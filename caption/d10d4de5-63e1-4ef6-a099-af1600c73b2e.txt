1
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:12,780
Okay. So now today we are going to start talking about what while the plan for today is first,

2
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:23,309
we're going to probably use this the first half of today's lecture to finish this av-test in the one example and then the latter half of the lecture,

3
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:29,360
we are going to have a review of some matrix algebra because starting from that,

4
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:38,009
starting from Thursday, we're are going to move on to multiple linear regression where we will I guess we don't have to, but it's a lot,

5
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:46,410
lot easier if we use matrix algebra measuring obviously expressed the right models is that

6
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:51,600
here we are writing everything basically the right way to do our speed at one x absolute.

7
00:00:52,020 --> 00:01:02,550
But when it comes to multiple covariates, multiple, you know, regression designation, matrix notation and matrix make things a lot easier.

8
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:07,500
But let's, let's first, let's finish, let's talk about this F test.

9
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:16,950
So F passed. It's a test of the overall phenomena of rationality and will later work will make this very clear.

10
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,139
But first let's have a review and refresh your memory.

11
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,670
What happens fusion is the F test heavily depends on out of this fusion.

12
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,810
So let's get a refresh memory what happens.

13
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:40,350
Goodness. So if we had to run the variables x1x2, we are as it gets one square x two square.

14
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:47,700
So both as we call chi square solution but with probably different d referendum.

15
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:52,560
And also if we assume they are these two are independent,

16
00:01:53,670 --> 00:02:06,340
then if we divide each one by their corresponding you are freedom and that if we look at the ratio of these two, that's how after solution is defined.

17
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:15,360
Then the ratio actually follows the so-called amplitude and position has two parameters and one is the you freedom

18
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:24,030
of the neutral interval in the numerator and the same word freedom is that one variable in the denominator.

19
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:31,770
So by definition the AB can only take part of you values because both top and bottom line chi square Russia.

20
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:39,600
There is no way on a positive values and for our distribution the connection is connected to a previous version.

21
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:45,330
So if we take the square of a T, you run the variable with your freedom, the F,

22
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:57,390
then the square t is a special F, this fusion in a sense that the first D word freedom is just equal to one.

23
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:03,000
The segment the freedom is equal, really worth freedom of Peters Fusion.

24
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:12,010
So this is how you can generate evidence fusion or how campus is connected through some decisions that we are familiar with.

25
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:16,080
So essentially all those institutions can be generated from normal.

26
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:22,389
For as long as we are normal, we can have the Fuze Building Cosmatos fusion event here.

27
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:29,730
Now we can have afterschool. So it turns out that not for how long this has been.

28
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:37,650
Well, previously we talk about using Keita's fusion using kid has to test because the novel is is that beta one is equal to zero.

29
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,000
To pass this novelist, it's been a lot easier to zero.

30
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:56,209
It turns out that we can use the use of test to test this as well, and which is as an equivalent test under a simple linear regulator.

31
00:03:56,210 --> 00:04:05,210
We're going to see that in pasties is actually it has the overall effect on the motor rather than a single bit of grandeur.

32
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:09,290
But if are for similar linear remuneration, I mean, these allow this to become the same.

33
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,770
So yeah, let's just focus on single linear regression for now.

34
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:21,419
So we are testing whether beta one is equal to zero or not. And previously we test this by carrying out of this by calculating this test.

35
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:28,010
The first which followed heated exclusion with a minus two or three right between the hosting is

36
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:35,720
calculated by dividing the estimate of beta one by its center editor or square root of the various,

37
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:40,010
and it follows tedious version with -24 freedom.

38
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:50,660
This is actually again here to make it an explicit this is under the not so older than I but this is this T following this T distribution.

39
00:04:54,260 --> 00:05:08,510
So that's that's t. Now, before we formally introduced the test, let's actually look at what the idea is behind that so-called impasse.

40
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:12,710
So after has answer to compare companies says to compare two models.

41
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,560
One model is the so-called or not model that's owned or not.

42
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:23,630
But this is so assuming by now that this is true. That is well, of course, novel that says that beta one is equal to zero.

43
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:34,820
So assuming this is true, that essentially we are looking at this model, the model that does not have X, does not have the covariate in the model.

44
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:39,080
So if we look at this model, we only have an intercept.

45
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:48,790
And that if you estimate the intercept using these two square as measure, then you will see that the estimate is actually the sample average.

46
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:53,230
We're simply using the sample average to estimate a beta beta zero, the intercept.

47
00:05:53,770 --> 00:06:00,550
And then we make a prediction where using simply the sample average to predict the the Y.

48
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:12,130
And for this model, if we calculate the so-called error sum of square or some squares of error, then this is the prediction.

49
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:15,640
We are. We are we are predicting the Y. I had a using y bar.

50
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:23,860
So if we take the difference in a some edge in the Y squared and take what's on, that's how the C is defined.

51
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:27,459
But this is the same as I even for the model on or not.

52
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:32,340
But this is and also this is actually equal as y, right?

53
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:38,650
So if we call the sum of square for Y, the total sum of squares, how that's defined is actually the total sum of squares.

54
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,610
So we actually measure those in one of the previous lectures.

55
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:47,049
So the total sum of squares can be viewed as a special type of error,

56
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:55,330
sum of squares in the sense that if you consider this particular model, then the total sum squares becomes the error somewhat squares.

57
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:59,690
For this particular model we are fitting of.

58
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:06,340
So this is the model under Nobelist. It's now under alternative hypothesis or beta.

59
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:14,560
One is not equal to zero. Then we are feeding this model where we do include this covariate in a model.

60
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,870
And in this case, of course, now we have the prediction.

61
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:27,860
So this is why I had after of course, after estimating beta zero beta while using the least squared method, we can predict why.

62
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:36,330
And then. But as I as I see now for this for the model under the alternative hypothesis

63
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:44,670
that the as I see is y I minus the predicted y and squared and taken the sun.

64
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:48,800
So this is not the as I see it previously.

65
00:07:50,670 --> 00:08:01,230
So the and test essentially to compare this to models to see which model is better to storage model is better because well because the the

66
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:08,880
novel this is indeed is is about this is about in the comparison between these two models as av-test as of to compare this to models.

67
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:16,800
The question is how do we actually use the sum of squares to construct a test, to test to compare this to models?

68
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:23,910
And that is the so-called F test statistic.

69
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:33,360
But before we do that, let's this is some just some facts that will be needed in order to introduce the F test.

70
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:44,680
So we are now we are trying to construct a statistic. By a statistic, we mean that it has to involve the unknown under or on one.

71
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,350
And also we have to figure out is sampling distribution.

72
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:53,890
But in order to control the House and figure out is sampling distribution and these facts are needed.

73
00:08:55,870 --> 00:09:01,270
So here we are not going to prove this these facts, but we are going to show this in future models.

74
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:11,200
One is that the total sum of the squares as as y divided by sigma square in photo chi square discussion with minus one before freedom.

75
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:17,139
So previously we we actually talking about the D working on this and minus one for the total sum of squares.

76
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:27,400
But we didn't talk about that. The distribution now about ss y divided by Sigma Square to follow Chi Square distribution and a similar to ss r.

77
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:35,230
This is a regression sum of square divided by sequence where a follow chi square with one d where freedom and

78
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:42,610
see the error sum of square divided by C must work and follow chi square with and one has to figure a figure.

79
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:51,280
So these three actually by properly standardizing what I mean by dividing, let's see my square.

80
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:59,170
All of these follow cut square distribution. And also it turns out that SSR and SSDI v are independent.

81
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:07,000
And now we are just taking these as facts, not worried about how exactly how many.

82
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:16,030
So and then using this facts now we are able to construct the so called F statistic.

83
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:29,330
Okay. So as we mentioned, under a lot of others, as we just mentioned, that these two, they are independent as as are and as I see are independent.

84
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:37,130
And then we know that SSR divided by CMA Square, it follows a Chi Square disclosure.

85
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:43,340
This guy followed Chi Square dissolution with. On this writing this guy.

86
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:51,380
Well Chi Square does fusion live right end of a bottom here this as a C divided by Sigma Square.

87
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:57,080
This S.C divided by Sigma Square that follows Chi Square with A-minus to do your freedom.

88
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:09,719
And also while these two are independent. So if we divide both by their corresponding the referendum,

89
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:16,240
that means dividing the top by one and dividing the bottom by risking our freedom among us.

90
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:29,400
Then if we take a look at the ratio, then by definition this ratio follows the F decision with your freedoms one end and minus two.

91
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,120
Right. That's that's just based on all the facts we have so far.

92
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:42,050
Okay. So that means that this guy follows and after this fusion.

93
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,840
Then, if you recall, well, of course,

94
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:57,470
the Sigma Square can cancel each other and you can cancel each other top and bottom in event ever canceling the Cinema Square.

95
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:01,130
Then the top essos are not divided by here.

96
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:05,000
We didn't make it explicit, but this is divided by one, right?

97
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:09,440
Divided by one. Then this guy SSR divided by one.

98
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:15,130
This is. MSR resolved by that?

99
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:20,850
Well, if you recall how I mean square for regression.

100
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:24,440
That's the SSR divided by the corresponding to our freedom.

101
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,720
And a similarity here. This SC divided by its old growth rate.

102
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,680
That's how we call my seed round me square.

103
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,270
I see. So that's why we have here.

104
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:49,720
So the f now if we define F to be m as are divided by and as C, which is just exactly the same as as you know,

105
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:53,120
as this whole thing here, it's kind of the same as this whole thing.

106
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:04,770
And then it follows this after fusion with one degree of a with one with the word freedom as one in ministry.

107
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:09,150
And this is how we define the so-called F statistic.

108
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:20,530
Okay. So any questions about this, like how this app is introduced, how best to fight?

109
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:32,359
Okay. So after having this ABS statistic, now before we look at a formula,

110
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:37,069
how to use this to carry out has let's take a look at the intuition behind this one.

111
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:50,240
This makes sense. So the f after the compares is the comparison in a comparison to SSR versus SC, but of course standardized.

112
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:54,680
So each one standardized were normalized by their corresponding D were freedom.

113
00:13:54,980 --> 00:14:05,240
So SSR divided by one and as has divided amount of soup but essentially in that pass estimate as he compares these to compare this.

114
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,190
And now let's just imagine some extreme case.

115
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,370
So let's imagine this is where, you know,

116
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:23,389
the model is so good result that this is the underlying true relationship between why that X is indeed like a nearly perfect linear regression model.

117
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:26,480
I mean, a perfect like nearly perfect linear, right?

118
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:34,810
So in that case, of course, the sum of squares of the regression should be very large compared to error is almost split

119
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:40,320
because there is no marginal error because that linear regression model is is correct.

120
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:46,520
So it's the noisy version. Also, there is there's no no error or very little error.

121
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:51,180
So the first term compared to the second term is very large. None of these.

122
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,310
Well, when we take and take a look at this racial,

123
00:14:55,730 --> 00:15:02,720
which is the ratio between the standardized SSR and centralized, as I see, this ratio should be fairly large.

124
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:07,910
So they are the worst if you have a really good linear regression model,

125
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:20,060
if the correlation between one X is indeed linear, then this fs letters to should be fairly large and workable.

126
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:25,790
But this is also the case where you know well well x is indeed linear.

127
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:31,160
That to me as beta one is not equal to zero. Rather radical of it in from x is not equal to zero.

128
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:38,840
So in other words, when beta one is not equal to zero, this f statistic its value should be fairly large.

129
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:48,180
On the other hand, if beta one is indeed equal to zero, that me is of.

130
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:56,800
But this is if indeed it is equal to zero, then that means the regression model really doesn't explain.

131
00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:04,010
Should at least play much for the variation. Why? Because. Because there is no association between the next result.

132
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:06,560
Another graduate student explained much of the variation.

133
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:16,640
So the variation in Y should mainly actually be left in this error term as as the sum of squares errors.

134
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:24,470
So errors almost squares. So in that case, then if you compare the SSR, SSR should be fair to small compared to SS.

135
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:31,670
And then of course if you calculate F statistic that M so this is should be fair to small.

136
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:37,910
Yeah, absolute should be fair to small if beta one is indeed equal to zero.

137
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:47,209
So this is actually the our test is based on this, this observation, so on or not, but this is what beta one is.

138
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:53,960
It is zero absolutely fair to small, but if beta one is not equal to zero, then the f should be fairly large.

139
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:59,900
So then we should reject of analysis. We should reject beta what you go do zero.

140
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:11,000
If we observe, if our data has after calculation f we get a fair large f spread very large about over F, that's when we should reject analysis.

141
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:18,590
So this is actually a lot of intuition behind the F test or F statistic,

142
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:25,910
but then the of the thing that we need to decide is when is F value large enough?

143
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:32,779
We say that always large enough will reach out a lot. We should look at that liabilities, but then what we need to do.

144
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:40,810
So that is when after we see a half value, how do you decide whether it's already larger cost will have an effect is.

145
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:50,730
Any questions about the situation behind the past?

146
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,830
Okay? Yeah.

147
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:00,530
Just like what? What is really here?

148
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:09,170
So we tested this null hypothesis by compute an F and A, then assessing how risible it is to think of a value of at least as extreme as F.

149
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:20,450
So in other words, we are just trying to make us assume that the weather f value that at the value of acidosis disease large enough or not,

150
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:27,680
is large or not large. And based on that, we will decide who will make the decision whether to reject or not react.

151
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:37,950
Okay. And this then this is the formal procedure for carrying out a test.

152
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:44,340
So first we compute to the test statistic, the value of F statistic for every lead.

153
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:51,360
Of course, we are able to calculate this. And well, we actually we do not need to manually complete this.

154
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:58,110
I mean, for the software, we will after this value, for this service and then we can calculate the p value.

155
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:08,790
So this is how the P value is defined. So the f whatever is speaking f this religion has such shame.

156
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:17,760
The PDM has such a shape. This is let's say this is F one and M.A. through work.

157
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:26,540
Work. And then let's say we observe the f value over here, right?

158
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:35,930
We observe F value over here from our data. And then the P-value is actually the probability that under not well this is assuming

159
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:39,440
that not all of this is true assuming there is no association between Y and X,

160
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:47,110
the probability of observing the probability match law to the right of this event.

161
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:54,100
Right? So that's not the probability so that this is done, the p value, this location, this is not the p value locality.

162
00:19:55,040 --> 00:20:03,319
So the idea is the p value is the probability that on this is we observe with the

163
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:08,990
probability of observing the f value we observe or even more extreme matters.

164
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:15,050
The morning screen values are the values to the right of this f larger values of very large values.

165
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:24,889
Those are actually values. So we calculate what are the probabilities of observing what we have observed, which is this F or even more extreme values?

166
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:34,090
We cannot do that, probably. So in an event that is called optional, this p can see here this is actually the so-called if you notice.

167
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:44,360
And even this P-value is very small. Let's say we compared it to .05 is very small.

168
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:55,250
That means well under the hypothesis is very likely is very likely to observe.

169
00:20:55,620 --> 00:21:00,480
You know what we have observed because it's very unlikely to observe, you know,

170
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:06,140
this f or even it for that, because the probabilities is smaller than it is very small.

171
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:15,260
And that that means the data as it provides evidence against this not but this is because if we are assuming that is true,

172
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:18,950
then it's very unlikely to observe what you have observed.

173
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:30,320
Right. So then that means we should reach out to not have losses. But if the P-value is large is not small unless a larger than .05 number that means

174
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:36,620
is not so unlikely to observe this while this actual F value will be observed.

175
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:41,650
So that means the data does not provide strong evidence against analysis.

176
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:52,489
So again, these are not reject. So the p value here is a is a summary of our data summarizing all the evidence in the

177
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:58,190
data and how likely it is to observe on arrival as everything is under liabilities,

178
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:04,740
so on or not. Ulnar, this is how likely it is to observe this actual value.

179
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:12,649
F We have observed or even more with values is unlikely that we will reject a novel, as this is not an unlikely event.

180
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:16,810
We will not reach our allowances. Okay.

181
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:20,110
So that's how we get out of our past.

182
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:34,950
So every test is two sided. So in other words, is testing the novel disease versus the alternative that beta one is not able to do.

183
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:43,270
So it's testing this two sided position and the STEM distribution itself is one.

184
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:51,260
So if you look at as shown in the plot here. This administration has.

185
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:53,350
It's not like t's not like normal.

186
00:22:53,360 --> 00:23:07,270
So in forever this vision the extreme out of our now those on the right hand of and here while the p value method and reduction region matter apply.

187
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:12,830
So we just talk about the P value method, right. And whether we calculate the P value.

188
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,890
So that is the values, this method here.

189
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:26,360
So what about the rejection region method regarding for the reader method, we need to construct the rejection region, the rejection region.

190
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,660
Now, if we want to keep that, let's say Alpha, we take less than we take Alpha able to pull those.

191
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:41,060
Right. And that's the common practice. We take the alpha equal to portable five, then the rejection region, that rejection.

192
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:50,200
The reduction region. Recall that a reactor reader contains all the extreme matters.

193
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,570
So if the F are extreme, then we will reject.

194
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,169
So in this case, that's what we construct a recharge region.

195
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:04,810
We need to find all that. We need to put all the extreme values into this region.

196
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:14,640
Region. Now, the extreme values are right here. So the values of the right so in this case that the radiation region are from above.

197
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:18,709
F That's what they were freedom and minus two. D were freedom.

198
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:24,550
Freedom. The 95% power of f this fusion.

199
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:30,110
Up to infinity, and that's the retention region.

200
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:46,190
So what it means is that now after you calculate your F statistic, your F statistic, you can look at whether that F falls inside this region.

201
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:58,610
So now if I call this R, then if F for inside R, then we reject.

202
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:07,520
We reject. And what happened was this. Because if ah, but if our fault is at this region, we consider it half to be extremely.

203
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:18,140
But if F does not fall into this ah, into this region, then we fail to react.

204
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:34,520
Problem is this. So that's the retraction revision method both of you at a later introductory remarks are they are

205
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:44,090
based on the the consideration that no one EF is large that we consider out to the extreme and event.

206
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:50,480
But but then the thing is just how large to decide the values and certainly not.

207
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:57,430
Okay. That's the test.

208
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:08,000
And it questions so far. Okay.

209
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:14,330
And then. Well, now for casting beta one. For passing the liabilities.

210
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:23,630
For the same liabilities we are testing again this analysis for testing the same novelties is now introduced to test.

211
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:29,300
We talk about two than one is to pass. The one is enhanced. So how are these test related?

212
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:34,810
It turns out that for simple linear regression, these two are equivalent.

213
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:41,690
They are exactly the same. The recall. At a later level, when we talk about mathematical linear regression, we are going to see the difference.

214
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:45,040
But for similar linear regression, they are equivalent.

215
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:58,880
But again, that while I would emphasize this is simply a regression here equivalent, I recall that a team has it actually constrained by.

216
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:13,500
Essentially it's a one had it divided by the center area, right along the center area where the matter is can be estimated by this guy.

217
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:22,920
So if all the tedious T distribution and the F statistic and follow evidence fusion.

218
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:30,830
And if you recall that the F in this case because the here we have what they were afraid of.

219
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:37,820
So the F that is the distribution is actually equal to the square of a key distribution.

220
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:49,370
And it turns out that indeed, in this case, the yes, the mistake is equal to it's just equal to the square of that key statistic.

221
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:53,450
We are not going to show this, but what a f.

222
00:27:53,450 --> 00:28:02,090
It turns out that somehow we we're going to show that it is indeed a squirrel t which makes this test.

223
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:05,930
They are exactly the same because one is just a square of the other.

224
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:11,600
So whites, sorry, not exactly the same. There are equivalent, but not exactly the same.

225
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:15,660
And I feel that as we talk about what difference. But but.

226
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:23,300
But they are. Yeah, but are there an equivalent in a sense that one is just the square of the.

227
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:37,030
So the other words, if you use T to pass all of this, this novel is like perhaps this novel is an event when tea falls into the reaction region.

228
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:48,100
Recall that about tea for for tea news fusion that's two sided this is what a tedious wilderness.

229
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:54,429
Among us to evoke freedom of effort is religion.

230
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:58,390
As we just mentioned that the F actually is pdaf looks like this.

231
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:12,170
This is F. So when we passed this, I say this versus alternative, like two sided alternative.

232
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:19,130
In this case, the extreme values for kids fusion. They are the foothills.

233
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:25,940
They're in the foothills. Right. Let's go to the lab and tell it from the left here in the Red Hill.

234
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:37,630
These are extreme values for tedious fusion. But for Al Jazeera, as we mentioned, that you see now, those are the values on the right here.

235
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:42,550
This is kind of easy to understand because F is a square of teeth.

236
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:48,400
So we look at the square, of course, the extreme values of like the left heel of t.

237
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:51,480
If you're square, it becomes very positive numbers.

238
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:59,280
So then, of course, that that he actually got dropped into this region for r f so.

239
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:07,390
But here on the plot, the T test, the reaction region when we pass this two sided alternative that we used,

240
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:13,480
it has this this h zero versus this particular H one bit.

241
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:21,390
We are not able to zero. Then the related region are the foothills of Sparta for M for F cast.

242
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:29,100
The regression region is actually on the right here because mathematically the square of the T distribution.

243
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:44,230
Okay. So that's the. The connection between T and F.

244
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:53,010
Oh. So yeah.

245
00:30:53,030 --> 00:31:01,540
So here is the difference between this two test. This is so we see that like here if when we pass this Tuesday here,

246
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:07,190
when we pass this two sided hypothesis that to means alternative is speed of one not

247
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:12,890
equal to zero two sided then the reference not as vision of the F and T square.

248
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:20,870
They are equivalent. They're just as we mention, because the when we square it, that's what else volatility becomes.

249
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:24,560
That also becomes very positive value for after solution.

250
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:29,870
So for testing the two sided hypothesis they haven't they are exactly the same.

251
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:33,350
They are equivalent. Well, the differences is one.

252
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:43,190
We test this one sided alternative. Now if we test this one sided alternative now it turns out that what our test cannot be used

253
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:50,299
to test this one sided alternative because F is because after squaring the truth fusion.

254
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:53,930
Now the F actually look at both both ends of distance fusion.

255
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:58,250
So F past only applies.

256
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:05,270
So maybe I'll make it in more explicit f test of test applies.

257
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:10,610
Two two sided.

258
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:20,310
Test is two sided test. That is this test for society.

259
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,750
So that's when our pass applies.

260
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:32,350
But if you want to pass a one sided alternative, I've been a lot longer than equal to zero.

261
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:41,650
Then we will need to rely of test. It has can be can be more flexible in testing once I.

262
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:46,120
In this case now for this alternative hypothesis.

263
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:51,550
Again. This is to right this tedious fusion with us to be awkward.

264
00:32:55,400 --> 00:33:00,559
Not because of the particular specification of this novel.

265
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:12,830
This is versus this alternative. The extreme values are the very positive values, because the hypothesis says that either beta one is equal to zero,

266
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:17,090
or if it's not equal to zero, it has to be poverty.

267
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:26,030
Beta one does not take an active value, so is because of the way that the two specified in this case.

268
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:32,389
Now the extreme values are the very positive values because what we only when we

269
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:38,060
get a very positive values that we have strong evidence against the novel is.

270
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:45,370
And so in this case, the atrium. Now those are the metropolitan battles and so on.

271
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:53,380
So then the for example, the rejection region, that's going to be the value to the right of psychology.

272
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:59,860
Okay. And this is here. So this is this.

273
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:17,970
So the of region in this case then. Is this is this region.

274
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:27,000
So we region will have a this is when the t value when it has the statistical value fall inside of the region.

275
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:38,810
Region, which means it's larger than this. So again, this redacted region is is determined by this attorney, by the for attorney,

276
00:34:39,890 --> 00:34:47,990
because the alternative because the alternative says that if Baker was not able to zero better, what must be a positive number.

277
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:56,060
And so then when we observe very large positive value for veto, then we should reject the reliably only when we react,

278
00:34:56,330 --> 00:35:01,850
only when we observe better, large values of better world, we should reject the populists.

279
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:07,760
So that's why the in this case, the rejection region is only by the right a tale of intelligence fusion.

280
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:12,410
Now, again, we want to keep the alpha equal to four or five.

281
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:17,690
Then here we should look at 95% out of the two distribution.

282
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:30,019
And this is the difference between F and G. So T is more flexible in the sense that you can test a one sided alternative.

283
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:34,040
But an impasse always applies to a two sided alternate.

284
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:46,610
Okay. Any questions? Okay.

285
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:53,930
So the f the first thing is actually related to the the AR recall that we introduced to the AR.

286
00:35:54,290 --> 00:36:05,330
So those deep wrestle AR is essentially that it represents the the percentage of the variation in in Y that that is explained by the regression model.

287
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:09,410
It turns out the F is a function of R squared.

288
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:14,780
You guys can. Wow, this is very simple algebra, but we were all made of that.

289
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:21,980
But it is it's very easy to based on the definition F and based on the definition of R squared, it's very easy to show this.

290
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,780
But there is the point is that there is a connection between F and R squared.

291
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:33,590
So of course, if you look at this, if you look at this function of our square, this is a increasing function.

292
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:41,880
This is. Increasing function of our square.

293
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:51,820
This is an increasing function of our square. So what it means then is that if our square is larger, m should also be larger.

294
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:56,710
Of course I'm apologizing for corresponding to our freedom, but let's forget about that for a minute.

295
00:36:56,950 --> 00:37:03,729
So if our square is larger than F should also be in our union, which makes sense because our square is larger.

296
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:07,750
It means that there is higher proportion, even in total variation.

297
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:12,940
Why that can be explained by a regression model. So that means your model is good.

298
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:19,770
So large r square means your resh model is good because of a large model is playing a large proportion of variation.

299
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:28,440
One. Now of course, when our square is large where model is good, only the F statistic should also be large.

300
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:39,360
If you recall the statistic that compares the sample square of the Russian colossal square, you know that your regression model is good.

301
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:43,610
F should also be large. So let's make intuitive sense.

302
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:50,050
Here. But this busy fashion shows us how men's marriage these two are.

303
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:56,360
And it. But there is no test directly based on this R squared.

304
00:37:56,730 --> 00:38:04,290
So what we carried out has some tests either based on key issues, based on tested positive for the F statistic.

305
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:15,270
Okay. And then let's take a look at one example.

306
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:19,800
This is a fairly simple example. It's similar to example one.

307
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,640
Well, here we have our outputs.

308
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:33,610
But we are not going to go into details like that with our coat, but we are going to take a look at an algorithm.

309
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:42,790
So this is a study to evaluate the relationship between the birth weight and astral levels.

310
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:47,650
Okay. So this astral level, this is our why.

311
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:57,310
And first way is our X. And we have data from 31 mother to be and there are newborn.

312
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:05,410
So sample size a 31 and we want to fit a linear regression model to study the association between astral level and the birth rate.

313
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:16,150
And here this list your lives just just reads data into our control of an event.

314
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:30,340
While we can use different functions and different functions to output here, just to give you some descriptive statistics about our two variables.

315
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:41,680
So we have estriol, we have birth weight, and of course a lot less than December 31.

316
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:48,450
And we have the mean we have a certain division, we have a median, you know, we have different different studies.

317
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:55,930
We've calculated using this particular our function in this this are packaged using this

318
00:39:55,930 --> 00:40:01,870
describe function so you can get all this different studies to disprove a statistical inverse.

319
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:11,769
There are other functions that do the same job and this this table just getting that these groups it is C0 it is the very first

320
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:20,550
step we take to do then allows for this gives insight how the data are disputing what they look like and then let's fit a model.

321
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:25,570
Right. So here this is the symbol linear regression model of theta.

322
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:29,950
So oh sorry.

323
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:35,380
So yes, I switch this MC So this is.

324
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:47,670
This is our way and this is our acts as shown here in this in this New York moment.

325
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:51,310
And this. This is our way. So this is the of plate. This is the acts.

326
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:55,010
He's a pastoral role model.

327
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:02,530
Okay. So if we see to that model, then we have the residuals.

328
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:09,010
So after feeding the model, we're going to have although the residuals are called residuals, are these these are the absent eyes.

329
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:25,280
And these are the apostles. And this here for the visual is the gives you the minimum the first courthouse immediate circle now and a announcement

330
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:31,920
of all these different residuals in total you have you have 31 residuals because you have 31 subjects in this.

331
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:38,670
And then the next table is God coalition table. So these this are super important table.

332
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:43,270
So here we have intercept intercept. This is beta, right?

333
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:48,990
This is Brazil. And also this is beta one and estimated value.

334
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:55,320
And then this is actually the beta zero hat and this is actually beta one ahead.

335
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:59,399
And these are the estimated values and the center error.

336
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:03,000
This is the center error, standard error for faith and zero hat.

337
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:13,150
And this is necessary for one. And then we have the tea van.

338
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:21,460
These are the test t statistic. This is the key statistic for testing.

339
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:31,410
Beta zero equals zero. I'm versus beta zero, not even zero.

340
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:40,800
So this is the testing, the two sided task for the intercept and the value of the t statistic.

341
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:46,400
And this guy here. This is the key for.

342
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:57,000
Forecasting beta one even to zero versus beta one not inclusive.

343
00:42:57,810 --> 00:43:00,960
The best testing for the slope for beta one.

344
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:06,030
And these are the values of the corresponding key statistic.

345
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:16,610
And then we have the p value. These are the problems was p value p value for four that hazard.

346
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:22,630
And this is the p value for. If you're not up for it.

347
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:31,640
Testing, but it's not. So these are what these each number represents.

348
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:38,960
And A based on this p values, we can see that both p values are very, very small and very, very small, which means that.

349
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:46,210
Because zero is significantly different from zero and a beta was different from zero.

350
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:51,340
And so we were in readout of both anomalies by looking at this P values.

351
00:43:55,220 --> 00:44:00,350
And then it's and then we have this residual center error.

352
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:08,959
I mean, this this is a call sample found. We I mean, we didn't talk about it, but we definitely saw this this statistic.

353
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,350
But it's just 100 before name in this is our average.

354
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:19,480
So this number here is actually the square root of as as.

355
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:28,750
Square with them as I see and we know about as I see some square.

356
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:48,040
I think this. And this thing is probably messy.

357
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:54,700
Okay. So in under a while with 2090 more freedom, this is minus to break in a of our freedom.

358
00:44:54,700 --> 00:45:00,360
We know that Morsi has the gantlet and so it is 31 would be more freedom.

359
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:07,420
This is 29 and this is ours with this volunteer here this is last year.

360
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:21,290
So our square is all of three seven, which means that 37% of the variation in what can be explained by this 17 year election law.

361
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:30,490
And this this actually is pretty good. So you will see that in practice, this 37% can be explained by a similar intervention.

362
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:37,390
Large amount of this is really good. That's really good model. Typical of fair amount, simply a rational model.

363
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:42,580
And that our square is much zero. It is more than not smaller than this.

364
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:49,630
And this adjusted our square. Well we will explain what this addresses are square meters.

365
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:58,210
When we talk about model in your regression model. So basically it's is this our square address it by its more freedom by the degree of freedom of.

366
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:00,909
Because I mean there is none for nonlinear regression model.

367
00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:06,970
The degree of freedom is going to depend on the number of covariance, including the model.

368
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:11,560
So in our square needs to be adjusted, but we are going to talk about the later.

369
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:17,240
And then we have the FS that stick. This is the f.

370
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:22,099
F that. Okay. So it has one.

371
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:29,540
The more freedom and 2090 more freedom. So it follows this f description with one end 29, the more freedom.

372
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:36,000
And then while we can use the F statistic for testing.

373
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:50,900
For testing the slope by the slope is equal to zero or not.

374
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:55,990
And then if you look at the p value, this is the corresponding period.

375
00:46:57,070 --> 00:47:03,130
If you look at this view that you'll see that it's exactly the same as this p value regime.

376
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:18,710
Exactly the same. Okay. This answer to confirm this is one example confirming that the AMP has indeed passed the equivalent when passing this on.

377
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:24,890
This is not a license to assign analysis to the two sided hypothesis.

378
00:47:26,030 --> 00:47:29,660
And also this this F statistic.

379
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:37,130
This is as an equal truth. This is equal to P squared.

380
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:42,800
Equal. True. T in this case is 4.1 for three.

381
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:48,140
That's a calculator here. This is. This is our piece that has.

382
00:47:51,770 --> 00:47:58,190
Right. And then the f is just a square of them t and there isn't a that.

383
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:10,610
So these are what each number mean in this output by an arbitrary fitness regime.

384
00:48:13,370 --> 00:48:16,370
Any questions about these numbers?

385
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:24,780
This results. Okay.

386
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:29,589
And then we would take a seven minute break. Who will probably come back?

387
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:36,593
And what can you do? This is the last time the grand jury.

388
00:48:43,019 --> 00:48:50,939
Okay. Now, then. Well, the next few slides, it's just I asked you to do some kind of calculation of the for estimates.

389
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:55,229
I mean, all of the parameters are shown in the table. However, as estimates are the given.

390
00:48:55,499 --> 00:49:01,139
But outputs are outputs. If you drag the fit senior rationale rational.

391
00:49:01,349 --> 00:49:07,469
So if you say us using this function to fit your rationale, you will get all these outputs automatically.

392
00:49:07,859 --> 00:49:15,869
But of course, these values, this has to be calculated by using the formulas we talk about for a similar linear rider,

393
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:19,078
which is the rules and problem of Capital Zero,

394
00:49:19,079 --> 00:49:25,809
how we can limit our one and then the next few slides just shows that you can indeed do that and you will get the same,

395
00:49:25,989 --> 00:49:34,709
same number as the output from that table. If you guys are interested, you can answer it yourself, but let's skip those.

396
00:49:35,129 --> 00:49:39,179
Let's then jump into this ANOVA table.

397
00:49:40,039 --> 00:49:45,689
Nice. So ANOVA and this actually gives the F, so it has to give the value of the P value.

398
00:49:46,439 --> 00:49:55,319
So for ANOVA now here we have of course, we have to do our freedom now first let's maybe start from here.

399
00:49:55,329 --> 00:50:01,279
So for example, square this column, this guy here, this is the S.

400
00:50:01,299 --> 00:50:08,249
S are the regression sample squared. And this guy here is the ask to see what is the error in sum of squared.

401
00:50:10,449 --> 00:50:17,259
And of course, then this one has one bigger freedom and this one has M minus to the more freedom, which is 29.

402
00:50:18,589 --> 00:50:22,369
And then the mean square list. This guy's s.

403
00:50:22,369 --> 00:50:26,839
S are divided by its own d more freedom, which is equal to one.

404
00:50:27,739 --> 00:50:37,579
And this guy here is the AC, which is equal to SC, divided by its own divorce rate.

405
00:50:37,859 --> 00:50:49,309
That's minus two. And then the F value, well, by definition at F value is calculated on this exchange of.

406
00:50:49,319 --> 00:50:55,969
And so he's counting that as the ratio and as R and and as.

407
00:51:01,159 --> 00:51:05,809
And then we have the p value. Now again, if you value listeners for testing.

408
00:51:16,619 --> 00:51:21,289
Never has been a one equal to zero versus been at one not.

409
00:51:21,299 --> 00:51:32,949
Not equal to zero. Not even. So this is how the anomaly table is configured.

410
00:51:34,239 --> 00:51:46,569
What what each number represents. And that if you look at this battle over here, this MSI, this 14.601 loss number was amazing.

411
00:51:46,989 --> 00:51:50,409
I just did a very quick calculation using art.

412
00:51:50,409 --> 00:51:56,939
There you can see that I counted the square root of this and I see it's 3.82.

413
00:51:57,549 --> 00:52:00,729
That is indeed the number we saw here.

414
00:52:02,229 --> 00:52:15,489
This 3.80 to this number for this number is actually the square root of the is just 100 different name in the problem.

415
00:52:15,499 --> 00:52:19,459
It's called a residuals generator. But anyway, it's the square root.

416
00:52:25,999 --> 00:52:31,669
Okay. So this is the ANOVA table four. And then again, if you look at it with P value here,

417
00:52:32,119 --> 00:52:41,969
that's exactly the same as the P value shown here from this absolute and also looking at it from at this.

418
00:52:42,589 --> 00:52:45,859
So we are exactly the same the same number.

419
00:52:54,849 --> 00:53:02,729
Okay. And questions. Okay.

420
00:53:02,729 --> 00:53:07,349
Then, then of course, while the next few slides just and again while you can, Daniel, you can,

421
00:53:07,829 --> 00:53:13,599
you can do some handicapped job ambassadors in cars of people using the formula we talked about.

422
00:53:13,619 --> 00:53:17,229
Right. So you can you can double check that you'll get exactly the same number.

423
00:53:18,329 --> 00:53:27,199
So we will skip that low and then the same number table.

424
00:53:27,539 --> 00:53:32,068
Now this. Now let's take a look at this to this.

425
00:53:32,069 --> 00:53:37,289
Two questions. What question is to estimate the marginal variance of birth weight?

426
00:53:37,559 --> 00:53:43,859
Recall that the birth weight and these are why so many is a reasonable estimate of why.

427
00:53:45,509 --> 00:53:50,759
You call that the margin of error as a Y by definition of of errors that should

428
00:53:50,759 --> 00:53:58,529
be equal to the estimate should be equal to sc y divided by n minus one.

429
00:53:59,739 --> 00:54:05,679
And that's how the margin of error is, how a sample virus is defined as is.

430
00:54:11,799 --> 00:54:16,509
This. So this is the heart of the matter is of why?

431
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:23,979
Now, what about the. The conditional bearers of what? Conditional X.

432
00:54:26,579 --> 00:54:32,069
Computer science. Can you call that a conditional x, a y given x?

433
00:54:35,399 --> 00:54:46,489
Because of our regression model says that. This is our regression model.

434
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:52,339
So can you like Skip announced the virus of what is simply the variance of absolute.

435
00:54:53,589 --> 00:54:58,929
That's as to see my sweater. Right. So. So we are looking at the estimate of sigma squared.

436
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:04,649
We're estimating we're looking at the same squares.

437
00:55:04,929 --> 00:55:11,469
And this is actually the vehicle that we use MSE two to estimate CMA squared.

438
00:55:12,279 --> 00:55:18,999
And this is the sub error sum of squares divided by the G for freedom and minus two.

439
00:55:25,199 --> 00:55:31,299
Okay. So this why the the two and there is is are different.

440
00:55:31,539 --> 00:55:35,709
I mean here if you look at the marginal variance kind of the commission matters

441
00:55:35,709 --> 00:55:41,109
there there are different if you cover their values that are different. The difference comes from the fact that.

442
00:55:41,709 --> 00:55:48,428
Now suppose these are. You know, this is why.

443
00:55:48,429 --> 00:55:52,089
Equal to beat a zero plus beat on one hand. Absolutely.

444
00:55:52,419 --> 00:56:00,579
And this is the line. And suppose that, you know, while we observe the data points, the data points centered around, you know, this line.

445
00:56:06,929 --> 00:56:09,059
Now the margin of error is of Y.

446
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:19,849
If you look at the margin of error is a Y, the margin of error is is actually looking at it ignore well, this is why this is x ignore.

447
00:56:19,869 --> 00:56:25,439
The X is just look at the different values of y like the smallest y.

448
00:56:25,859 --> 00:56:30,779
Well, maybe somewhere here and learn as to why. Maybe somewhere somewhere here.

449
00:56:31,919 --> 00:56:38,519
And then you just look out of the y, although d for a y values and calculated the very best the so-called margin of error in some way.

450
00:56:38,909 --> 00:56:42,699
Just look at a variation in white and largely ignore x.

451
00:56:42,719 --> 00:56:45,309
Just look at how how much variation there is.

452
00:56:45,339 --> 00:56:54,089
Partly why that's the margin of error is on what the condition of variance on y is differ because conditional whereas let's let's

453
00:56:54,149 --> 00:57:01,828
conditional any let's say condition on this particular x equal to small action a conditional this x conditional on this x.

454
00:57:01,829 --> 00:57:06,209
The variation in y is maybe just from here to here.

455
00:57:06,209 --> 00:57:08,449
That's actually the same as square if you can.

456
00:57:08,459 --> 00:57:16,889
There's no that's a different values if you're conditional another X over here if you look at the variation in Y again,

457
00:57:16,889 --> 00:57:23,279
then the variation is actually quantified by the variance of C, C, the absolute.

458
00:57:23,909 --> 00:57:30,129
So that's sigma squared. So if you conditional X, if you look at a any fixed x and then look at it there,

459
00:57:30,149 --> 00:57:41,229
there is a Y that would be areas of y exactly the same as the variance of doesn't matter whether your axes and which acts are loosening up.

460
00:57:41,799 --> 00:57:48,389
And so that's that's why we see the difference between the marginal boundaries of what kind of a conditional on one the margin of error.

461
00:57:48,389 --> 00:58:00,238
And as you ignore that X you just look at the total range from of Y and look at how much variation there is or what a conditional there is a y,

462
00:58:00,239 --> 00:58:05,639
you you fix X, you look at a conclusion on that and you go to x.

463
00:58:05,639 --> 00:58:08,819
How much variation you have for that y.

464
00:58:10,799 --> 00:58:14,789
Okay. So this is this is a difference between the marginal areas and a condition of interest.

465
00:58:15,629 --> 00:58:25,969
And then we will I to look at, you know, does birthweight depend on astro level?

466
00:58:25,989 --> 00:58:29,939
So does why the amount of X we want to carry out a T test?

467
00:58:31,949 --> 00:58:37,619
And so, you know, there has to be whether beta one is equal to zero or not.

468
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:49,559
We are looking at a weather beaten one is equal to zero or not.

469
00:58:50,579 --> 00:59:01,079
And the key statistic. You call that a t is equal to beta one divided by the square root of.

470
00:59:05,069 --> 00:59:12,959
One hat. And we can find that value from our output.

471
00:59:14,339 --> 00:59:20,819
And so insight is given here. But also if you want to go back to the original output table.

472
00:59:23,409 --> 00:59:29,109
The key nano is verbena, one that's given by this 4.1 for three.

473
00:59:31,319 --> 00:59:37,589
Kew Gardens. 4.143 and P-value is given by this .000271.

474
00:59:38,849 --> 01:00:01,659
So. So this is the key statistic and that the p value is equal to, you know, the T distribution with minus to the your freedom,

475
01:00:02,619 --> 01:00:08,559
which is 29, you are four larger than this observer achieved right under limits.

476
01:00:11,309 --> 01:00:14,759
That's actually part of 000271.

477
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:20,629
That's given by back to our output tables.

478
01:00:26,009 --> 01:00:39,899
What this means is that here if we look at this T news fusion, this T 29 year freedom and our observed value is over, here is 4.2143.

479
01:00:40,049 --> 01:00:49,679
And this is our observed. Sorry.

480
01:00:52,119 --> 01:01:00,459
Here. I show you some of them here. Okay, so let me finish this explanation, then I will come back.

481
01:01:00,729 --> 01:01:04,329
So here, this is our observer team. 4.1, four, three.

482
01:01:05,769 --> 01:01:10,269
And then what we call a P value recall, that p value is the probability that honorable.

483
01:01:10,269 --> 01:01:17,349
This is we observe. Now, what we have observed were even more extreme matter in this case, because this is a two sided test.

484
01:01:17,619 --> 01:01:28,089
We are testing a two sided hypothesis so that you see value is either to the right of this team or to the left of 90.

485
01:01:30,709 --> 01:01:33,409
We're to the left. Left of note.

486
01:01:35,249 --> 01:01:42,809
So that's how we calculate about the p value should be either the probability to the left tail or the probability that to the right tail.

487
01:01:43,469 --> 01:01:51,959
And that's why I put an absolute value here, so that the absolute value of this piece larger than what is observed.

488
01:01:55,809 --> 01:02:00,019
And this P-value is .0271.

489
01:02:01,419 --> 01:02:06,399
And this is of course much smaller than .05 if we take Alpha able to quantify.

490
01:02:08,329 --> 01:02:14,369
And this means we will reject. We reject novelists.

491
01:02:17,089 --> 01:02:21,939
Right. So what do we mean by rejection probabilities?

492
01:02:21,969 --> 01:02:29,079
It means that. It means that while beta one is.

493
01:02:42,579 --> 01:02:45,819
It means that beta one is significantly different from zero.

494
01:02:47,919 --> 01:02:54,729
Sea level is different. It means the data actually provides significant evidence showing that beta one is not equal to zero.

495
01:02:54,909 --> 01:02:58,419
There is an association between what next?

496
01:02:59,739 --> 01:03:08,019
So this is what we mean by redaction, not because it's or in terms of the this particular scientific question.

497
01:03:08,379 --> 01:03:15,999
That is there is a significant.

498
01:03:47,119 --> 01:04:02,579
And. There is a significant association, linear association between Y and next, between the birth weight and astral.

499
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:11,669
So, I mean, if you want to interpret this further, you could actually go back to the to the table.

500
01:04:12,179 --> 01:04:20,419
And here we see that of the estimated value of beta 1.602.

501
01:04:20,429 --> 01:04:30,029
Right. So what this means is that since all average on average, so for every one unit increase in S0 level,

502
01:04:31,289 --> 01:04:42,179
you see an average of 1608 to increase in unit increase in Y, which is birthweight by whatever unit birthweight case.

503
01:04:42,869 --> 01:04:49,379
I think that birthweight is measured in grams divided by 100.

504
01:04:49,709 --> 01:05:02,039
So so that's how much more than forever unit increase in astral level and birthweight is going to increase by 0.6 AU into unit on average.

505
01:05:02,849 --> 01:05:08,819
That's that's not usual to interpret but give a more quantitative interpretation.

506
01:05:11,999 --> 01:05:21,779
Okay. So that's how to use that. You'd have to test this association between between these this to right mix.

507
01:05:22,109 --> 01:05:31,019
Any questions about this? Okay.

508
01:05:31,379 --> 01:05:37,049
And then let's take a look at how we use AV test to determine if there is an association.

509
01:05:38,339 --> 01:05:52,609
So for our test, we are casting the same. Work has been the same.

510
01:05:53,069 --> 01:06:12,339
I've always. In the recall, the absolute hosting that's calculated as the ratio of MSR and AC that's given from the ANOVA table.

511
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:21,159
Right now, if we go back to the ANOVA table, the alphabet of these given and this.

512
01:06:33,059 --> 01:06:47,849
And the P-value is equal to the probability that f this version with one in 2019 girlfriend a larger than this F under novelist's.

513
01:06:50,359 --> 01:06:53,419
And that is point O'Toole seven one.

514
01:06:53,839 --> 01:07:02,029
Again, this same problem. And this is one less than one in five.

515
01:07:02,029 --> 01:07:09,079
So we reject the diagnosis. And in this case.

516
01:07:12,039 --> 01:07:15,969
Okay. So this is the, you know, the afters fusion, right?

517
01:07:15,999 --> 01:07:19,269
So suppose well here this f value.

518
01:07:24,019 --> 01:07:28,769
Is somewhere here in this. This is where the F value is.

519
01:07:29,319 --> 01:07:35,069
And then when we cover the P value, the p value is actually the probability to the right of the about.

520
01:07:40,079 --> 01:07:44,559
And in this case, the probably to the left of this value is a tiny number.

521
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:50,789
So that is this this man who is on a very large, very large.

522
01:07:50,789 --> 01:07:54,179
So it's very unlikely to observe Islamic fundamentalists.

523
01:07:55,349 --> 01:08:04,799
And that's why we reject lawlessness. So this this volunteer.

524
01:08:04,839 --> 01:08:17,259
That's not. So we reach the same conclusion using the app test.

525
01:08:25,509 --> 01:08:33,219
Okay. And then the next question is what percentage of the variation is explained by Astral?

526
01:08:33,579 --> 01:08:38,109
And this is very similar. And this is just to look at our square in our square.

527
01:08:38,859 --> 01:08:44,659
So our square in this case is equal to that.

528
01:08:45,009 --> 01:08:50,199
We can always go back to the our output here.

529
01:08:50,199 --> 01:08:54,639
So the our square is given by 23718.

530
01:09:05,109 --> 01:09:17,939
13718. So which means that what is presented on these 37.18% of the variation in the birthweight

531
01:09:18,209 --> 01:09:24,028
in wider can be explained by astral AB by a similar linear regression model.

532
01:09:24,029 --> 01:09:39,269
We didn't. Okay.

533
01:09:39,599 --> 01:09:41,488
So that's this example.

534
01:09:41,489 --> 01:09:52,769
I mean that the slice that ah we skipped in the middle, these are just some articles showing how to calculate this numbers by hand using the form,

535
01:09:52,889 --> 01:09:57,989
for example, for our square and our square, as we mentioned, password is default in this way.

536
01:09:58,909 --> 01:10:06,719
And then of course then you can cover the square manually by hand if you plot everything into this folder.

537
01:10:06,959 --> 01:10:11,319
Or you could directly get our square problem, you know, after the field.

538
01:10:11,339 --> 01:10:16,609
Although using the summary function to get to the object to get a summary statistic from R and A,

539
01:10:16,619 --> 01:10:21,418
you'll get the same R squared so the slides will skip in the middle.

540
01:10:21,419 --> 01:10:28,949
They just contain some articles showing how to get different methods that has different values for different statistics.

541
01:10:32,669 --> 01:10:37,229
Yeah. So yeah, that's I think that yeah, that's this example.

542
01:10:37,229 --> 01:10:43,199
So any questions about this exam or about General about if she passed or passed?

543
01:10:51,049 --> 01:10:54,949
Okay. Then, if there is no question, then we are going to.

544
01:11:01,419 --> 01:11:27,659
Look at the next module. Society.

545
01:11:28,339 --> 01:11:32,869
What do these men ever review? Matrix Algebra Review.

546
01:11:33,139 --> 01:11:45,369
So. So as we mentioned, the FAA is we're going to move out of multiple linear regression and for multiple linear regression.

547
01:11:45,379 --> 01:11:53,149
Well, it's we will have to because we don't have to wait.

548
01:11:53,499 --> 01:11:58,489
But it's it's does make sense to choose to still use the explicit expression.

549
01:11:58,969 --> 01:12:05,719
So it's a lot easier, a lot easier to use the matrix notation to express multibillionaire, graduate and do the calculation.

550
01:12:06,309 --> 01:12:11,809
And so that's that's why I'm for we starting from next lecture.

551
01:12:11,929 --> 01:12:14,959
So when we talk about what we start with, talk about modern linear regression,

552
01:12:14,959 --> 01:12:25,369
we going switch from matrix notation to to express the models and to do all the revisions to talk about different properties, things like that.

553
01:12:26,029 --> 01:12:34,939
So here, this model is a very quick matrix out of a review and depending on all your familiarity with matrix algebra,

554
01:12:35,449 --> 01:12:45,919
this is a hopefully I mean, hopefully this is not not too much of a review.

555
01:12:46,349 --> 01:12:55,819
So yeah, so here I think the review we are going to go over this review very quickly.

556
01:12:55,829 --> 01:13:03,619
We are not going to spend too much time. We're going to use whatever time that is left for, for this lecture for you to take a look at it.

557
01:13:04,009 --> 01:13:11,089
Basically here we're just listening to some facts of the matrix out here that it will be used in future lectures.

558
01:13:13,359 --> 01:13:24,929
So let's very quickly go over this. So of course when we talk about Matrix, we need to talk about the badgers and midges.

559
01:13:25,229 --> 01:13:29,458
So the pattern here throughout this course and also not only this course,

560
01:13:29,459 --> 01:13:34,379
but generally speaking, the way we talk about Badger, we mean a column badger.

561
01:13:37,029 --> 01:13:44,109
So by default, we call them back. So it's a it's a we stack a bunch of numbers on top of each other.

562
01:13:44,319 --> 01:13:48,219
So this is what a vector means, is it's a column vector.

563
01:13:48,819 --> 01:13:54,159
And what matrix means is that A we know it's a two dimensional array of numbers.

564
01:13:54,519 --> 01:14:03,299
So we have you can consider this a stack of different rules on top of each other or different columns right next to each other.

565
01:14:03,429 --> 01:14:10,689
So, so, but anyways, we have an array of two divided by array of numbers that's called a matrix.

566
01:14:10,989 --> 01:14:16,869
And then you have a number of rows and number of columns are by C matrix.

567
01:14:18,849 --> 01:14:27,249
And a scalar is just a one by one matrix or a one by one factor is just 111 dimensional thing.

568
01:14:28,029 --> 01:14:36,039
And a square matrix is the matrix where the number of rules and number of columns that are equal, equal number of rules and columns,

569
01:14:36,039 --> 01:14:43,539
the square matrix, a diagonal matrix, that means only the well, first of all, is a square matrix assignable.

570
01:14:44,439 --> 01:14:48,669
Only the diagonal elements are possible. It it all the other ones.

571
01:14:48,939 --> 01:14:54,039
All of these are zeros. That's what biometrics means.

572
01:14:55,119 --> 01:15:06,429
And either the matrix, well, if it's a square diagonal matrix, where all of the elements are lies and all the other elements are reals.

573
01:15:08,299 --> 01:15:12,079
So this is an adult matrix.

574
01:15:12,589 --> 01:15:23,269
So for us, that is a matrix that anything modified by another matrix still equal to the original matrix or for being obviously the matrix.

575
01:15:24,289 --> 01:15:30,089
If you're left to multiply or write and multiply by another matrix, you will still getting back.

576
01:15:30,699 --> 01:15:38,539
It doesn't change anything. Now some special measures.

577
01:15:39,229 --> 01:15:48,019
So we have the so-called armor triangle images. That's the case where here this is diagonal elements in this dialog.

578
01:15:48,289 --> 01:15:53,809
So all the elements below the bottom are zooms.

579
01:15:53,929 --> 01:16:00,049
This is what we call a sort of upper triangular matrix and a similar that we can.

580
01:16:00,049 --> 01:16:08,179
We have the lower triangular matrix that is above everything, above the diagonal.

581
01:16:08,299 --> 01:16:12,919
This, this, this elements here. These elements are zeros.

582
01:16:13,219 --> 01:16:20,329
This is what we call the lower triangular matrix. And then we have the same actually the matrix.

583
01:16:20,739 --> 01:16:28,539
The magic matrix means that the field is equal to AGI.

584
01:16:28,579 --> 01:16:35,759
So the other was, you know, the elements. We are we are symmetric.

585
01:16:35,939 --> 01:16:40,739
So if you look at these elements, here they are. They are the same.

586
01:16:41,099 --> 01:16:47,159
They are exactly the same. So this is what we call the symmetric matrix.

587
01:16:49,789 --> 01:16:54,499
So this person might. Well, you know, later. How about transport?

588
01:16:54,649 --> 01:16:58,139
Right. So it's a matter of which means that A is equal to a Hezbollah.

589
01:16:58,279 --> 01:17:04,159
So if you switch that, then rows and columns and you will get the exact same metrics back.

590
01:17:08,049 --> 01:17:14,859
Of course, any diagonal matrix is symmetric because diagonal matrix or the of the continents are zeros.

591
01:17:15,519 --> 01:17:25,809
Of course it's symmetric. And then we have a so-called zero matrix.

592
01:17:26,319 --> 01:17:33,739
That means what? All the elements are zeros. This is the zero matrix and we have the one factor.

593
01:17:33,759 --> 01:17:42,509
So if all the elements are once again, this is not one, one and one matrix, all of the elements are ones.

594
01:17:43,519 --> 01:17:49,689
This one matrix is a some special, which is this.

595
01:17:50,409 --> 01:17:57,069
And then we have the transpose. So the transpose on matrix, you just switch the rules into columns.

596
01:17:57,579 --> 01:18:04,089
Oh, this is a result. These are different rules of matrix.

597
01:18:04,749 --> 01:18:07,969
And then the transpose. You are just making the rules become the columns.

598
01:18:08,149 --> 01:18:15,819
So you have different and different columns and this become the second column on that third.

599
01:18:16,389 --> 01:18:27,489
The third column this, this, this is why not matrix transpose is that if a is equal to a transpose that asymmetric.

600
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:40,039
The Matrix addition. So you have two litters is A and B while they are in the same division.

601
01:18:40,049 --> 01:18:45,169
Of course, when we talk about a matrix which will make sure that this is how to use the same dimension.

602
01:18:45,949 --> 01:18:53,609
So once they're in the same dimension, then if we look at A, Class B is just adding otherwise sound.

603
01:18:53,959 --> 01:19:03,889
So we have the first with some of the first elements of A, then B and similarly we have the sun.

604
01:19:04,309 --> 01:19:08,149
So basically it's just a sun, just one element of wise sun, right?

605
01:19:08,419 --> 01:19:12,319
So that's how much this addition is carried out.

606
01:19:16,909 --> 01:19:20,929
And then we have the so-called vector inner product.

607
01:19:22,399 --> 01:19:30,529
So we have well, the inner product of inner product is as if for two actors of the same dimension.

608
01:19:30,769 --> 01:19:34,189
So we've got A and B and C dimension.

609
01:19:34,669 --> 01:19:39,439
Then we look at a transpose has been it will give us as a skin.

610
01:19:40,609 --> 01:19:45,759
So a transpose become a rule vector and B is a column.

611
01:19:46,879 --> 01:19:51,319
So if you multiply those two, we'll get a screen.

612
01:19:51,559 --> 01:19:57,409
So the scalar is calculated as the sum of the element, a wise product,

613
01:19:57,739 --> 01:20:07,609
and so a one plus B one times A to a one times B one plus a, two times B two plus a, three times B three.

614
01:20:08,029 --> 01:20:12,079
And that's what a vector in our product is.

615
01:20:17,809 --> 01:20:22,399
And then matrix product. Okay, so mission is product.

616
01:20:23,509 --> 01:20:32,389
So let's say well here we have see you go to end times V well to in order for matrix proton to make sense for A and B,

617
01:20:32,959 --> 01:20:46,789
the the number of rules in a needs to be equal to the number of columns in B, otherwise the product is not cannot be calculated.

618
01:20:48,559 --> 01:20:57,979
So the for the ideas element of the C matrix, the ideas element is actually equal to the inner product of eyes rule.

619
01:20:57,979 --> 01:21:09,499
You just find I throw from a and the is column from B and you carry out of a product that gives you that element the CAGR of the matrix C.

620
01:21:10,659 --> 01:21:18,549
There's a sequel to see Iggy Pop and then.

621
01:21:20,179 --> 01:21:23,869
C. C. I.

622
01:21:23,879 --> 01:21:28,209
J. Is equal to essentially a. I. Hence.

623
01:21:34,539 --> 01:21:46,029
In Times speak there is the either column of Matrix St and PJ is the James column of Matrix V.

624
01:21:46,719 --> 01:21:56,429
So if you count the funeral, right? Useless as CIJ.

625
01:21:59,359 --> 01:22:05,479
So again, this is only defined with a number of columns in an yes.

626
01:22:05,929 --> 01:22:13,919
Number of columns equal to the number of rules in beat. Yet again.

627
01:22:14,429 --> 01:22:16,679
Well, Matrix is multiplied by our screen.

628
01:22:21,659 --> 01:22:34,739
Well it matrix a like scalar that's a C times a matrix A is just equal to you C times A1 one seed has a one, two and so forth.

629
01:22:35,579 --> 01:22:38,729
And the C times a.

630
01:22:41,849 --> 01:22:44,969
One can use.

631
01:22:50,599 --> 01:22:56,299
This is less a car seat. So article are rules and see comments.

632
01:22:56,779 --> 01:23:03,319
So it's just alimony wise. All right. So that's a modification by a scooter.

633
01:23:04,729 --> 01:23:12,229
And then we have the so-called matrix in our paradigm. That's a transposed times eight and alternate product that's eight times a transpose.

634
01:23:14,959 --> 01:23:24,139
And also we have the concept of the crease. The crease is simply the sum of the elements along the main diagonal.

635
01:23:24,949 --> 01:23:30,859
So if you have a a matrix, for example, if I say.

636
01:23:32,269 --> 01:23:35,549
Catch. Let's just use this as an example.

637
01:23:35,699 --> 01:23:44,119
So if this is this matrix, then the twist is just the sum of this elements on the video.

638
01:23:44,589 --> 01:24:02,739
And that's how a trace is defined. And then we have the use of some rules of military operation.

639
01:24:03,999 --> 01:24:15,099
So a lot, you know, a philosophy is equal to B plus A, times de la school, times a matrix, a single to times that they should have the scalar.

640
01:24:16,599 --> 01:24:23,199
And the disputed law says that if you left, multiply, if the matrix is left and multiply by 80,

641
01:24:23,439 --> 01:24:28,179
the sum is left multiplied by now you can do still a do this,

642
01:24:28,359 --> 01:24:40,629
each of this each matrix in the sun so it is equal to eight times v plus eight and see is the same if you write it modified by some matrix right.

643
01:24:40,689 --> 01:24:52,598
So is equal to B times de plus C type state. Yeah, but here well one thing is that any time speed is not an equal speed.

644
01:24:52,599 --> 01:24:55,989
I'm saying. So these are this is a very simple fact.

645
01:24:56,319 --> 01:25:02,019
So because the dimension of the product may not exist, there is no.

646
01:25:03,789 --> 01:25:10,539
So this is the difference between a matrix multiplication and a scalar multiplication.

647
01:25:10,539 --> 01:25:21,219
Right. So there's. So eight times V is not a U.S. and but but for the law here now for the for the

648
01:25:21,219 --> 01:25:29,049
product you can easily combine the adjacent matrix when you calculate the product.

649
01:25:29,079 --> 01:25:35,649
So for example, if you first multiply energy and then last time I see is the same as if A first

650
01:25:35,649 --> 01:25:42,399
month high B and a C and then multiplied by this will give you the same result.

651
01:25:44,849 --> 01:25:51,149
And if we take matrix transports now, the transport of the sun is equal to the sum of the prisoners,

652
01:25:51,659 --> 01:25:56,919
by the way, calculated of a transport or product that is actually equal to.

653
01:25:56,939 --> 01:26:02,969
Now, you need to reverse the order of this part so it becomes b transpose times, transpose transports.

654
01:26:04,859 --> 01:26:11,039
This is not something you need to prepare for. Similarly, if you have the part on A, B and C.

655
01:26:11,579 --> 01:26:22,889
We encounter the principle. It becomes C, transpose some speed transport times A transpose to reverse the order of the part we apply of transpose.

656
01:26:25,229 --> 01:26:29,669
Okay. So those are some very basic concepts of the matrix algebra.

657
01:26:29,699 --> 01:26:34,349
Now another thing important is the so-called linear dependance.

658
01:26:35,069 --> 01:26:43,319
So for a vector we see that they are linear, independent, linear, independent.

659
01:26:43,829 --> 01:26:53,819
If there exist constant, non-zero, constant, there exists some non-zero constant such that some linear combination is equal to zero.

660
01:26:56,469 --> 01:27:03,309
So if this equation one hosts only when all the seats are equal to zero.

661
01:27:05,319 --> 01:27:12,669
So in other words, if you want one, if this equation holds only when all the c k are equal to zero,

662
01:27:13,089 --> 01:27:22,799
then you say that this x, this this vector x can be seen on bleeding earnings independent by linear and independent.

663
01:27:22,809 --> 01:27:31,599
What we mean is that none of these factors here, no this factor here can be expressed as linear combination of the others.

664
01:27:32,109 --> 01:27:42,029
And that's what we mean by linear environment. Yeah, we could.

665
01:27:42,539 --> 01:27:50,639
Yeah. Later we're going to have one example of our linear events and then we have the rank of Bellatrix.

666
01:27:51,329 --> 01:27:59,279
So the rank of a matrix equal to the number of linearly independent columns or linear number of button rows.

667
01:27:59,279 --> 01:28:03,839
I mean, these two numbers have to be equal. This is a fact of the rec function.

668
01:28:04,679 --> 01:28:09,619
So the rabbit is the number of linearly divided in columns or a linear resource.

669
01:28:11,069 --> 01:28:21,689
End of the rule. Rank in a column rank. They are equal for a matrix and also for if a matrix is are by C dimensional.

670
01:28:22,309 --> 01:28:31,818
And then the rank actually is is has to be smaller than or equal to the minimum of these two number roles.

671
01:28:31,819 --> 01:28:35,789
In number of columns, it cannot exceed either one.

672
01:28:38,879 --> 01:28:39,239
Okay.

673
01:28:39,839 --> 01:28:54,149
And then if A is are by C matrix and if the rug indeed is equal to the smaller one of these two are MSE, we see that a is a full rank is a full rank.

674
01:28:54,419 --> 01:28:59,459
Otherwise if the rank is strictly smaller, then then both numbers.

675
01:28:59,729 --> 01:29:05,449
Now we see that a is rank division or is not a forearm, not a full rank or recognition.

676
01:29:07,859 --> 01:29:13,918
So that's the rank of a matrix. Take a look at some example.

677
01:29:13,919 --> 01:29:19,289
Let's say this matrix over here and this matrix, you say it has round two.

678
01:29:19,319 --> 01:29:23,999
The reason is that if you look out of the three columns, the three columns,

679
01:29:24,239 --> 01:29:30,779
we see that the last column expresses a linear combination of the first two columns.

680
01:29:31,679 --> 01:29:38,519
We are we take this here is one times this and so we take of the C to be two and a one.

681
01:29:38,969 --> 01:29:43,979
We can use class last column as linear combination on the first column, first two columns.

682
01:29:44,669 --> 01:29:48,719
So this means that all three columns, they are not linear.

683
01:29:48,719 --> 01:29:56,878
The element in the rank is equal to because because that if you look after the first two columns, the first two columns, they are linear.

684
01:29:56,879 --> 01:30:01,799
Even one is not cannot be expressed as linear combination of the other.

685
01:30:02,459 --> 01:30:07,949
So in this case, the random matrix is equal to two.

686
01:30:10,439 --> 01:30:16,679
So of course, here I mean, well, here we expressed the last column as linear combination of the first two columns.

687
01:30:17,549 --> 01:30:22,259
Of course, you could express the first column as linear combination of the last two,

688
01:30:22,589 --> 01:30:26,219
where the middle column has the, you know, combination of the first and third column.

689
01:30:26,219 --> 01:30:31,759
So. That's that's not a unique.

690
01:30:32,029 --> 01:30:41,689
But what what is unique is that you know about this three columns but one can be expressed as a linear combination of the other.

691
01:30:42,099 --> 01:30:47,449
So that the rank of this matrix is equal to and A for this matrix.

692
01:30:47,449 --> 01:30:54,858
B while the right is equal to one. Because if you look at the three columns, for example, now the the second,

693
01:30:54,859 --> 01:31:01,339
the column is the first column multiplied by three and the last column is the first column multiplied by five.

694
01:31:02,179 --> 01:31:11,239
So all so again, these two columns can be expressed as the first column, but by a non-zero constant.

695
01:31:11,869 --> 01:31:22,489
So that's why here the red is just equal to one and a four rank.

696
01:31:22,579 --> 01:31:28,339
As we mentioned, the rank has to be smaller than or equal to the minimum of this true pharmacy.

697
01:31:30,469 --> 01:31:34,819
And and also if we multiply, if you look at the product,

698
01:31:35,839 --> 01:31:43,269
the RAGO part on a matrix where do multiplication matrix multiplication the rank remember

699
01:31:43,279 --> 01:31:51,369
the right never increase the rank of actually what becomes the minimum of this is correct.

700
01:31:51,979 --> 01:32:01,219
So the smaller the right of the product is going to be smaller, smaller than or equal to the minimum of this thorax.

701
01:32:04,309 --> 01:32:08,089
And another thing is that multiply by a full rank matrix never reduce rank.

702
01:32:13,859 --> 01:32:17,939
Okay. So then another concept is the determinant.

703
01:32:18,179 --> 01:32:26,909
So the determinant we use, you know, we put a list to bars around AIDS to denial of eternal war.

704
01:32:27,149 --> 01:32:34,828
We use this to develop a determinant of X that will determine if it can be calculated using this expression.

705
01:32:34,829 --> 01:32:43,649
So determinant of a measured speed can be calculated by calculating the determinant of lower dimension matrices.

706
01:32:43,829 --> 01:32:52,738
So but but let's let's not worry too much about this because we we will never maybe if we're talking about whole matrix,

707
01:32:52,739 --> 01:32:57,809
we should know how the problem determinant like for this two by two matrix determinant is

708
01:32:57,809 --> 01:33:07,079
just the product of this diagonal elements minus the product of this true added elements.

709
01:33:07,709 --> 01:33:18,719
So that's the determinant of two by two matrix. But a for higher dimensional x three by three or four by four, we don't need to have really two to.

710
01:33:19,859 --> 01:33:24,439
But we will see will never rely on this this way for us.

711
01:33:24,449 --> 01:33:33,739
I mean, we will always use software to combat determinants. So there is no way that we are going to do it by hand or not going into the matrix.

712
01:33:34,859 --> 01:33:40,258
But if we're to add to its add to the community to remember this part of the formula

713
01:33:40,259 --> 01:33:45,479
for determinant because it's very easy and it's very handy for 2012 matrix.

714
01:33:48,849 --> 01:33:54,519
Okay. And then for determining if it is for RAC, then determine is not equal to zero.

715
01:33:54,879 --> 01:33:59,499
So but if it is not for RAC, then determined is equal to zero.

716
01:34:00,169 --> 01:34:07,059
And if a train of traveler, the determinant is simply the product of the diagonal element.

717
01:34:08,879 --> 01:34:12,899
This is another special case where the determinant can be very easy to calculate.

718
01:34:13,379 --> 01:34:19,439
That's when the matrix is triangular. The term is simply about a product of only three elements.

719
01:34:24,159 --> 01:34:27,789
And then we have the concept of matrix inverse.

720
01:34:29,019 --> 01:34:37,758
So if A is a full rank and of course it needs to be a square matrix, even if it's a square matrix is a foreign.

721
01:34:37,759 --> 01:34:45,779
And then we can define the enormous inverse set assigned a multiplied by a inverse or a response.

722
01:34:45,989 --> 01:35:00,219
And that gives us the identity matrix. And if a is not of Iraq is rather deficient, then a singular we call a singular matrix.

723
01:35:00,579 --> 01:35:09,249
Then inverse of hey does not exist. But we call that while there are generalized inverse defined by the inverse of matrix is similar.

724
01:35:09,249 --> 01:35:15,429
Matrix does not exist, not for another singular matrix is a unique inverse.

725
01:35:15,429 --> 01:35:20,589
Exist the inverse. If it exists, then then the inverse is unique.

726
01:35:23,499 --> 01:35:31,689
Now for matrix inverse, it is helpful to actually to remember, you know,

727
01:35:31,719 --> 01:35:42,878
the matrix inverse for a two by two matrix because again, this may become handy if all are similar,

728
01:35:42,879 --> 01:35:51,449
so is one divided by the determinations and then multiply by here we just switch the order of the diagonal hurricanes and then we,

729
01:35:52,049 --> 01:35:56,069
we just put a negative sign for the, of the elements.

730
01:35:56,379 --> 01:36:03,889
So using the inverse of the battle matrix of Kelvin, but if for higher dimensional measures,

731
01:36:03,969 --> 01:36:10,268
I mean we for us we just, we will just rely on software to counter the inverse.

732
01:36:10,269 --> 01:36:14,069
We don't need to worry too much about the inverse. Let me see if I can.

733
01:36:19,019 --> 01:36:23,619
Okay. So for inverse then we have certain rules.

734
01:36:23,829 --> 01:36:30,658
So the inverse of inverse is just equal to the original matrix and the inverse of a screen.

735
01:36:30,659 --> 01:36:35,099
Or perhaps matrix is just a reciprocal of the scalar times.

736
01:36:35,099 --> 01:36:40,379
The inverse of the matrix and the inverse of cosmos is equal to the.

737
01:36:41,549 --> 01:36:44,729
The transpose of the inverse. And.

738
01:36:46,159 --> 01:36:50,449
And similar to the transpose when we calculated the inverse of the paradox of the matrix.

739
01:36:50,819 --> 01:36:55,159
Now we need to reverse the order eight times be the inverse of eight times.

740
01:36:55,159 --> 01:37:00,059
The is equal to the inverse of peak times the inverse of a.

741
01:37:01,119 --> 01:37:11,179
So. She? And also we have some special witnesses.

742
01:37:11,449 --> 01:37:16,639
One is the so-called automotive matrix. So A is said to be a component.

743
01:37:16,639 --> 01:37:27,019
If a square is equal to eight and if it is I, the pole of the art minus eight is also this is very easy to control.

744
01:37:27,769 --> 01:37:31,879
And then a special matrix is called a production matrix.

745
01:37:32,119 --> 01:37:42,438
A production matrix. If P square is equal to P, which means it is either potent and P transpose is equal to eight.

746
01:37:42,439 --> 01:37:47,269
So this is our P transpose, even if you which means PS symmetric.

747
01:37:47,809 --> 01:37:53,239
So it's PS symmetric component then and PS production matrix.

748
01:37:53,569 --> 01:37:57,639
So if P is fragile matrix and a lot of PS also irrationalities.

749
01:37:59,479 --> 01:38:04,669
And also we have the orthogonal matrix. So P sets to be orthogonal if P square.

750
01:38:05,359 --> 01:38:10,489
Few times p transpose equal to either the matrix and the P transport time is equal.

751
01:38:11,869 --> 01:38:16,758
So these three collisions. They are. They are. One of them is redundant.

752
01:38:16,759 --> 01:38:19,879
So any any. And two of them in five.

753
01:38:19,899 --> 01:38:24,278
Then the third one. Okay.

754
01:38:24,279 --> 01:38:31,268
So I think we are at home so we won't have time to go through all the all the polls and all the facts.

755
01:38:31,269 --> 01:38:43,209
But what is left is, you know, some of the council and Metro Security and defense leaders and also the London Ambulance Service.

756
01:38:45,849 --> 01:38:50,289
So there are probably seven or eight slides left.

757
01:38:50,649 --> 01:38:57,249
So you guys can go over the slides. You get a refresh memory he doesn't want to talk about starting from Thursday.

758
01:38:57,299 --> 01:39:05,489
When we talk about Michael, we know that you have a lot of insects, no water.

759
01:39:05,769 --> 01:39:07,839
Okay. So this is down black rule start.
