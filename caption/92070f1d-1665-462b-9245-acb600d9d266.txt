1
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,420
In this module, I'll
be describing to

2
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:12,260
you some occupational
health outcomes,

3
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:13,540
but before we do that.

4
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:14,770
I want to ask you,

5
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:15,820
what do you think are some of

6
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,230
the most dangerous industries

7
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:18,800
that we have in this country?

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,770
Things might pop into
your mind based on

9
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,605
your favorite television show
on loggers or fishermen.

10
00:00:23,605 --> 00:00:25,210
That's not inaccurate
but it turns

11
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:27,295
out there's a lot
more to it than that.

12
00:00:27,295 --> 00:00:29,920
We'll explore this
in this module.

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,815
I want to begin by
noting the burden

14
00:00:32,815 --> 00:00:34,930
of occupational injuries
and illnesses you

15
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,270
may initially think
appropriately that

16
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,805
it's the worker that
bears the only burden,

17
00:00:39,805 --> 00:00:43,345
but in fact, it turns out
that it's not the case.

18
00:00:43,345 --> 00:00:45,260
Workers do bear a huge burden but

19
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,690
employers and communities and

20
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:50,570
workers' families and society all

21
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,250
bear the burden of
occupational injuries

22
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,145
and illnesses as well.

23
00:00:54,145 --> 00:00:56,215
So if we zoom in on the worker,

24
00:00:56,215 --> 00:00:58,190
absolutely they have the
most direct impacts.

25
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:59,300
They may be disabled.

26
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,530
They have an economic loss.

27
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:02,645
There living and
working with pain.

28
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:04,790
They're unable to contribute
to community life.

29
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:06,280
They have a loss
of opportunities,

30
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,590
the huge impacts but the
community is affected as well.

31
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,120
There's also community level

32
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,270
economic losses and strain
introduced by injuries and

33
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:16,880
illnesses and of course
the workers family

34
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,550
is also going to
experience economic loss.

35
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:21,875
Potentially depression, anxiety,

36
00:01:21,875 --> 00:01:25,270
and impacts on familial
relationships.

37
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:27,170
Looking at the employer,

38
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,640
of course they have direct costs.

39
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,650
They're responsible for
the injury and illness,

40
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,360
so they have direct medical costs

41
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,730
for addressing that outcome.

42
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:37,370
They may also have
rehabilitation expenses,

43
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,540
and pension, and wage,

44
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:41,060
replacement, but there's
also indirect costs.

45
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,290
For every injured workers,

46
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:44,975
someone new has to be
hired to do that same job.

47
00:01:44,975 --> 00:01:47,230
That's going to have an
impact on production.

48
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:49,220
Finally, at the society level,

49
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,300
we have things like workers

50
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,980
compensation costs that are

51
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,915
borne through medical insurance.

52
00:01:53,915 --> 00:01:55,160
It may be that the cost of

53
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,840
injuries and illnesses
are actually passed

54
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,095
along directly to consumers
through increased prices.

55
00:02:00,095 --> 00:02:02,360
There's going to be
impacts on productivity,

56
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,830
loss of human capital,

57
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:07,190
potential instability in
these systems designed

58
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,540
to provide us with

59
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,910
the products we need and
the services we use.

60
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:14,390
So you can see there's a much
broader impacts than just

61
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,830
on the workers who themselves

62
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:18,475
suffer injuries and illnesses.

63
00:02:18,475 --> 00:02:21,750
Let's look at the US in 2017.

64
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,530
That year, there were
about 160 million workers

65
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:26,420
in the United States in January,

66
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:29,695
out of a total population
of about 327 million.

67
00:02:29,695 --> 00:02:31,640
Now, the Bureau of
Labor Statistics

68
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,810
is responsible for keeping

69
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:34,490
official counts of injuries and

70
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:36,405
illness the US and that year,

71
00:02:36,405 --> 00:02:41,495
they counted exactly 5,147
dead workers from injuries.

72
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,250
They didn't provide
any estimates on

73
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,380
the number of fatal
illnesses in the workplace

74
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:49,340
but they estimated at a
170,000 nonfatal illnesses,

75
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,980
and a total of just
under three million

76
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:55,210
non-fatal workplace
injuries and illnesses.

77
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,120
Unfortunately, with
occupational health,

78
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,750
we know under-reporting
is a huge issue.

79
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,490
So this is a scenario or

80
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:03,830
a circumstance where
workers don't report when

81
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,490
they're ill or injured

82
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,100
and there are various
reasons that they do

83
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:10,460
that but we do know that this
is absolutely a phenomenon.

84
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,080
Now, that year, if we

85
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,615
apply estimates accounting
for under reporting.

86
00:03:14,615 --> 00:03:15,710
Actually, our number of

87
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,960
estimated fatal injuries
does not change.

88
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,250
One of the things, we do well is

89
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,620
counting dead workers,
unfortunately.

90
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,820
But when we account
for under-reporting,

91
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,160
we think there's
something like 53,000

92
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,820
fatal illnesses in the
workplace that year,

93
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:29,960
and almost half a

94
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,900
million non-fatal
occupational illnesses,

95
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:36,170
and a grand total of nine
million nonfatal injuries,

96
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,720
and illnesses about three
times the number that was

97
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,540
reported officially by the
Bureau of Labor statistics.

98
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,760
So again, we have
a huge burden on

99
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,020
the country on our
workforce as well.

100
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,980
In this graphic, we're looking at

101
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,720
fatal work injuries in the US

102
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,840
per year between 2003 and 2017.

103
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,640
So you can see the
number of workers that

104
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,280
died on the job from
injuries each year.

105
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,825
You'll also see in blue,

106
00:03:59,825 --> 00:04:02,660
these are bars
representing the fraction

107
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,600
of workers who are
employees and in orange,

108
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,130
those are the fraction
of dead workers

109
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,220
who are self employed,

110
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:11,030
and so you can see the
numbers are relatively stable

111
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:14,000
around 5,000 workers
killed each year,

112
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,279
and that the fraction
of employees

113
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:18,560
to self-employed is
also relatively stable.

114
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,770
It's something between
20 and 25 percent.

115
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:24,240
One question that I
posed to you earlier;

116
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,860
what's the most
dangerous industry?

117
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,020
Well, actually how we frame

118
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,060
that question
dictates the answer.

119
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,670
We can talk about
an injury rate for

120
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,470
fatal injuries or
we could talk about

121
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:36,140
the absolute number
of people who died.

122
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,390
So on the left side
of the graphic

123
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,580
you're looking at here,
these orange bars.

124
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,340
We're looking at
the total number of

125
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:46,815
fatal work injuries by
major industry sector.

126
00:04:46,815 --> 00:04:49,805
Here, you can see the construction
industry in the lead.

127
00:04:49,805 --> 00:04:52,980
In 2017, 971 workers dead,

128
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,350
followed by transportation
and warehousing,

129
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,760
that may be unexpected,

130
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,835
followed by agriculture,
forestry, fishing, and hunting.

131
00:04:59,835 --> 00:05:01,460
On the right-hand side,

132
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,800
we're looking at the
fatal work injury rate

133
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,005
per 100,000 workers.

134
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:07,880
The pattern is different here.

135
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,850
Here Agriculture, forestry,
fishing, and hunting,

136
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:13,490
is far and away the most
dangerous in terms of

137
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:15,770
fatal injury rate followed

138
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:17,630
by transportation
and warehousing,

139
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:21,050
followed by mining, quarrying,
and gas extraction.

140
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,285
So again, whether we look at

141
00:05:23,285 --> 00:05:24,650
the absolute number of people

142
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,330
killed or the rate of injuries,

143
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:28,610
is going to dictate
which industry is most

144
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:31,130
dangerous but what should
be evident here is,

145
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,930
your risk of fatal
injury is very much

146
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:35,690
dependent on the
type of work you do.

147
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:38,180
We can look at other
factors that lead to

148
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,310
fatal injuries including age.

149
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,960
So in this graphic,
we've got a bunch of

150
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,360
different age groups
including all workers.

151
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,830
That's the dashed line you see

152
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,930
here and something
that probably pops out

153
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:51,680
immediately is the age
group 64 years and over has

154
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,060
a much higher rate of

155
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:56,180
fatal work injuries
than younger workers.

156
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,580
So there's a
vulnerable population.

157
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,230
Your risk of death on the job

158
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,000
also depends on where you work.

159
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,910
So here's a national map and
you can see the number of

160
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:08,990
workers who died in each
state in the US in 2017,

161
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,730
and the colors on
the map indicate

162
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:13,100
the change compared to 2016.

163
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,130
So if we zoom in on
Michigan, in 2017,

164
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:18,110
we had a 153 workers die

165
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,270
but you'll see our status
blue indicating there

166
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:25,390
were fewer workers died
in 2017 compared to 2016.

167
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:27,050
Now, I'd encourage
you to focus in on

168
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,850
your home state but
I also realized

169
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,125
that the pattern very much

170
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,630
depends on the state
that you live in,

171
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,550
in terms of the trend compared to

172
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:38,965
2016 and also the absolute
number of workers who died.

173
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:42,290
So fatal injuries are
catastrophic and terrible

174
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:45,140
but they're far outnumbered
by nonfatal injuries.

175
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,015
So let's talk about
those for a minute.

176
00:06:47,015 --> 00:06:48,950
When we talk about
nonfatal injuries,

177
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,150
we have to consider that not

178
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,890
every injury is created equal.

179
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:53,750
Some are more severe than others.

180
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,685
So if we look at this graph here,

181
00:06:55,685 --> 00:06:57,950
between 2003 and 2017,

182
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,005
we have a number of
different trend lines.

183
00:07:00,005 --> 00:07:02,480
The one at the top is
total recordable cases.

184
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,070
These are cases that
were serious enough

185
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:06,110
that they had to get
reported to the government.

186
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:07,460
You can see the line there has

187
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,470
a pretty steady
decline over time.

188
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,270
That's great news, but if we go

189
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,250
into the sub categories
and these are

190
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,110
different severities
that might require

191
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:17,060
someone being away from work.

192
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,100
They can't work at all or perhaps

193
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,410
being restricted and having
to do a different type of

194
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,390
job until they heal and we can

195
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,760
see that the trends there
are much more flat.

196
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,100
So while the total
rate is coming down,

197
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,230
some of these very
severe cases don't

198
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:33,125
appear to be declining
at the same rate.

199
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:35,270
Something that we need
to acknowledge is

200
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,010
the fact that the vast majority

201
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:38,390
of injuries and illnesses that

202
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,250
don't kill workers are injuries.

203
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,350
So this graph here
highlights the fact that

204
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:46,910
about 95 percent of the
injuries and illnesses in 2015,

205
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:48,395
in the US were

206
00:07:48,395 --> 00:07:50,570
injuries and only
about five percent

207
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:51,680
were illnesses but of course,

208
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,690
we can zoom in on the illnesses
and realize there are

209
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,910
many kinds of illnesses
that can happen.

210
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:58,595
For example some common
ones are skin disease,

211
00:07:58,595 --> 00:08:02,540
and hearing loss, and
respiratory conditions.

212
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:05,360
The risk of injury
in the workplace for

213
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,890
a non-fatal injuries depends on

214
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:08,630
things like the size
of your employer.

215
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,100
So the graph we're
looking at here,

216
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:14,025
breaks down employers on
the X-axis by size, 110,

217
00:08:14,025 --> 00:08:16,199
1,149 and so forth,

218
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:18,290
and then the different
colored bars represent years

219
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:21,095
between 2011 and 2015.

220
00:08:21,095 --> 00:08:23,720
You can see here basically,
regardless of year,

221
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,930
the most dangerous size
of employer is one that

222
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:30,605
has between 50 and 249 employees.

223
00:08:30,605 --> 00:08:33,950
The one that has the lowest
injury and illness rates,

224
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:37,150
is the smallest companies
of 1-10 employees.

225
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,910
That might make sense but if you

226
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,705
think about it a little more,

227
00:08:40,705 --> 00:08:42,980
these mid-sized companies
aren't large enough to

228
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,410
have the tremendous resources
that a large company

229
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:48,050
has but they're very
often more likely to have

230
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:52,040
dangerous operations compared
to a much smaller company.

231
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:56,135
Your risk of nonfatal injury
also depends on your sex.

232
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:58,295
So this series of pie charts is

233
00:08:58,295 --> 00:09:00,590
showing you the ratio of male

234
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:02,090
to female in terms of

235
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:03,500
incidence rates by a couple

236
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,210
of different types of employment.

237
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:07,490
First, we see private industry,

238
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:09,080
then we have state government,

239
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,490
and then we have
local government.

240
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:11,990
The numbers differ but you'll see

241
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,970
the trend is absolutely
the same and that

242
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,880
males tend to have a
much higher fraction of

243
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,450
the nonfatal injuries and
illnesses than do females.

244
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:22,370
We also can look at

245
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:25,100
geographic patterns in
nonfatal work injuries.

246
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,210
So where does Michigan
stand in this?

247
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,645
So here Michigan actually has a

248
00:09:29,645 --> 00:09:32,540
slightly higher than the
average incidence rates.

249
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:38,015
So the national incidence rate
in this year 2016 was 2.9,

250
00:09:38,015 --> 00:09:40,790
and Michigan was
right around 3.2.

251
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,980
Far from the most
dangerous state but we

252
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,740
also were not the safest
on the other hand.

253
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,960
So again, where you
live and work has

254
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,430
a very strong influence on

255
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:52,512
your risk of a nonfatal injury.
