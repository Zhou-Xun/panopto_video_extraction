1
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:15,450
So it is my absolute pleasure to introduce to today's guest lecturer Dr. Victoria Cross to cover the

2
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:22,829
area is a panelist researcher here at the University of Michigan and the Department of Epidemiology.

3
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,909
She finished her Ph.D. Was it in June?

4
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,930
Way back in June, yesterday? No, not yesterday.

5
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:41,579
But Victoria is a wonderful example of what it means to be an interdisciplinary researcher.

6
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:47,190
So prior to getting her PhD in genealogy, she got her MSW and MPH.

7
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,329
Prior to that, she had done training in anthropology, including field work.

8
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:54,390
She's worked on qualitative methods and quantitative methods.

9
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,040
It's important, I think, just to find someone to do things like there's one type of scientist, you know,

10
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:02,790
others you need lots of different methods and lots of different disciplines to kind of understand a problem,

11
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:07,739
especially a problem as difficult as chronic stress, whatever we mean by that.

12
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:13,139
Right. So because and I, Victoria is going to talk to you about some of her dissertation work,

13
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:18,360
which really sort of both directly addressing some of the things that we talked about in the readings,

14
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:21,599
the trigger social stress test, the video that you watch, too,

15
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,360
like she's going to show you data from that type of data collection that put on the study that I had.

16
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,790
But she'll tell you a little bit about and then we should have plenty of time for questions today.

17
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:36,870
But please join me in welcoming Dr. Kolesnikov.

18
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,280
Hello, everybody, and thank you. Thank you for your introductions. Generous and direct.

19
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:51,900
I have to ask if you should project. Okay, let me know if you cannot hear.

20
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:57,880
Sometimes I kind of trail off, especially when I begin to rumble or about like things that are whatever.

21
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,040
So let me know and I'll try to speak up and repeat and ask questions.

22
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:08,799
So, again, thank you. Thank you. And it's an honor to share some of my work with you today.

23
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:17,350
And it's the first time to share, so to speak, about my work, not in a very and not in a defensive manner as I'm a student.

24
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:21,639
And is it worth it, what I'm doing? But yeah, I guess it is.

25
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:29,320
Like this is the work I've been doing for the last several years and I think some of it is very interesting.

26
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:38,299
And if it's inspires you, I'm honored. So Briony introduced me as she she talked about.

27
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:43,330
So I am currently a staff on one of her projects research project.

28
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:48,670
And I'm sure given the topic of this class, you will hear about it a lot, the ATLAS study.

29
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:54,220
But I encourage you to ask her about it and how it's going, because it is a fascinating study.

30
00:02:54,550 --> 00:03:02,770
The focus is on studying life course transitions related to suicide and suicidal ideation.

31
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:09,310
And we're using multiple datasets. We're using multiple methods that are some of them are very new and I'm still learning myself.

32
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,270
So, yeah, this is what I'm doing.

33
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:20,349
And started this August and I did defense actually the defense was earlier,

34
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:24,550
but August is when the degree can conveyed to me, so that's why it's there.

35
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:33,820
But yeah, as we mentioned, the focus of my dissertation was on exploring the role of chronic stress and metabolic health disparities.

36
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:42,760
And a fun fact about me is that I am still feeling it as I'm standing in front of you.

37
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:52,840
I ran a marathon was my first one, so in time I'm not quite the time that I was hoping for, but I'm happy.

38
00:03:52,900 --> 00:04:00,970
She won her age group and was fourth woman overall. And so that's next.

39
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:12,739
But it's actually it's it's relevant as far as what we're going to be talking about the running the marathon on doing some sort of exertion like that.

40
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:15,350
And this is a stressor. It's a huge stressor.

41
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:22,279
And what's interesting about our response to stress is that it's almost doesn't matter what type of stress you experience,

42
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:27,140
the the source of stress, the way your body responds to that stress is very similar.

43
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:33,620
So the way I responded to the stress or to the marathon, to the nutritional deprivation and energy,

44
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:41,330
low energy during or at mile 18 when I really wanted to quit is may be similar to the way you might

45
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:46,940
respond or your body might respond to a very challenging stress exam or something like that.

46
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:50,630
So. So, yeah.

47
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:57,139
So the overview for today, I was going to try to talk about this stress construct and the complexity about it,

48
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:01,370
but it's very cool to hear and all your that.

49
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:04,490
You already have a background, you know what it is and all of it is.

50
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:10,490
Many of it may be redundant to you or I don't know, but forgive me if it's so,

51
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:15,499
and then I'll talk about the measurement of stress and population research and how

52
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:20,180
it's relevant to the studies of health and health disparities in populations.

53
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:28,309
And I will share the results from primarily study one because I know already I think I don't think I have time to do the study too.

54
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:31,820
But we'll see. Maybe, maybe there will be time and I can ask questions.

55
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:38,090
So I'd like to start with this quote, which I'll read it to you.

56
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:42,290
Stress, in addition to being itself and the result of itself is also the cause of itself.

57
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:48,110
It just kind of second, the quote is sort of a nonsense quote that very circular.

58
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:54,110
But I think I like it. I love it because it kind of pinpoints showcases the problem,

59
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:59,569
the problem or the challenge of studying something like stress and how it relates to health.

60
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:06,310
Because it is stress, it's circular and it's very when we're trying to apply scientific methods,

61
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:09,380
you measure it objectively or think about it objectively.

62
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:13,280
It's really hard to begin to dissect, saying it in objective manner,

63
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:19,390
especially when you begin thinking about stress experience itself, which is a lot of it.

64
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:26,300
It's very important. The subjective part of the stress experience is often the key in how we respond to stressor.

65
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:33,020
So how do we begin going back and forth between objectivity, objective measures and objectivity and accounting to that?

66
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:44,540
So this is a this is a diagram from one of my aims and it's kind of helps to one way of beginning to dissecting the stress construct.

67
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:54,620
So during a stress, when we experience an acute stress, that is not always the perceptions of that stress that you're experiencing.

68
00:06:54,950 --> 00:07:02,780
It also that all other factors that are surrounding where you are in the time when you're experiencing this stressor,

69
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:06,320
and that includes what's happening in your personal life,

70
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,390
what's happening in your family with your friends,

71
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:15,680
whether or not you got COVID today or whether or not there is some sort of political issues that are happening in the larger community.

72
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:22,880
All of these factors are one way or the other influencing how you will perceive that particular stresses that you're encountering right now.

73
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:29,029
And it's important to keep that in mind and try to measure it in a way that will account for

74
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:34,190
all these kind of complex interrelationship between chronic factors and acute stressors.

75
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:40,190
But it's also what's important is that when we're experiencing a chronic stress or acute of chronic stressors,

76
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:46,099
we are we're experiencing it at different levels and not a very arguably a

77
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:50,420
very small portion of what we experience as stressful is at a conscious level.

78
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:57,140
And by conscious, I mean we can say like, yes, I'm stressed right now and this I need this, this right now.

79
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:03,590
Maybe I need some relaxation or maybe I need to do my stretching to go for a run to address the stress.

80
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:07,460
Or maybe some of you are more conscious than that and you're able to do that.

81
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:12,080
But again, arguably, it's a very small portion of what is actually happening.

82
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:19,579
There's a big underlying mechanism that is both unconscious, that is registered and in the background,

83
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:27,200
but also there's a physiological responses within your body that you may not be aware of,

84
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:36,980
that how stress is in, how stress impacting your body, but it's just because you're not aware of it and cannot report about it.

85
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:44,359
It doesn't mean it's not influencing your health. And then that's sort of what I said, like the small portion where.

86
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:49,399
So the perceived stress is also important to highlight here is because the majority

87
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:55,100
of our studies in population health studies are using the metric of reporting,

88
00:08:55,190 --> 00:09:00,440
stress or reporting by your stressful experience to assess the stress level that you do have.

89
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:06,300
And what about. All these underlying features don't really know.

90
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:13,410
And that's kind of important to to keep that in mind, this oscillation between what we know, what we know,

91
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:19,500
what all what we can report on and what our bodies can tell us, and what is the relationship between these two?

92
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:31,380
This one is. There's another way of kind of separating or breaking apart the complex relationship within that stress construct.

93
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:38,219
This one, I find is useful to think was in addition to the previous one,

94
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:46,740
because it separates the stress into the stress sources like category or stressors and these little icons that.

95
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:54,650
I guess they are kind of pointing to the potential different ways of thinking about these stressors.

96
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:59,750
It could be anything from major disasters and major traumatic events such as natural

97
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:06,079
disasters or losing a loved one or grieving of a loved one or or just a test.

98
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:16,190
Or maybe it's a very challenging test. And then for getting sick, all of these are distinct events that you can be asked about and you can report on.

99
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:23,450
So these. That's why we call them the stress sources. But these stress soldiers, as I mentioned earlier,

100
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,250
are important to consider within the larger frame of this concept concentric figures of

101
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:35,000
what else is going on and what are other features that are influencing these stressors.

102
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:41,450
And what's important in these stress sources that unless we're talking about big trauma or natural disasters,

103
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:51,020
most of the stressors that we're talking about are daily, everyday events like taking an exam or having a car break from breaking down on you.

104
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,150
And for some people, it's not very stressful.

105
00:10:53,570 --> 00:11:01,640
If you're good at that task or subject, you won't be stressed out, but maybe you will if you are on top of everything else that is going on.

106
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:10,010
So the key point here is that they're not inherently stressful and they depend on your appraisal of that stressor.

107
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:16,440
And then your appraisal of that stressor will determine how you will respond to that stress.

108
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:25,830
So it will both determine your stress response and whether or not you deem that stress that event as being stressful.

109
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:30,060
Now, stress response as a category is a big on its on itself.

110
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:39,660
It's it's it's includes all this physiological, emotional, psychological responses that are happening all at once and and in sequence as well.

111
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:44,040
Here I'm just highlighting the physiological stress response.

112
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:52,020
And you've heard these chart terms already and you talked earlier about fight or flight and general adaptation syndrome.

113
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:59,549
So this is where it's interesting. This the idea of general adaptation syndrome is that kind of goes back to what I mentioned in the

114
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:05,010
beginning is that it's almost doesn't matter what type of stressor you experience that your body,

115
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:10,290
how your body physiologically react to this stressors is following the same trajectory.

116
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:16,280
It's almost the same. That's why we're talking about it as a generalized adaptation syndrome.

117
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:21,330
And it goes through this adaptation to that stressor in a similar way.

118
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:27,999
And bringing out this negative feedback mechanism is because the way we adapt,

119
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:35,490
the way we think about how physiologically body adapts to stress, is using this negative feedback mechanism.

120
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,440
And it's very similar to like such a stress as, for example, temperature fluctuations.

121
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:45,390
When you feel cold, your body begins to adapt, trying to warm you up, you begin to shiver.

122
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:48,930
When you feel hot, you begin to sweat.

123
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:54,120
And that way your body tries to pull it off. So it's it's a negative feedback mechanism.

124
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:57,570
And it's the same way with the with the stress response.

125
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:02,580
But slightly different hormones and neuronal processes are involved.

126
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:07,509
And then finally, the stress impact.

127
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:15,489
And you can see this kind of like it sets up the stress response as a mediator between stressors and stress context to stress impact,

128
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:23,290
which is a sort of like more closer relationship toward our health and how stress will impact our health.

129
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:33,910
And primarily thought right now is that over time or when when people begin to experience stressors that are too severe and maybe too prolonged,

130
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,370
maybe to early in life,

131
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:47,109
to the the healthy physiological and psychological adaptations that could be you might encounter by so like physiological adaptations,

132
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:56,560
such as maybe feeling fear or anxiety when you're experiencing stressor or having the higher heart rate

133
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:04,120
and all other adaptation that you're experiencing within your body are maybe healthy in the short term,

134
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,570
but when you experience them over time and for a prolonged period of times,

135
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:13,840
that could lead to some small adaptations that could have far reaching consequences.

136
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:19,180
And it has been shown that, for example, experiencing trauma early in life,

137
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:26,500
severe trauma has been linked to structural changes in the brain, has been linked to memory loss,

138
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:37,870
to developing PTSD and depression and other physical symptoms that is connected to dysfunction of your

139
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:46,780
immune system or metabolic systems and developing diabetes or Crohn's disease complex etiological causes.

140
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:49,900
So how do we again,

141
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:58,060
this this the way we break down the stress and understand the stress directly kind of feeds into how old metrics discussed in population.

142
00:14:58,450 --> 00:14:59,469
As I mentioned before,

143
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:08,890
the primary way we deal with that in a population health research is through surveys and the big reason for that is that it is feasible.

144
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:13,959
It is not feasible to do any type of other biomarker collection.

145
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:19,810
When you have nationally representative samples of thousands of people, it is also.

146
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:32,700
It also is quick and and it allows us to assess the background understanding like it feeds into different type of stress component.

147
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:40,540
Again most often what through the surveys we ask about stressors and then we we count them.

148
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:49,110
There's different ways of operationalizing them and understanding or measuring the level of stress one might have.

149
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,649
But that's one way, just counting and assigning a score for a person.

150
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:56,400
And then that's what we did in one of our studies.

151
00:15:56,610 --> 00:16:04,150
To see another way of assessing the stress level could be by asking about, instead of the events themself,

152
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:10,360
about the psychological adaptations you might have or you know you do by either

153
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:16,450
coping with the stress or reporting on your current self-perceived stress level,

154
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:20,710
whether or which reflects some sort of sense of overwhelm that you have right now.

155
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,540
Nonspecific, just generally giving everything else.

156
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:31,749
And but the biggest downside for this is that. It relies on memory.

157
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:36,820
And I mentioned before experiencing high levels of stress could compromise your memory.

158
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:44,559
So it's kind of like it's trying to and then the stress itself assumes that it's a conscious experience that you can think about,

159
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:52,510
objectify and report about. And some of it is, to an extent, could be stigmatized by these traumatic events.

160
00:16:52,810 --> 00:17:03,070
People don't want to talk about them. And then so the second way of doing it is to collect stress biomarkers.

161
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:07,419
And those are great. And people talk about them as being objective,

162
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:11,620
which we have to be very careful about talking about them as objective measures because they're

163
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:17,949
very sensitive to many of the fluctuations in that you experience during your course of the day,

164
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:24,370
even if you're not if you had good sleep or not, your cortisol levels could shift dramatically.

165
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:33,519
And then so but you could there's two ways of measuring the biomarker or some sort of physiological feedback.

166
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,759
Which one is a short term, this idea of fight or flight?

167
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:43,149
When you experience a stress, you can we can measure your heart rate before and after experiencing the stress and and see what happens

168
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:50,469
in that the other way is which is the kind of iconic biomarker right now that we use in stress research.

169
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:56,320
And you you I've seen you guys talking about the HP axis reactivity, which is the main,

170
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:00,759
which is could be equated to physiological stress response, response.

171
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:07,420
When when I'm saying stress reactivity, I'm thinking about physiological stress response and the end product of it is cortisol.

172
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:15,370
Again, if you have more questions about I want to talk about again, we can during Q&A, we can talk about the mechanisms of it.

173
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:27,880
But yeah, so the main challenge was that was relying on the physiological measures is that it's expensive and often infeasible.

174
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,240
That's the biggest problem. So.

175
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:41,530
So. Y. Y. So. But I guess I hope they set it up in a way that it's kind of this almost is something we need to focus on measures.

176
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:51,250
But the reason one of the reasons is that because we're a majority of our research focused on using measures that are derived from self-report.

177
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:59,410
And but if we're thinking about physiological measures of physiological stress response to being a mediator between them,

178
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:04,149
we need to understand what is the relationship between the two in order to make

179
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:09,430
some far reaching conclusions and hypotheses about how stress impacts health,

180
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:19,280
let alone how stress. Could be considered as a key match mechanism in explaining the health disparities that exist at the population level.

181
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:28,460
And then we can begin asking this big questions and sort of think about the policy implications and other interventions.

182
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,280
So study one is did exactly that.

183
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:41,900
The main question was how does the self-report measure relate to the physiological measures of stress?

184
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:51,290
And so objective one was that to understand how to commonly used self-report measures of stress coverage

185
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:57,769
with the various features of acute cortisol profile and the cortisol profile is important to consider.

186
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:01,009
It's not just one time measure, it's measured.

187
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:09,919
We collect measures across time frame to understand this idea, like more a time based approach,

188
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:14,030
a response to a stressor, because it doesn't happen all at once.

189
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:21,500
And seeing that profile and I'll talk about it a little more will help understand our whether or

190
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:26,300
not your stress response is healthy at that moment when you were a participant in the study.

191
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:31,759
And then the second objective, it speaks more to this understanding of the background stress.

192
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:41,980
And here we just proximity was by using indicators for the reason that this label and social economic status data comes from the region.

193
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:50,180
Stress and trauma study. This is really is the main pie in the study it started in 2016.

194
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:58,430
The study collection, the collection and selection into the study occurred in two stages.

195
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:03,830
First, we reached out to the Virginia Commonwealth University Health Care Network and

196
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,540
anybody who had been seeing it within that network within the last two years,

197
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:18,049
I think, and we're within that age group and also had we're considered considered to be at risk of type two diabetes.

198
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:23,540
And these were based on the whether or not you had impaired glucose and other indicators.

199
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,800
So they were eligible to participate in the study.

200
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:39,380
And then we selected these participants in two by two with a two by two sampling frame where we tried to balance them by race and neighborhood.

201
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:43,490
Yes, that means we try to when we're looking at these quadrants,

202
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:49,880
our aim was to have an equal distribution of the participants based on socio demographic characteristics.

203
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:53,150
And we sort of achieved it at the, at the baseline.

204
00:21:53,570 --> 00:22:03,170
But but you see that the white adults from low socioeconomic backgrounds were the hardest to select into our study.

205
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:12,830
And it's a known issue. So our sample, the The Age of All participants were 57 years old at baseline,

206
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,969
about half were female and identified as non-Hispanic black and a little over

207
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:24,470
half had a college degree and were from a high socioeconomic neighborhood.

208
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,419
Our exposure was measured by two self-report measures.

209
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:33,979
One is perceived stress scale, and this is an example of the questions we asked of them.

210
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:42,170
And again, it's asked about assess. You ask participants to assess their overall stress level overall they experience within the last month.

211
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:45,980
And then the second one was based on this chronic stress scale.

212
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:55,790
We called it domain specific stress because it's asked questions about potential stressors of stress sources across 12 life domains such as family,

213
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:59,720
employment, disability and other issues that people might experience.

214
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:05,600
And then we sum them up. And then we used the summary scores at our predictor.

215
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:18,440
So the outcome, physiological stress response, and we measured that by collecting saliva cortisol levels within the two hour period at baseline,

216
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:24,500
the causal level is the end product of axis response and it is a sort of

217
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:30,020
reflection reflects the functional status or the health of the stress response.

218
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:39,140
And this is this diagram helps to understand what we should expect to see versus what we're going to see.

219
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:47,719
So if the response, if you will have a healthy stress response, then this is the normal section.

220
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:56,330
This is what we expect to see. They come in at the fairly low level with their or rather what I would call it, they come in with level.

221
00:23:56,330 --> 00:24:04,880
It's a the cortisol concentration is fairly low now after we stress them out and we will using that to your social stress test,

222
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:11,480
we expect to see this gradual rise in their concentration, the cortisol level concentration.

223
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:20,809
They will reach a certain peak about 20, maybe 15 minutes after the stressor, and then we expect them to gradually begin to self-regulate,

224
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:29,600
or which means their cortisol levels should eventually return to the pretest level, and that will indicate a healthy stress response.

225
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,770
So responding and self-regulating is good.

226
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:41,540
That's what we want to see. But if we see people responding but unable to self-regulate after that, there's some sort of delay in the response.

227
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:46,639
That means your maybe there is a stress response, that there's something else is feeding into that,

228
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,420
whether it's a physiological dysfunction or something else is happening, we don't know.

229
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:57,650
But it's some sort of small adaptation or we we see a lot of blunted responses,

230
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:04,250
which means their participants will not respond to their stressor, or rather their cortisol level will not rise.

231
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:11,530
And in some participants in our study, we even see a negative kind of line that they went down after a stressor.

232
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:16,460
So, again, indication, some sort of small adaptation.

233
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:22,070
And this was that social stress test administered in during our study.

234
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:29,710
If you haven't watched that video that posted on your in-class canvas, I recommend watching it.

235
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:35,090
It is a trial social. It is a stressful test.

236
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:41,959
But the stressful part comes from this social evaluative portion and means that it's

237
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:47,660
not that you're giving a speech and maybe just giving a speech would be stressful,

238
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:52,040
but if you're doing a speech in your bathroom, that's not that stressful, right?

239
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:56,090
It's stressful when you're in front of other people and it's more stressful when those other

240
00:25:56,090 --> 00:26:01,040
people are not responding and not giving you any cues on what how your speech is going,

241
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:07,700
which I'm actually was wondering in how to do your social stressful work in that post like Zoom era

242
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:14,549
when you're so used to just like talking through the vacuum without any anybody there any cues.

243
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:24,890
So anyway but and the other and it's followed that speech is followed by the two minute mental arithmetic task, which is simple.

244
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:29,120
But again, it could be stressful on top of whatever else is happening.

245
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:33,290
And if you make a mistake, which is like the numbers are simple, but they're inconvenient,

246
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:37,040
if you make a mistake, you're asked to start again, which is very frustrating.

247
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,580
And then this effect modification that again goes back to the objective.

248
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:53,510
Number two is this idea to evaluate the other chronic features or structural features that could be influencing how you are experiencing the stressor.

249
00:26:56,050 --> 00:27:04,000
And I guess the important part is our neighborhood socioeconomic status is was derived from census indicators.

250
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:11,470
So we were not asking about it. We were assigning participants into law high level based on where they live, actually.

251
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:19,630
So results show that. So this is the overall some participant characteristics.

252
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:33,100
And the third, third, fourth and fifth columns show the median values of the participants based on their demographic characteristics,

253
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:38,230
their median values. Of course, we stressed the mean specific stress and celebrate cortisol.

254
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:40,840
And you could see here, for example, that.

255
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:52,520
non-Hispanic black adults were reporting higher stress median stress levels on both measures compared to white adults.

256
00:27:53,360 --> 00:28:03,500
But for example, when we're comparing adults based on their assigned neighborhoods, yes, we saw differences only based on domain specific stress.

257
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:10,510
So this is the main result of answering the question of the objective, number one.

258
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:14,170
So these are a little busy, so stay with me.

259
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:21,070
I'll try to walk you through this. So on the Y, so left right is again perceived stress.

260
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,330
The main specific stress.

261
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:34,530
I u i subdivided our summary scores for these stressors by Tertiles and Tertiles are based on just number of people within each group.

262
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:37,930
So it's not driven by background knowledge.

263
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:47,339
It's empirical and. Going forward, I want you to just pay attention to the launch, the orange line and the dark line.

264
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:55,800
The dark blue line. The orange line indicates everybody, the group of people who reported high stress level so are really stressed out.

265
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:59,770
The blue line indicated low stress. Okay.

266
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:06,000
So we'll comparing the on the Y act on the x axis for two graphs we see collection times.

267
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:14,850
So we collected the salary cortisol from them eight times one time before they add the baseline when they just

268
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:23,009
started their their test then right prior to their actual stressor for the job talk and then right after.

269
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:32,600
And then we kind of continued. And then on the y axis we have lots from forties, all trajectories and the trajectories are again subdivided.

270
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:38,390
Or by or depicted by that type of supported stress.

271
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:43,310
Right. So if you look at you have that.

272
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:51,920
So what would be the tension here? And this is where I'm talking about like cortisol profile, who paid attention to what is the difference?

273
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:58,310
Is there any differences at baseline between these three groups or rather two groups I want you to pay attention to?

274
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:05,270
And based on what we see here, there is no statistically significant differences between these groups.

275
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:15,140
Now, we pay attention to the slope of these lines, slope of the dark blue line and slope of the orange line.

276
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:22,940
And see, the slope is kind of shallow. That means the response is not as not as high.

277
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:31,730
So the response is blunted. And that is, as you remember, blunted response is sort of an indication while adaptation.

278
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:37,190
So what we see here is that the group that reports high stress,

279
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:46,040
they do not respond to the stressor as well as people who report low stress, which is dark blue line.

280
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:56,140
And you see that differences in terms of the peak levels could also be a feature of the how we grafted.

281
00:30:57,250 --> 00:31:03,700
The other important aspect here in this cortisol profile is whether or not they're able to self regulate.

282
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:10,719
And for this self-regulatory part on the significant the only domain specific stress.

283
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:16,840
So significant differences between high versus low groups and where you can see that growth,

284
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:24,700
which is that orange line had a little much shallower slow compared to the group that was a

285
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:30,370
dark line although both of the groups were not able to self-regulate to the pre test levels.

286
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:37,540
Now, this this set of graphs are similar but different.

287
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:44,340
They're showing the effect modification by neighborhood X and again on the Y on

288
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:49,620
the x axis is collection times on the Y axis will have something different.

289
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,780
And the difference is,

290
00:31:51,780 --> 00:32:01,740
is that cortisol trajectories now are depicted by neighborhood X and the percentiles of specific received or domain specific stress.

291
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:06,540
So they show that X.

292
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:13,080
So participants who are from high neighborhood X are depicted by the smooth lines.

293
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:22,379
So if you see the smooth lines, regardless of the color, those are the participants who are were assigned to a high neighborhood.

294
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:26,010
This yes, the dotted line shows the low, obviously,

295
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:33,150
and then the color within these indicates whether or not they reported high versus low stress level.

296
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:37,440
Okay. So. Pay attention to that.

297
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:42,830
The smooth lines first. Only forget about the dotted lines.

298
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:48,470
So what we see and I'm going to be talking about this perceived stress of scale right now.

299
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:56,480
So what we see here is that there is a distinct differences in the level of the in the response of

300
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:03,530
the cortisol response that is shown by participants who are reporting high stress versus low stress.

301
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:09,950
That means the orange line is more blunted compared to the.

302
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:15,499
Dark line. So and this is expected. This is what we wanted to see.

303
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,260
This is what our hypotheses we were thinking.

304
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:25,280
The people who are reporting and if there is a relationship between self-reported stress and physiological stress response,

305
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:26,720
this is what we want to see.

306
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:36,019
When I say people who report stress, they're aware that are stressed out and this is what their body is telling us right now.

307
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:40,100
If you're disregarding the smooth lines, the dotted lines, show us.

308
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:45,060
Kind of two things. One is that. It's.

309
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:50,729
There is no semen difference. So there are overlapping lines.

310
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:55,470
There is no semen difference as to what these participants report.

311
00:33:56,070 --> 00:34:00,130
Their stress response is blunted. Right.

312
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:05,400
So that there was no difference between the colors in the dotted lines.

313
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:11,470
Right. They're overlapping. And the other aspect of it all is that they are sort of blunted,

314
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:17,470
regardless of what you were responding or what you were saying, your you think how much you have stressed out or not.

315
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:21,340
Your physiologically, it seems like you are pretty stressed out.

316
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:26,890
It shows that your your you have a blunted stress response.

317
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:29,379
So there is some sort of dysregulation. And again,

318
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:39,100
the dotted lines are indicative of the group of people who are from low socioeconomic neighborhood versus whose lines high socioeconomic neighborhood.

319
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:45,190
We did that by by race and ethnicity as well, and there was no statistically significant findings.

320
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:52,150
There is some feature here that we noticed that is consistent with other studies that we saw where.

321
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:59,320
But I think how we can return to that if you're if you're interested in talking about this.

322
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:12,309
So the main takeaways from this study is that in answering the question for that, for for objective one, the answer is yes.

323
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:18,940
There's seemingly a relationship between the psychosocial stress and physiological stress response.

324
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:24,610
That is, participants reporting high, high social psychosocial stress.

325
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:30,760
Their physiological stress response appears to be blunted and it's sort of congruent across the two.

326
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:40,370
Self-reported stress scales. And then the second one was sort of a bit of more unexpected finding.

327
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:45,260
There's no limited evidence for effect modification by race or ethnicity,

328
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:52,250
but there was a clear indication that Neighborhood X modifies the relationship between the measures.

329
00:35:52,700 --> 00:36:00,980
That is when we that is participants from low socioeconomic backgrounds.

330
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:10,040
They regardless of what they report, their bodies show that there there's sort of in to the to the how they respond to stress.

331
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:14,940
And this could mean many things. And I mean.

332
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:22,280
BLOCK It's sort of suggestions of how could one interpret this finding and it's just interpretation.

333
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:30,109
So it could mean that our stress measure is inadequate to kind of capture all the variations or

334
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:35,360
important stressors that are relevant for different types of people and different experiences.

335
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:42,560
And it is if you look at the stressor, stress, scale, it doesn't capture things like discrimination or or other stressors.

336
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:54,920
And then the other explanation that could also be subsumed within that is that there is of maybe that some sort of an embodiment of disadvantage

337
00:36:54,920 --> 00:37:07,910
where being continuously stressed out as one might expect to be or experiencing higher low grade stressors if you live in a poor neighborhood,

338
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:15,320
might influence whether or not you become sensitized or desensitized to stress experience.

339
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:20,570
Yeah. So yeah, let's see.

340
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:22,370
There are questions for this.

341
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:31,180
And that last point is really important and it's something I think your work is really keen to know if any of you are trained or lived under a claim,

342
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:35,720
you know, like eventually you stop being able to hear those things and of course the trains keep coming.

343
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:37,879
It's not the trains aren't there. Is that you literally?

344
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:43,880
But if somebody actually like a train come by a lot today, you would say no because you didn't hear it.

345
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:48,560
And it's not that. There it is. It wasn't sounding registered in your ears.

346
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:52,669
It's that it came in through this year and it reads like, I know what that is.

347
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:57,940
And it literally like did not rise to the level of consciousness. So now you are not able to report.

348
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:02,750
So I think this work really just sort of demonstrates.

349
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:08,000
Why? Why do we talk so much about measurement?

350
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:13,430
And we're talking about something like mental health, which has all these assumptions like you can report on it.

351
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:19,430
It's just that you will report on it or that you're willing to report on it, but then you can report on it.

352
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:24,560
And as that is the part that you're reporting on, the part that actually matters,

353
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:31,520
which is also remember that Aadhaar Aadhaar is trying to get at what is fundamentally happening in the brain.

354
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:39,470
Right. What is happening in the body? What's that? You know, so it's it's this work is really sort of drawing on a lot of different big ideas.

355
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:45,320
Questions for Victoria. Why.

356
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:53,450
And I know that cortisol is a response to stress, but why measure cortisol versus like heart rate or blood pressure?

357
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:59,060
I guess, like. Is it? I don't know. It's a better measure of stress than those things.

358
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:06,350
Yeah. No, it's it's a great question. And there's often there's many answers to that question.

359
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:15,770
And Regan also helped me with that. But the the heart rate is maybe more messy of a measure.

360
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:25,580
It also is. But also we can correct for that, like your physical level, whether or not you're healthy or not.

361
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:33,650
And that will change. But the biggest answer to the why cortisol is that because the cortisol.

362
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:37,780
What does it do in the body when the cortisol is released?

363
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:44,390
There's a trigger for the trigger for releasing glucose into your bloodstream.

364
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:47,330
And that's what's happened with glucose.

365
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:56,510
Glucose is important because of the evolutionary kind of based adaptation that we experience throughout the ages.

366
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:07,610
That is, if you're experiencing sense of fear and you are in danger immediately, your body literally preps you to run or do something or fight.

367
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:11,000
Right. The pupils are dilated, so you're you see better.

368
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:21,560
You have this, although in an influx of all the glucose from your muscles, so your muscles can immediately engage and run and save life.

369
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:28,310
So that is still there. It is the immediate response that we are very well equipped to deal with.

370
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:31,760
And that's why we're here where domineering specie. Look at us.

371
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:42,620
But but the downside of it all is that over time, so when we're experiencing non-slip threatening stressors every day,

372
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:49,760
throughout the day, every minute, these stressors, again, not generally stress response, they elicit the same response.

373
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:55,280
So what it means, you have a higher cortisol level in your in your in your body.

374
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:00,770
You have a higher glucose level in your bloodstream that is not being used.

375
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:12,410
So and one key feature or key disorder that we know what that is kind of mimics the same state is diabetes.

376
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:17,690
When you experience in diabetes, you have one marker of diabetes.

377
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:23,330
In fact, how you get diagnosed with diabetes is whether we're checking what is your blood glucose level.

378
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:28,910
If your blood glucose level remains high, your diabetes, and that is exactly the same one.

379
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:39,620
What happens when you experience stress? So cortisol is the the trigger a chemical trigger or hormone that.

380
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:46,500
Processes that these features and why vehicles get released together with insulin.

381
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,360
So insulin is the counter of that.

382
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:59,100
And I think the other the model system that people have so this exactly like so the reason so when we think about what causes type two diabetes,

383
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:04,829
which is what the study is trying to get at, this is the goal is to try to understand how does stress relate to disparities in

384
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:08,310
diabetes because African-Americans are far more likely to develop type two diabetes.

385
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:18,059
We're trying to understand is stress. The reason why and Cushing's syndrome is a is not the same as being stressed or diabetes,

386
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:25,940
but it is a condition where people have either a they might have a pituitary tumor or some other problem where they are producing a lot of important.

387
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:34,049
And when people have Cushing's, they get depressed, they get diabetes, they get osteoporosis, they get a lot of things.

388
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:41,280
We're going to centralize it body adiposity. So it's a it's kind of a model system of sort of what happens or if you've ever had to take steroids,

389
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:46,650
if you remember how to be on points for something or if you know somebody who's been like people,

390
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:51,240
people puff up like you and part of some part of that as a result of this,

391
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:55,410
those are doses of cortisol much higher than you would ever get physiologically.

392
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:57,330
What do you mean when you take the steroids?

393
00:42:57,330 --> 00:43:05,650
But they're an immunosuppressant they are dumping, but, you know, telling your body, get cortisol out of your you know,

394
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:12,930
get it into circulation or get glucose into circulation, which is thought to be part of what leads to insulin resistance.

395
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:20,860
Question. But but there are people who study this as it relates to cardiovascular disease

396
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:24,849
and they like they do not necessarily trigger but do other other stressors.

397
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:30,610
And they do heart rate blood pressure. So if we were looking at a different outcome, like hypertension, for example,

398
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:36,640
then I think cortisol would not make sense as the biomarker to look at, but rather heart rate variability for.

399
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:40,680
I mean, I've even seen things like skin conductance, other types of measures.

400
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:47,470
There's also ways to measure what's happening in the body. But this one is the one that's relevant to the outcome in the study.

401
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:53,950
And there could be also there's a two types of cortisol is diurnal cortisol, and then there is acute cortisol.

402
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:54,759
And they, you know,

403
00:43:54,760 --> 00:44:03,729
cortisol is what sort of governs your everyday life and it's what you feel when you are part of this pick up after the coffee so that you're all of a

404
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:09,639
sudden you actually are stressed in your body out by taking coffee in because

405
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:13,990
it gives all this influx of this like energy availability all of a sudden,

406
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:16,990
okay, I'm ready to fight, right. Or flight.

407
00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:23,080
So, so yeah, it's up. And the cortisol, it is a normal pattern.

408
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:28,920
It also governs your energy levels before going to bed or during the daytime.

409
00:44:28,930 --> 00:44:32,690
It's all we can measure.

410
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:38,380
The study has been measuring that as another way of understanding your overall stress response.

411
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:45,520
And so this for our study, we to account for that perturbations during the viral cortisol,

412
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:57,040
we all collected our cortisol measures or conducted a this collection our first visit agitated at the same time of the

413
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:04,180
day for all the participants that's supposed to help or account for all these fluctuations that people might experience.

414
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:09,310
The other thing is that the term glucocorticoid literally like sugar something something.

415
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:14,740
Right. And but they were they were discovered in animals because they responded after the increase,

416
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:18,700
after you eat or that's how they found this thing that we think about is like the stress hormone.

417
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:23,430
Like they weren't found because they were stressing out the animals. They were found because the animals were eating.

418
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:29,860
And you notice after the animal eats particularly like high fat, high sugar foods, this hormone increases.

419
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:37,180
So now we understand it as stress hormone, but it was first actually found as something that was influenced by its sugar intake.

420
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:42,430
Or whether or not animals were frightened. Yes.

421
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:52,680
And this I don't know. So it's like you're skipping so much.

422
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:57,600
No, I just wanted to show the. But I'm just talking about that one.

423
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:03,300
That's that's a quote from an article published in 1928.

424
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:07,170
And that was published by Wilbur Cannon that I mentioned earlier.

425
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:13,110
His name coined the idea of flight and fighting. Homeostasis.

426
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:23,900
I. This quote is fascinating because it kind of talks about this torturing forecasts by putting them in cages and making dogs bark at them.

427
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:31,340
But what's fascinating is that the the who do consortia, which is the glucose levels in the blood,

428
00:46:32,210 --> 00:46:38,960
only increased according to them when cats were showed fear or rage or whatever.

429
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:46,670
Were emotionally involved rather than. So this goes back to this idea of the role of consciousness and perception.

430
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:50,780
All right. So let's jump back.

431
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:56,000
I think we have a little bit of time. So the second study will, I guess, skip a lot.

432
00:46:56,630 --> 00:47:07,070
This second study tried to understand this, whether or not there is a relationship between stress that we report had baseline of our

433
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:15,530
participants reported or whether how depends on how they responded during our trip stress test,

434
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:20,450
whether or not they were able to exhibit the response or not.

435
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:26,570
That was how we measured it and whether that was associated with the incidence of type two diabetes,

436
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:31,130
actually just diabetes, because one of the studies didn't over time.

437
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:41,059
And for that I used to samples and the study was just based on comparing doing the parallel analysis and two different

438
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:47,690
samples that samples had a very similar sampling frame and the way participants were selected to do the studies.

439
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:52,580
So this the first one is what I talked about. It's our study.

440
00:47:53,390 --> 00:48:02,780
And the second sample was what the acronym is HANDLE'S, which is the Healthy Aging in neighborhoods of diversity across the Lifespan study cohort.

441
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:11,180
And it is a much longer longitudinal study and it's still going on.

442
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:17,870
You can go and check them out and see what the what the procedures are that think in their fifth wave.

443
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:26,819
But. I guess the key in the interest of time, I'm going to just show.

444
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:30,930
So the exposure and the outcome in both of the studies were very similar.

445
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:35,310
We used for self-reported stress as an exposure.

446
00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:43,410
We used again perceived stress scale. And it was measured at visit one primarily.

447
00:48:43,890 --> 00:48:52,500
And then in our in the RCA study that I talked about just prior, we also used that QS cortisol response status,

448
00:48:52,770 --> 00:48:56,790
which is we assigned participants based on whether or not they were able there was it.

449
00:48:56,790 --> 00:49:05,820
We observed the change in that cortisol response from baseline to peak and whether or not it exceeded or was equal to 20% difference.

450
00:49:06,690 --> 00:49:09,210
And then the outcome was into the diabetes.

451
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:16,830
The challenge was the handles a sample is that they didn't differentiate between type one and type two diabetes.

452
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:21,420
Or we do know that type one tends to occur quite a bit earlier in life.

453
00:49:22,410 --> 00:49:31,590
And our sample was all. Well the sample at baseline and clearly it's everybody 30 and onwards.

454
00:49:31,950 --> 00:49:41,610
So we could still have some cases of type one diabetes, but we hypothesized majority of incident diabetes cases would be of type two.

455
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:49,589
And then again. So the idea was, again,

456
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:54,870
to explore does moderation or not effect modification by this or the importance of the contextual

457
00:49:54,870 --> 00:50:00,780
factors on whether or not these modify the relationship between stress and incipient diabetes?

458
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:09,149
But because of a small sample size for our study, we only used these indicators as covariates.

459
00:50:09,150 --> 00:50:15,900
We were unable to do. Just the power of the study was limited, so we're not able to explore that question there.

460
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:24,930
We did explore the moderating variables in that larger study, which had about 3000, a little over 3000 participants at baseline.

461
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:30,450
And again, the same moderating factors were considered, which is poverty level,

462
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:38,879
slightly differently operationalized as socioeconomic status and then race testing and then analytic approach.

463
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:45,660
We we primarily did several approaches, but I will focus on using survival models.

464
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:49,470
COX Proportional models to understand that relationship.

465
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:59,760
And so this these are characteristics, demographic characteristics by median perceived stress.

466
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:04,680
So again, our stress the perceived stress score that we earlier use.

467
00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:11,729
So I divided by tertiles or used it as percentiles here I just used a score and divided by

468
00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:21,420
the media of the sample and assigns high versus low C's stress based on that median division.

469
00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:34,269
So in handles, participants who had high perceived stress were younger, had higher were higher percentage,

470
00:51:34,270 --> 00:51:41,830
lived in poverty, had lower education, no insurance, and were either unemployed but disabled.

471
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:52,270
They're also reporting more frequent use of tobacco or a depressed, high depressive symptoms.

472
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:58,839
In our SAS, no differences was found by age, race, ethnicity,

473
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:08,050
employment and other features except there is a higher percentage had lower education and higher depression severity.

474
00:52:11,330 --> 00:52:19,800
So four main results. Over the median follow up of seven years, which was done in Handel study.

475
00:52:20,310 --> 00:52:27,780
We had about 197 cases, so it's about 9% who develop diabetes.

476
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:41,939
In our study out of 125 participants at baseline, which is fairly small and for a longitudinal study, about 11% developed diabetes.

477
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:50,459
But another important differentiation between the two studies here is that our sample is all the adults at risk,

478
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:57,210
at high risk of diabetes, while the handle sample includes general community population.

479
00:52:57,210 --> 00:53:02,370
So it is expected that the rate of developing diabetes will be higher in our study.

480
00:53:05,370 --> 00:53:12,720
And this these are the results and basically it's showing our results even though the point estimates are in the expected direction,

481
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:17,729
which is the high stress was associated with higher in the diabetes.

482
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:22,620
But our confidence intervals included unity.

483
00:53:28,090 --> 00:53:33,490
And then this this was in fact, the results for effect identification by race and ethnicity and policies.

484
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:40,690
There is no, no, no evidence for effect modification or our system, but for race, ethnicity,

485
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:46,989
we saw that compared to white adults with low stress, which is what you see here.

486
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:57,460
And it's this red line. The graph shows adjusted survival curves from the Cox proportional models, which basically suggests that.

487
00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:06,929
White adults in low stress may have higher diabetes, diabetes,

488
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:14,370
free survival compared to any other groups and compared to any other reported stressors.

489
00:54:14,670 --> 00:54:25,960
So that's what we see basically in the graph. So main takeaways from this study was that.

490
00:54:26,970 --> 00:54:33,630
There was no statistically significant association between perceived stress or acute stress response and incident diabetes,

491
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:37,469
although the direction of association is as hypothesized,

492
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:46,230
and we do think that next steps would be we hoping that we will link this study to other bigger

493
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:55,020
samples and we use evidence from other study to increase our knowledge that is available now,

494
00:54:55,020 --> 00:55:00,900
starting to see whether our findings are non-significant are actually true findings or not.

495
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:06,720
And then we did find effect modification handles.

496
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:13,680
But it also it is. So, again, white adults with low levels of stress.

497
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:24,900
Stress had the lowest incidence of diabetes. We also found because there is a weird if you look back at kind of sort of unexpected, the participants,

498
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:31,350
black adults with low stress had higher hazard rate compared to black adults was high stress.

499
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:36,800
It's kind of unclear what it was about. But we also hypothesize,

500
00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:43,110
think that the measure itself with which we use their stress levels may not be sensitive

501
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:49,220
enough to detect the underlying features or important differences in this population.

502
00:55:52,520 --> 00:56:00,640
Yeah. So and I don't know why my conclusions appear in a random, but yeah.

503
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:06,000
So the main conclusions from these two studies are that psychosocial stress,

504
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:18,080
a stress construct is a complex multilevel construct and a process that includes various features, biological and psychological and social mechanisms.

505
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:25,510
Chronic psychosocial stress might play an important role in cardiometabolic risk disparities.

506
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:30,440
And still, I mean, the evidence suggests that it does. We have a weak evidence in our studies,

507
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:42,440
but there are some just basically suggesting we need to keep digging deeper and measuring psychosocial stress where a self-report is feasible,

508
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:48,890
but it must be modified to be relevant to the populations.

509
00:56:48,890 --> 00:56:58,040
Your study. And then. Yeah. And then we demonstrated the need for replication, combining evidence from multiple studies.

510
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:05,860
All right. Any more questions you might have or feedback or.

511
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:17,700
Yes. I was just wandering back to study one where we were talking about like portable increases, your glucose response and like release.

512
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:25,060
Would that mean then that like a one third stress response or you would like shown with a graph like would that be almost advantageous?

513
00:57:25,090 --> 00:57:28,800
Like, could that be seen in a good way or is that still a bad thing?

514
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:40,410
So the blunted stress response indicates that there's some sort of insensitivity to glucose glucocorticoids in your bloodstream.

515
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:44,809
So there are some sort of. No.

516
00:57:44,810 --> 00:57:51,930
It's an indication of small adaptation of not a healthy response.

517
00:57:52,030 --> 00:57:55,640
Well, I think, though, I guess what I'm saying is it's an indication of adaptation.

518
00:57:56,060 --> 00:58:04,760
The challenge is sort of in the view is it's kind of like your thermostat, like you set your thermostat for 78 or whatever.

519
00:58:05,150 --> 00:58:11,660
But if it's 120 degrees outside, it has to, which is like the chronic stress.

520
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:17,840
Like it's really works hard to get down to 78 all the time and eventually it actually can't get down to 70.

521
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:21,770
The idea is that it actually kind of even though it's trying it, it can only get down to 79.

522
00:58:22,610 --> 00:58:31,909
Right. And so the same way that the initial level that the that if you notice like the people because you can go

523
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:38,660
back to that slide that level before we stress them out to the level that they're walking in the door with.

524
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:43,000
And so it's it's both. What is happening.

525
00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:47,190
Before when I stressed that which is this the slope, right.

526
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:52,360
Which is what Victoria is saying like that is that not responding to an acute stressor is a problem.

527
00:58:53,350 --> 00:58:59,670
The other element is that the where the Intersect actually is.

528
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:04,839
So so it's not just that the slope is different from the Intersect. It's not that's probably not statistically significantly different.

529
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:12,750
Right. But that the intercept is also so because you could have like just, you know, high, medium, low and they all have the same slope.

530
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:18,660
But and I think this also kind of illustrates. Why it's so hard to do this.

531
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:22,560
People had to come in fast. We had to, like, bring a car.

532
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:25,910
They were there at 3:00. They had we had them do the interview.

533
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:29,520
They showed out at 5:00. And when all this stuff happens. We did it.

534
00:59:29,730 --> 00:59:35,460
She didn't even mention the fact that, like the first participants know they're giving a speech, but that's all they know.

535
00:59:35,610 --> 00:59:40,800
And so there's actually there's a temporary deception that is that is right at the end of everything,

536
00:59:41,430 --> 00:59:47,490
because they are told they don't know that the audience is not going to be friendly and they want the audience says nothing.

537
00:59:47,730 --> 00:59:50,910
You think you're just intense? Like the audience says nothing. They don't smile.

538
00:59:51,090 --> 00:59:56,040
They don't nod. The only thing that the audience says is you still have some time left.

539
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:03,600
Or if you get that's incorrect, start over. Subtract 13,022 like that.

540
01:00:03,610 --> 01:00:07,710
So watch the trailer video if you haven't already. That is exactly what we did to before.

541
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:12,630
And I can tell you, like, I wish we had done that. I wish we collected cortisol on the panel.

542
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:17,180
Very stressful to be a panel member in that in that study.

543
01:00:17,190 --> 01:00:27,600
I was there too. Yeah it's really hard to of that. So yeah so it's very kind of a discussion that self-awareness and pointed stress responses that

544
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:34,480
is I mean like I'm not I'm just out like the code is all just kind of stays in the bloodstream.

545
01:00:35,370 --> 01:00:39,029
It's more means that yeah, I am blunted overall.

546
01:00:39,030 --> 01:00:43,740
We look at this like this example it's you don't.

547
01:00:44,810 --> 01:00:50,990
Respond as well. Now you can see that they're also at the higher level as they come in.

548
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:59,970
And that response, I mean, that's also been right here, that indication that you're already having this higher level.

549
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:03,350
There's no maybe there's nowhere for you to go to respond.

550
01:01:03,770 --> 01:01:12,110
You're kind of like at the maximum already. So you are responding, but your body is just like it is already on this like overdrive, you know?

551
01:01:12,470 --> 01:01:18,050
So but we're looking at this overall trajectory, whether or not it's blunted.

552
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:21,500
If your job if your responded but unable to regulate.

553
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:25,820
It's a it's also a marker and it's also been linked to.

554
01:01:26,060 --> 01:01:27,170
So that's another feature.

555
01:01:27,470 --> 01:01:39,650
Different features of this cortisol profile have been linked to different types of health outcomes and inability to self-regulate, as we saw here.

556
01:01:40,370 --> 01:01:46,580
This finding was consistently linked to higher cardiovascular disorders incidence,

557
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:54,050
while having the blunted overall response was linked to higher incidence of diabetes and depression.

558
01:01:54,950 --> 01:02:00,860
So there's a difference. So you can think about what happens when you are continuously on edge.

559
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:09,230
You always responsive, right? Or what happens when you have low energy availability, which is associated with depression or diabetes.

560
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:15,290
So it's like I think another thing that there's another kind of piece of historical literature relevant here,

561
01:02:15,290 --> 01:02:19,159
which is that one of the other when people were looking for like biomarkers for depression,

562
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:26,030
which they still do, but like real like in the sixties and seventies, one of the paradigms that was used is called a dexamethasone suppression test.

563
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:30,079
And so this was a a again, not stressing people out,

564
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:36,620
but you would bring people into the lab and you would give them cortisol or you wouldn't either like through a pill or through an injection,

565
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:40,980
and you would actually watch when it cut. How long did it take for them to clear that cortisol, to your point?

566
01:02:41,010 --> 01:02:44,629
Right. So like how so it's not that I'm I'm not emotionally distressing you.

567
01:02:44,630 --> 01:02:47,900
I'm like physiologically, I'm giving you a jump.

568
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:52,549
And people with depression have severe clinical, clinical depression.

569
01:02:52,550 --> 01:02:59,180
What do we mean by that? Those people, it was the literature which is now much more mixed.

570
01:02:59,180 --> 01:03:03,080
But at the time there was like there was a belief that people were with severe depression.

571
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:07,760
We're not able to bring that cortisol down, that exogenous, like also.

572
01:03:08,450 --> 01:03:12,319
So it basically is just like stuck, right? Yeah. They basically couldn't clear it.

573
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:16,610
Right. Which is again, there's also like it's if, if you're really interested,

574
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:21,110
there's like fascinating literature to on like there's two great animal models of type two diabetes.

575
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:26,990
They're all really anxious. Like they're not breeding for anybody, they're breeding for diabetes risk.

576
01:03:27,410 --> 01:03:33,110
But if you put those animal like if you just had, somebody would see them like be really nervous and they don't they even though like

577
01:03:33,110 --> 01:03:37,700
they're genetically bred to get type two diabetes in like ten days or whatever,

578
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:43,069
I mean, like, really, really like they're also super anxious animals and so it kind of it's still indicating like there's

579
01:03:43,070 --> 01:03:48,170
some there's potentially some like shared biological substrate that's going on between those two.

580
01:03:48,590 --> 01:03:53,540
Whether it turns out to be the access is the thing underneath the hood of that or something else.

581
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:58,520
But certainly it's there's a lot of different strains of evidence that suggest that's relevant.

582
01:04:02,990 --> 01:04:10,250
So when you're thinking about like intervening because you said that like if you have higher perceived stress,

583
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:14,000
then you probably also have higher stress levels.

584
01:04:15,710 --> 01:04:22,370
When you think about brain, I guess like that level down, not even like thinking about the response for say like.

585
01:04:22,940 --> 01:04:28,520
Yeah. Do try to address people's perceived stress and like trying to get them to perceived stress less.

586
01:04:30,270 --> 01:04:34,729
Yeah. Yeah. It's a it's great question.

587
01:04:34,730 --> 01:04:44,389
And I think the focus on the effects modification by structural factors is one way of trying to

588
01:04:44,390 --> 01:04:50,450
begin systematically addressing this question is that is what is that that we can intervene on?

589
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:54,860
And because you experience in a higher stress level,

590
01:04:54,860 --> 01:05:04,850
but you are living in a neighborhood and you are encountering other challenges that are structurally inequitable and unfair,

591
01:05:05,090 --> 01:05:12,049
then it's kind of where this is kind of pointing to what exactly we need to address

592
01:05:12,050 --> 01:05:17,150
first before we're talking about the people who are experiencing the high stress levels.

593
01:05:17,510 --> 01:05:21,229
So that's why the concentric circles are important.

594
01:05:21,230 --> 01:05:29,300
We need to start big and see what is actually modifiable and can help influence what are people reporting on?

595
01:05:29,690 --> 01:05:37,009
The fact that we are using their self-report to show that is in a way a kind of proof of concept like it is important.

596
01:05:37,010 --> 01:05:44,310
People are responding, it makes a difference. But whether or not we actually can intervene like, hey, stop stressing out, that's.

597
01:05:44,770 --> 01:05:52,870
I mean, it is helpful to understand that there are behavioral interventions that exist and they are helpful.

598
01:05:53,230 --> 01:05:58,720
But it's not the key. This is not the key that we in population health focus on.

599
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:18,320
Based on your thinking. I need to look at this and recognize.
