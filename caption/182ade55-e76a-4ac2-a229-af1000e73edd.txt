1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:19,050
Oh, in terms of discipline, I guess I could not believe in Jesus.

2
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:37,200
Usually he used to be like, I don't know are likely to lose a indispensable helps them.

3
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:45,530
So I like I said, I thought he was using like this.

4
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:54,010
Yes. You see. So it's like I have a totally laying around yesterday.

5
00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:06,000
Okay, why don't we get started? Really? So today we're going to continue our discussion of nutrition monitoring.

6
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,670
And today we're going to be talking about dietary reference intakes.

7
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,240
This is just an introduction to the diaries.

8
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,150
You'll revisit them when you take vitamins and minerals and we'll revisit them.

9
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:26,400
Detail wrinkles, have a nutrition assessment team second year.

10
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:36,000
It's going to be a shorter lecture. And so what I want to do this before we even start our first few classes.

11
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,940
We have a lot of content. We didn't have a lot of time. We didn't really get a chance to introduce ourselves.

12
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:47,430
We have some students from other departments in here, so I have since we have the time,

13
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,860
let's just go around and share a name, the program you're in where you're from.

14
00:01:53,880 --> 00:02:00,290
Another thought to have it's Wednesday, some day, things like that.

15
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:07,600
So who wants to begin? Hi, I'm Sabrina.

23
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:55,040
Hi, I'm Christiana. I am also an MPH dietetic student, and I grew up in Ann Arbor, but now live in Michigan State.

24
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:05,030
Oh, I'm out of here. I am getting EMS and nutrition and dietetics and I'm from New Jersey, but I went to Forest in China and I study biology.

25
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:12,710
I'm Hayley. I'm also an MPH Nutritional Sciences Dietetics student.

26
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:20,180

I'm here. I'm also an education dietetics student.

30
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:46,460
There's a trend. Yeah. Yeah. I'm originally from Rochester, Michigan, so, like an hour away from here, so.

31
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:52,400
And got my undergrad in exercise science from home college, a small college on the west side.

32
00:03:53,980 --> 00:04:01,610
And Mya, I am also MPH Dietetics first year I'm from Boston and I went to Hamilton College.

Undergrad, I studied biology. Couple of you guys from Boston.

34
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:14,630
Okay. My name is Leah. I am the Age Dietetic Nutrition Program.

35
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:23,090
Had my undergrad at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, where I studied global studies and politics.

36
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:27,050
So completely different. And I'm from Maryland.

37
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,370
Yeah, it's nice having these diverse backgrounds, so.

38
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:35,450
Right. It's important. Hello, I'm Melissa.

I'm also MPH Dietetics. I'm from Los Angeles, California.

40
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:45,110
I studied at UC Santa Cruz, so I haven't left California until now.

41
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:49,489
Yeah. Oh, well.

42
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:58,219
Hi everyone. I imagine how I am from South Korea, but I spent a lot of time in Chicago, MPH Dietetics,

43
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:03,470
and I did my undergrad here at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor for microbiology.

44
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,000
Great. My name's Kayla. I'm from Holland, Michigan.

45
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:17,240
I am a fifth year undergrad student here at Michigan, and I'm currently applying to dietetics programs.

46
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:26,979
My name is Felicia and you can call me Tess and also A.H.

47
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:30,880
Daddy's that entity. And I'm from China.

48
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:42,830
Hi. My name is Kiki and I'm Brooklyn and I did my undergrad in in engineering and I'm not an MPH in nutritional sciences but

49
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:52,040
non dietetics and I'm Shifa I'm a I mess with the dietetics concentration for a year and I did my undergrad at misuse.

50
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:05,000
Hi, I'm Kelly. I'm a second year MPH Health Behavior and Health Education Department, though not nutrition,

51
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:12,590
but I've taken a lot of nutrition stuff last year and I did my undergrad a long time ago, returning to school at Barnard College in New York.

52
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:16,520
I got a degree in philosophy and I have a Ph.D. in philosophy from Columbia.

53
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:25,190
Hi, I'm Jennifer. I am in I am an MPH in internal sciences, in dietetics.

54
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:29,330
And I did my undergrad in anthropology here at the University of Michigan.

55
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:35,660
Hi, I'm Morgan. I'm from Frisco, Texas, which is just like a little north of Dallas.

56
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:41,299
I did my undergrad here and like cellular, molecular bio.

57
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,770
And I am a first year mph, but not dietetics.

58
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:52,080
Hi. My name is Lola. I'm in a regional program.

59
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:56,760
I'm from Indonesia, where I also got my undergrad degree in nutrition.

60
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:08,670
Hi, I'm Jenny. I'm EMS dietetics stewardess, and I did my undergraduate in China and major game food in microbiology.

61
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:16,170
I'm sorry. I'm I'm an I'm also a first year MPH student in dietetics.

62
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:21,330
I'm from China and I did my undergrad in U.C. Davis and clinical nutrition.

63
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:35,250
Hi, Jason. I'm from China and I graduated from UC Davis and my major is, uh, nutrition and currently on I'm Empire, Frontier Year and Genocide.

64
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:38,670
Major Yes, I am.

65
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:47,219
And I did my undergrad study in the University of Washington in the Foreign System,

66
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:52,570
Nutrition and Health Major and the first year and that was important.

67
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,720
Hi, I'm in and I'm from Sterling Heights, Michigan.

68
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:05,550
So about like an hour away, I went to Michigan State and I studied nutritional sciences and human biology and I'm m.p.h. dietetics.

69
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:09,959
I mean, I'm m.p.h. dietetics.

70
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:15,330
I went to Michigan for undergrad and in general studies I am yanjing.

71
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:23,190
I'm an MPH dietetics, I'm from Malaysia, but I did my undergraduate in Hong Kong studying for the nutritional science.

72
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:36,950
I think, you know, I'm amazed. I did my undergrad here at U of M and Biochemistry in French, and I'm from Michigan.

73
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:41,900
I see you in it. And I touch base a year ago, maybe.

74
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:47,090
Good to see you. Hi, Marilyn.

75
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:52,150
First European countries were originally from Long Island.

76
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:56,420
You are in the U.S. for about ten years now.

77
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:00,980
I did my undergrad at U of M campus for public health.

78
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:06,860
I'm Kenneth. I'm from East Point. If you don't know what they say, I'm from Detroit.

79
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:12,500
I did an impact in Social Sciences Dietetics.

80
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:15,780
I did my undergrad at Michigan State, The Green.

81
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,600
So I go and I did that in horticulture.

82
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,050
On the organic sustainability track for farming. That's cool.

83
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:34,580
I am Nicole, I am an MSC Nutrition Non Dietetic and my alma mater is you about art history and foreign languages 30 years ago.

84
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:41,540
And then be someone else and they come in. Yeah, I just came in.

85
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,780
Um, my, my name is Serino. I'm an M.S. and Dietetics.

86
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:53,510
I'm from New Jersey, and I did my undergrad here as well, but I'm from Maine.

87
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:57,410
So who do all of you from New England.

88
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:04,820
I did my I did my undergrad, actually, in at the University of Vermont.

89
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:08,810
And then I did my master's and Ph.D. at the University of Arizona.

90
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:12,770
I write nutritional science and genetics.

91
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:20,300
And that's actually what brought me here, because I did my post-doc in human genetics for a number of years,

92
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:25,729
and then a teaching position came up to teach the nutrition courses.

93
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:31,340
And I really wanted to get back to nutrition. And while I loved genetics, I missed nutrition.

94
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:36,830
So that's how I am here today teaching all of you.

95
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:48,530
So it's amazing how your path can zigzag and you just have to be receptive to doors opening and explore those open doors.

96
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:53,360
So you still have family in many. What's that? You still I mean, I do.

97
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:59,320
I do. So in the summer I go back and yeah, I checked all our family.

98
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:03,680
My husband's from Vermont. And so all our family and friends are back there.

99
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:09,730
We have the school. We have the school. I met his sister at school and.

100
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:21,660
And you know, things just lead from there. But we can hear the melody here.

101
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:31,950
I mean, it's been 20 years and my son is very much entrenched in Michigan, although he's doing his college town in Ohio.

102
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:37,540
You know, every once in a while we talk about, well, we really it would be nice to go back home where all our friends and family are.

103
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:42,120
And our son was like, uh mm hmm. Is this up for debate?

104
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:50,489
So anyway, the good thing about Michigan is it reminds me a lot of New England, although I miss the mountains and the ocean.

105
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:56,310
But, you know, the lakes here are pretty amazing. And the climate, I would say, is actually maybe a smidgen warmer.

106
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:01,800
Spring comes a little earlier than I mean, but it's nice here.

107
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:06,030
So and I love it. All right.

108
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:18,659
Well, so let's begin our discussion of our three references before we do again.

109
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,070
This just a reminder.

110
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:29,100
If you have your food for thought assignment where you need to listen to a video and read an article and just answer the question questions.

111
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:35,249
You know, I've gotten feedback from several years. I think I've had this project now for about three or four years.

112
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:43,620
Students really enjoy videos and articles, and it's just an assignment that will, you know,

113
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:48,990
sort of gives you an incentive to actually watch the videos, read the articles and so forth.

114
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:56,729
So I hope that you learn and enjoy answering the question.

115
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:00,600
Is there like a specific link or account?

116
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:11,200
No, just answer. In the best of your ability to respond.

117
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:15,910
Yeah. Yeah. If it. If it asks you to explain.

118
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:21,270
No. One sentence is probably not enough for an explanation.

119
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:25,630
You want to be someone about your explanations.

120
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:34,750
Again, Carol Shannon will be here on Monday. There are some modules that you need to just kind of go through.

121
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:38,229
They're not hard. There are quizzes. You will not be test.

122
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:45,190
Those quizzes don't count. It's just part of the modules. But it's all it's about just acquainting you with how to do what searches.

123
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:53,650
And the other thing I just want to do a quick shout out today is that like from 12 to 130, there's a student organization there.

124
00:13:53,890 --> 00:14:04,000
I really encourage you to attend. You may not join a student organization right away, but I do strongly recommend that you get involved at some point.

125
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:09,849
And I also wanted to do a shout out that for those of you interested in maternal and child nutrition,

126
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:14,820
there is a maternal and child health student organization.

127
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:18,190
It's not listed under the public health, it's on central campus.

128
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:23,740
But a number of our students, as well as students from Public Health, have been involved in that organization.

129
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:34,870
So that would be one that you could reach out. Yeah, you say that Jackie sent me the link wasn't well, it was sent.

130
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:39,040
Carol sent you a notification. Is it 1212 to 130.

131
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:43,020
Yeah. And I think it's right here in the community room isn't it. Yes.

132
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,140
So it's worthwhile to to visit. Okay.

133
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:48,760
All right.

134
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:59,730
So today we're going to just, you know, consider the purpose of these reference values intakes, defining them as well as just the applications.

135
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:06,550
So, again, this is part of the framework for nutrition monitoring in the United States.

136
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:09,670
We've gone through this figure a few times.

137
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:12,520
We talked about the food supply here in the far left.

138
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:23,079
Then we talked about consumption by individuals which is assessed or examined there that are collected data is collected via the NHANES,

139
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:29,260
our surveillance system. And so basically talking about nutrient requirements,

140
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:34,959
which again is part of nutrient nutrition monitoring that we have with reference or

141
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:46,660
standards like what we consider requirements or intake requirements for various nutrients.

142
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:52,440
And so. And this is just.

143
00:15:55,290 --> 00:16:00,900
The theories that were developed in the U.S. or also a collaboration with Canada.

144
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:10,150
So Canada uses the same drive. Okay.

145
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:19,160
So our eyes are dietary reference intakes are reference values or standards.

146
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:25,670
Think of it either way and their specific nutrient requirement recommendations.

147
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:36,950
Okay. And we also have upper limit tolerable upper limit levels where we're concerned that if individuals exceed the upper limit,

148
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:48,890
they're at higher risk for excessive nutrient intake and the host of side effects that could occur due to excessive intake,

149
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:57,709
again, use in the United States and Canada. And the purpose of these, there's a, you know, a host of reasons why we have them,

150
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:01,640
but it's to ensure adequate intake of our population in this country.

151
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:12,860
It's the backbone of our nutrition policy. Our dietary reference intakes are what inform the dietary guidelines,

152
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:20,000
which is one of our major policy documents in this category, our dietary guidelines.

153
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:28,370
It's also the standards for public health programs. It's the standards that are used in various agencies.

154
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:35,620
The school lunch program. It's also the basis for food labeling and so forth.

155
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:52,070
So in addition to we're going to just talk about the four key nutrient intake reference values or reference intake values.

156
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:55,550
We're just going to talk about this for but I also wanted to highlight again,

157
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:59,660
we have upper levels, which is part of the four I'm going to be talking about.

158
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:10,250
There's also a range of intake and that's called the acceptable macronutrient distribution range AMD and I

159
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:14,390
get so used to saying and others that I always have to go back and look and see what it actually means.

160
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:18,470
So it's an acceptable macronutrient distribution range.

161
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:22,910
So anybody know what the MDR is? We use them all the time and we don't even realize what they're called.

162
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:30,650
One word like this is the amount of carbs you should have a day, like 40 minutes.

163
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:41,930
It's the percentages. So it's the percentage of the macronutrients, carbohydrate, protein and fats as a percentage of total energy intake.

164
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:54,250
So this is where we might have a range of 25 to 35% for fat and even walk around with even those numbers in my head.

165
00:18:54,470 --> 00:19:03,740
But but we have ranges that are were developed by the academy that's developed from a healthy population and so forth.

166
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:11,510
So those are our MDR estimated energy intake requirements.

167
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:20,580
We have actual algorithms, formulas for calculating the energy requirements of individuals.

168
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:24,020
So you will have an opportunity, those of you in the dietetic program, right?

169
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:29,240
Those of you taking maternal and child, you'll be using one of the formulas.

170
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:35,209
But for those of you end up practicing and dietetics the estimated energy requirement,

171
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:43,700
the hours are frequently used by dietitians as well as other means of estimating energy intake.

172
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:47,330
But these were developed by the academy. So.

173
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:54,840
So these are also available in the workshop reports.

174
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:04,530
So the reference values are developed for their by gender, their by life stage.

175
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:14,720
So we have values for infants, children, various age ranges for adults and so forth, and also conditions, for example, pregnancy and lactation.

176
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:28,410
We have specific data series and these intake reference values just reflect the average need per day over time.

177
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:35,400
So it's understood that over a period of a week your intakes are going to fluctuate, right?

178
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:45,770
There may be a day where you don't take in any vitamin A, but the next day or the day after you might take in a lot of vitamin A.

179
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:49,840
It's understood that there's going to be variability and we know this to be true.

180
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:57,180
Just think about your own diet. We know day to day to day. Generally speaking, are just excuse variability.

181
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:03,420
And so it's understood that over a course of roughly seven days, there's going to be variability.

182
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:11,610
But over those seven days, you would expect it to average out to the roughly the intake requirement.

183
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:18,180
And it's also important to note that these are established for healthy individuals.

184
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:22,170
Now, one caveat I want to say, I meant to bring one of the books.

185
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:25,950
I have a number of the workshop reports, and as professionals,

186
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:32,550
you really should take time to get into these reports, especially once you've had vitamins and minerals.

187
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,990
They are an easy read.

188
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:44,930
Once you get through epidemiology and vitamins and minerals, they are a very easy read and the chapters are set up the same for every nutrient,

189
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:51,690
for the most part, introductions or the biochemical metabolism, highlights of the nutrient.

190
00:21:52,630 --> 00:22:00,630
And it might get into some of the issues of absorption bioavailability and then it gets into the data that

191
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:09,330
was used or the criteria that was used to set all the various limits or the various reference indicators.

192
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:15,090
Why was I going there? Oh, the point I was going to bring up for some of the nutrients, there's caveats.

193
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:23,579
So you get through at the very end that'll have the RDA is the year the upper limits and

194
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:29,549
then there may be a segment several segments after caveats for various populations.

195
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:41,250
So for example with iron there's concerned about people who may have hemochromatosis that is a genetic mutation in that they accumulate excess iron.

196
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:50,870
So there may be there may be something in the end of the chapter about caveats for smokers and that they may need extra nutrient,

197
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,770
maybe vitamin C, because of the issues of smoking.

198
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:01,410
So there are caveats for some of these nutrients later in the chapter for various populations.

199
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:08,399
Okay. So you all should become very acquainted with these chapters.

200
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,900
It's really important we get occasional updates.

201
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:19,590
So vitamin C, A, vitamin E, vitamin C, vitamin D and calcium were updated in 2011.

202
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:23,550
I can't tell you how many times I've had to go back to that workshop report to look things up.

203
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:30,660
Sodium was just updated, so over time nutrients will get updated as we get new information.

204
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,890
Yep. Can you please repeat where you were referring to?

205
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,609
So I will show you. But it's just the national academy.

206
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:43,080
So if you go to the National Academy website and you type in diaries,

207
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:51,060
it'll bring up all the workshop reports and I will show you a picture of all the different reports.

208
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:57,320
Some of them are specific for each nutrient and some of them have multiple nutrients within like

209
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:02,280
I think there's one that might have like nine or ten different nutrients all within one book.

210
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:10,590
And it's a fat book, but they're all, they're. Okay.

211
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:14,010
So let's get well before I start. You know what I'm going to do?

212
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:20,100
I'm going to jump ahead just so I can show you real quick, since I should have just brought that up right there.

213
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:25,770
So these are all the different workshop reports, and I didn't even know they're all here.

214
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:32,670
But actually, for the most part, I guess actually, most of them are multiple nutrients.

215
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:42,719
So you would just go to the National Academy National Academy Press and just type in dry,

216
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,700
and then I would just do and in the nutrient of interest and it will pull up the workshop report.

217
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:53,770
Yeah. And again, free download. So.

218
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:08,540
The other thing that's nice about them is they do a very nice job with transparency about for the most part as to how the upper limit was set.

219
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,250
And I think you'll get some of that covered in vitamins and minerals.

220
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:20,210
But if you ever wondered how an upper limit was set for a nutrient and some of them are kind of interesting,

221
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:25,820
you just as upper limits are always covered at the end of the chapter and it will lay out the

222
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:31,729
evidence that the Academy or the committee that was in charge of that found for evidence,

223
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,730
and then their rationale for why they set what they said.

224
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:40,159
And so are they updated every year, or is it just kind of like whenever they find something new,

225
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:52,280
whenever they get new and new, when there's when research has accumulated to the point that they can, it warrants an update.

226
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:59,330
It's a very, very expensive endeavor to set these dates.

227
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:07,870
In fact, there was another workshop report about how expensive it is to because you're convening not just one committee,

228
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:14,660
you're convening multiple committees of researchers to redo the DRI for a given nutrient.

229
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:24,920
And if you go back to the sodium one or the or the calcium and vitamin D, you appreciate how much work goes into these.

230
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:29,480
Publications. So it's an expensive endeavor.

231
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:36,950
What does that entail? Like what? Like what are they like? Well, they have to do or they have to that first that, you know,

232
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:43,279
there's a formalized like review that has to be developed and there's multiple committees,

233
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:50,610
those that are going to be tackling upper limit, those that are going to be tackling the are the RDA there.

234
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:53,620
I'm sure those specific committees are there.

235
00:26:53,650 --> 00:27:04,550
Then you have all the support staff to do all these lit reviews and then you have to go through the research literature,

236
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:09,020
grading it for evidence, you know, in terms of how good is the evidence.

237
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:12,290
So there's a lot of work that goes into it.

238
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:19,450
And so yeah, in as much as like 45% of this country has at least one chronic condition,

239
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:23,060
are they thinking like toward the future of making this maybe a little more tailored?

240
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:29,340
Or are they just handling the different health conditions with the caveats about individual nutrients or what what's the thinking on that?

241
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:34,639
They are there is they've always wanted to include chronic disease, but it's difficult.

242
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,160
And I have a couple of slides about that.

243
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:44,810
But we are moving in that direction and there's actually a new workshop report all about it and it's worth getting in is too much for me to summarize.

244
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:48,890
I tried to do it last year for the students. I was like, okay, this is way too much.

245
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,420
Instead, I'm going to direct you to it and it's really interested.

246
00:27:53,420 --> 00:28:00,740
So interesting. So for those of you interested in how the drives are moving in the direction of taking into account chronic disease,

247
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:05,540
I really encourage you to take a look at this workshop report.

248
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:09,400
Yeah, we are not actually doing the research. They're just commenting research.

249
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:12,650
They're not conducting the research they are culminating.

250
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:18,440
Now, that being said, there's times where when I've read various things with nutrients,

251
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:26,240
they've reached out to researchers to see if there was more data that they could pull together and maybe do a mini meta analysis.

252
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,550
So sometimes it's really like a huge systematic review, meta analysis sometimes.

253
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:39,740
So it's really a lot of work that has to occur in order to then lead to recommendations.

254
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:44,900
Yeah. Okay.

255
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:51,230
Your questions. Good questions. Yes, I guess so.

256
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:56,150
In terms of specific nutrients that could be swayed by lobbyists.

257
00:28:56,450 --> 00:29:01,190
Do they take that into account when looking at different articles?

258
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:06,110
The good thing about the academy is its researchers.

259
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:12,559
And these are researchers who they that the folks that sit on these committees when I've gone through,

260
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,080
they will list the committee members at the beginning.

261
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:20,570
And if you go through the various nutrients after a while, especially if you have time to spend with a particular nutrient,

262
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:28,040
you start to learn who the researchers are that have spent their careers in these nutrients and they're populated with those researchers.

263
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:33,650
So these are specific to evidence in the scientific literature.

264
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:47,240
Or those that sit on the committee as what I'm saying is.

265
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:54,450
RESEARCHERS. Yes. Okay. So let's go through the nutrient, the reference intakes.

266
00:29:54,450 --> 00:30:00,570
Again, we're just going to cover four, but these are the key four values.

267
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:04,080
So the estimated average requirement for the EMR,

268
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:16,320
this is a nutrient reference intake value that by definition it's the average daily nutrient intake level.

269
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:23,040
It's estimated to meet the 50% of the requirement for a population.

270
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:30,720
So. It meets the nutrient requirement of 50% of a population.

271
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:50,710
So by definition, the EMR is based on nutrient requirement scientific evidence that that's key to the definition of the air is if a nutrient has an R,

272
00:30:50,920 --> 00:31:02,830
that means there was sufficient nutrient requirement data to set the air or to establish in the air.

273
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:09,730
And so again, by definition, here we have a normal distribution.

274
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:14,500
And by definition and this is based this is population data.

275
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:25,420
The mean of that nutrient requirement, distribution is the air and.

276
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,410
It's the air is only used.

277
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:44,630
Generally speaking, it's only used for statistical analysis to establish or to derive the prevalence of nutrient inadequacy in populations.

278
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:50,330
And you will learn how this how we do it in nutrition assessment.

279
00:31:50,930 --> 00:32:00,799
So the E.R., the reason why we have tables for the E.R. is for researchers who are interested in deriving

280
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:08,540
the prevalence of micronutrient intake in a population to know the prevalence of inadequacy.

281
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:15,950
Okay. So yes, in terms of macronutrients that could be overexpressed in a population.

282
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:23,600
So for instance, like sodium, where the population on average in the US tends to eat more than recommended.

283
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:32,050
Like how do they come to the recommended number without having a population where there is the lower end of the spectrum?

284
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,199
So in this case,

285
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:43,310
we do not have an E.R. for sodium for the very reason that there was not enough evidence to establish what is a new theory requirement for sodium.

286
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:47,700
You just don't have that answer yet. So, in fact, we don't have an E.R. for sodium.

287
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:51,110
Even though we just got a new dry out for sodium.

288
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:57,020
There was not enough evidence to determine what exactly is the nutrient requirement for sodium.

289
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,590
They couldn't could be determined based on the evidence that we have.

290
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:09,510
So not all nutrients are going to have any air. Colleen doesn't have any air vitamin K.

291
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:21,330
What else? There's a couple others that don't that we don't have an R means we don't have sufficient nutrient requirement data to set an R.

292
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:34,190
And again, e.R. Is generally speaking, used for calculating prevalence of inadequacy in populations in nutrition assessment.

293
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:38,930
You'll learn there's another way to use a are when you're working with an individual.

294
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:56,240
But let's look minor point here if you have any air which is the mean to standard deviations above the air is the RDA.

295
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:11,690
So if we have nutrients that have an RDA value recommended dietary allowance per day, if we have nutrients that have an RDA.

296
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:15,590
Your next thought should be and then that means we have an R.

297
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:22,790
That means we had nutrient requirement data for that nutrient to set the air.

298
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:28,910
Thus, two standard deviations above the air is by definition the RDA.

299
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,880
In fact, the sodium. Don't we have an RDA for sodium? We don't.

300
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:38,230
They have a different intake preference value for it. Got it.

301
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:45,940
Yeah. So this is just an application of using the air.

302
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:56,440
This is a paper from Reagan Daily who does a lot of work in population data, population studies.

303
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:00,280
In this case, we have micronutrients.

304
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:04,600
These are pregnant U.S. women.

305
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:13,920
And we want you know, it was important to know is their nutrient inadequacy is among pregnant U.S. women.

306
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:17,920
And so I've got the column highlighted there.

307
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:25,630
That's the percentage or the prevalence of women with intakes below the e.R.

308
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:30,760
And that's the prevalence of our nutrient intake inadequacy.

309
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:39,370
So do we see some concerns, but only folate?

310
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,590
5%? No. Folate is 35, almost 36%.

311
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:50,240
So notice at the top it says food alone. Okay.

312
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:55,870
But you're right. What other what other nutrients are concerning?

313
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:04,750
The vitamin D that you can see it's at PFC B6 and C?

314
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:09,580
Yeah. I mean, there's a number there that are concerning.

315
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:15,610
Now, vitamin D is a little bit more complicated because where do we get vitamin D?

316
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:18,880
Sometimes we can get it from the sun as well. Right.

317
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:24,490
So this is just giving us an indication of vitamin D coming in through the diet.

318
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:29,429
Right. Yeah. You would have to get more information,

319
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:35,159
determine if they're really vitamin D deficient and what other information we need to

320
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:40,800
really determine if they're vitamin D deficiency because if they're supplementing.

321
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:44,880
So supplementing and supplementing is a key point here.

322
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:45,569
This is food.

323
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:54,540
Only, I suspect, is another column that's food plus supplements and then would probably see a different but with vitamin D or any nutrient,

324
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:57,810
how can we determine if there is a true deficiency?

325
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:10,110
Bloodwork. Yeah, so we would assess for nutrient status, just doing blood work, collecting vitamin D serum to see what their levels.

326
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:17,729
Yeah. But again, the reason for putting this up is just a really nice example of how the EMR is applied

327
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:26,550
in a population in a population study driving prevalence of nutrient inadequacy.

328
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:39,690
It's interesting. Ironside in. My guess is that so the problem with Ion is that you get alertness and nutrition assessment.

329
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:46,440
But there's two approaches for us for deriving prevalence and the one that has to be

330
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:54,179
used for ion is probability and it's a much more rigorous analytic method to derive.

331
00:37:54,180 --> 00:38:02,450
And it may be that they just didn't calculate this giant holding cell a bigger upright ion.

332
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:08,280
Yeah. Yeah. Instead, it's possible that they looked at I have to go back and some of these studies will

333
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:12,780
also collect some bloodwork and they may have just looked at ion v and bloodwork.

334
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:21,120
Okay. So as I indicated,

335
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:29,549
if you have any air than two standard deviations above the air is the RDA and that's a recommended dietary allowance and it's a level

336
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:39,660
that is sufficient to meet the requirement of nearly all individuals in a population 97.5% by definition of two standard deviations.

337
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,770
And the idea is used to counsel individuals.

338
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:55,680
And so. Most of you in your professional practice will be using the RDA, not the API, which I haven't gotten to yet.

339
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:05,060
The third level is adequate intake.

340
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:20,240
This is a nutrient level that the Academy developed for those nutrients in which we do not have the nutrient requirement data.

341
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:33,170
So if we don't have nutrient requirement data, that means we can't set an EAA or establish an R and an RDA.

342
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:45,920
So instead the nutrient gets an adequate intake reference value or they determine an air value.

343
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:55,100
So this is based on observed or experimentally determined approximation of nutrient intake.

344
00:39:55,340 --> 00:40:09,500
Typically what the is is they will look at, I think vitamin K, I'm pretty sure vitamin K was the API for vitamin K was derived in this manner.

345
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:15,820
They looked at an enhanced population.

346
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:26,930
They got the data for vitamin K intake in the US population and then they went to the 75th percentile.

347
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:34,550
And they use that because the I. So the rationale is that.

348
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:42,920
In a population where vitamin K intake, especially at the 75th percentile,

349
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:49,249
the researchers felt fairly certain that the 75th percentile would be a level

350
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:57,290
that would provide an adequate amount of vitamin K for the U.S. population.

351
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:08,760
Understanding that it's just a values that I tend to think of as a temporary value and a sort of

352
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:16,710
temporary until we get enough nutrient requirement data that then can set an EMR and an RDA.

353
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,180
You will never see the term temporary. It's my my choice.

354
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:30,510
But I think of an I is kind of being a temporary reference value until we get more data for that nutrient.

355
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:35,850
So a great example. Calcium and vitamin D had I values.

356
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:51,300
But by 2010, there was enough nutrient requirement data for the Academy to convene a review of the literature.

357
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:56,320
And now we have an R and a RDA for calcium and vitamin D.

358
00:41:57,010 --> 00:42:00,560
And yeah. Can you ever go back to it?

359
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:05,110
I haven't. Haven't you. No. Because if you have nutrient requirement data for that,

360
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:15,420
because I just means we don't have nutrient requirement data and so we're just setting a level based on healthy intake levels of a population.

361
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:22,809
That's why I'm saying I tend to think of it sort of as a temporary value that will get ingested

362
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:29,970
or will will be converted from an AI eventually to an EMR in an RDA with more research.

363
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:39,850
Yeah. So is that like the point where it turns into an ER like you have enough data that's subjective or like what's the it doesn't.

364
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,850
So turning is not a good way of describing it.

365
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:53,470
Nutrients that have an I like calcium and vitamin D once we have enough nutrient requirement data what's the like what's enough.

366
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:57,700
Like well when they feel like there's enough to it's subjective to like well I guess

367
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:03,430
it is somewhat subjective but when they feel like there's sufficient data to set.

368
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:14,650
For example, calcium is using balance studies and there were a host of balance studies conducted in metabolic units in the United States.

369
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:20,350
And once they had accumulated quite a bit of data from those balance studies, they felt ready to move ahead.

370
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:24,400
Yeah, so likewise for vitamin C.

371
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:31,290
So it's not that it is turning into it's just once is enough.

372
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:35,190
Once they feel that they have sufficient nutrient requirement data,

373
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:40,400
then they can in and say, okay, let's see if we can set in the air and in our knees.

374
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:49,680
So we use the air and the air values for populations and our views only for individuals.

375
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:56,280
Yeah. Yeah. So but one thing I want to stress that I sense we don't have nutrient requirement data.

376
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:01,470
If somebody consumes below the air, are they deficient?

377
00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:13,980
No, no, we can't say that they have their intake is deficient because it's not the air is not based on requirement data.

378
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:23,820
So you will note that in this study, the only thing they did.

379
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:28,250
And so for nutrients that have an eye.

380
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:37,010
They didn't ask for any of these women below the eye because that's incorrect use of I and I will tell you every once in a

381
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:46,280
while I see papers where researchers will calculate the prevalence of those below the eye y that pass through peer review.

382
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:49,640
I have no idea because that's wrong. Fundamentally wrong.

383
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:56,540
We can't say that someone consuming a nutrient below the eye is deficient.

384
00:44:56,660 --> 00:45:06,940
But what we can say, given the way they set the values, we can say how many were at or above the eye.

385
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:11,510
And there we have reasonable confidence that they're getting an adequate amount.

386
00:45:12,350 --> 00:45:20,930
So the only way you can use an eye in a population study is to determine the prevalence of those consuming at the level of eye are higher.

387
00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:27,030
Does that make sense to everybody? Yeah.

388
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:32,940
So that's why the fire rate column, it's the percentage above the AEI.

389
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:34,650
And we have an eye for Colleen.

390
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:47,520
And should we say the requirement of our adequate levels of or what what is that baseline we're saying I get 500 milligrams of magnesium a day.

391
00:45:47,730 --> 00:45:51,930
I don't know. The number is I have, like disease I considered healthy.

392
00:45:52,350 --> 00:46:03,960
What if we're saying that that's an adequate intake level that meets the physiologic needs for for population.

393
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:14,309
So for the EMR. So for a population study, we use the R because in a population we don't know what everyone's nutrient requirement is.

394
00:46:14,310 --> 00:46:17,639
We assume it's the mean. Not too high.

395
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:21,190
Not too low. We assume it's the mean. Okay, okay.

396
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:25,410
Yeah. That that answer the question. Yeah, yeah.

397
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:35,790
I read studies when I argue that the RDA isn't actually high enough that a lot of nutrients for what we consider health versus a point to be used.

398
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:41,550
So I'm just curious what they what that baseline actually and so the it's.

399
00:46:43,870 --> 00:46:50,770
For each nutrient RDA or the C.A.R. is set to meet those.

400
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:56,410
What is understood of what the purpose of that nutrient in its function in the body got it.

401
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:05,620
So it gives certain tissue levels that may be enzyme levels and the calcium its balance because we excrete calcium in urine.

402
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:12,340
So it's assumed that among adults, especially intake equals excretion, we must be in balance.

403
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:20,710
So there's different ways for them to derive that, but it has to do with what the body is using that nutrient for and these different criteria.

404
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:29,229
And I think once you have vitamins and minerals,

405
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:36,730
it will become more evident of how some of these nutrients are assessed or examined, as you points out.

406
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:42,320
Okay. So that's the I.

407
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,650
And then we have the upper limit.

408
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:54,640
And again, that set for establishing for many nutrients to reduce the risk of adverse or toxic effects from too much.

409
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:03,300
And this uses a risk assessment, which is really interesting.

410
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:10,959
You guys will learn about risk assessment framework when you take your class and ask,

411
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,570
which I don't know when you have an NHS course in your public health.

412
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:20,170
But there's a whole framework for risk assessment, and that's what's used to set the upper limit.

413
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:34,480
For nutrients. And that what I was just highlighting the use of AI in this population study.

414
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:38,980
This is an example if you guys can see it.

415
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:46,420
I was going to copy, I was going to print it for you guys. What I wanted to draw your attention to is on the far right,

416
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:57,969
you'll note this is a study that looks at adequacy among U.S. infants micronutrients and on the farm.

417
00:48:57,970 --> 00:49:02,980
So we have three columns here on the far right. We have less than the EMR.

418
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:05,020
We have greater than the eye.

419
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:15,610
And for infants, a lot of the nutrients are values because we have not we don't have enough data yet to establish nutrient requirements in infants.

420
00:49:15,610 --> 00:49:21,970
And the AI is based on breast milk nutrient levels among healthy.

421
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:32,430
Mothers. So and then over here on the far right is the column for infants above the upper limit for various nutrients.

422
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:37,920
And I wanted to highlight this. This is a nice example of why we would be concerned.

423
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:50,310
So we have 59% infants with zinc, high excessive zinc intake, and 32% of the infants have excessive vitamin A.

424
00:49:51,840 --> 00:50:01,570
Where do you think that's coming from? Food sources or supplements supplement.

425
00:50:02,230 --> 00:50:15,040
Yeah, this is the kind of data that is so important because then it highlights some of the sort of caregiving strategies that need modification.

426
00:50:16,390 --> 00:50:19,960
Many of the supplements for infants are pre-formed vitamin A,

427
00:50:19,990 --> 00:50:28,000
so it's very concerning that infants are getting intake levels above or at the upper limit.

428
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:35,739
For vitamin A, there's their side effects from excessive levels of vitamin A and so forth.

429
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:45,040
So that's a great example of why we collect, why we why the upper limit was so important and why these population studies are so important.

430
00:50:45,730 --> 00:50:47,740
Did you say that these were breastfed infants?

431
00:50:49,270 --> 00:50:59,679
They may be both, but the reason I brought up breastfeeding is the air is based on nutrient content of breast milk and just if possible,

432
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:04,600
make the supplement. Some other thinking is passing through, which is concerning.

433
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:11,320
No, this is these these are supplements being given directly to them.

434
00:51:11,410 --> 00:51:18,580
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

435
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:33,070
I did want to just point out that the dry value, the dry terms used in the United States are not always used in other countries.

436
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:46,720
So I think so China uses the same terms as we do, except the RDA is called the R and I reference nutrient intake in other countries.

437
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:52,580
The dries are actually called the driving rain eyes.

438
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:58,600
And so what's in blue are the terms that you might come across in other countries.

439
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:00,640
And so this comes into play.

440
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:11,480
If you're reading any kind of papers, research papers, or just papers about reference intake values like global or just international.

441
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:19,300
They'll throw all these terms around and it's it gets confusing about what we talk in RDA, we talk in the air.

442
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:22,570
So I wanted you to have this so that, you know.

443
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:27,880
How these are various terms are referred to.

444
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:34,810
Um. Units on Mondays think they are.

445
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:42,580
Okay. So you can access the tables online.

446
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:48,130
You guys have just a few of the tables in this handout.

447
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:53,770
So I just wanted to just orient you.

448
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:08,590
The first two pages are the E.R. and the reason why I want to orient you is I've had students use these tables,

449
00:53:08,590 --> 00:53:13,270
and they were supposed to be finding the ideas, and they gave me the E.R. values.

450
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:23,680
So be very fearful when you're trying to find if you if you're trying to find an RDA values for nutrition, make sure you read the table.

451
00:53:24,010 --> 00:53:27,350
I'll make sure you're not accessing the E.R.

452
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:32,770
Right. So the first two tables are the year that you would use if you're doing a population study.

453
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:43,760
And the third page is where we have segments.

454
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:52,660
So we have the recommended dietary allowance, the RDA as well as adequate intakes.

455
00:53:52,810 --> 00:53:55,990
And so on the table, anything that has an ad strips.

456
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:02,080
Within, I explained in one of the footnotes.

457
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:05,860
So if there's a nutrient without an asterix, then that's an RDA.

458
00:54:07,450 --> 00:54:16,390
So what's the RDA for vitamin C for women greater than 70 years of age?

459
00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:22,020
75. 75. Yeah. Yeah.

460
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:28,059
And then on the next page, it just continues with more RDA value.

461
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:40,720
So you'll notice that choline biotin into authentic acid and can have a high values for adults.

462
00:54:41,170 --> 00:54:47,380
Children and adults. And.

463
00:54:50,870 --> 00:55:04,580
And so if the cooling intake off of the intake recommendation for choline for women who are pregnant is 450 milligrams a day.

464
00:55:04,590 --> 00:55:09,340
I if she's consuming below 450 is her intake inadequate.

465
00:55:10,790 --> 00:55:20,690
Yeah in say that right now if you're working with her and her intake is quite a bit below,

466
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:28,700
you would not discuss that her intake is inadequate, but you would encourage foods that are high in quality during pregnancy.

467
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:33,469
Right. So it's very important to make that distinction.

468
00:55:33,470 --> 00:55:42,410
You're not going to talk about it as an inadequacy. But, you know, I would like to see her closer to see if she's well below.

469
00:55:42,410 --> 00:55:45,450
And you want to encourage those foods. Yeah. Yeah.

470
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:50,360
So I think I'm getting a little confused to clarify with the only time you're able

471
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:54,170
to say someone might be in a nutrient deficiency is if they're under the E.R.

472
00:55:54,290 --> 00:55:59,389
e.R. Yeah, well, there's a caveat to that.

473
00:55:59,390 --> 00:56:05,180
If you're working with them individually, if they're below the RDA, it's concerning.

474
00:56:05,210 --> 00:56:10,610
Okay. So when we get to nutrition assessment, we'll go through that.

475
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:17,750
But there's a whole qualitative approach that many that you'll use as professionals if they're,

476
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:23,120
if you're working with a client or patient and they're below the RDA but above the E.R.,

477
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:28,729
then you're just you're not going to talk to them per se about, you know, frank deficiency.

478
00:56:28,730 --> 00:56:32,110
It's just let's make sure you have enough foods that have this nutrient.

479
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:38,090
I mean, it also depends on how many food records you have because you're not going to base that just on one day of data.

480
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:42,110
Right. So this caveats to that. But yes.

481
00:56:43,370 --> 00:56:47,270
Okay, that's all I wanted to point out.

482
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:53,370
There's tables that have the upper limit over here.

483
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:56,600
So you have the upper limit.

484
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:13,969
And then the other point I wanted to make is we have a new driver and that's the KDR, chronic disease risk reduction urine.

485
00:57:13,970 --> 00:57:20,330
And this is new and it was developed with when they reviewed sodium.

486
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:23,209
And this is where we're coming back to.

487
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:33,980
Your question about removing addressing chronic disease as part of the drugs has always been a goal of the academy.

488
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:41,900
It's just didn't have the framework. And the evidence to support, for the most part is starting to move in that direction.

489
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:51,110
So with sodium here we have a CVR of it has an up at the top here.

490
00:57:51,110 --> 00:58:03,439
So here's the API for sodium. Well, here on the far left is this is for males and we have an API and then we see this KDR and that it's

491
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:14,180
basically saying that any reduction in sodium intake in the range of intakes of 2300 or higher,

492
00:58:15,050 --> 00:58:26,390
if somebody has a sodium intake that's 2300 milligrams or higher, any reduction of that is going to improve and reduce their chronic disease risk.

493
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:35,360
Okay. So the KDR does not replace the AEI.

494
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:48,970
It just provides further information on chronic disease risk that we know that intake above the KDR increases chronic disease risk.

495
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:58,450
Specifically, what in this case is cardio cardiovascular disease.

496
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:05,470
Yeah. Yeah. Sodium actually plays into has that adverse effect on blood pressure.

497
00:59:05,570 --> 00:59:13,540
Right. And we'll talk a little bit more about that later in the semester. So we have a KDR with sodium.

498
00:59:14,230 --> 00:59:17,390
And this is a report that I encourage all of you know,

499
00:59:17,410 --> 00:59:24,040
those of you interested in just as the mythological challenges of developing chronic disease drives.

500
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:26,260
But we are moving in that direction.

501
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:36,850
So and it was I went through this a couple of years ago when they first came out and I remember thinking, Oh, I hadn't thought about that.

502
00:59:36,850 --> 00:59:41,229
Yes, I can see how that is complicating the ability to derive these values.

503
00:59:41,230 --> 00:59:48,760
So it's really, really quite informative about some of the challenges that experience.

504
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:57,220
Okay. Again, these are all some of the workshop reports for all the various nutrients,

505
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:07,510
the types of studies that are used by the researchers and their systematic reviews and analysis are depletion relation studies.

506
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:11,320
Anybody familiar with a depletion or depletion study?

507
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:18,739
It's actually. Excuse me. It's actually really interesting, especially when you get into these reports,

508
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:30,170
because they will cite some earlier research that probably would not pass IAB approval today, but at least in relation studies,

509
01:00:30,170 --> 01:00:38,930
is when you take a population usually a small because it's done in the oftentimes in a metabolic lab or something and you start depleting their

510
01:00:38,930 --> 01:00:47,000
intake of a particular nutrient and you start monitoring specific signs and symptoms or blood levels of certain enzymes or what have you.

511
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:52,870
And then when you get them to a certain point, then you start re feeding them with the nutrient.

512
01:00:55,310 --> 01:00:58,790
And I remember one study can't remember which nutrient.

513
01:00:58,790 --> 01:01:01,310
I want to say it's Simon but I'm not positive.

514
01:01:01,610 --> 01:01:08,700
And it was an old study where they had teenage girls and they started depleting them t shirts alignment.

515
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:18,290
And after two weeks, the girls, the study participants started showing signs of irritability and grumpiness.

516
01:01:18,290 --> 01:01:24,439
And so they were monitoring these symptoms. And I don't remember how far they took them down before they started re cleaning.

517
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:31,940
But again today I'm not sure that some of these studies would pass either be approval.

518
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:37,100
There are still depletion depletion studies done maybe not to the same degree,

519
01:01:37,310 --> 01:01:46,639
but those have been useful and interesting and some of those are detailed in some of the reports you train.

520
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:50,720
Balanced studies talked about that with calcium clinical trials.

521
01:01:51,050 --> 01:01:54,200
Animal studies may provide some insight.

522
01:01:54,200 --> 01:02:00,110
It's not they're not heavily relied on by the researchers, but sometimes it provides some insight.

523
01:02:00,230 --> 01:02:09,590
Epidemiologic studies, case studies and dietary intakes of a healthy population are the types of studies that might be used to set in a high.

524
01:02:10,470 --> 01:02:18,930
Value. Very last one. And then applications.

525
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:24,810
We talked earlier about all the different applications for the drives.

526
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:36,180
It's all pretty intuitive. I mean, everything from food labeling to the programs that are supported by our federal agents, agencies and so forth,

527
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:45,510
like Wink School Lunch, the drives are used by the military for military meals and so forth, food policy and so forth.

528
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:51,600
And then I just wanted to highlight this article.

529
01:02:55,170 --> 01:03:04,770
There's a global Internet initiative to harmonize the process of developing.

530
01:03:05,710 --> 01:03:15,820
Reference in take values and it makes sense that we should be harmonizing how we derive these values.

531
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:27,069
And we're not harmonizing the actual values. We're harmonizing the process, the framework, the systematic reviews and so forth.

532
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:33,190
And so this is an interesting article for those of you interested suitably and, and so forth.

533
01:03:36,790 --> 01:03:45,190
So aligning the methodology, the population might determine where population needs different values for certain things.

534
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:51,250
Yeah. Yeah. Well, we can certainly imagine in certain populations that the needs might differ.

535
01:03:51,580 --> 01:03:52,190
Right. Right.

536
01:03:52,360 --> 01:04:01,450
But the methodology that's the argument by researchers is that the methodology should be harmonized, the process, the framework and so forth.

537
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:10,230
Okay. Any questions? Thanks.

538
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:18,030
Good question. Going back to like setting eyes through dietary intake from healthy populations.

539
01:04:19,590 --> 01:04:26,669
So how do we necessarily know if you're looking at a healthy population that doesn't have risk factors,

540
01:04:26,670 --> 01:04:30,000
if they're within a population that is at very high risk for something?

541
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:35,580
So the researchers are going to be very careful about the type of population they pick.

542
01:04:36,060 --> 01:04:39,840
Right. So, for example, with vitamin K,

543
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:49,709
they felt that if they used the whole NHANES sample and they may have even looked at several names, iterations, and again,

544
01:04:49,710 --> 01:04:53,460
instead of going with the 50th percentile for vitamin K intake,

545
01:04:53,460 --> 01:05:02,730
they decided to go with the 75th just to be more just to be on the safe side of picking a high enough level of vitamin K.

546
01:05:03,810 --> 01:05:10,320
But again, you can see how it's just an experimentally derived it's not based on nutrient requirement.

547
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:14,530
And that's why the 85 is not the end all value.

548
01:05:14,550 --> 01:05:24,209
Ultimately, you want an R and an idea for vitamin K and sometimes there is data that they can use.

549
01:05:24,210 --> 01:05:28,140
In addition to setting that using enhanced data,

550
01:05:28,140 --> 01:05:37,500
they may have also had some research on information on blood levels of vitamin K and symptoms of vitamin K deficiency and so forth.

551
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:42,180
So it's not just that they say, oh, well, we'll just use enhanced.

552
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:50,990
They go in informed about, you know, cumulative data that they do have to make the decision about that.

553
01:05:51,150 --> 01:05:58,880
But it's not ideal their knowledge that. I'm actually wondering.

554
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:08,990
What do you mean? What do you mean by harmonize the framework and process of deriving writing nutrient reference reference values?

555
01:06:09,260 --> 01:06:15,350
So harmonizing just simply means standardizing it all in from country to country.

556
01:06:16,190 --> 01:06:26,340
The framework and how we the methodology that's used to derive dietary reference intake values, they're arguing it should be harmonized.

557
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:33,080
It should be standardized from country to country to country. But there are actually different cultures and especially food cultures.

558
01:06:33,090 --> 01:06:42,740
So isn't that we're not talking about the actual values, we're talking about the methodology used to determine the values, not the values themselves.

559
01:06:43,370 --> 01:06:47,220
It's the methodology used to derive them.

560
01:06:47,450 --> 01:06:50,840
Is that. Thank you. Yeah, that's a distinction. That's an important distinction.

561
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:56,100
Can. Okay.

562
01:06:56,790 --> 01:07:00,390
I hadn't thought of it that important.

563
01:07:04,950 --> 01:07:09,030
No, not important. All right, well, that's it.

564
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:14,710
Have a good rest of the day, and I will see you on Monday.

565
01:07:14,730 --> 01:07:19,130
As I said, Carol Channing will be here to go over that search.

566
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:31,620
Have a great weekend. And you is here with me this.

567
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:35,930
Should poverty and hunger.
