1
00:00:01,338 --> 00:00:05,280
Defining Health Disparities.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,910
Inequalities in healthcare and health
disparities are well-established and

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,000
costly problems for the United States,
as well as globally.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,966
Health professionals from
diverse specialties and

5
00:00:15,966 --> 00:00:20,481
backgrounds face challenges in conducting
relevant research and translating

6
00:00:20,481 --> 00:00:26,683
promising findings into meaningful
practice to address health equity.

7
00:00:26,683 --> 00:00:29,402
Some of you may be familiar
with different concepts used to

8
00:00:29,402 --> 00:00:32,070
discuss health disparities.

9
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,430
One of the biggest challenges is agreeing
on the meaning of health disparities and

10
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:40,880
health equity because different
terms are used to represent the idea

11
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:47,330
that everyone has a fair and
just opportunity to be healthy.

12
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:51,050
This video defines several
terms you will encounter

13
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,300
in course readings to
highlight the need for

14
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:59,110
consistency when using specific terms to
describe social determinants of health.

15
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:02,270
Although there is no one definition
of health disparities or

16
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:07,100
health equity on which everyone agrees,
there are critical conceptual components

17
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:13,470
necessary to provide a framework for
effective action.

18
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:17,630
Ask yourself,
when does a difference become a disparity.

19
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:22,411
Take a moment to think about differences
in health between groups you are familiar

20
00:01:22,411 --> 00:01:31,365
with that may not be a disparity.

21
00:01:31,365 --> 00:01:33,840
What immediately came to mind?

22
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,310
Was it differences between men and
women, and breast cancer?

23
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:45,450
Or what about sex differences
in prostate cancer?

24
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:51,200
Or differences between ethnic groups for
sickle-cell anemia.

25
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,820
Do these differences reflect health
disparities, why or why not?

26
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,620
Health professionals and
policymakers have been aware of racial and

27
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,810
ethnic differences in health for
centuries.

28
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:08,480
It has only been recently that
the Federal government identified

29
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:14,570
the elimination of health disparities as
a national goal due to several challenges.

30
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:19,900
These include determining the meaning
of disparities between two groups,

31
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:25,440
identifying accurately the size of
a disparity, assessing how racial and

32
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,440
ethnic group membership correlates
with socioeconomic position or

33
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,460
living conditions.

34
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:35,210
And understanding the role of race,
ethnicity, gender, and

35
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:41,310
class in influencing health from
an intersectionality perspective.

36
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:44,620
Health disparities are defined
as differences in health

37
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,260
affecting marginalized groups.

38
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,460
This is not the complete story.

39
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:54,020
We must also consider health equity, which
takes into account the motivation for

40
00:02:54,020 --> 00:03:00,500
change based on social justice,
including ethical and human rights.

41
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,201
A number of terms are used to
reflect equity and health,

42
00:03:04,201 --> 00:03:08,695
including health inequalities,
social inequalities in health,

43
00:03:08,695 --> 00:03:13,521
health inequities, and equity in health.

44
00:03:13,521 --> 00:03:18,412
All of these terms suggest an underlying
social injustice in opportunities and

45
00:03:18,412 --> 00:03:22,160
resources necessary to be healthy.

46
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,260
Metrics for measuring change reflect
social determinants of health to achieve

47
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,440
health equity.

48
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:33,886
The metrics we use to **** change include
the health disparity of interest and

49
00:03:33,886 --> 00:03:38,938
its key social determinants.

50
00:03:38,938 --> 00:03:43,220
Our goal should not be to **** average
change in the population's health.

51
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:47,485
Rather, our goal is to document change and
health outcomes for

52
00:03:47,485 --> 00:03:52,314
disadvantaged groups, and
the size of gaps between disadvantaged and

53
00:03:52,314 --> 00:03:58,530
advantaged groups to reflect
movement towards health equity.

54
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,740
For example,

55
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:04,850
the left side of the slide illustrates
how we might intervene to give the same

56
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:11,100
resource to assist with accessing fruit
on a tree to people of different heights.

57
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,780
Giving each person access
to a box of the same height

58
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:19,650
is an example of giving everyone
the same or equal resources.

59
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:23,440
However, this does not
translate into equity

60
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,510
when there are differential needs
across people of varying heights.

61
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:33,271
The example on the right shows that we
must provide boxes of different heights to

62
00:04:33,271 --> 00:04:38,171
achieve equity when differences exist.

63
00:04:38,171 --> 00:04:42,786
Health equity, then, is the absence
of systematic disparities in health

64
00:04:42,786 --> 00:04:47,020
between more and
less advantaged social groups.

65
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:51,520
Use course readings to help you determine
specific definitions you will use

66
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:57,990
as you consider a research question or
practice goal for your final paper.

67
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:01,850
What contributes to health
outcomes not being equitable?

68
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:06,450
Remember, to reduce inequalities in
health, every action must include added

69
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:12,330
efforts to reach and assist the most
vulnerable or marginalized groups.

70
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:15,382
Otherwise, we will not close
the health disparities gap.
