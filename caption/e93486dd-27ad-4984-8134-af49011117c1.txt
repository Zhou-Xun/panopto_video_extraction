1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:06,810
Have a wonderful speaker who is from career services, Mattie Houston.

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,220
So she's going to be sharing with you a lot of really great essential information.

3
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,240
Please pay attention. I also have.

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,360
You only have to stop now. Yeah, if you want one.

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:25,200
So I was super excited to do this and it's my favorite tool and I printed it out and realize that 90% of it's hyperlinks.

6
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,280
So enjoy what you can from it.

7
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,839
If you like a paper copy, definitely lean into it. Otherwise we'll be sharing the link for this too and that digital copy.

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,829
But it's mostly about the opportunity search, which is what we're talking about today. So internships, jobs, all that.

9
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:41,370
Yeah. And then you've actually already posted a link to this on our discussion board.

10
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,370
So if you're not a paper copy person, you don't need to take one.

11
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:48,510
But if you are a paper copy person, we have them. So who wants one?

12
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:56,819
No profit on this one. Okay, more people of the same type.

13
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,920
All right. Am I good to go? Yeah. Okay. Well, hi, everybody.

14
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,100
My name is Maddie Houston. I think I've met with some of you before.

15
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,639
If not. Nice to meet you. I work for the Speech Careers Office.

16
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,799
I do mostly workshops and one on one student appointments.

17
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:16,440
One to meet with students, one on one to learn about a variety of topics, including what we're talking about today, which is the opportunity search.

18
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,830
So I know most of you are looking for internships, correct?

19
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:25,709
Yes. Okay, cool. So we'll be talking about that. So Opportunity Search was my big umbrella term.

20
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:32,100
Really, the opportunity search means job fellowship, internship, job search and internship are pretty similar.

21
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:40,620
There's maybe a couple of things that differentiate, but I wanted to start with simplicity, so I don't know how many of you have used simplicity.

22
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:47,330
It's our career services portal that we have for age, so it has ways for you to make appointments with our office.

23
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,230
It has a way through to connect with employers. Some students love it, some students don't.

24
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,180
It's just very important. So I want to do a work like walkthrough of that to begin with.

25
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:04,830
And first of all, how to find it, which starts with the heights. So I hope you all love the heights because I don't.

26
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:09,870
But that's okay. So we'll start with the height, literally googling numerous speeds, the heights I start.

27
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:14,040
Does anyone have any pressing questions that they're like, Maddie, I need to know this right now.

28
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,350
Cool. Thanks for the response. Just a little had not like shake my body.

29
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,970
Okay, so we go there. I'm going to have to log in dialog, man.

30
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,700
Cool. All right, so we go to students career development.

31
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:34,980
Here's our page. There's lots of wonderful things out here.

32
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,700
We haven't completely sorted it out, but it should be updated. There's all of our staff out there.

33
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:45,240
There's me, our interns too. You can meet with our interns as well, but if we want to access simplicity, it's right here.

34
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:50,729
Access our career portal. So you log in and this is the home page.

35
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:54,990
So how many of you have seen this before? Sick.

36
00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:01,169
Okay, cool. I also just realize that their screens are there. Hey, guys, looking at the wall over there, lesson learned.

37
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:05,070
So this is the home page that you'll be able to access. This is what it should look like for you.

38
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:10,139
Might be a little bit different, but these tabs up here is what's going to be most important.

39
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:15,930
So if you want to make an appointment, you want to come in, you want someone to look at your cover letter resume,

40
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:22,500
you want to negotiate a job offer, you want to prep for an interview, you need any type of career services help.

41
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,420
You can come in here, you can request an appointment you'll go through all of your past ones will be here too.

42
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:35,820
You can pick the topic of which we have many. You can meet with one of our full time staff, which is me, my boss, Mariana or Andrea.

43
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:41,550
All of them are wonderful. And we also have student coaches too, who will pop up and you can just be like check availability.

44
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,120
And I be like, Oh, look, anyone want to meet with me on Monday at ten?

45
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,880
Because you can it's all through here. You can request these and that's how you can come in and meet with people in our office.

46
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:59,190
So there's that. Any questions about coaching we're going to breezed through this resources.

47
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:03,930
It's always an interesting space. Mostly what we have is our Google folder, the careers library.

48
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:12,570
So you can go through here. Our Instagram is on vacation, so not really the best resource, but you can always follow us.

49
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:18,890
You can look through some employers here. I think what's even better is looking at our events about you in your hand up.

50
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:25,500
Yes. So I know that they're all paying for this service right now because you are paying to be a student here.

51
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,820
Yes. But do you get to continue the service after you graduate at all?

52
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:36,900
Yes, you do. So after you graduate, you will have access to the careers portal forever.

53
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,690
It might give you a soft spot because there's technically an agreement you have to agree to like every two years.

54
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:48,060
So if you graduate, then down the line you want to go back and get your piece and you want help with your personal statement.

55
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,990
You just email our office and you're like, Hey, you can make an appointment. I'd love to meet with you.

56
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:58,260
And as long as it's not like the first three weeks of school or the first three weeks in January, we'll be able to meet with you.

57
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,880
So we meet with alumni and as.

58
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:07,500
A student, you'll have full access to everything on here and all of our events and things for 18 months after you graduate.

59
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,980
But otherwise you can still have appointments and access our Google library and things like that.

60
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:20,580
I don't think you'll be able to attend our internal workshops, which high key you won't need to because all of them are recorded anyway.

61
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,630
I just said hi. Q I am, yes. Oh.

62
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:32,110
Is there just like an army of resources involved? I'm so glad you are.

63
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:35,810
Yes, there is. So. But I will pick that up.

64
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:48,700
But just asking about asynchronous resources. So if we go back to Resource Town, I love the pressure of knowing my password.

65
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:54,040
Let's go on an adventure together, shall we? Yes, there is.

66
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:58,029
We have a whole Google drive here too, so you'll be able to click on it. These are all asynchronous resources.

67
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:02,770
So we built this out, and by we, I mean me and my wonderful one intern over the summer.

68
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,280
These are all asynchronous resources that you can access 24/7,

69
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:10,569
because our biggest feedback from students wasn't that they didn't have enough time to be with us.

70
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,930
It's that they didn't want to. They were like, We want asynchronous resources.

71
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:19,000
And so we built all of this out. So everything and anything that you're interested in is hopefully in here.

72
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:24,760
So interviewing, for example, we have a whole folder on that. We have lots of resources.

73
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:30,730
Probably the best way to start with is interview toolset, which goes through all the different parts.

74
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:38,500
I'm a huge fan of using the summary on the side, but also we have all of our recorded workshops in here too.

75
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,899
They're called webinars for reasons I can't get into, but all of the ones are recorded in.

76
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,600
They are here. So if you're like, I really want to work on interview prep,

77
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:51,150
but I don't want to come in and talk to someone or I do my work at 3 a.m. It's not going to be coached.

78
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:54,820
Me Okay, you can come in, you can watch a workshop and you can access all of our tools.

79
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:00,300
So yeah. And questions now.

80
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:06,710
Okay. All right, great. So that's resources.

81
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:11,889
Next, what's going to be most important is events. So we bring in employers a lot of the time you can find them here.

82
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:15,370
We have navigating networking today from 5 to 6 p.m. with me.

83
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:24,760
You will learn how to use that. We probably have time for LinkedIn. Otherwise, we have employers coming in all the time to meet with students.

84
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:31,330
So big employers like the Cleveland Clinic, small employers like Benchmark Consulting.

85
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:36,129
We put lots of things in here. Some of them are through our office.

86
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:45,850
Some of them are going to be general university career ones. Um, but yeah, informational sessions are a good one.

87
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:52,629
I would want to promote if you're stressed out for the spring, it's not going to be on this page.

88
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:58,120
But we have a setting up a successful spring workshop the first week in December if you're already stressed out about January and February.

89
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:03,159
Otherwise there's tons of things in here. If you find employers that are coming in, we have all different types of events,

90
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:09,580
so definitely peruse through those because I know all of you get like a billion emails a day and we do send those out too.

91
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:14,890
But sometimes it's easier. Just go to the page. Next is opportunity posting.

92
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,770
So we'll talk about this when we get to the fancy site that I made for all of you.

93
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:21,940
But this is one search engine that's going to be really helpful for all of you.

94
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:29,110
It's the most public health specific one you're going to find. And this is where you can search for jobs, internships, fellowships.

95
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:33,280
It's nice. It will start to personalize it for you the more you use it.

96
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:40,929
So it'll be like, Oh, students in your major have also been looking at these internships because you looked at this one.

97
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:45,370
I've always weird because my algorithms always thrown off because I meet with a ton of different students every day.

98
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:57,280
But you can go through and here and all of these come to us from alumni, professors, different groups on campus, employers reaching out directly.

99
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,760
So it's going to be much more tailored to public health than anything else.

100
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:09,220
The biggest suggestion, if you're going through here looking for internships, I would go through and put in the internship filter.

101
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:15,999
Sometimes I have students come in and they're like, I have had a first year student come in and he's like, Yeah,

102
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,200
I was looking for health care consulting internships and you put in health care

103
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,559
consulting as the keywords and he got like one internship and he was like,

104
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:28,480
There's no health care consulting. And I was like, So sometimes they call them analysts.

105
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:33,490
Why don't you change it up or just put a general internship filter on there and you'll get a lot more results?

106
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:39,430
I know we only have 147 internships on here, so it's almost worth just putting a generic filter on to go through.

107
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:41,709
Sometimes students come in and they get really frustrated.

108
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:47,890
They can't find something, but they're looking for our super specific internship and our site isn't set up for super specific keywords.

109
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:56,050
Not yet. Otherwise, you can look through here lots of fellowships.

110
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:02,530
I'm trying to think of what could be age related, but maybe you want to be a health risk assessment intern.

111
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:07,030
For Insight, Exposure and Risk Sciences Group you can go through.

112
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,839
Every description is going to be different as much as we try to regulate it between all of our employers.

113
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:15,610
Some of them like to put tons of information and some of them like to put three sentences on a link.

114
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:24,370
So hopefully you can go through here. Another thing that's really frustrating is not all employers fill out every little box,

115
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:27,819
and that can be really frustrating for international students if you're looking for sponsorship.

116
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,010
So that's pretty inconsistent across the board.

117
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:38,290
Otherwise you can go through fun reminder about job descriptions if you're looking at or an internship description and you're like,

118
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:44,379
I need most of this. Great. If most of it, you made about 60% of a description apply for it.

119
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:50,050
Most internship job descriptions are wish lists, and that candidate probably doesn't exist.

120
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:53,470
And if they do, they probably want to be paid like 20 K more than what they're offering.

121
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:58,660
So if you feel like you're looking at a lot of positions and you're like, Yeah, I have most of what they're looking for, but I don't have all of it.

122
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:04,360
So suggest applying to those and a lot of these will probably take you to external sites to apply.

123
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:14,860
Yes, I've heard it's true that women on average tend to look for jobs, that they meet more qualifications than men.

124
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:19,840
Yeah. Now the data on that is like super bummer, but that is true.

125
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:24,370
Yeah. So that's why I usually like to tell students think of most descriptions as wish list.

126
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:28,810
You really got to hit the basic thing sometimes of like, Oh, we require that you have a bachelor's degree.

127
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,010
That's pretty important.

128
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:36,460
But if there's things like, Oh, you need to have, you know, proficiency in these 8000 different programs and you need to have all these skills.

129
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:39,940
As long as you're meeting most of those, you're willing to learn definitely apply.

130
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:44,499
But yes, that is true. Women, it's I don't want to get it wrong, but it's a bummer.

131
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:50,260
It's like women only apply for jobs that they meet like 90% of the qualifications and men of high when they're like 20%.

132
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:54,350
So yeah. Yeah. Just kind of.

133
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:58,790
50% of. Specific word and know.

134
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:04,540
You mean, like, maybe 50%? I guess I forgot. What?

135
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:09,630
I wasn't sure. Yeah.

136
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:16,300
And that's why I think internships, there's more leeway. Most importantly, just apply to internships you actually want.

137
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:19,960
That's usually my biggest piece of advice for students. My students come in there like Maddie.

138
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:26,070
I've applied for 200 internships, and I haven't gotten anything, and I'm like, Okay, well, how many then did you genuinely apply for?

139
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,229
And they were like, You can maybe write a cover letter. It's optional. Did you write it?

140
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:36,340
And they're like, No. It's like, okay, if you don't want to write a cover letter for a position, odds are you probably don't want it that bad.

141
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:41,590
So try to genuinely apply to positions that you want if you want to get into the swing of things.

142
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:45,489
Sure, I'm a student can. She's like, sorry, I'm out of breath, girls.

143
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:49,569
Out of shape. She came in and she was like, Yeah, I applied for like ten jobs.

144
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:53,370
Just like, get the feel of it. I was like more of they call you and then I like you all from work.

145
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:56,319
She she's like, I'm probably not. And I was like, not great.

146
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:02,290
So genuinely apply to internships you want one zero invested in if they ask you to write a cover letter and it's optional,

147
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:06,340
if you're like, yes, I will write this, I want this job. Probably the internship you want to apply for.

148
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:11,770
How many internships turn into jobs? I don't know.

149
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:16,660
That's a good question. And it's really hard to tell some students.

150
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,100
I don't know if we collect that. I'm actually going through all the internship data today.

151
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:28,330
It's going terribly so far, but I don't know how many do, but a lot of students, a lot of programs will be really upfront about that.

152
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:34,990
They'll be like, Hey, this is a volunteer program. We'll probably offer you a full time offer extended after the internship.

153
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,160
A lot of them, it happens on like an informal basis.

154
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:43,869
So it's like, oh, this internship going really well, we think you're really cool and they kind of hint at it.

155
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:47,590
And then at the end they're like, I don't know you to come work for us maybe. And you're like, I don't know, let me think about it.

156
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,370
And that can be really hard for students because sometimes they're like, Yeah, the internship was great,

157
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:56,980
but I also kind of see a few other fish in the sea or out there, like, maybe I can get paid more somewhere else.

158
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:02,979
And so we got to navigate a lot of these conversations with students, particularly like August and September.

159
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,049
And we talk about ways to be like, I'm really into you,

160
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:10,000
but also I want to see other people on like how to navigate those conversations so they can be kind of uncomfortable.

161
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:16,120
But yeah, so some of them do, but it's not a guarantee. Sometimes I have a lot that usually happens with undergrad students.

162
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,179
They come in and they're like, I want an internship that gives me a job.

163
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:23,590
Like, Where do I apply? And I'm like, That's a really tough thing to find out sometimes.

164
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:32,560
Yes. Any other questions about opportunity search on here or using this portal to locate internships?

165
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,420
Can I go back or am I okay?

166
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:43,270
Any questions about simplicity type of code?

167
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:49,280
Okay. All right, cool. So now we can go to the presentation.

168
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:53,740
It is 1149. So everything on here?

169
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:58,880
Yes, it was. Okay, cool.

170
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:07,600
Cool. Let's get down to business. Cool.

171
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:12,969
That's me and my headshot. Also, they have professional headshots.

172
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:17,110
They take like every month or two and they're always on our calendar. So if you want a new professional headshot.

173
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:22,210
I personally always look terrible in the ones that I get on here, but they usually work for a lot of people.

174
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:29,319
So we're going to talk about timelines. We'll start with we'll talk about other search engines and then a couple of things about applying

175
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,379
an AI you guys have already done or you all have already done like resumes and cover letters,

176
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:43,240
those types of things, but just some more resources and then we'll have the tool, this fella, this is the beautiful digital version.

177
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:47,710
So. But somebody already posted it. Yes, it's on the discussion board if you want.

178
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:51,760
Yes. Shout out to that person who posted it. Megan. Megan Rose.

179
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:57,339
Ten points. Okay, so where are you all in your opportunity search.

180
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:04,239
So if you could share, like I'm still looking for internships or I haven't even started, or I realize now this works better when it's virtual,

181
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,410
but if anybody has any feedback on where they are in their search, like I'm just getting started,

182
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:12,100
or I found a couple of positions or I hate all of this and I'm really stressed out.

183
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:19,900
Yes. I have an interview tonight. Yes, I have.

184
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:26,200
Is that right after that interview? Oh, so what? Yeah. Um, but I know I'm not the normal person.

185
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:33,880
Well, I hope you like pressure. If you need anything from my spouse after you like Manning and supersize my interview, I can like walking away.

186
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,410
But. No, but that's something. Yeah.

187
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,900
From the posters I haven't seen. Like a lot of people in our department.

188
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:47,280
Looks like starting from now until late January.

189
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:52,350
Yeah, you kind of work around. And so I've been, like, keeping my.

190
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:56,550
I have. Really? Yeah. Your space sensors are telling you you can't do it.

191
00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:02,260
Yeah. We'll talk about the next thing to a timeline. That's probably the number of graduated from students where, like, am I behind?

192
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:06,690
Yeah, I'm like, well, the first week was full of the library.

193
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:11,580
Yeah. Anybody else? Any other thoughts about the search?

194
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:18,340
Once the appropriate time to reach out from company apply to yeah.

195
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:22,840
And so imagine your excitement and I was like, oh yeah.

196
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:27,580
So the company that you applied for but you didn't interview for yet like you just applied.

197
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:32,620
Yeah. So I think it's appropriate to reach out to them like three weeks after the deadline is close.

198
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,410
So that's another thing we'll talk about a little bit later.

199
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:40,809
But one of the best things to do when you're applying for jobs or internships is keeping track of why you applied them on.

200
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,230
The deadlines are for students come in and they're like, Mandy,

201
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,660
I applied to this a month ago and I haven't heard back and I'm like, okay, well, you plan.

202
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:50,830
On the second day the position was open and it just closed like two days ago.

203
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:57,280
So usually you want to give them some lead time, but definitely good to follow up. I would say like three weeks after the posting.

204
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:02,860
Okay. All right. Any other thoughts on opportunity search?

205
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:09,790
What's the temperature like? Who's feeling super nervous or confidence?

206
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,280
All right. A lot of nerves. Okay. Yeah, that's great.

207
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:20,080
I could be here to support you and that you'll feel a little bit better, at least at the end of this.

208
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:25,450
Um, hopefully this next time will make you feel better.

209
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:28,870
So we had so many students at the beginning of the year who was like.

210
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:33,250
Like Matty. I feel behind, I think I'm feeling I'm really stressed out.

211
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:38,710
So we made all of these timelines that live on our Google Drive.

212
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:42,940
They are made in Canva because shout out to Canva for being beautiful.

213
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:52,360
And so the thing is, they are pretty general even on the general one, but we can't make specifics for everyone.

214
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:58,599
Actually. Let me pull up there. This is for like everything fellowships full time job.

215
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,230
So we do have one for internships too.

216
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:06,550
We try to get everything in there. Fellowships, PhD applications.

217
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:15,070
Essentially, though, what I tell my students and I mean if you're looking and you're thinking about timelines,

218
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:23,440
if you're really interested in corporate big corporate internships or you're interested in consulting,

219
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:30,450
a lot of those places do tend to hire in the fall. So they're going to be looking in September, October, November.

220
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,020
They're not interested in administrative fellowships. So that's a different conversation.

221
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:40,060
But typically they're an earlier window that's not say if you're interested in consulting that like your window has passed,

222
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:45,400
a lot of them have another blip where they come back up in January and February and they recruit again then as well.

223
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:52,150
I know that VHS tape recruiting that our students do is a little bit different than like the strategy

224
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:59,440
and financial consulting that a lot of students do all that to say you can start searching now.

225
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,389
So as you said earlier like that, I think it's okay to start looking at search engines and trying to see positions.

226
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:10,570
There might be some that meet your needs unless you're really interested in like local, state, federal internships.

227
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:15,520
You're interested in working for a nonprofit. We love students who intern there,

228
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:20,950
but they don't really have a capability to recruit super early in the fall and then pay you a ton of money and have you start in the spring.

229
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:26,350
A lot of them tend to recruit in almost an as needed basis like they do with jobs.

230
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,729
So that's going to be a spring recruitment.

231
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:32,680
So if you're interested in local, state, federal type positions, those are going to be springtime applications.

232
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:42,370
Otherwise, let's see possible summer start dates, consulting and corporate ones.

233
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,209
Interview. Yeah, I hate these timelines.

234
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:53,590
I try really hard to make them. Not confusing, but just looking at them, they still seem really confusing.

235
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:58,900
But one other thing I do want to say is you tend to hate, you tend to be interested in internships that are unpaid.

236
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:07,089
We do have lots of funding for unpaid internships and you apply for those and like a march, April timeline,

237
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:12,490
unless you're planning on going internationally with your internship, then you're going to have to pay a little bit earlier in about February.

238
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:16,600
The funding here available to international students as well.

239
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:24,580
No, I don't think so.

240
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:31,370
When I think about I don't know. That's a good question because there's lots of different funding you can piece together.

241
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:35,839
There is departmental funding and then there's like different scholarships we have to that run through our office,

242
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:43,820
one for women's health and one for transitional, which really just means like you really need like 500 bucks before you get started.

243
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:49,490
And I think we give those out to international students, but I don't know about departmental ones.

244
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:57,650
Um, all that's, that's always fair to ask otherwise, as far as timelines,

245
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:03,379
I think if you're interested in applying for positions, you can look right now there might be some that are coming up.

246
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:08,720
You might also see internships you can apply for right now, but you're not going to interview for until January or February, which is like the worst.

247
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:13,970
But a lot of places want their deadlines in by like beginning or middle of December,

248
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:18,620
and they're not going to interview you before a big holiday break. So a lot of people do their interviews in January.

249
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:27,830
I will say for our students, you're really going to be recruited all the time, kind of similar to our biostatistics units are.

250
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:36,080
There's always going to be positions out there that will be a good fit for you. So there should be positions out there now that you can apply for.

251
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:40,429
But there definitely will be probably an influx coming in the spring, January or February.

252
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:51,200
We get a ton of postings. So yeah, any questions about the timeline or the stress about I feel like I missed an opportunity.

253
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:57,820
Has to look to the owl to give you direct eye contact to the people watching this recording.

254
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:02,150
Okay, here we go.

255
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:09,280
And there's also a ton more, too. We have the full time job, one's fellowships, which are weird.

256
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:13,420
If you're interested in fellowships for your second year, we can have a conversation about that later.

257
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:19,210
Ph.D. programs and applications as well. Okay.

258
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:24,660
So we're transitioning a lot today.

259
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:29,700
One of the things to think about when you're going to do your research, I think sometimes students don't really know where to start,

260
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,489
so it's good to build some parameters and ask yourself some questions.

261
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:39,180
That's kind of also the tool that we have is kind of based on that where you explore and you try to figure out, okay, what am I actually looking for?

262
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:44,910
So going into your search, it is helpful to figure out, okay, are there specific skills that I might gain or develop?

263
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:50,610
Like I see, oh, there's a specific type of mapping that I tend to see in like full time jobs that I want.

264
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:56,309
I want to have an internship that will teach me that skill or I know day to day that's pretty common.

265
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:59,850
I a lot of students come in who are like, I do not want to sit in a desk all day.

266
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:05,540
I will disintegrate if I have to do that. So think about, okay, do you want to be in a field if you're doing research, do you want to do it?

267
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:10,140
Know what lab? Do you want to not do it in a lab? Do you want to do more qualitative or quantitative analysis?

268
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:15,810
Try to think about the things that you want to do when you graduate, earn full time jobs that you can develop.

269
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:23,370
Now, fields of interest can be really helpful if you're like, Yeah, I know, I want to work in this specific field.

270
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:26,639
Some of us are really lucky, and you're a student who's like, I want to do this.

271
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:31,370
I want to do since I was two years old and I'm studying, ready to go. Or it could be people who are like me, really?

272
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:35,100
I don't know. I'm going to change my major seven times and I can't really figure out what I want to do.

273
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,820
And you might have like five or six different fields that might be very different.

274
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:42,359
That's okay too. You'll just have more parts to your search.

275
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,249
And so going in and using one or two keywords,

276
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:47,880
you going to use five or six and you're going to kind of have different materials for each time you apply.

277
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:51,300
Where you want to be located can be really important. That'll really change things.

278
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:56,490
If you're still trying to figure out what internships are out there for you,

279
00:24:56,490 --> 00:25:02,399
I would suggest not putting the location filter on just yet because sometimes it's good just to look at opportunities to be like,

280
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:09,600
Oh, this is what I want to do. I just can't move to Seattle. And then there's other factors.

281
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,590
Usually location's a pretty big one, but if there's pay, sometimes that's non-negotiable,

282
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:17,430
and sometimes there's like, I need to have a paid internship and I need this much money this summer.

283
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,430
And I know the students are like, I could live anywhere.

284
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:25,710
It doesn't matter, but try to figure out if there's any of those non negotiable things for your search.

285
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:35,070
But some reflection beforehand can be good, so you're not going to have a ton of time for this.

286
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:38,879
But asking yourself these two questions is really important, especially the industry.

287
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:44,730
If you know, at least relatively what type of industry you want to be in, whether that's like, yeah, I'm interested in consulting.

288
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:47,940
I don't really know what that means, but I know I'm interested in it. That's a start.

289
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:54,780
And you know how to gather information about these opportunities through networking, which we'll talk about a little bit later,

290
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:59,040
but just trying to ask yourself and do some reflection before you start your searches.

291
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:02,070
But sometimes if you just go in there and I am just going to see what's out there,

292
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:06,600
you might feel really overwhelmed and not know what you're looking for. Okay.

293
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:14,549
I do want to know this. Does anybody have any issues that have with their search like keywords or I don't even know what websites to use or I'm using.

294
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:19,920
Indeed. And it's the worst. Anybody have any challenge that they've encountered with their search or even like,

295
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:25,110
I can't find a position that I want that can't find the positions you want.

296
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:29,320
Okay, we'll try. Keep finding solutions through.

297
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:34,710
Yeah. That can be aware of like how they cause this huge problem for each.

298
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:39,059
But when you go to look for full time jobs and they're like, we want to see and you're like, I don't have that.

299
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:44,580
But okay, so not find the positions you're interested in, anybody else, any challenges you've encountered.

300
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:53,659
That's okay because there's going to be lots of different parts of that.

301
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:58,670
So as far as not being able to find the internships that you're interested in, I would say.

302
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:04,370
We'll come down to what you're using to search. So, like, what search engines are you using?

303
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:07,940
What keywords? Again, maybe you're being too specific. You might be being too general.

304
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:12,320
Something that I suggest for students if you're having a hard time finding the internships that you want.

305
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:22,639
Start with a more general search and make them pay attention to the internships that you're interested in.

306
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,900
But maybe you can't take. Or even full time jobs and trying to keep track of that.

307
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:30,860
And so I think what happens, a lot of students go in and they look at, you know, a search engine.

308
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:37,370
They're like, oh, I found like a couple jobs that are really cool. And then I didn't do anything with that information and that was four months ago.

309
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,069
So something that's really important is when you go to do your search,

310
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:44,840
if you find positions you're interested in, see them on that site, favorite them, whatever that means there.

311
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:51,200
But also I suggest creating a separate Google doc and copying and pasting that entire job description and putting it in the Google

312
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:58,249
doc and creating a mega Google lot of job descriptions that you're interested in that will help you in the most rudimentary way.

313
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:02,120
I now kind of identify patterns over time, so maybe you'll see, Oh,

314
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:07,849
all these are looking for project coordinator type roles or all of them are looking for a specific type of skill,

315
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:11,840
or they all seem to weirdly be located in nonprofits. They're all federal level positions.

316
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:17,180
Sometimes it's hard to identify those patterns, but when you have them all in one place,

317
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:21,559
that can be a little bit easier and that can help you with keywords.

318
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:25,570
So that's usually a huge barrier for students when they come in as they're like,

319
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:30,410
I'm looking up, you know, toxicology, blah, blah, blah, internships, and I'm super specific.

320
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:35,690
Sometimes you got to go a little bit general. The most general you can do is like public health internships.

321
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:38,540
I know it's pretty general, but it can be a good starting point.

322
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:43,580
Or if you're at DHS, maybe, you know, Environmental Health Sciences, internships, I know those can be general,

323
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,290
but sometimes the general search will be more helpful when you're pulling things up.

324
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:53,299
I think one of the struggles in environmental health is that a lot of them there's

325
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:57,830
like industrial environmental health and there's also environmental health,

326
00:28:57,830 --> 00:29:04,459
and then there's also ecology and ecosystem health and yeah, fall into things.

327
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:08,390
So it can be really frustrating. I know in our field especially,

328
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:11,689
I think HHS is probably the one degree program that I see the most difficulty

329
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:16,120
with that because also just environmental health means so many different things,

330
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:20,360
so many different companies, and they all don't have like a consistent definition.

331
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:23,770
Do you ever get up. Yeah, I was going to have and on that no.

332
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:29,240
Like I found some ones that are not public health necessarily but are like environmental.

333
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:40,490
Yeah. I think like should I go for that? Like kind of like when I go into a plant like things or should I like, yeah,

334
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:47,270
I think that's a good question because you'll see a lot of places that like e just like environmental health sciences isn't part of their work,

335
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:50,720
but it's like you could come work for Amazon in a position that's similar to that.

336
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:58,910
I think those are some really good places for students to intern. So yes, but yeah,

337
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:02,870
I think that is a huge thing and that's why I think it'll come down to really being particular

338
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:07,070
about your search and where you're searching and what keywords you're using when you go through.

339
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,950
And if that really stresses you out, that's a really good time to come in and have an appointment and be like,

340
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:16,609
Hey, I've been using this and I've been finding nothing and we can kind of move together.

341
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:22,790
I've never had a student walk out and be like, I still don't know what I'm searching for because usually we can figure out what

342
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:26,360
part of the search engine we can use or who you can talk to to figure that out.

343
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:31,970
I thought, I'm so getting through like half these slides, by the way.

344
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:36,379
All right. So there's lots of ways to find opportunities. We have all the search engines.

345
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:43,490
There's also networking, which is part of the packet. This is the second page on that tool that we handed out.

346
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:47,990
It can be a little bit intimidating. I will say now all these links are for everyone.

347
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:55,340
There's one on the tool that's not up here because I got into a portal with some bullet points today, but there is a really great resource.

348
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:59,330
If you're an international student, you have an international student brand. It's called Inner Stride.

349
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:03,450
It's really great. So if you're looking for an internship, you need sponsorship, things like that, inner stride.

350
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:08,630
It's going to be a great one for our international friends. Otherwise career portal.

351
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:11,660
Our career portal is going to be the first one I always stress to students.

352
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:15,950
It's going to be very public health center off to get. You're not going to have to use specific keywords.

353
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:20,600
Second one is going to be handshake. How many of you have used handshake? Cool.

354
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:25,280
I know it's pretty popular in most institutions too. So a lot of people come in and they're like, Oh, is that my undergrad?

355
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:30,350
Awesome handshake can be fun.

356
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:37,399
You do really got to use your keywords. Keywords are going to be friends. Filters are always going to be your friends on a handshake and make sure you

357
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,459
go in and you address because your first year this isn't as much a concern,

358
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:44,780
but make sure you fill out your little profile about what you're interested in and update that.

359
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:45,889
Unfortunately,

360
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:51,440
a lot of students who come in who are like seniors in undergrad and like they're a completely different person than when they were a freshman.

361
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,900
And it's like out of my they keep giving me like teaching jobs and like, oh,

362
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:58,219
maybe because you started out with like a teaching major, but you just never changed it.

363
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:02,420
So handshake is going to. Your friend saving applications in there.

364
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:07,970
I know it's still tough because sometimes it'll suggest jobs for you and it's like you should be a truck driver in Nebraska and you're like,

365
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,520
That's not at all in line with what I've been looking at.

366
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:15,229
But handshake, the more you use and the better the algorithm gets, definitely use the filters.

367
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:20,450
I think it can be good and it's still going to be a little bit more tailored than the open ocean resources.

368
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:26,120
Those are the two biggest ones and Compass is really good.

369
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:30,500
If you're looking for international type opportunities, they tend to gravitate towards undergraduate students.

370
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:34,280
We have career fairs and expos. The bigger ones.

371
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:40,760
The School of Public Health does not have a career fair yet, but next year we well, that's a huge plan that we're working on.

372
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:48,830
Otherwise there are there's one really big career fair in February for the whole university, so you can check that one out.

373
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:57,410
Otherwise, if you're looking for on campus opportunities, U of M student employment is going to be a place to go as well.

374
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:06,560
Those are the big ones you have affiliated handshake. The portal second section is going to be the open ocean one that's going to be LinkedIn.

375
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:11,270
You can search for jobs on LinkedIn if you have a profile. Definitely would suggest doing that.

376
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,020
The nice thing about LinkedIn, when you go to apply for jobs there,

377
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:22,610
it will have your education already linked up to your profile so you can say, oh, you know, 30 U of M alumni work at this company.

378
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:27,439
And it's nice. It's really easy for you to locate people I would show you.

379
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,850
But also I didn't go to U of M, so it has different logos on there that are not very popular in this town.

380
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:36,410
But you can look and see the alumni. You can also have company alumni too.

381
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:42,349
So if you had work experience before this, it can also say like, Oh, there's five previous company alumni that have worked here.

382
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:50,450
So LinkedIn's really good if you're trying to find specific people to connect with and if you're really interested in specific companies.

383
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:54,169
So maybe you don't know if they have internships or something, but you're like, Yes, I love what they do.

384
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:57,170
I'm interested. LinkedIn is a good place to connect with that company.

385
00:33:57,170 --> 00:34:01,940
Look at their page, see who works there, and maybe there's alumni we can start a conversation with.

386
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,870
You don't only have to talk to alumni, it's just really nice because you can do that thing where you're like,

387
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:14,000
Go blue and they're like, Oh my God, I got my island. It's just a lot easier to talk to alumni than just reaching out to people at random.

388
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:20,329
Indeed, is one of my favorites. I'm a big fan of it. You know, lots of students get internships and jobs.

389
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:24,680
I got this job out of it. It's shot up. So India is actually a good site.

390
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:27,710
You do have to use it. You don't have to create an account. I think it can help.

391
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:32,420
They have some good filters on there if you start to do your search,

392
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:37,640
which is another thing that we're probably not going to get to as far as frequency of searching,

393
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:43,820
I have some students who are like Type A and they're like, Yes, I want to do 4 hours of searching each week.

394
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:46,100
I'm going to do one on Monday, one on Tuesday, one on Thursday.

395
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:52,790
And then sometimes it's just every now and again I usually suggest to students try to do like once a week, try to find a class,

396
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:57,650
whether it's 20 minutes before this class, 20 minutes after another, try to find something you already routinely do.

397
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:01,849
And your search, you'll find the search engines you like, you'll figure out kind of a pattern.

398
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:08,720
You'll be like, and I'll start with the career portal. I'll look at handshake, a background to India, I look at USA Jobs.

399
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:15,350
The more you search, the more familiar you'll get with it. And it makes it easier because you'll start to see positions like, Oh,

400
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:21,440
that's all the new ones I'm good at and really good about that because it'll have you can filter by posts that have been jobs

401
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:28,450
that have been posted in the last like 72 hours or just helpful so big fan of indeed they also have really good commercials.

402
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:32,750
Um, but anyways, those are really good general ones.

403
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:40,309
And another one if you're interested in working for nonprofits, maybe some think tanks, maybe for online for policy work, idealist is really good.

404
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:44,900
That's kind of a sleeper for a lot of folks can pull that up.

405
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:53,929
I have one minute before we get to questions. It's behind by a minute.

406
00:35:53,930 --> 00:36:00,379
Okay. I will finish up soon. I just want to have actual time for questions because I tend to talk about, I mean, this that I feel this is really good.

407
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:03,230
It's better for full time jobs, but you can still find internships.

408
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:10,040
One thing that's really nice about idealist is if you're very issue oriented, you can search by issue area.

409
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,760
So like climate change, that's your time. They have none.

410
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:19,420
Oh, in Ann Arbor. Okay, so you should be able to search, too.

411
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:23,840
They have none anywhere. And your filter is on the top left under.

412
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:29,979
Like up a little bit higher than where it is.

413
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:36,370
It's just below. And then when I'm really good with my right and left.

414
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:43,050
But anyways, there tends to be a lot of smaller internships on here that don't get posted on larger spaces.

415
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:49,570
So if you're interested in specific issue area or interested in working in nonprofit foundation level type work,

416
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:53,350
you'll find some really interesting opportunities on here that don't tend to be elsewhere.

417
00:36:53,800 --> 00:37:00,010
So that's a good one. Share with your nonprofit friends. USA Jobs is good.

418
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:05,020
If you're applying for federal internships, those can be a doozy.

419
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:14,409
I know applying to federal positions can be really tough. My biggest suggestion is a read everything on the description,

420
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:19,560
even though it can be really confusing because it's like you need to be a source of energy and that can be tough.

421
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,680
There's ways to tackle that.

422
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:28,420
The number one thing to remember if you're applying for federal internship or position, is that they like the resume of a very specific way.

423
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:36,280
So when you go to apply to a federal position, they have a federal resume builder and they just tend to ask things that other places don't have.

424
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:41,169
Like you need to literally put on your resume that you're a U.S. citizen, you need to put months and certain ways.

425
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:44,170
You need to have your start date availability listed.

426
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,700
They ask for a couple of things that aren't common on other resumes.

427
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:54,670
So if you literally just put USA Jobs Resumé Builder, just use around my builder that they provide because they do look for specific things.

428
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:58,750
And unfortunately I will say the federal government, not everyone is going to have a person reading the recipe.

429
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,240
So a lot of those are going through technology systems.

430
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:08,620
And I want to point out to USA Jobs is a separate institution from who will actually be working.

431
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:15,850
Yeah. So there is like this extra layer of filter that goes through and it's tasty.

432
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:24,850
Yeah. So if you do find an internship that you really want at a federal place and you can contact someone at that institution,

433
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:30,070
they might be able to sort through some of their bureaucracy to see if they like you.

434
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,870
So just a hint there. So it can be tough.

435
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:37,270
So if you're really interested, you're like, Matty, I need to work for a federal department.

436
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:40,990
That's my dream. Probably a good thing to come in and talk to us about. You can have an appointment.

437
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:49,060
Otherwise, my world abroad can be good going global if you're really interested.

438
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:53,500
It's in many other areas, like I'm studying epidemiology. I want to work in like Belgium.

439
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:57,250
And I was like so specifically from Belgium and she's like, No. And I was like, okay.

440
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:03,880
Going global is a really good one. If you're interested in working internationally, I will say it's tougher to do that with internship sometimes.

441
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:06,099
Otherwise, there's a variety in here.

442
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:13,059
If you're really interested in specific things like bio pharmacy, medical devices, health administration, you can go through some of these boards.

443
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:20,709
They can be helpful. And then the last thing I will say to give us 5 minutes is do it yourself.

444
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:26,230
So networking. And that just means thinking about people that are in your network and that's a fun, nebulous term.

445
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:31,899
But thinking about people that, you know, whether it's your neighbor or your uncle or your uncle's neighbor, all those types of things.

446
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:35,980
If you have somebody who's doing work you're interested in, totally worth reaching out.

447
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:40,170
We have lots of resources about that. Just know it doesn't have to be super complex.

448
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:43,389
You're be like, Hey, I'm a first year graduate student, the University of Michigan, studying this.

449
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:47,770
I'm really interested in the work that you're doing at this company. It's the type of work I find valuable and important.

450
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:54,639
Do you have 10 to 15 minutes to connect? Your advisors and me have a lot of friends in different places.

451
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:58,780
Yeah. And so when you initially put on your little like dream internship,

452
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:07,690
I tried to think of anyone if you had something specific there that I knew of, so please, 100% connection.

453
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:13,090
And I know networking in itself is always stressful, but think about people.

454
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:18,340
If you have other fellow students, second years, if anyone is doing work you're interested in, in a company you're interested in,

455
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:21,430
it's worth reaching out and trying to connect with them or connecting with mentors,

456
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:25,569
supervisors, professors and being like, Hey, you're pretty important.

457
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:28,630
Do you know anyone doing this work? I'm really passionate about it and I want to do it.

458
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:34,240
Okay. Oh, the questions can turn into filters.

459
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:38,200
You'll get these slides later. We already did them on the careers portal.

460
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:41,710
I was going to give you time to explore. Unfortunately, that will not happen.

461
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:45,219
Explore on your own applying. We have resources on here.

462
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:48,129
I know you've already gone through that, but you can go to our Google Library at any time.

463
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:52,390
We have resume templates, cover letters, which I know can be the bane of some people's existence.

464
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:59,050
I'm a huge fan of cover letters. I would always love to talk to you about them thinking about your next steps.

465
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:05,650
This would be a time of reflection. But just think about after this presentation, you'd be like, okay, that crazy redhead talk really fast.

466
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:11,889
But I know my next step. I want to start my opportunity search or I want to find more companies,

467
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:17,800
or I want to find keywords trying to think about with your opportunity search you're looking for an internship.

468
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:21,010
Try to think about something tangible that you can do in the next couple of weeks.

469
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:24,489
And even if it's just make an appointment with our office, that's totally okay too.

470
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:27,730
We have a lot of students who. Make appointments with us.

471
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:32,660
We have drop in hours Mondays and that's not true. Wednesdays and Fridays from 1 to 4.

472
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:35,840
They're virtual, they're like 20 minute appointments. You can pop in, you'll talk to anyone.

473
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:41,270
It's kind of the Wild West, those you don't get to pick. We meet with like an appointment over, like, Hey, I want this presentation.

474
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:44,810
And my age passed and I got really stressed out. I just wanna talk to somebody about it.

475
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:49,100
You can come in for drop ins and we'll talk you through it. We do have workshops.

476
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:54,169
We have one upcoming tonight for navigating networking employer events coming up.

477
00:41:54,170 --> 00:42:00,020
And then our careers library is linked again. And I have a server for you all, but I'll send it later and please use the survey.

478
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:05,690
So if you're like, this was super helpful or this was super not helpful and we were hoping for something else, definitely let me know.

479
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:09,470
We're building our calendar for the spring. Okay.

480
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:12,410
I said a lot of things really fast, but I want to leave time for questions.

481
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:19,940
Anyone have something on their brain that they would like to ask for the good of the order?

482
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:26,120
Where's the nervous or confident meter now? Still nervous.

483
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:29,629
Oh, we got nervous, but inundated with information. All right.

484
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:33,020
Okay. Feeling a little better. That's an improvement, right?

485
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:41,690
Gladiator, like. Right, like, that's good if get this from the middle part. So I'm trying to think just an absolute is quite bad.

486
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:45,260
I don't know but I know that there.

487
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:48,870
The public health clinics had like a home that very short.

488
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:52,410
Yeah, exactly. They weren't meeting like we promised.

489
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:56,180
They're coming like, yeah, I wasn't there.

490
00:42:56,190 --> 00:43:00,990
You know, unfortunately, I'm on the outskirts of that. Yeah. One side of the house.

491
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:06,419
I do have a mentorship program. I watch my my graduate school to have something like that.

492
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:07,300
And it was terrible, was worse.

493
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:11,640
I got paired with like the, like the shop while I was doing research, which was like, I'm available for like two or four.

494
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:13,530
I was like, cool. I never got the time.

495
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:19,380
But I think the management program here is very top out and should be really good, so hopefully that'll happen soon.

496
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:23,310
Yeah, I think they were originally supposed to have on Monday we got an email.

497
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:27,299
Yeah, they're coming out today so hopefully they are both on me.

498
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,490
Really cool programs are this school.

499
00:43:29,490 --> 00:43:35,370
But when I was like way cool all in my favorite ending on I ah particularly the most motivated that I've ever worked with on higher end.

500
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:40,499
I also come from liberal arts, so any other thoughts?

501
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:43,979
I'm trying to think of the general suggestions I give to students for internships.

502
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:48,030
Besides, you will find one. It will be good.

503
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:55,740
We will help you take steps to do that. Over the summer you have to register your internship and we send out supportive emails.

504
00:43:56,430 --> 00:44:02,370
I don't know if I'll be sending them. You'll definitely know if it's me. But you will have support throughout the summer internship too.

505
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:04,889
That'll be like, Hey, now's a good time to add this to your resume.

506
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:08,910
I haven't had time to touch base with a supervisor if you want to continue working with them,

507
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:14,729
so you'll have support after you register your internship. And because we're having this conversation now,

508
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:19,020
that's a really good sign that you won't be coming in the last week in April looking for an internship,

509
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:25,830
which even if you did, we'd still be able to work with him, so. Okay, let's go to 1220.

510
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:30,840
We have 2 minutes feel. Can we thank Maddie?

511
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:38,110
I think we're going to try to have her back next semester to help out with networking and professionalism.

512
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:42,030
Her stations as you guys go forward into your internship.

513
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:46,439
Thank you so much for coming. Yeah, 100% we do.

514
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:49,889
We're kind of like wrapping up class here really rapidly.

515
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:59,040
So over the next couple weeks, I know you guys have a lot of class work that you're going to be doing and thinking about finals and all of that stuff.

516
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,080
And that's all very exciting. But also.
