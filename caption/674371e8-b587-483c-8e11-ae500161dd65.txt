Hello. I'm Dr. Rob Davidson.

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:10,940
I'm an emergency physician at Gerber Hospital in Freemont, also a graduate student in the School of Public Health at the University of Michigan.

3
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:17,690
Happy to be here! Before the new Waco County Board of Commissioners to talk about a subject about which I'm very passionate

4
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:23,480
that affects the lives of the people that I've been taking care of for 20 years in this community.

5
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:32,870
I'm here tonight to talk to you about climate change. Although climate change seems like a far off threat that affects people very far down the road,

6
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:38,270
I'm here to say that climate change is something impacting the health of the people of Newaygo County.

7
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:45,950
This very day, and this is something that the Newaygo County Board of Commissioners needs to continue to address in order to protect

8
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:52,700
the lives of the people that you are representing and the people that I've been treating for nearly two decades,

9
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,410
in particular in Newaygo County.

10
00:00:54,410 --> 00:01:04,940
We have a large agricultural workforce, a lot of farms in this county, and climate change does impact people involved in agriculture.

11
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:13,200
With global warming, we have significant higher numbers of extreme weather events that in fact, impacts crop yields.

12
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,040
When we have early warmer spells in the late parts of winter, you may have budding that.

13
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,740
Then we have destruction of crops through frost cycles that happen in the early spring,

14
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,860
therefore impacting the livelihoods of the people in this community.

15
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:34,970
And we know that income does directly impact people's health and other aspects of climate

16
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:41,540
change that can affect people's health directly include extreme heat and extreme cold.

17
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:52,400
Colder temperatures at night have been increasing throughout the Upper Midwest, resulting in the use of of heating devices in homes more frequently.

18
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:59,900
We frequently see people in the emergency department with respiratory illnesses like asthma and COPD and emphysema,

19
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:06,680
who use wood burners and who are negatively impacted by sometimes the smoke from these wood burners in their homes.

20
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:16,190
We're also seeing people who have concerns of exposure people with with housing that is somewhat limited or is that that is at risk.

21
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:18,980
And with colder nights with more extreme temperatures in the winter,

22
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:27,440
those people are at risk of exposure and hypothermia and something we definitely see in this community throughout the winter months.

23
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,750
And so I'm here today again to tell you that climate change is not something that affects other people,

24
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,460
not something that only affects people on the coasts.

25
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:40,280
And that's something that only affects people in other places are only going to affect people decades from now.

26
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:47,330
Climate change is something impacting the people in this county today. It is something that we need to address as the county and the county board

27
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:50,540
of Commissioners need to address and also need to push upstream to the state

28
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:54,380
legislature to make this a priority in the state to help protect those folks

29
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:58,724
that I'm here to care for and that you are charged with representing things.
