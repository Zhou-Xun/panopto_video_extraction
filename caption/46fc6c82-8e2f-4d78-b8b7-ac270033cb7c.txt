Hi, everyone, and welcome back to Episode 640. This is week two, and in week two, we're going to be talking about how to bring data sets in to SAS.

2
00:00:11,247 --> 00:00:18,057
Now, as you recall from last week, epidemiology is a quantitative science at its core, right?

3
00:00:18,057 --> 00:00:28,157
We rely upon mounds of data in order to understand causal questions of interest between some sort of exposure risk factor,

4
00:00:28,157 --> 00:00:40,317
you know, characteristic and health. So in this particular week, I'm going to show you how it is that we bring in external data sources into SAS.

5
00:00:40,317 --> 00:00:42,117
We're going to start really simple, actually.

6
00:00:42,117 --> 00:00:49,917
So this particular week is the only week where I'm going to show you how to use what's called a graphical user interface or a GUI,

7
00:00:49,917 --> 00:00:55,887
which is basically a menu driven system in order to program in SAS.

8
00:00:55,887 --> 00:01:02,967
When you're bringing in data sets in the real world, I strongly recommend that you use this approach in the next week.

9
00:01:02,967 --> 00:01:09,597
I'm going to teach you more details about how to actually code bringing in data sets in great detail.

10
00:01:09,597 --> 00:01:13,347
But I have to admit that that's one of my least favorite things to program in SAS.

11
00:01:13,347 --> 00:01:20,997
And so whenever it is possible to use this graphical interface, I strongly recommend it.

12
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:25,527
So in terms of learning objectives for what you can expect during this week,

13
00:01:25,527 --> 00:01:32,607
I'm going to show you different types of external file types that you might want to read into SAS.

14
00:01:32,607 --> 00:01:38,037
Again, I'll be showing you how to use that gooey to bring datasets into SAS.

15
00:01:38,037 --> 00:01:48,858
And then I'm going to show you how to store SAS files onto your computer so you can find them later and use them.
