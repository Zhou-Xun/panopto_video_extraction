1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:11,350
Yeah. And then also if somebody could, you know, check the Panopto recordings after class just to make sure that they're working.

2
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:17,670
That would be absolutely lovely. But my name is Abraham Wagner.

3
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,020
I'm a research assistant professor. Like I said, I've had this class for a few years now,

4
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:32,040
and I'm really excited for it to be in person and for us to be talking with each other once a week about advanced epidemiological methods.

5
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:39,000
This is you know, I've tried a few classes in the department and honestly, this is one of my favorite ones to teach.

6
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:49,580
Um, but how I would like to start is for you to come up with a group name.

7
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:57,870
Like a group name. Um, so, like something that is a pun on something epidemiology or public health related.

8
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,410
Um, you know, talk among yourself and find something.

9
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,570
I could give you suggestions from previous years, but I kind of want you to think about it.

10
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:14,760
And then on the opposite side of the of the tag, if you write your name in,

11
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:20,470
I guess I have one that should be kind of there, but otherwise, you know, feel free to do yourself.

12
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:23,879
I'll give you a couple of minutes to come up with something and then we'll go around.

13
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:35,740
And if you. So.

14
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:50,060
Anything. Okay.

15
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:11,250
Now. They don't.

16
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,740
You just sit down. And.

17
00:02:51,530 --> 00:03:09,380
This. But I did.

18
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:39,250
On for.

19
00:03:51,310 --> 00:04:03,370
Stop all this. Everyone has their.

20
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:29,080
And. Okay.

21
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:34,570
It looks like most of you have your group names. So I will.

22
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:40,989
Why don't we have something where you know what your group grouping is, and then just, like,

23
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:50,889
quickly go around, say your name, what program you are in, and yeah, let's just go for their pronouns.

24
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:55,360
So we'll start with you. So in our country.

25
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:01,820
Air culture is important. And I think you are.

26
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:10,350
Yeah. Yeah, I'm here. In the future, the Panopto will start.

27
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:18,970
They take it. And then you are basically.

28
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,880
I know nobody is. But I would love.

29
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:31,480
The first set of bacteria that Dr.

30
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:36,340
All right. That poor guy.

31
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:52,200
So I is. Yeah. So I actually came over and tried to have daughter.

32
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:58,350
Okay. I know. And I know that. Okay.

33
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:15,280
Here's where you have more than a third of the fact that we are living in this category.

34
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:23,650
I think I think that.

35
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:33,140
I in into that. Oh and then also I've been so negative in introducing her but a very important person,

36
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:38,260
his classes are he is cited here and I don't know if you want to say anything about yourself.

37
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:42,980
Oh, I love them. And then they do.

38
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:50,100
All they have is literally because I started becoming so famous.

39
00:06:50,260 --> 00:07:00,460
Their. Yeah. And just to just let you know, she will be your GSI for 634 and then also 643, which most of you will also be taking.

40
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:10,710
So you'll hear about her a lot this semester. But the other thing you report is you're not free to go there.

41
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,030
I'm yeah, I'm okay.

42
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:19,190
I'm just I'm ready to go.

43
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:25,000
Go there. And her speech.

44
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:31,420
Yeah. We ask our friends to go the.

45
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:38,940
They already have the strength to be here to tell me out.

46
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:44,950
But it's all there is to carry on.

47
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:51,630
My name is Ali tonight. And I'm from.

48
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:01,570
And yet we're struggling with this is.

49
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:10,780
Oh, I'm see. I'm about.

50
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,860
And I have. Okay. And then over here.

51
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:24,200
So largely, he likes them very much, in my words.

52
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:30,820
Okay. Why are you trying to tell me you're in the market?

53
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:38,230
By the way, I'm also. Here.

54
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:46,540
James Madison. Yes, I.

55
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,600
Have. And more and.

56
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:02,810
I wanted to be when I heard you talking to my husband about, like what? Every night. You know, I thought I had spoken.

57
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:12,069
Exactly. You always get, like, fast. For what it is.

58
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:17,290
Your grandfather really felt that you were part of that.

59
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:24,350
And I know how hard how.

60
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:32,380
And finally. So what? Fantastic.

61
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:42,860
Hi, Jordan. Okay.

62
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:45,520
Thank you for this quick round of introductions.

63
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:51,070
I would say probably for the next couple of weeks, I might be like meandered around staring at you and staring at the cards.

64
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:55,810
I'm sorry about awkward, but it's just, you know, the best way for me to get to know your names.

65
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:10,810
Yes. Okay. So today we are I am just going to introduce this class did the expectations for this class and then we will dove into the material.

66
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:15,850
But it'll probably be a bit you know, we're we're easing into it.

67
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:19,450
So this is kind of a simple one thing.

68
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:23,800
I do record attendance for this class. I'm going into attendance policies in a moment.

69
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:31,000
But the link at the beginning of class is for you to sign in is this link.

70
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:35,649
Here it is. Paul ABC.com.

71
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:46,900
Abraham Wagner. April 4th. I was just the default they gave me. And so when you do log in, be sure to like click through everything and hit submit.

72
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:54,730
I just want to make sure that we get it recorded and I'm not exactly sure how pull every word does this.

73
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:01,930
We will all be downloading this after every week and then we might be using the theme link.

74
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:11,300
So I know in the past some students have asked questions like, I think there's something in poll everywhere where you can like clear your data.

75
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,469
That's that doesn't matter. That's totally fine because I just download it every week.

76
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:21,670
So I don't need any past data in it. But yeah, if you could do that right now, that would be fabulous.

77
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:35,490
Let me know if you ever have any troubles with that. There is this.

78
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:53,210
Feeling sorry.

79
00:11:54,370 --> 00:12:04,020
You feel like. Oh, it's like you know that you have three or you of 40 decisions to make you start.

80
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:13,909
They could also put this on campus. I might do that after class, but this is so and so.

81
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:17,480
There's no like link for you to click. You have to hit it.

82
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:23,030
I do realize that not everybody likes bringing their laptop to class, and if you do, that's wonderful.

83
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:30,649
But I will try to email you links ahead of time so that if you want to, you know, there's not much you'll have to do.

84
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:37,880
But if you ever have to log on to their tab quick with your smartphone, you can just like look at that announcement that I sent the day previous.

85
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:49,810
Also this room has, I think, horrible acoustics. Like for one person talking, it kind of sounds nice, but it does get like really rowdy.

86
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:58,299
I'm sorry about that. And then also, if you are I think me talking here, hopefully you are able to hear me.

87
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:04,600
If ever you can't, please raise your hand and let me know. But sometimes it's hard for you to hear other students.

88
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,010
So don't feel bad about just like yelling and screaming at me.

89
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:15,520
Otherwise I can kind of come towards you and figure out your problem. Okay.

90
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:36,260
Okay. So episode six for for Contemporary Methods, you and Avery Wagner.

91
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:41,840
You can just call me Abraham if you want to call me Dr. Wagner. Professor Wagner, that's totally fine.

92
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:48,800
I have my office hours are still going to be all on Zoom.

93
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:57,860
I just have like a Google calendar appointment thoughts for everybody, but I will be like at my computer during those time.

94
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,499
So you don't need to register ahead of time.

95
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:06,780
Like if you look and see that I'm available and it's that hour, you can log on to zoom and I will be there.

96
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:13,310
But you know, I encourage you to use the office hours, you know, to tackle your homework,

97
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:18,500
to talk about, you know, any issues you're having with the program.

98
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:25,970
I consider kind of like a drop in thing where if you just want to introduce yourself and chat, I'm all for I'm all for that.

99
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:38,150
So I'm a on the research professor track, which I don't think that impacts you too much, but I am in since I'm non tenure track, I am in the lectures.

100
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:44,780
So all people who instruct in our department who are not tenure track are part of the lectures.

101
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:54,470
Okay, so I'd like you at the beginning of the semester, just like we reintroduce some basic things, some,

102
00:14:54,590 --> 00:15:01,069
some lifestyle hacks, maybe just as it were, you know, you realize that these things are out there.

103
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:05,900
So there is a variety of counseling and psychological services offered to students.

104
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,450
Please see them and use them a lot.

105
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:17,239
Like I. I started therapy during the pandemic and I think it has had such a beneficial

106
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:22,070
impact on my life and I hope that more people take advantage of things like that.

107
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:29,010
You know, as the perpetrators were mentioning, it can be expensive being a graduate student.

108
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,190
There are food pantries across campus.

109
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,620
It's an example of one I'm sure Googling around you be able to find others.

110
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:44,030
So also take advantage of those. Now, zooming in on this, how is it going to work?

111
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:50,390
I know that most of you have probably taken two other module classes previously in the spring semester,

112
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:59,479
the winter semester, and I think the module classes have like a lot of important information in them.

113
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,540
And that's why we as a department have like specify these different classes.

114
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:08,540
I know that many students have some disagreements about them being like one credit

115
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:14,540
and there's like confusion about like how much work should be put into the class.

116
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:18,229
But the thing is, each of the maverick classes are separate, they are different instructors.

117
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:21,740
So there could be potentially different expectations for what students are doing.

118
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:25,520
And that's what I'm going to be coming up to today. So we have our class today.

119
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:32,360
I'll let you out at 250. Um, do you all have a class like right before this?

120
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:40,820
Okay, it seems that there is like, you know, a bunch of people came in. One, feel free to bring in food.

121
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:49,100
That's totally fine. I think this is actually one of the rooms on campus where we are able legally to have food.

122
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:59,239
You know, I'm not feel free to like, you know, stretch your legs, go to the bathroom, run around the school.

123
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,660
You know, if you just need to take a bit of a break, that's totally fine.

124
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:08,360
I'll try to have at least like a five, ten minute break in the class in the middle.

125
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,880
I think that's important. Just like get a stretch.

126
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:23,450
I know 2 hours is like a lot to be getting all of this stuff and interact and at some point they might finish class a bit early.

127
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:27,200
But I don't know in the first couple of weeks that doesn't happen. Okay.

128
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:38,990
So what I have is I have the assignments are due most weeks there will be a homework assignment that will be due Sunday evening.

129
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:45,110
And that is because I have who tune in.

130
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:51,280
I will look through some of your assignments on Monday and I just like to be able to have that.

131
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:55,490
So then on Tuesday I can talk with any issues that are coming up,

132
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:59,300
but otherwise you should probably get a grade for your assignments within one week of submitting them.

133
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:08,330
But we just take it on Sunday so we have a bit of time for us to discuss any issues that are coming up before most classes.

134
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:12,980
With the exception of today, there is a reading quiz which is due right before class.

135
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:17,090
So, you know, and it's not designed to be anything super difficult.

136
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:22,200
I just want to make sure that you are, you know, at least skimming through the articles and hopefully reading them.

137
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:25,550
They have some interesting article for you this year for this semester.

138
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:33,069
The work itself. You know, I'll just have you worked on it this weekend and see what you think.

139
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:38,620
But it's a lot of it is designed to go over material that we talk about in class.

140
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:47,059
So again, the class structure every week, there's sort of like a new contemporary method that we talk about again today

141
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:50,440
is a bit more of like an easing in and an introduction to the class structure.

142
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:56,410
But you'll read a paper about that method and then during class we will discuss that more in depth.

143
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:00,700
And then it's not just going to be straight talking at you for 2 hours.

144
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:05,140
It'll be me talking briefly. And then I have some small group work, and then there'll be some like bounceback.

145
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:17,560
And then afterwards there is a homework assignment and oftentimes it involves you working through some coding related to that topic.

146
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:20,950
But you know, this isn't a coding class per say.

147
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:25,900
I'm not trying to trip you up with the coding like I really am holding your hand through the assignment.

148
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:35,110
Um, and, you know, we'll talk more about this next week, but, you know, if you are getting really flustered with the homework,

149
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:44,350
that is an excellent reason to reach out to me or to Hanan, because the homework isn't designed to be tricky.

150
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:53,680
It's much more designed for you to understand, like, how you would go about putting something and then also you interpreting it.

151
00:19:53,680 --> 00:20:00,430
That's probably the even more important part, and I have code for half an hour on canvas,

152
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:04,000
but if you want, you could use whatever statistical program you want.

153
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:09,399
Very agnostic about that. Okay.

154
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:18,400
So the point of this class I want to introduce or maybe reintroduce some contemporary methods,

155
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:26,890
a lot of these you've probably heard about in previous classes, but I'm here to, you know, maybe put a different spin on it.

156
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:34,899
Uh, one thing that maybe I'd like to mention is that, you know, at this point in time, you're second year epidemiology students.

157
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:41,799
You're all very, um, you're all very smart and intelligent and great and you're getting to the point,

158
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:46,390
especially in a class like this, where there might be disagreements between experts in the field.

159
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:51,690
So I might say something and it might sound a bit different than how you're talking or

160
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:56,830
how it's been said in another class or how you might hear about it from somebody else.

161
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,790
I'll try to point those out when there's substantial disagreements about something.

162
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:05,049
But, um, I think that's just important to do all of that.

163
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:12,580
And that's just part of where we are, as I feel like not everything is super sensitive and there's a lot of great areas.

164
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:17,500
But, you know, throughout this week we'll be talking about generalized linear models.

165
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:21,750
We'll be talking about causal inference, specifically using marginal structure models.

166
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:26,709
We're talking about mediators consider bias analysis, meta analysis.

167
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:31,090
And then we also have one guest lecture on mathematical modeling.

168
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:39,070
And throughout all of this, I do want to have, you know, a reflection on the culture of epidemiology.

169
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:47,410
I'm a firm believer that, you know, in the long term science, as we have it in terms of, you know, making observations,

170
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:54,670
developing hypotheses, running experiments, um, I think that that's like a great way of learning about the world.

171
00:21:54,670 --> 00:22:01,180
But like, our methods are often imbued with racism, with certain biases.

172
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:05,940
And I want us to be cognizant of that. So I will be bringing that up from time to time.

173
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:16,139
Okay. So I would at the beginning of each class, you know, each class they teach each semester.

174
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:23,070
I like students to be able to just like give me brief feedback.

175
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:31,200
So I'm going to give you like a couple of minutes just on your own to write some feedback.

176
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:37,980
For me, this is in it, so I know this is a really long URL, but this should also be in an email that I sent you.

177
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:42,690
So please click on that link. If you don't have access to the Google doc, please let me know.

178
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:48,870
Um, but you should be able to log in to your the University of Michigan credentials and view it.

179
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:55,919
Um, and again, this is, you know, if you feel self-conscious about writing stuff right now,

180
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:01,139
you could I'll just look at this later this week and really next week and talk to you about it before class.

181
00:23:01,140 --> 00:24:06,340
But I want to give you some time right now to put down some of your thoughts. She?

182
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:56,880
I think this is really, really good. Feel free to continue editing this and adding on to it over the next bit of time.

183
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:04,510
I want us to go into our first small group discussion.

184
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:12,180
So how this works is that I have a computer, I have documents, and it's meant to be relatively collaborative.

185
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:15,569
So within your groups, you know, you all could be editing it.

186
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:23,820
It could just be one person. But it's it's like also kind of a reference for you to look back on later if you need to.

187
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:32,880
But again, this isn't a link in the email that I sent you, or I guess it's in this notes thing that I have for the PowerPoint.

188
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:39,670
But if you click it, basically you'll get few, just like a list of all the different groups.

189
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:46,080
It actually could be nice if like one person in each group just renames the folder,

190
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:56,640
keep it as like group aid or whatever, but then afterwards like add a dash and then write what your new group name is.

191
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:05,610
But then within that there are discussion guides for each week.

192
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:20,370
So when you open that up, there should be like a a worksheet that you can fill out for each the small group discussions that we have during class.

193
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:28,440
And so yeah, we're going on to our first one, which is thinking back to research.

194
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:33,090
You've done two internships or maybe thinking about like what jobs you'd want to get in the future.

195
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:37,770
What are some epidemiological methods that you'd like to learn more about?

196
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:42,600
And then is there something that really makes sense in a previous class?

197
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:54,900
So I guess this is something for you to kind of discuss as a group and then to have, you know, one person or more to take notes on what you say.

198
00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:01,319
You know, I do kind of briefly skim through these. I don't like look at these like so much in depth.

199
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:04,650
This is more so a record for you, not for me.

200
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:11,850
So, you know, I don't take attendance by this or anything, but, you know, just view this as a document that you can use.

201
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:17,730
And then another thing is that after we come back from like a small group, I mean,

202
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:24,990
I probably won't go to like every group and I might pick out a few groups just to talk about what some of you have said.

203
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:34,540
So maybe like each time you have a small group discussion, you have in mind like somebody in your group who can respond to a question for you,

204
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:41,190
like, I'm never going to call out and be like Maria or T like, can you answer this question?

205
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:45,540
But I might call your group and be like the disease. What do you think about this?

206
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:49,950
So we'll be there can be just like somebody in that group to answer.

207
00:30:50,580 --> 00:31:02,790
But I will just give you a couple minutes because we could spend like forever on this, but we'll come back like at 147, 148 to with.

208
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:45,890
Her. The U.S., France, Britain.

209
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:09,010
Was. That was jobs.

210
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:58,110
Up. Oh.

211
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:06,800
The President. You know.

212
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:19,340
I. Yeah.

213
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:39,440
I believe that. The.

214
00:33:49,440 --> 00:34:04,540
I'd like to think that. I.

215
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:51,080
Hey, guys. I that.

216
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:08,770
Yeah. Yeah, I love that.

217
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:39,500
Yeah, you're right. And that is.

218
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,120
99 of.

219
00:35:52,280 --> 00:36:02,900
All. Okay.

220
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:07,120
I'll bring that all together. Thank you for writing this down.

221
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:12,880
I don't think I'm gonna call 903 now for this because you all have a keen interest in different things to say.

222
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:19,840
But I don't feel like collecting this because I like to provide feedback to the department on where we're at with everything.

223
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,360
This year I'm on the curriculum committee,

224
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:26,950
so we are planning on making changes to the courses and feedback like this is actually really important for us.

225
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:31,660
Okay, let's move on.

226
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:37,960
Unless somebody had like a question right now or something strong, they want to say.

227
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:47,080
Absolutely. We are expected to finish this post.

228
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:54,089
Nope, nope, nope. This is just for you. Again,

229
00:36:54,090 --> 00:37:00,299
I want you to it basically is a like a starting point of conversation for you to

230
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:05,040
have within your group and then just for you to be able to jot your own notes down.

231
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:10,660
In the past, pre-pandemic, I was like, print up all these copies together, like one per group.

232
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:18,000
But then it got kind of like messy and, um, but this way it's like they're.

233
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,399
And some of the stuff might help you with, like, homework that you do.

234
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:25,400
So just like, taking notes on it with your group throughout class can be useful, but you don't need to submit it.

235
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:31,770
Okay. So how does this class work for one?

236
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:36,890
Attendance in this class is required, but how does that work?

237
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:43,139
I do give you one freebie where you don't you come in.

238
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:47,460
But then after that a third deducting points from your overall grade.

239
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:59,760
And how I do that is listed out in the service. Of course, if you have some reason not to be in class, like I can excuse things, um, you know,

240
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:03,480
if there's something that you know about ahead of time, you should tell me ahead of time.

241
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:07,530
But if there's an emergency, you. You can tell me after the fact.

242
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:15,600
I remember there's one day I was sitting in my office and a student knocked on my door and she said, No, I have a concussion.

243
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:23,010
Do I need to be coming to class today? And it's like you definitely tell me, like go to the ER like go do your thing.

244
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:31,020
You can notify me later. That's totally fine. Um, but otherwise I do, you know, expect you to be here.

245
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:36,989
And I think what I realized over the course of the pandemic and whatnot is that, you know,

246
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:44,340
I think some students do well with asynchronous learning and like watching recordings and whatnot, but I think that's hard for a lot of people.

247
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:44,879
And honestly,

248
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:53,970
this class is 2 hours long and like I would not wish upon my worst enemy to like view a lecture recording for 2 hours is a way to learn material.

249
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:58,680
Like, that's not the greatest, you know, that's not best practices and online learning and things like that.

250
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:05,490
But that's just how the first step is that, you know, if you do have an excuse for absence,

251
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:12,540
I'll give you information about how to make up those attendance plans. So that's kind of like something that we'll do and, you know, 1 to 1 basis.

252
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,620
Any questions about attendance? Yeah.

253
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:24,000
So I was interested. Was.

254
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:34,780
Um. I don't. I mean, we were told by our chair prior to coming to this that.

255
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,970
So your question is like whether we can repair attendance or not?

256
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:53,290
Yeah, first look, first of all, I think first of all, the service providers are concerned about water and it continues.

257
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:59,090
Yeah, I guess that's a good point. I mean, I could look at,

258
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:08,140
but I think everything in my for this is in line with like what information I got from my chair prior to coming when we had a faculty retreat,

259
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:17,140
um, earlier in the year. And uh, I think one of the things that we really talked about was attendance.

260
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:24,580
And I, you know, I don't know what your experience has been over the pandemic period, but it starts off with like everybody in the classroom.

261
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:28,660
But then if you don't require attendance, it's like, oh, then there's good people.

262
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:33,850
So I think what we're trying to do is just like negotiate between a few different things.

263
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:40,659
But of course, like if you have a reason not to be here in your home, you know,

264
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:47,320
if you've had some exposure for COVID or monkeypox or something like that, you know, we can figure something else out.

265
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:57,260
But you feel free to follow up if you. You know, I'm not trying to gaslight you about the attendance stuff.

266
00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:02,150
I see. I think that I don't know if necessarily things have changed, but, like the emphases have maybe been different.

267
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:12,920
Okay, so assignments again, I'll give you some base code in staff two hour, but feel free to use something else if you want.

268
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:20,690
Uh, basically, I just have, like, holes in the code and then you, like, put some information in, like, about a variable.

269
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:29,270
And again, it's very hand holding and then you output your results and then basically their assignment is you interpreting those results.

270
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:34,660
So assignments can totally be done collaboratively.

271
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:42,320
You can work on it with your classmates. I think that can be a great way to get to the homework, but you need to submit your own work.

272
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,699
And I think most people kind of have an idea of what that is.

273
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:55,729
But like you can't just have a classmates email you their homework assignment that you upload it like, oh, that's you.

274
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:59,900
You need to like substantially contribute to your learning of the material.

275
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:04,940
But again, I'm happy to have you work on that with your classmates.

276
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:15,710
Okay. So how, um, homework assignment submissions work is that you can submit assignments up to 40 hours late.

277
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:17,360
Over across all of your assignments.

278
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:24,380
So, you know, you could submit this first assignment 40 hours late and then every other assignment you could submit one hour late.

279
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:31,810
And that would be like under the 42 hours. So you'd be totally fine. You can submit like each assignment 40 times.

280
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:37,280
I think sometimes people have questions about that. You do not need to notify me or the GSA.

281
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:45,649
And honestly, a lot of this is to limit students who in the past they have students that like 1201 in email would be like,

282
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:49,850
Oh, I was 2 minutes late submitting my assignment. That that's totally fine.

283
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:53,660
So I don't need to know about that. The GSA doesn't need to know about that.

284
00:42:54,080 --> 00:43:02,209
Um, again, if you think there will be something in excess of the 40 hours and you have something that's excusable,

285
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:06,190
please email me and we can, we can talk through that.

286
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:12,350
But if you submit assignments after this point, you'll be docked 25 points.

287
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:17,150
So I'm not trying to, like super penalize you for submitting stuff.

288
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:19,129
Like, I do want you to learn the material.

289
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:24,080
It's just the problem is that if you are late with one assignment, then you're probably gonna be late at the next one.

290
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:28,040
And there's sort of like a snowball effect of you just getting behind on a lot of the material.

291
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:32,780
Um, but there's other things like if you didn't get to something one week,

292
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:37,910
you can submit it by the end of class and you could still have up to 75% of your grade.

293
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:45,690
Yeah. So it's like a cumulative effect according to lifetime.

294
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,200
Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Cumulative accrued lifetime of.

295
00:43:56,230 --> 00:44:02,290
But the final exam and the reading quiz are kind of due for those periods.

296
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:09,490
For one, the final exam that we do on the date that you start your next class 643 And I just

297
00:44:09,490 --> 00:44:16,090
want I want you to have everything done before going into doctor business class.

298
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:26,160
Like, I don't want you to have like more stuff here. Yeah. Yeah.

299
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:30,120
So if you it after 48 hours, you would be down 25 points.

300
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:40,400
Is that your question? Oh, I think it's supposed to be 25 points.

301
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:45,070
Yeah, there was a there was a new version which I might not have uploaded, but yeah.

302
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:48,600
Thank you for coming out with that. So 25 points is what it should.

303
00:44:55,010 --> 00:44:59,180
Okay. So, you know, I want this to be a learning class.

304
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:08,210
So if you had points taken off, you can often make up those points and there's instructions for how to do that in canvas.

305
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:16,010
There's like a tab about point make up and basically those that assignment is just do at the end of this half semester.

306
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:19,459
So, um, you know, there's a due date on that.

307
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:25,280
So you could, I mean, you could do this every week or you could wait till the end in the fall through all of your homework assignments.

308
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:30,020
Um, but you can get some things.

309
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:42,020
The other thing about assignments to the union is going to be the primary person who will be grading the assignment.

310
00:45:42,590 --> 00:45:51,530
I have given her a rubric to use with grading, but, you know, she has like a bit of latitude,

311
00:45:51,530 --> 00:46:00,079
but primarily will be adhering to that rubric that I give my my one contention with all this is,

312
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:04,670
though, that if you have a question about grading, you primarily should be talking to me about that, not you.

313
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:10,970
So if it's like an issue of like G on added up your point flag, of course you could talk to her,

314
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:15,800
but you know, and of course you could talk to her even about like I just don't understand this question.

315
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:23,780
Could we need to talk about that? That that's totally fine. But if your question is like, why did I get three points off but not five points five,

316
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:27,200
that's a question you can direct with me and I'm happy to have those conversations.

317
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:35,960
But I just I want to block you in from having these questions about like why you get third grade,

318
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:41,690
because in the end, it's me who doesn't get to hear for how to grade stuff.

319
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:51,500
Any questions on assignments? Okay.

320
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:58,559
So the final exam is the thing that I will open it up the last week of class.

321
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:02,730
It's basically just the canvas. With this you need a complete on your own.

322
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:08,580
So a homework assignments you can do it. Classmates final exam you should be doing by yourself.

323
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:16,920
Um, but you know, you have a long period of time to be three answering it.

324
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:22,530
It's open notes, obviously. It's open internet, but just don't talk to people about it.

325
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:27,600
So obviously, like, I cannot police the nitty gritty of it.

326
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:33,570
You know, I'm not going to be breathing down your neck to see like, are you working on the final exam with another student or not?

327
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:42,710
I'm not going to be, you know, looking over your shoulder to see if you did just copy a student's homework and paraphrase it.

328
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:47,340
You know, those are things that, like, I don't have control over who you and doesn't have control over,

329
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:51,330
but we're going to try to treat you as adults as much as possible.

330
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:58,230
And part of the thinking of this is like how these things work in the real world and how do things work in the real world.

331
00:47:58,230 --> 00:48:04,200
And generally you will get to a place where you will have a very collaborative, team based environment.

332
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:11,429
They think that's like anybody in public health. So that's kind of what the homework assignments replicate is that you can talk

333
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:15,780
with other people about problems that you're seeing in the work environment.

334
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:19,260
But the final exam,

335
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:28,290
the idea behind that is more so like what are some basic sets of information that you should

336
00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:34,810
be able to kind of rattle off as a student of epidemiology that you want to have to look at?

337
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:39,990
So those are kind of like more of the big picture ideas that I would expect you to know.

338
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:47,840
But I do think that it's important to talk about ethics in public health because, you know,

339
00:48:47,850 --> 00:48:58,140
I think we are behaviors over our lifetime kind of influence, how we will act in the future and our ethics are part of this.

340
00:48:58,530 --> 00:49:07,500
So unfortunately, we've seen in the past some kind of shady things happen in the field of public health, numerous examples of COVID 19.

341
00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:16,590
But I also think through, you know, the Flint water crisis, which was like six or seven years ago,

342
00:49:17,490 --> 00:49:23,640
there were people in environmental health departments, public health departments kind of covering up through that the data.

343
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:28,499
And I just feel very uncomfortable with things like that.

344
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:36,450
And I have this belief that we like inculcate our sense of ethics in ourselves and, you know,

345
00:49:36,450 --> 00:49:41,639
the type of person who is more likely to be like cheating on his homework assignment for these final exams.

346
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:50,040
I worry that they'd be the people who would like go out into the real world and, you know, operate unethically in their jobs and in public health.

347
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:53,010
That can mean people getting sick and having people die.

348
00:49:53,100 --> 00:50:00,180
So not to be super morbid about it, but this is all to say that, you know, I'm treating you as adults.

349
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:04,649
I respect what you're able to do.

350
00:50:04,650 --> 00:50:08,700
I think you all come to this with a lot of different experiences and a lot of different knowledge.

351
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:16,950
And for many of these topics, I'm sure you have like a great deep understanding and let's just work on the material together.

352
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:22,329
And I'm not here to micromanage how you do this. Any questions on ethics?

353
00:50:22,330 --> 00:50:25,940
So. Okay.

354
00:50:25,950 --> 00:50:29,790
So this is the time for our ten minute break.

355
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:39,120
Feel free to. Yeah, I just, like, walk around a bit. Will reconvene at 210, and, you know, I'll be up here if you have any questions.

356
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:55,710
Not. After.

357
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:21,750
Yeah. Yesterday.

358
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:34,270
I feel like I lost my life in the last.

359
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:46,820
Frankly, my. Oh, yeah. That has to happen after the close of that.

360
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:52,280
There's a lot of things that.

361
00:51:54,040 --> 00:52:07,930
Very small, but I think that everyone just kind of.

362
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:15,660
For people like.

363
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:24,890
Now. And in order to.

364
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:35,110
I. Here.

365
00:52:44,490 --> 00:52:59,490
And. More than. Yeah.

366
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:17,170
I actually. Year.

367
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:43,830
Have. Yeah.

368
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:58,380
I feel like this. Me show.

369
00:54:00,410 --> 00:54:07,600
You say, lady, that you.

370
00:54:08,770 --> 00:54:12,070
Oh, right.

371
00:54:16,550 --> 00:54:21,020
Yeah, I like. In the first part.

372
00:54:43,830 --> 00:54:51,860
I. That seems like.

373
00:55:22,410 --> 00:55:49,440
What? After the.

374
00:56:12,130 --> 00:56:26,080
And. And.

375
00:57:11,610 --> 00:57:18,770
It's not of fascinating that. A lot.

376
00:57:42,170 --> 00:57:51,340
Here's. Back to.

377
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:26,550
I. Okay.

378
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:33,650
Let's get started with this bit of an apology for the people who are viewing the recordings,

379
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:40,350
because I never stop during breaks because I realize that if I stop the recording, I will forget to put it on again.

380
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:44,190
And inevitably, like half the class will just like not have a recording.

381
00:58:44,190 --> 00:58:47,900
So, you know, if you're being honest, recording everything comes in the head and stuff.

382
00:58:47,910 --> 00:58:58,170
So. Okay. So the rest of the class is about using generalized linear models to output absolute indifference measures,

383
00:58:58,650 --> 00:59:02,370
and we'll be talking about what that means. This is like my big takeaway.

384
00:59:02,370 --> 00:59:11,500
If there's anything that you can get from this class, it's that we should not be using odds ratios as much as we do.

385
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:14,669
So I'm like using ugly colors, ugly fonts.

386
00:59:14,670 --> 00:59:16,680
I really want this to be hammered into your head.

387
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:23,640
I think like in our both artistic courses, it's just like one of the first regression models that we talk about.

388
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,639
Similarly in epidemiology, certainly it's very flexible.

389
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:33,510
It's great for beginner students, but your second year epidemiology students, we can talk about different types of ratio measures instead.

390
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:40,870
Of course, there are some reasons why you'd want to use odds ratios like case control studies.

391
00:59:40,890 --> 00:59:52,170
Great reason to use an object. You know, if you have a really rare outcome, then the odds ratio pretty much approximates like a risk ratio from 600.

392
00:59:52,170 --> 00:59:57,719
You might have learned other ways that like an average should actually three ratio you might learn about that other classes.

393
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:02,490
So there there's reasons in some situations to use them if they're relatively equivalent.

394
01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:11,970
But the other reason why people use odds ratios a lot is that logistic regressions are just like really mathematically simple.

395
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:21,780
So it's very convenient to to use the coding is easy and there are fewer convergence issues.

396
01:00:21,870 --> 01:00:27,750
So one thing you will see, I don't think I have it in the homework assignments anymore in some of the past years I might have.

397
01:00:28,710 --> 01:00:32,730
But when you're using models that approximate risk ratios,

398
01:00:33,270 --> 01:00:39,960
sometimes there's what's called convergence issues or like they're just aren't able to output the the result.

399
01:00:42,270 --> 01:00:45,599
So I think in some situations, if that's the case, you know, going back to the accounting issues.

400
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:55,559
Okay. Okay. So again, or using in other things, so basic epidemiology, we have exposures.

401
01:00:55,560 --> 01:01:07,920
We have outcomes, um, exposures we often use other words like independent variable explanatory variable risk or preventive factor for outcome.

402
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:11,490
That's the dependent variable. That's the why that is.

403
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:18,240
It could be a disease, it could be healthy. You know, it's it's another thing that we are interested in.

404
01:01:20,670 --> 01:01:24,840
Okay. So in this class, we're predominantly going to be focusing on dichotomous measures.

405
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:28,260
So like, you either have the disease or you do not.

406
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:35,160
Of course, we realize that a lot of things operate more so on a continual a continuous basis,

407
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:42,780
but that's just not something that we're able to really focus a lot on, on a class which only, you know, meet several times over half a semester.

408
01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:49,530
Um, but there are two basic types of that kind of measure.

409
01:01:49,530 --> 01:01:55,640
There's the relative measures and there's absolute measures. The relative measures do include these are the ratios.

410
01:01:56,430 --> 01:02:06,480
So this does include something like an odds ratio, but also things like a rate ratio or a hazard ratio, a risk ratio, a prevalence ratio.

411
01:02:06,810 --> 01:02:12,960
One of the reasons why high prevalence ratio is being a subset of risk ratio is that statistically,

412
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:19,260
you know how you code for them in SAS will be very similar.

413
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:23,130
The difference is that problem three issues are from cross-sectional data,

414
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:30,570
whereas risk ratios are longitudinal where you have like exposure information at one point and then over time you look at the outcome,

415
01:02:31,110 --> 01:02:37,290
but like your program doesn't know the timing of different things. So that's why I have these kind of work.

416
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:42,540
Okay, so we also have absolute measures, so ask them if these are the differences.

417
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:48,749
So there's risk differences. There's rate differences like an odds difference doesn't make sense.

418
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:50,760
So there's not even anything that's like that.

419
01:02:51,390 --> 01:02:56,129
Similarly, risk difference in prevalence difference, those are you know, how you code for those are very similar.

420
01:02:56,130 --> 01:03:00,420
It's just like what your dataset is telling you, not what the statistical program is telling you.

421
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:09,550
Any questions on this? I would stay away from the word relative risk.

422
01:03:09,730 --> 01:03:13,210
I think that's sort of like an old fashioned word. So many people see it.

423
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:19,560
I feel like relative risk in the past often referred to just like an all three show, but maybe means the risk ratio.

424
01:03:19,570 --> 01:03:23,380
I don't know. Again, it's there could be a relative measure, which is a risk.

425
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:28,630
So I think it'd be a risk ratio. But oftentimes when you hear the word relative risk, they're not referring to it ratio.

426
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:35,590
So I would just stay away from it if somebody said it kind of peer a bit into their methods, a bit more to see what they're actually talking about.

427
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:46,000
Okay. So, you know, we have spent a lot of time in our AP classes probably going over like this two by two table.

428
01:03:46,150 --> 01:03:50,910
And this is just like an extension of a two by two table. So obviously you have people with an exposure or not.

429
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:54,820
That's what the plus and negative things are. You have people, disease or not.

430
01:03:55,180 --> 01:04:02,499
So we have our like ABCD. If you have a cohort study, you could look at their their follow up time.

431
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:08,890
So they're person years. So from this information, we can know the risks.

432
01:04:09,340 --> 01:04:12,400
We can measure the rates. We can know the odds.

433
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:15,370
And from that, we can compute all these different measures.

434
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:22,599
So I'll have this up to, you know, have you look at it in a moment with some small group work,

435
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:32,710
but there are a few different ways that you can interpret ratio measures or different measures.

436
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:37,210
This is this is my way. This is not the only way.

437
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:42,070
And you probably are learning in other classes different ways of interpreting these.

438
01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:47,200
You are probably reading lots of articles and even sometimes they interpret them in a number of different ways.

439
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:51,580
So I'll talk to you a bit about how I like things,

440
01:04:51,580 --> 01:04:55,479
and then we'll talk about maybe how some other people write things, you know, for homework assignments.

441
01:04:55,480 --> 01:05:01,300
I am pretty flexible, but the one thing I will say is that like when you're writing a paper or when you're writing a report,

442
01:05:01,750 --> 01:05:09,040
I think many students from their background may be taking like English classes or composition classes.

443
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:18,250
They want to be like really fancy with how they very clearly want to incorporate all sorts of like different ways of saying things.

444
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:25,270
But I'm here to tell you that your results section of any paper or to put it concretely, your homework assignments you do for me,

445
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:29,260
like you can be very repetitive for how you interpret these different measures,

446
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:34,160
like your results section of any paper is not going to be the most beautifully written.

447
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:40,300
So if you like, repeat these same sentences over and over again, I prefer you to do that.

448
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:44,380
Then just try to be really creative and then make something up and then be confusing for a reader.

449
01:05:47,470 --> 01:05:53,710
But how I think of how you do these interpretations and again, this is probably like a big review,

450
01:05:55,210 --> 01:05:59,950
but you think over something if there's a positive association or if that there's a negative association.

451
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:13,330
And so we would talk about like the a big example will be using in this class is looking at the relationship between coffee, drinking and diabetes.

452
01:06:13,930 --> 01:06:18,900
I am not an endocrinologist. I know nothing about diabetes.

453
01:06:18,910 --> 01:06:23,680
I just made this up for this class. And so like all of our homework assignments is fake data.

454
01:06:24,370 --> 01:06:27,880
Everything that I'll give you as an example is, is not true.

455
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:32,020
I do not know what the current state of the literature is on this, but this is the example that I'm going to be using.

456
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:39,219
So you could talk about like the the risk of diabetes is five times higher in

457
01:06:39,220 --> 01:06:43,390
those who drink coffee compared to those who don't drink coffee or you feel

458
01:06:43,390 --> 01:06:48,190
like the odds of diabetes or the rate of diabetes that mean by like a positive

459
01:06:48,190 --> 01:06:55,750
association using different types of measures for a negative association.

460
01:06:55,930 --> 01:06:58,690
I would say something like the, the,

461
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:09,790
the risk of diabetes is point five times as high in those who drink coffee compared this doctor for difference measures.

462
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:16,950
Here is where for rates obviously you have person years for risk.

463
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:22,810
You can probably convert that into a percentage just to make it like easier to interpret.

464
01:07:23,170 --> 01:07:37,840
So like you could have like a ratio of like 0.0001, but you can also multiply it up to be like, you know, 5000 per 10,000 persons.

465
01:07:38,740 --> 01:07:44,620
And that, you know, probably makes things more interpretable, although it's it's the same number.

466
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:51,390
Okay. So there are other ways of interpreting this.

467
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:55,180
You know, I know that like if you had an odds ratio of 1.6,

468
01:07:55,540 --> 01:08:00,340
you might have learned that you could say like the odds are 60% higher in one group versus another.

469
01:08:00,670 --> 01:08:04,280
That's like a totally legitimate way of saying something. It's an order.

470
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:09,100
She was like point nine. You could say it's 10% lower in one group compared to another group.

471
01:08:10,930 --> 01:08:17,560
So I think converting ratios into percentages by laughing off one is is okay or subtracting from one.

472
01:08:17,950 --> 01:08:23,350
I just think that gets confusing, especially when comparing to how you interpret a difference measure.

473
01:08:24,010 --> 01:08:27,069
So there's sort of some overlap in how these things are interpreted.

474
01:08:27,070 --> 01:08:30,280
So you always need to go back to thinking about is this a ratio or is this a difference?

475
01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:35,200
Okay, this is just me talking very vaguely and broadly about these things.

476
01:08:35,620 --> 01:08:46,960
What I would like you to do in your small groups is to compute these different ratio indifference measures, given this data, and to interpret this.

477
01:08:48,730 --> 01:08:53,080
And then afterwards I'll have each group take one of them to come back to me.

478
01:09:03,980 --> 01:09:14,460
All. Let's take some consumers and.

479
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:37,870
That. I know.

480
01:10:00,820 --> 01:10:06,070
You know, and I.

481
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:32,080
This. Yeah.

482
01:10:49,830 --> 01:10:54,290
I. There.

483
01:10:59,230 --> 01:11:11,820
Yeah. Said.

484
01:11:25,330 --> 01:11:35,620
The. My.

485
01:11:40,870 --> 01:11:47,700
And. Yeah.

486
01:11:48,290 --> 01:12:00,870
I heard you say that. Yeah. We're taking.

487
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:44,270
Yeah. Maybe.

488
01:12:52,010 --> 01:12:55,440
I. First of all, before.

489
01:12:58,430 --> 01:13:06,400
That's going to be. Oh, yeah.

490
01:13:07,060 --> 01:13:21,410
Yeah. And. For more than one.

491
01:13:24,770 --> 01:13:36,360
I certainly. Many.

492
01:13:44,160 --> 01:14:06,670
I need to have it. Okay.

493
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:12,100
And a fourth back. If you haven't gone through all these, that's okay.

494
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:17,350
But I will just call on some groups to talk through their answers.

495
01:14:17,950 --> 01:14:23,160
Um. Okay.

496
01:14:23,170 --> 01:14:27,400
The type Q errors. What did you get for all three of you and how do you interpret it?

497
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:46,130
You got a call? I.

498
01:14:52,420 --> 01:14:59,020
Yep. So the odds of diabetes is five, six times as high in coffee drinkers compared to non coffee drinkers.

499
01:14:59,740 --> 01:15:04,299
And sometimes people will think that's kind of redundant comparing like if you

500
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:07,300
say coffee drinkers and it's the baseline going to be not coffee drinkers.

501
01:15:07,330 --> 01:15:11,170
So sometimes like in results, you'll see that comparison group admitted.

502
01:15:11,470 --> 01:15:13,510
I think sometimes it's important to say just in case,

503
01:15:13,510 --> 01:15:20,980
like there could be three different groups of people who like drink a lot of coffee even though it's not so great.

504
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:27,670
Okay. So moving on to here, the weakness of the card.

505
01:15:27,670 --> 01:15:31,290
What did you say for risk ratio?

506
01:15:34,210 --> 01:15:39,160
The rest of you know, we've got this because I.

507
01:15:45,510 --> 01:15:49,150
Yes. Very, very good. Moving here.

508
01:15:51,460 --> 01:15:56,190
Oh, yes. So what did you think or reassure?

509
01:16:07,850 --> 01:16:24,170
So to celebrate. And you have like a great ratio associated with that.

510
01:16:25,850 --> 01:16:32,990
Okay. So the ratio I have is point six or seven.

511
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:40,060
Did anyone else get through it and have a similar number? Okay. Um, sometimes there are calculators out there wrong.

512
01:16:40,070 --> 01:16:43,610
So feel free to, you know, push back against what I say.

513
01:16:44,030 --> 01:16:48,139
Um, but yeah. So, you know, very similarly, we were just in search of a great intuit.

514
01:16:48,140 --> 01:16:58,010
So the rate of, um, diabetes is 0.6, four times as high among those who drink coffee or those who don't.

515
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:03,220
Okay. Um, did the disease.

516
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:09,440
Did you get to calculating the risk difference at all? Oh, yeah, of course.

517
01:17:23,820 --> 01:17:29,190
Yeah. I mean, when I. So again, since I just did this, I might have done it wrong for my race difference.

518
01:17:29,190 --> 01:17:36,149
I got negative .08 is, um, yeah.

519
01:17:36,150 --> 01:17:42,360
And so that's one of the things where then you can make that into percentage by saying like -8%.

520
01:17:43,230 --> 01:17:49,709
I mean you could always see like the risk is negative .08 or lower.

521
01:17:49,710 --> 01:17:58,860
So the risk of diabetes is 0.08 lower in this group compared to that group, that's kind of confusing.

522
01:17:58,950 --> 01:18:03,300
So that's right. It's 8% lower in those who drink coffee compared to those who don't drink coffee.

523
01:18:03,750 --> 01:18:07,200
Yeah, I just realize. Oh, yeah.

524
01:18:08,190 --> 01:18:11,450
But does that does that make sense? Like how that's converted to percentages.

525
01:18:14,340 --> 01:18:31,900
Okay. Um, did this group over here, the, the significant group under point of five, did you get to a rate difference at zero?

526
01:18:33,330 --> 01:18:38,309
I also got negative .07, but it could be a rounding error.

527
01:18:38,310 --> 01:18:41,640
So don't. I'm sure you're you're you're good.

528
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:51,480
And that's one of the things also we're like -0.07 you could say like the rate is .07 less in the coffee drinkers compared to not.

529
01:18:51,480 --> 01:19:01,200
But it's probably better to multiply that up to a reasonable number and see if like seven per thousand or 77 per 10,000 person years.

530
01:19:01,710 --> 01:19:06,630
So that's how I would say that. Any questions on this, though?

531
01:19:08,310 --> 01:19:13,049
Again, I'm including this here and it's like a fill in the blanks to interpret things.

532
01:19:13,050 --> 01:19:19,230
I don't think you can go wrong with this, but there are other ways to interpret ratio measures, absolute measures.

533
01:19:19,230 --> 01:19:25,920
So you could be creative, but like there's no reason to be creative and you might hear things in different classes.

534
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:30,649
Again, that's totally fine. Okay.

535
01:19:30,650 --> 01:19:38,070
So using these, you can actually kind of manipulate them a bit to find other measures which are really important.

536
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:49,729
So if you remember back to F 600 and talking about like an attributable fraction or a population attributable fraction, that is just one minus.

537
01:19:49,730 --> 01:19:56,580
The risk ratio are not the ratio and we're, you know, attributable fraction sounds really fancy.

538
01:19:56,580 --> 01:20:03,410
It sounds like a big word. What does it mean? But this is what we use to calculate vaccine effectiveness.

539
01:20:03,980 --> 01:20:17,540
So, for instance, if we in our study found that the COVID vaccine was 60% effective, that means that it originally came from like a risk ratio of 0.4.

540
01:20:17,750 --> 01:20:25,300
So what it's saying is that like the risk of getting COVID 19 is kind of four times higher among those who get vaccine compared to those who don't.

541
01:20:26,210 --> 01:20:35,070
Because that make sense. Number needed to treat is that we see this a lot in my clinical literature, especially like doctors like this number.

542
01:20:35,730 --> 01:20:37,290
It's just one over the risk difference.

543
01:20:37,290 --> 01:20:46,499
It's kind of like how many people need to be given a vaccine or a drug or like some sort of intervention to prevent like one case of disease.

544
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:51,840
Like how many people need to be given statins to prevent a heart attack.

545
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:53,670
Like maybe you need like 60 people to get it.

546
01:20:54,060 --> 01:21:02,160
And that'll be very different than if you only need to treat like two people to get to prevent one case of the disease.

547
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:09,080
Okay. So moving on, how do we decide which measure to use?

548
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:12,920
So this is like my flow diagram.

549
01:21:13,580 --> 01:21:23,450
First, ask yourself this question is the probability of selection from the source population in this study the same for those within with an outcome?

550
01:21:25,310 --> 01:21:29,750
This sounds really convoluted, but basically it means that you have a case control study or not.

551
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:36,590
So no would mean that this is not the case.

552
01:21:36,590 --> 01:21:43,820
So in a case control study, the whole point is that we oversample cases that, you know, the efficiency in a case control study.

553
01:21:43,870 --> 01:21:50,480
So for those with the outcome of the cases, they're sampled at a higher probability than those without the cases.

554
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:57,290
So then we would use an observation. So again, if it's a case control study using authorship.

555
01:21:57,650 --> 01:22:07,280
But if not, let's think about this. So is the information collected longitudinally?

556
01:22:07,790 --> 01:22:10,900
If it is, then we could use a risk measure.

557
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:17,810
If it is not, we go to this last point and we could use a problem like a prevalence ratio of prevalence difference.

558
01:22:20,590 --> 01:22:24,340
This is just like another way of looking at it. Based on the study design.

559
01:22:25,450 --> 01:22:29,470
Again, the benefit of odds ratios is you can use them in any kind of study that you want.

560
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:32,890
And we'll talk about the disadvantages of all three issues in a moment.

561
01:22:35,110 --> 01:22:41,499
But prevalence ratios, differences you use in cross sectional things, risk ratios you can use in cohorts in randomized controlled trials,

562
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:48,460
which by definition are longitudinal and ratios you can use if you collect time information.

563
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:56,020
Okay. So the difference between absolute and relative measures, I think is probably like very apparent in an absolute measure.

564
01:22:56,020 --> 01:23:00,849
It's centered around zero and it's perfectly symmetrical between like negative infinity and positive infinity.

565
01:23:00,850 --> 01:23:06,940
Or we could like have a percentage or a person or whatever for relative measures,

566
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:12,310
they are symmetrical around one and the distance between zero and one is the same as between one and infinity.

567
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:18,400
So here three shows in all addresses for the same data set.

568
01:23:18,820 --> 01:23:26,800
If you calculated recursion now as you would like you've done for the small group, the odds ratio will always appear to be more exaggerated.

569
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:31,209
So the odds ratio will always be, you know, if it's predicted, it'll be less than the risk ratio.

570
01:23:31,210 --> 01:23:34,570
If it's causing the outcome, it'll be more.

571
01:23:35,740 --> 01:23:39,600
This isn't like a fight. It's not to see that all three she was like, Why is that all?

572
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:48,400
But if just a layman was looking at, you know, an observation of risk or if they think that the order issue number means there's a stronger effect,

573
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:52,930
again, this is in a needling problem with the object you perceive.

574
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:58,120
It's just like how our minds interpret that information. Okay.

575
01:23:58,870 --> 01:24:03,520
So I'd like you to spend some time on this and basically calculate the odds ratio.

576
01:24:03,550 --> 01:24:08,050
There are three fewer the risk difference for men women in the total population.

577
01:24:08,500 --> 01:24:16,900
And I will maybe in your groups you could split it up so that one person both men and women in total and then compare size.

578
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:38,690
So we're looking at. Like most.

579
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:49,360
But that's how I would think about it. And again, we'll talk about we're going out to fundraisers, but like, yeah,

580
01:24:49,660 --> 01:24:55,569
I think probably like more people, better ones, but you know, you could have reasons for that.

581
01:24:55,570 --> 01:25:00,640
Maybe that reason is your advisor or the person you're working with really wants like a certain ratio.

582
01:25:01,250 --> 01:25:29,880
Yeah. Third.

583
01:26:25,450 --> 01:26:50,110
When you leave here, you. Yeah.

584
01:26:54,730 --> 01:27:01,800
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

585
01:27:06,010 --> 01:27:24,390
Very large numbers. When?

586
01:27:32,940 --> 01:27:36,870
And. I didn't.

587
01:27:41,490 --> 01:27:46,670
Very for that.

588
01:28:00,870 --> 01:28:11,560
Is. The.

589
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:39,870
But. Okay.

590
01:28:40,380 --> 01:28:47,280
Let's start to talk about this for epi tastic.

591
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:52,980
Could you give me the odds ratio for men, women and in total population?

592
01:28:55,940 --> 01:28:59,960
Many people want. One more story. Okay.

593
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:03,420
So for men, it's what to.

594
01:29:04,060 --> 01:29:11,680
And then for women. But. Okay, but does anyone have it for the total population?

595
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:21,250
I think I heard this. Okay.

596
01:29:21,670 --> 01:29:26,240
And the ecological balances.

597
01:29:26,260 --> 01:29:44,140
Do you have anything for the risk ratio? Okay.

598
01:29:46,300 --> 01:29:49,780
I think I have like 1.1 million, but again, it could be a rounding error. This is fine.

599
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:54,850
Okay. Um, and then group G.

600
01:29:54,850 --> 01:30:13,670
I forget what your. For all of them.

601
01:30:14,210 --> 01:30:18,200
Okay. This is pretty much what I got.

602
01:30:18,380 --> 01:30:25,220
I've got to one on here, but any numbers that you want to dispute.

603
01:30:27,140 --> 01:30:31,520
Okay. So I know that you probably just calculated these and you're not really thinking about them too much,

604
01:30:31,940 --> 01:30:35,650
but this is like one of the reasons why odds ratios are weird.

605
01:30:35,660 --> 01:30:39,440
So let's look at risk differences for men is .05.

606
01:30:39,830 --> 01:30:45,260
For women it's .05. So total it means point of fact that kind of just makes sense, right?

607
01:30:45,260 --> 01:30:50,540
Like if the population are just assuming everybody in this is either a man or woman,

608
01:30:52,070 --> 01:30:56,330
then, you know, if half of them are pregnant, five and half of them are 25.

609
01:30:56,330 --> 01:31:03,470
We think altogether it's kind affect their risk ratio. Half of them are 1.06, half of them are 2.0.

610
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:07,640
So like for the total population, it's like kind of in between.

611
01:31:07,980 --> 01:31:09,050
Does that make sense?

612
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:19,850
Um, and again, it ratio measures are symmetric around one, so it's not like it's going to be 1.5 because like the farther you get out,

613
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:23,770
the less of the difference there is between each subsequent number.

614
01:31:25,340 --> 01:31:30,559
But odds ratios are really for men it's 2.1, one for women is 2.11.

615
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:34,850
So we are assuming the total population is 2.11, but actually it's 1.2.

616
01:31:36,740 --> 01:31:40,760
So that's weird. Okay. So this is an example of non flexibility.

617
01:31:41,450 --> 01:31:47,120
So this is what we mean by non collapsible is that the total population value is

618
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:51,830
sometimes going to be different than what you would expect given stratified samples.

619
01:31:55,730 --> 01:32:04,040
Does that make sense? And so I was looking online and apparently there are like some rare circumstances where other

620
01:32:04,040 --> 01:32:09,020
measures of association made in like some really weird circumstances not be collapsible,

621
01:32:09,380 --> 01:32:18,080
but in general, like risk measures, rate measures are flexible, but is odds ratios like sometimes it'll be what you expect,

622
01:32:18,410 --> 01:32:22,610
but sometimes it's total value will just be like way out there in a really bizarre number.

623
01:32:25,610 --> 01:32:31,430
This is just like me putting it in like words, what I was just saying.

624
01:32:31,820 --> 01:32:37,430
So if we have a third variable, which in this situation is sex,

625
01:32:37,970 --> 01:32:44,900
then we could look at three different measures, like in the total population and in two different groups.

626
01:32:47,870 --> 01:32:56,390
And then we could see if the total population is in between the stratified populations, then the measure is classical.

627
01:33:00,650 --> 01:33:05,240
So we're going to be talking like a bit more. I'll bring up this idea of flexibility really later.

628
01:33:05,240 --> 01:33:10,370
But basically when we're doing some causal inference, it's important to have a collapsible measure.

629
01:33:10,790 --> 01:33:18,230
Like if something is no longer collapsible, then some of the assumptions that we make for certain causal inference methods just don't hold true.

630
01:33:18,980 --> 01:33:25,270
So that's one reason why we don't like the all ratio, is that we don't know if it's going to be collapsible in the situations that we're looking.

631
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:32,920
Any questions? Clarksburg Okay.

632
01:33:33,860 --> 01:33:40,550
Just a few different things. One, if you use a racial measure, you should put the axes on a large scale.

633
01:33:41,150 --> 01:33:46,060
So this is just an example that I have comparing.

634
01:33:46,070 --> 01:33:49,940
It doesn't really matter. It's like the odds of some disease.

635
01:33:50,230 --> 01:34:00,410
And if looking at a population of migrants and local citizens and you know what we choose in epidemiology, this reference group is know up to us.

636
01:34:00,650 --> 01:34:04,550
So we could have locals be the reference group, we could have migrants be the reference group.

637
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:09,499
And then, you know, they'll just be a flip of it. So and these are just inverses of it.

638
01:34:09,500 --> 01:34:12,860
Like one divided by 4.37 is point to three.

639
01:34:14,180 --> 01:34:18,340
So these numbers are equivalent. It's just that what we're comparing is different.

640
01:34:18,350 --> 01:34:21,370
Does that. Makes sense. Okay.

641
01:34:21,910 --> 01:34:26,880
So if we don't have any addressing of the axis, it looks like this number is really precise.

642
01:34:26,890 --> 01:34:30,640
Like the confidence interval is really small, but this number looks really broad.

643
01:34:31,750 --> 01:34:35,310
But if we put things on the large scale, they're the same.

644
01:34:35,330 --> 01:34:37,840
So that's why we like using the large scale for ratio.

645
01:34:38,050 --> 01:34:44,680
We if you're visually depicting a ratio measure, put it on the long scale and there's a way of doing this in Excel.

646
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:52,520
Obviously, if you're really fancy to use R for data visualization, you can do this, maybe even be able to use this house.

647
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:57,280
So I don't think people will put and this okay,

648
01:34:57,400 --> 01:35:01,959
so the homework assignment for today is although generalized linear regression, I just have to slide in.

649
01:35:01,960 --> 01:35:09,940
I'll let you go. So generalized linear regression is just a standard way of coding for something in a statistical program,

650
01:35:10,780 --> 01:35:16,030
and you need to specify two different functions. There's a distribution function and a linked function.

651
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:23,200
It is sort of like arbitrary what these things actually mean. But distribution is like, are your data normally distributed or not?

652
01:35:24,070 --> 01:35:28,120
And then a link function is basically looking at for a mean value in the population.

653
01:35:28,120 --> 01:35:32,140
How does that how do individual values relate to that mean value?

654
01:35:33,970 --> 01:35:41,140
And so we can specify a number of different regression models and just showing you the code for fast.

655
01:35:41,140 --> 01:35:45,879
But it's quite easy to find how this would be coded in R or any other program.

656
01:35:45,880 --> 01:35:49,540
But please like me or you know, if you have questions about this.

657
01:35:51,100 --> 01:35:58,389
So for linear regression, we specify a normal distribution and we the link function is just called identity.

658
01:35:58,390 --> 01:36:01,420
And so that's basically just like the most basic thing.

659
01:36:01,810 --> 01:36:07,120
I think that's what it means by identity. It's like there's no transformation and then you output beta coefficients.

660
01:36:07,120 --> 01:36:12,849
Again, we're not really talking about this much for the logistic regression.

661
01:36:12,850 --> 01:36:16,059
You specify a little bit like for like binomial,

662
01:36:16,060 --> 01:36:22,420
you specify a log length and for a binomial regression you specify like this to be an identity, but the distribution to be binomial.

663
01:36:23,620 --> 01:36:27,430
So again, you will be doing a homework assignment where you go about this in depth.

664
01:36:28,270 --> 01:36:30,520
Let me know if you have any questions.

665
01:36:30,940 --> 01:36:39,340
The last thing I'll say is that at the end of each lecture I just have like a few things on the final exam will not exclusively be this,

666
01:36:39,790 --> 01:36:45,909
but this will be a lot of this stuff that I would include on the final exam.

667
01:36:45,910 --> 01:36:53,240
Please look this over. If you have any questions, let me or you know, and if you are doing a make up, I do refer you to like responses.

668
01:36:53,290 --> 01:36:56,310
But again, you would have that discussion. Okay, so I'm out of here.

669
01:36:56,360 --> 01:37:00,940
The other questions be coming in. Let me know if you have any questions, I'll figure out.

670
01:37:05,540 --> 01:37:05,800
What?
