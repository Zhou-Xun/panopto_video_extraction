1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:07,200
thank you for the Internet and wanted to be the first speaker was compliant

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:14,220
to leave a nice talking that they're

3
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:20,080
athletes and I my background is actually mileage you know

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:25,540
way in which I address public health issues and

5
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:31,360
in my area which is specifically in your final term is affected.

6
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:36,500
so I'm interested in that being at the interface collecting data

7
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:41,520
having feel like they're also doing mathematical

8
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,860
models and thinking about my perspective

9
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:54,600
to pick friends in that

10
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,607
environment determines that the and see there's been lots of different movement

11
00:00:59,607 --> 00:01:05,707
towards trying to integrate

12
00:01:05,707 --> 00:01:10,867
one house is one of the recent movement in this

13
00:01:10,867 --> 00:01:16,067
direction that in my primarily motivated

14
00:01:16,067 --> 00:01:21,147
by been there to integrate animal

15
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:27,167
health and environment so in public

16
00:01:27,167 --> 00:01:32,167
life 's idea had been going on on

17
00:01:32,167 --> 00:01:38,707
time and there's a long history of thinking about

18
00:01:38,707 --> 00:01:44,507
what I wanna do here is to link that all link that with

19
00:01:44,507 --> 00:01:49,987
the ways in which our feel that your knowledge is moving more towards assistance perspective

20
00:01:49,987 --> 00:01:55,507
which I think is very much.

21
00:01:55,507 --> 00:02:00,623
so it back. um this is a overview of my presentation

22
00:02:00,623 --> 00:02:05,963
a brief history of one help from this perspective. be interested

23
00:02:05,963 --> 00:02:11,303
in in integrating environments with locales and then my

24
00:02:11,303 --> 00:02:17,663
perspective on a systems approach to one house and after genealogy and then

25
00:02:17,663 --> 00:02:22,743
bringing in some work that I've been doing in Ecuador at a long-standing project

26
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:27,803
the next any years now. and

27
00:02:27,803 --> 00:02:35,343
our work. I'm thinking in Ecuador.

28
00:02:35,343 --> 00:02:40,563
so as they mentioned there's a ballot long history of thinking about the environment the public

29
00:02:40,563 --> 00:02:46,043
out goes way back and take him

30
00:02:46,043 --> 00:02:51,423
to a pocket where this idea. environment

31
00:02:51,423 --> 00:02:57,223
for central and the way was thinking about how

32
00:02:57,223 --> 00:03:12,633
and

33
00:03:12,633 --> 00:03:17,893
more recently we break out who's really more

34
00:03:17,893 --> 00:03:23,573
known for working and social medicine and connect

35
00:03:23,573 --> 00:03:28,773
process with how with also the first person to coin

36
00:03:28,773 --> 00:03:34,633
the term who knows. so he again was very interested in

37
00:03:34,633 --> 00:03:39,653
play you know

38
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:44,973
and then also similar timeframe to compete ideas

39
00:03:44,973 --> 00:03:50,433
about these five days the Syrian the contagion.

40
00:03:50,433 --> 00:03:56,453
both of which again the environment played a central role in.

41
00:03:56,453 --> 00:04:01,509
so we had history in which that paradigm that we're thinking about may

42
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:06,949
not always the line eyebrow and paradigms that these people are thinking about

43
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:12,289
but clearly that theme of the importance of the environment

44
00:04:12,289 --> 00:04:18,489
played out. have a long long history and

45
00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:24,929
that kinda changed a bit with Jerry Berry in the development

46
00:04:24,929 --> 00:04:30,029
taxi where there became this movement towards more thinking

47
00:04:30,029 --> 00:04:35,069
about the individual and what's happening within the individual and really started moving

48
00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:40,089
about thinking about individual risk factors as as of primary

49
00:04:40,089 --> 00:04:45,249
importance in public health and that really frames how we think about you know

50
00:04:45,249 --> 00:04:50,669
how you learn a better you know the factor analysis really is thinking about

51
00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:55,869
at individual level.

52
00:04:55,869 --> 00:05:00,923
how determines of how our pattern and so

53
00:05:00,923 --> 00:05:06,863
public health becomes more focus on the individual with germs and obviously vaccines

54
00:05:06,863 --> 00:05:12,803
are gonna leave the single most important development in certainly

55
00:05:12,803 --> 00:05:18,223
movement had a lot of benefit. also but had good

56
00:05:18,223 --> 00:05:25,503
impact thinking about larger

57
00:05:25,503 --> 00:05:31,263
logic. so

58
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:36,563
over the past few decades though they think I mean these new these new public

59
00:05:36,563 --> 00:05:41,563
health questions that really that's a test to think about reconnecting with

60
00:05:41,563 --> 00:05:46,823
the environment and I just listing a few examples here in the context of the sex diseases

61
00:05:46,823 --> 00:05:52,163
that kinda highlight change and thinking and and developing a different

62
00:05:52,163 --> 00:05:57,303
field so there's this connection. this residential force

63
00:05:57,303 --> 00:06:03,377
connection is the one process that had been occurring very intensely in Africa

64
00:06:03,377 --> 00:06:08,597
and so they just bill over. we were not a human.

65
00:06:08,597 --> 00:06:15,497
it's something that we're seeing right now Ebola the great example of that where

66
00:06:15,497 --> 00:06:20,717
this into the fourth and

67
00:06:20,717 --> 00:06:25,717
for their livelihood has created this exposure

68
00:06:25,717 --> 00:06:30,777
and complex ecological process that results in spillover

69
00:06:30,777 --> 00:06:36,177
of fires is like the ball with a ball and now we even have these complex social processes

70
00:06:36,177 --> 00:06:42,601
that are set you know where we were trying to use to explain

71
00:06:42,601 --> 00:06:47,741
the them friends within human race and so

72
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:54,921
I would really good example of where a systems approach is really needed to be thinking

73
00:06:54,921 --> 00:07:00,081
issues around do not get viruses going over

74
00:07:00,081 --> 00:07:05,881
for agricultural practice it is another big area and historically

75
00:07:05,881 --> 00:07:11,181
you know about the red childhood diseases that come from livestock

76
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:16,301
more but recently received the emergence of a lot of different pathogen mostly associated

77
00:07:16,301 --> 00:07:22,081
with this increasing density farming density occurring globally.

78
00:07:22,081 --> 00:07:27,461
so Chris pretty boy at one five seven. jacket

79
00:07:27,461 --> 00:07:32,561
up fast. outbreak that I mean these these are these are

80
00:07:32,561 --> 00:07:41,706
the merge nineteen eighties and nineteen nineties as well as drug

81
00:07:41,706 --> 00:07:46,986
climate change and another huge year in which lots of different

82
00:07:46,986 --> 00:07:52,606
have impacted and and will be in fact different times and faxes

83
00:07:52,606 --> 00:07:59,006
like that. my areas more in water where we see

84
00:07:59,006 --> 00:08:04,226
you know that in fact the claim it on in terror pathogen is complex

85
00:08:04,226 --> 00:08:09,586
it's. looks to be serving vote way of concentrating pathogen but also

86
00:08:09,586 --> 00:08:14,986
a way of diluting that and so the the ultimate

87
00:08:14,986 --> 00:08:21,086
Royal climate change in effect pathogen is very complex again thanking

88
00:08:21,086 --> 00:08:27,066
more systems level thanking these processes. and lastly

89
00:08:27,066 --> 00:08:32,266
by in transmission. been doing some work on this area

90
00:08:32,266 --> 00:08:37,466
looking at well what's called a dilution factors a Syrian disease college that says that

91
00:08:37,466 --> 00:08:42,562
that increasing biodiversity helps to dilute for

92
00:08:42,562 --> 00:08:47,902
the transmission line disease is a great example of that where the idea

93
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:53,622
is basically that with more potential post around

94
00:08:53,622 --> 00:08:59,242
there's gonna be more hope that a lot less efficient fish and less efficient

95
00:08:59,242 --> 00:09:06,542
and actually help transmission and again Lyman.

96
00:09:06,542 --> 00:09:11,802
so I was thinking about the environment. um

97
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:16,962
both socially vote back becomes critical thinking about. we need to get you

98
00:09:16,962 --> 00:09:23,542
know really needing go beyond just the individual process.

99
00:09:23,542 --> 00:09:28,542
so this is one way am I thinking about these interactions in the

100
00:09:28,542 --> 00:09:35,182
framework where we have this bill processes

101
00:09:35,182 --> 00:09:40,268
much of all been talking about climate change um road development which

102
00:09:40,268 --> 00:09:45,848
I'll be talking about more water project leading them affecting more proximal

103
00:09:45,848 --> 00:09:50,868
kinds of factors that more directly affect the

104
00:09:50,868 --> 00:09:56,108
transmission. I'd be happy and so it's really the impact of these

105
00:09:56,108 --> 00:10:02,008
environment of processes which are complex dynamic process you know and then on the south like climate change.

106
00:10:02,008 --> 00:10:07,608
it's really is how it impacts transmission is what we're concerned about

107
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:13,068
directly and then that transmission. I would impact that transmission then affects

108
00:10:13,068 --> 00:10:19,088
all of me disease the third. we have vinyl changes leading the transmission cycle

109
00:10:19,088 --> 00:10:26,268
and disease and so when we're thinking about environment with terms of disease.

110
00:10:26,268 --> 00:10:31,888
the way in which we might want to categorize the text on it be thinking about anything

111
00:10:31,888 --> 00:10:36,908
rest more intensely along this idea of transmission cycle than it

112
00:10:36,908 --> 00:10:42,094
does about standard tax on. if

113
00:10:42,094 --> 00:10:48,234
you if you come a from clinical perspective. we really we might be interested in fire and bacteria

114
00:10:48,234 --> 00:10:54,414
had to wait CDC is the division of biology and

115
00:10:54,414 --> 00:10:59,514
act reality for ago in Paris I things like water borne

116
00:10:59,514 --> 00:11:04,534
pathogen that I studied to kinda fall through the cracks. we water cabbage and cross over the

117
00:11:04,534 --> 00:11:09,694
tax on but that same time 's intervention. we we wanna use the same kinda

118
00:11:09,694 --> 00:11:14,814
interventions across these different diseases. so another way this isn't

119
00:11:14,814 --> 00:11:20,994
right. um that

120
00:11:20,994 --> 00:11:26,294
we might wanna think about classifying

121
00:11:26,294 --> 00:11:32,334
these diseases are classifying you have these transmission systems or these pathogens is how they're transmitted.

122
00:11:32,334 --> 00:11:37,474
we had directly transmitted diseases. one's going from human to human the environment doesn't play

123
00:11:37,474 --> 00:11:42,724
a huge role really sexy transmitted diseases as a group

124
00:11:42,724 --> 00:11:47,824
in Victor a great example of that here and find

125
00:11:47,824 --> 00:11:52,984
large that is rare to find a pathogen beyond that category where

126
00:11:52,984 --> 00:11:58,304
there's no environmental even influenza TV. there's an environmental compliment

127
00:11:58,304 --> 00:12:03,624
to the transmission even if we might think of that with the threat

128
00:12:03,624 --> 00:12:11,524
and the kind of interventions we use for those these like math adjuster.

129
00:12:11,524 --> 00:12:18,104
so um so do you see but she's directly transmitted diseases have.

130
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:23,924
we were thinking more about social structure and processes less about the invite

131
00:12:23,924 --> 00:12:29,124
and then the second here would be disaster borne diseases another big category

132
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:34,124
where there's a vector usually mosquito or text that actually factors that

133
00:12:34,124 --> 00:12:39,444
pathogen from one host to another lot example malaria

134
00:12:39,444 --> 00:12:45,690
dengue good classic examples of happens in this in this category

135
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:50,730
environment media transmission this is where the water borne pathogen tend to lie where

136
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:55,830
there environments and important part of this transmission system

137
00:12:55,830 --> 00:13:01,650
people shine into the environment. so

138
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:06,670
and and then others contact an environment that environment could be a table

139
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:14,230
top. could be a daycare center could be in that

140
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:19,836
plays a role here. there maybe other hosts involved. also this is where livestock

141
00:13:19,836 --> 00:13:25,336
transmission.

142
00:13:25,336 --> 00:13:30,436
and lastly we had to do an act of these where is humans are what

143
00:13:30,436 --> 00:13:35,976
we call dead and how transmission is maintained

144
00:13:35,976 --> 00:13:41,156
in in the

145
00:13:41,156 --> 00:13:46,256
in the environment through other species and then humans

146
00:13:46,256 --> 00:13:52,296
are way. yeah I guess a date and how distracting I how they get they get exposed to that pathogen.

147
00:13:52,296 --> 00:13:57,536
but they can't it and so if we go along. we use this kind

148
00:13:57,536 --> 00:14:02,776
of paradigm to be thinking about how do you classify in fact diseases we can be

149
00:14:02,776 --> 00:14:08,176
thinking more about the role in which different processes

150
00:14:08,176 --> 00:14:15,256
social processes either way and and this the kind of intervention.

151
00:14:15,256 --> 00:14:20,291
we may want to use for these different

152
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:25,391
different groups of pathogen will be similar within each.

153
00:14:25,391 --> 00:14:31,651
so we back contact and

154
00:14:31,651 --> 00:14:36,651
I wanted introduce to our study side in Ecuador where we're thinking about these this

155
00:14:36,651 --> 00:14:41,991
kind of transmission system and systems level phenomena

156
00:14:41,991 --> 00:14:47,191
in the context of the roads the roads being environmental determinants and

157
00:14:47,191 --> 00:14:52,831
we've been interested in this topic in Ecuador for a couple decades now

158
00:14:52,831 --> 00:14:59,591
and researching in this area. just for orientation where

159
00:14:59,591 --> 00:15:04,591
this is Ecuador through the northern part of Ecuador along along the coast that the

160
00:15:04,591 --> 00:15:09,691
Goshen. it's just right on the Colombian border.

161
00:15:09,691 --> 00:15:14,731
and this prior nineteen ninety six at no Road with

162
00:15:14,731 --> 00:15:19,775
a very isolated area mostly after like could Dorian 's eighty percent

163
00:15:19,775 --> 00:15:25,235
twenty percent indigenous relation in this great and so

164
00:15:25,235 --> 00:15:30,455
we've been studying communities that are different levels

165
00:15:30,455 --> 00:15:36,275
of remoteness from the primary rather.

166
00:15:36,275 --> 00:15:41,795
the primary road going from the code along and I think this leaves all we have for the Andes.

167
00:15:41,795 --> 00:15:47,435
if you connected this region. um in the major way and had major significance

168
00:15:47,435 --> 00:15:52,695
so we had just the cross section here so we we have been following

169
00:15:52,695 --> 00:15:57,815
communities that are still relatively remote from the road and those communities

170
00:15:57,815 --> 00:16:03,195
that are on line and we're looking at the impact with his idea

171
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:08,255
that um this area and this center regional scale

172
00:16:08,255 --> 00:16:16,259
designer study looking at communities they have differential at

173
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:23,119
and we're looking at the ideas in which how the road might affect

174
00:16:23,119 --> 00:16:28,259
these transmission often and people ask what are we to you know what it's not

175
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:34,019
obvious you think about what how the road might impact these transmission

176
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:40,419
and so we

177
00:16:40,419 --> 00:16:45,499
what the following flies are gonna be doing is kinda giving you a sense of how

178
00:16:45,499 --> 00:16:51,439
how the road and how the road does impact this region in general

179
00:16:51,439 --> 00:16:57,319
and and what our series of its impact on else in the mission.

180
00:16:57,319 --> 00:17:02,619
so the idea again is the study design itself at a regional

181
00:17:02,619 --> 00:17:07,659
level is really thinking it is an ecological perspective. so irrespective of

182
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:12,679
whether or not we you know specifically starting nine humans

183
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:17,853
and and doing ecology. so what we call an ecological perspective think

184
00:17:17,853 --> 00:17:23,073
from the neck not less of that lesson there's perspective of the ecological

185
00:17:23,073 --> 00:17:32,753
design you know theology anymore from how we call just think about

186
00:17:32,753 --> 00:17:38,293
dynamic. so little bit about roads and and

187
00:17:38,293 --> 00:17:43,333
and how they influence communities when they're built. so

188
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:48,453
when the World Bank decides that there needs to be a road for work for whatever reason in area the.

189
00:17:48,453 --> 00:17:53,713
they do health impact assessment. they and those health in fact they do environmental

190
00:17:53,713 --> 00:17:58,973
the general health impact assessment is part of that and

191
00:17:58,973 --> 00:18:05,113
they look at what they might look at things like well what what positive things are gonna occur Road

192
00:18:05,113 --> 00:18:10,233
health care. also maybe looking at what the impact is

193
00:18:10,233 --> 00:18:15,273
in the hazards of actually building the road as one issue with

194
00:18:15,273 --> 00:18:20,687
respect but they really do very little and and really

195
00:18:20,687 --> 00:18:26,627
thinking about the downstream in fact impact how how it will affect

196
00:18:26,627 --> 00:18:31,767
the economy how like your social structure and how it affects the economy out of Texas also

197
00:18:31,767 --> 00:18:37,767
struck very much plays the road impact

198
00:18:37,767 --> 00:18:43,547
transmission of disease and that's that's kind of the perspective that we have.

199
00:18:43,547 --> 00:18:48,767
so what brain so the world one bank roll Bank funds is rather based on their primary

200
00:18:48,767 --> 00:18:54,067
broke that was rode back when from the coast to the Andes that's what they've

201
00:18:54,067 --> 00:18:59,707
what happen. road road is it it's not just the static

202
00:18:59,707 --> 00:19:04,827
kind of process where you build this road and see what happens but second the roads

203
00:19:04,827 --> 00:19:10,067
are continually built once you build a primary. so the second he wrote than

204
00:19:10,067 --> 00:19:16,167
the primary route the cross section through an area second they were giving access

205
00:19:16,167 --> 00:19:21,637
other community and that

206
00:19:21,637 --> 00:19:26,657
is a dynamic for these roads get felt for a variety reasons. they actually because of the travel

207
00:19:26,657 --> 00:19:32,197
those roads can disappear in a year one after they're built. so they're asked

208
00:19:32,197 --> 00:19:37,297
accessibility of chain so over the decades we've seen

209
00:19:37,297 --> 00:19:43,977
this process is not a I mean change everything.

210
00:19:43,977 --> 00:19:49,337
and they were main room and so

211
00:19:49,337 --> 00:19:54,337
it is important to think about road development as his dynamic process that on for over

212
00:19:54,337 --> 00:19:59,339
a decade so what road to do one thing rather than

213
00:19:59,339 --> 00:20:04,459
facilitate movement so without the row all these communities

214
00:20:04,459 --> 00:20:10,139
live along rivers and rivers where there have been so major

215
00:20:10,139 --> 00:20:15,259
transportation. these are pictures of this

216
00:20:15,259 --> 00:20:21,159
exact canoe taxi that takes people up and down the river once the day.

217
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:26,239
my cost ten dollars for someone to take them from the

218
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:31,319
commercial Center broke bones in a remote area. this is somebody with a dugout canoe.

219
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:38,499
I am moving along the river. um this may take

220
00:20:38,499 --> 00:20:44,059
three four five hours to go from Foucault remote area. this this motor transmission

221
00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:49,399
gonna take days. so the technology in which you have two transports gonna dictate

222
00:20:49,399 --> 00:20:56,133
how remote you are you get a row. what that bring that brings

223
00:20:56,133 --> 00:21:01,753
but this is public transportation now it costs more like twenty five cents ago from

224
00:21:01,753 --> 00:21:07,513
that saying that same distance much cheaper um people bring in

225
00:21:07,513 --> 00:21:12,593
motors and fiberglass now this transport time goes from

226
00:21:12,593 --> 00:21:18,153
five hours down to two. so the road facilitates it

227
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:23,552
increased movement any pretax to

228
00:21:23,552 --> 00:21:28,853
to to the outside world road also facilitate changes in population

229
00:21:28,853 --> 00:21:34,033
structures either that pictures of communities that have no road

230
00:21:34,033 --> 00:21:40,413
access on community. have increased sense that

231
00:21:40,413 --> 00:21:45,953
people are accessing the water roads are built in the community patient

232
00:21:45,953 --> 00:21:52,153
facility and changes in population structures. roads have um

233
00:21:52,153 --> 00:21:57,153
dream environmental change consequences these roads are built for a reason usually for

234
00:21:57,153 --> 00:22:03,077
resource extraction in this case building up on the plantation.

235
00:22:03,077 --> 00:22:09,797
so we witnessed a lot of deforestation

236
00:22:09,797 --> 00:22:14,797
but also roads bring in um change the market economy and so

237
00:22:14,797 --> 00:22:20,516
we lost the different times of the exec I mean and

238
00:22:20,516 --> 00:22:26,776
the reliance and the shift from maybe relying more on

239
00:22:26,776 --> 00:22:32,797
grown hunting. two more centerline times of action.

240
00:22:32,797 --> 00:22:38,697
so dramatic social changes.

241
00:22:38,697 --> 00:22:43,797
so this is kind of the diagram we put together they connect the cobble

242
00:22:43,797 --> 00:22:48,797
diagram to connect proximity to transmission system as I

243
00:22:48,797 --> 00:22:53,797
mentioned and then to busy and these are a number of

244
00:22:53,797 --> 00:22:58,900
different pathways that might directly address impact

245
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:04,240
of the sect station. they see that we focus

246
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:10,320
on quite a bit in our studies that then the demographic changes that occur

247
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:16,420
and decrease in and out migration for those you needs it also not road access eight

248
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:21,660
people and household change the wage labor kinds of activities and they mainly

249
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:27,040
for six months and come back to you might you just have a lot disruption of social structure

250
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:32,200
and you wind up decreased social cohesion

251
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:37,560
along that that has impact my name for Scott 's

252
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:42,580
likewise the road increases the ability to go

253
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:47,780
to your cities like the cab although it

254
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:54,860
increases the rate pathogens are reintroduced. also in

255
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:59,920
one area here which also focus on because of the thing

256
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:05,292
is increase the resources. one of that was increase in small scale farming

257
00:24:05,292 --> 00:24:10,792
poultry farming and chicken farming. um that includes eating chicken

258
00:24:10,792 --> 00:24:15,792
antibiotics as growth. therefore introducing the region

259
00:24:15,792 --> 00:24:21,152
and and what I'll be showing you data how

260
00:24:21,152 --> 00:24:27,352
you know what we found that impact

261
00:24:27,352 --> 00:24:33,272
chicken

262
00:24:33,272 --> 00:24:38,312
and so this is giving a little bit more detail in that area. I'll

263
00:24:38,312 --> 00:24:44,372
ban markers. we can see again from my more systems perspective.

264
00:24:44,372 --> 00:24:49,412
we've got two sources and about resistance or input of

265
00:24:49,412 --> 00:24:54,732
antibody and about. it wanted team human use of antibiotics hear

266
00:24:54,732 --> 00:24:59,870
that and that is brought in the household um through standard

267
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:05,370
water sanitation pathways they can get spread throughout a village throughout the region

268
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:11,130
and then there's also the end of attic used and livestock chickens in this case here

269
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:16,551
which also can increase the exposure of and I've this and either through the direct consumption

270
00:25:16,551 --> 00:25:22,471
of those chickens or the chicken contaminated.

271
00:25:22,471 --> 00:25:27,591
so that's kind of next system perspective of how we see transmission

272
00:25:27,591 --> 00:25:33,551
occurring and so um

273
00:25:33,551 --> 00:25:39,571
mangy resulting in in our study is gonna be talking about is one focus on human antibody cues

274
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:44,851
and one phone. this is actually providing

275
00:25:44,851 --> 00:25:49,931
a little bit more contact and the poultry farming and small scale farming.

276
00:25:49,931 --> 00:25:55,211
a lot of the research is focused on the impact of agriculture use of antibody large scale

277
00:25:55,211 --> 00:26:00,712
process. higher

278
00:26:00,712 --> 00:26:06,192
but this this decision to start promoting small scale farming

279
00:26:06,192 --> 00:26:11,272
as important development is something that has been going on

280
00:26:11,272 --> 00:26:16,512
for quite a while of the gates foundation is very interested in in developing the small

281
00:26:16,512 --> 00:26:22,032
scale farming is a solution to parties world either again.

282
00:26:22,032 --> 00:26:27,652
usually slamming Fannie run or small community run type of operation where

283
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:33,972
they're they're buying genetically fried chicken and have special seeds special that

284
00:26:33,972 --> 00:26:39,292
on it they're getting and about and then also a little bit

285
00:26:39,292 --> 00:26:45,812
growing. nice heavy chicken

286
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:51,073
they can sell for. so it's it's

287
00:26:51,073 --> 00:26:56,252
it's an issue with respect to an interesting issue with respect to

288
00:26:56,252 --> 00:27:03,732
kind of craving attention between economic

289
00:27:03,732 --> 00:27:08,812
and update issue that we're trying to bring up is that though this is

290
00:27:08,812 --> 00:27:14,573
added added each farm level. is not using as much and

291
00:27:14,573 --> 00:27:19,772
if you add up the amount of small scale farm globally is quite a bit

292
00:27:19,772 --> 00:27:25,412
and the exposure is quite much intensive

293
00:27:25,412 --> 00:27:30,932
right close proximity to people 's house.

294
00:27:30,932 --> 00:27:36,252
so little bit more again on this on our study site I mentioned

295
00:27:36,252 --> 00:27:42,732
it's the coastal rain forest mostly largely after I Victorian

296
00:27:42,732 --> 00:27:47,792
and tai chi so they easy influx of misuse of populations is increasing with this

297
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:53,312
road overtime. again city Goshen

298
00:27:53,312 --> 00:27:58,712
Colombian border of North the. our our board bone is our

299
00:27:58,712 --> 00:28:03,772
main study site and commercial Center. and then these are

300
00:28:03,772 --> 00:28:08,792
all the road that have been developed for the primary road is

301
00:28:08,792 --> 00:28:14,092
this road here take going from the TV and

302
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:19,712
all these other roads are second they've built over the

303
00:28:19,712 --> 00:28:25,232
fifteen twenty.

304
00:28:25,232 --> 00:28:32,302
world. you don't see that on this

305
00:28:32,302 --> 00:28:37,442
there's three main river all the

306
00:28:37,442 --> 00:28:42,982
immunity line communities

307
00:28:42,982 --> 00:28:48,102
huge long history of living in this area and if economy.

308
00:28:48,102 --> 00:28:53,142
originally it was you know your gold mining. Robert tapping hog wild

00:28:53,142 --> 00:29:00,462
all industries in which river transport without it.

310
00:29:00,462 --> 00:29:05,482
they said yes to the road shifted shifted the economy toward

311
00:29:05,482 --> 00:29:16,722
and # days and very dramatic ecological ship.

312
00:29:16,722 --> 00:29:22,382
so we decided back back in two thousand three we started to study

313
00:29:22,382 --> 00:29:27,582
and listed and enroll twenty one villages. this is a long it's longitudinal

314
00:29:27,582 --> 00:29:32,667
study at the village level following these villages from two thousand

315
00:29:32,667 --> 00:29:38,088
and three to two thousand thirteen this first phase of our study

316
00:29:38,088 --> 00:29:43,287
um each year we did a case control study in each of the twenty one villages

317
00:29:43,287 --> 00:29:48,588
are basically cut eight months to visit all twenty one villages given the remoteness of these villages. we spent

318
00:29:48,588 --> 00:29:53,907
two weeks in each of these villages doing an active surveillance and identifying all case the

319
00:29:53,907 --> 00:30:00,027
diarrhea and from there to

320
00:30:00,027 --> 00:30:07,068
educate control over these these eleven case

321
00:30:07,068 --> 00:30:12,147
or eleven cycles each village each of the twenty one villages.

322
00:30:12,147 --> 00:30:17,347
eleven time or date and then we also did an active

323
00:30:17,347 --> 00:30:22,647
surveillance in different different years and this time and

324
00:30:22,647 --> 00:30:27,807
the active surveillance you know did you do the active and correctly trained villagers in each

325
00:30:27,807 --> 00:30:32,932
of the villages to do surveillance every week house in

326
00:30:32,932 --> 00:30:38,452
their village and anybody and then I see sent them

327
00:30:38,452 --> 00:30:44,392
they and recorded it. so basic continuous

328
00:30:44,392 --> 00:30:49,612
perspective on the incident itself report in parallel

329
00:30:49,612 --> 00:30:54,612
case controls. this this is active balance the of the major major and

330
00:30:54,612 --> 00:31:02,832
that we were training these local new members actually actually

331
00:31:02,832 --> 00:31:08,712
take a lot of training set a lot that date.

332
00:31:08,712 --> 00:31:14,832
so well focus on the rest of this talk is

333
00:31:14,832 --> 00:31:21,412
is the day that was on the daily collected again I'll focus on the human data.

334
00:31:21,412 --> 00:31:26,492
and this is just kinda giving an overall sense of the level of and about resistance

335
00:31:26,492 --> 00:31:31,822
in the community forty percent of the ice but listen to one or more and just give you a sense

336
00:31:31,822 --> 00:31:40,342
of how many of these I where is in two two three four they six

337
00:31:40,342 --> 00:31:45,342
you know use a fair amount of an inactive distance in these communities even in the

338
00:31:45,342 --> 00:31:51,322
remote communities and

339
00:31:51,322 --> 00:31:56,542
when we actually did. so basically what we did was we

340
00:31:56,542 --> 00:32:01,942
you look at the stratified by remote as I mentioned we twenty one villages

341
00:32:01,942 --> 00:32:07,482
that we selected we're selected. so we had a good representation.

342
00:32:07,482 --> 00:32:12,542
need area route from an apart from

343
00:32:12,542 --> 00:32:17,781
the ones that have it what we call medium ones ever closer. we're siding

344
00:32:17,781 --> 00:32:23,802
on that and so if you actually looked at

345
00:32:23,802 --> 00:32:28,901
the relationship between um stratified by far media

346
00:32:28,901 --> 00:32:34,068
and the quotes we that those communities that were close are

347
00:32:34,068 --> 00:32:39,547
the along two time resistant to this one particular

348
00:32:39,547 --> 00:32:46,128
pair of antibiotics off the line which turned out to be the most common

349
00:32:46,128 --> 00:32:52,047
reason we have we our you know type you know aesthetic

350
00:32:52,047 --> 00:32:57,408
so we see that relationship and we saw that and we've seen this in the context

351
00:32:57,408 --> 00:33:02,448
of pathogen more pathogen transmission. we seen this in the context.

352
00:33:02,448 --> 00:33:07,448
Darryl disease. we ` seen this in the context nutrition

353
00:33:07,448 --> 00:33:14,254
very consistently we got those close villages more

354
00:33:14,254 --> 00:33:19,854
and so in the context of just thinking about and about resistance

355
00:33:19,854 --> 00:33:25,594
um. we look at some possible estimates in the spatial patterns one wise

356
00:33:25,594 --> 00:33:30,934
and about excuse but the differential across. please give me make sense.

357
00:33:30,934 --> 00:33:36,674
we see can receiving more and have more active

358
00:33:36,674 --> 00:33:42,494
local second is that spread the of antibiotics and resistance and gene transfer

359
00:33:42,494 --> 00:33:48,754
was differential across. we see more transmission and the potentially

360
00:33:48,754 --> 00:33:54,654
in let's say the roe versus mocha

361
00:33:54,654 --> 00:34:00,474
reintroduction is Anna Vasquez I'm an erotic resistant bacteria

362
00:34:00,474 --> 00:34:08,854
and other potential nation that we're seeing reader the do.

363
00:34:08,854 --> 00:34:14,812
so in order to look at that. we first looked at and about if you'd

364
00:34:14,812 --> 00:34:19,992
which was uh and this is Dan about you know percent people that report using

365
00:34:19,992 --> 00:34:27,652
it about it in the past week. um and a quick differential across the product.

366
00:34:27,652 --> 00:34:33,592
you know overall maybe like ten percent of the people that yet

367
00:34:33,592 --> 00:34:41,792
the fair amount of and about a use important thing there is no trend turns out that

368
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:47,732
are very effective in getting into work getting through all these immunities the of road

369
00:34:47,732 --> 00:34:54,852
and remote communities that turned out to have as much access

370
00:34:54,852 --> 00:35:01,292
less. so and not accusing itself is not explaining seeing.

371
00:35:01,292 --> 00:35:06,332
so the next question was just to tease apart it

372
00:35:06,332 --> 00:35:11,632
two other ideas about the transmission being differential or injection or any reduction

373
00:35:11,632 --> 00:35:18,140
being differential. and we look developed a

374
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:23,840
mechanistic transmission model in order address this question. um

375
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:29,300
where the model basically just drives the fact that people and gas

376
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:34,440
resistant bacteria and that I'm showing here

377
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:39,740
with the rate of land at rate a of land and then they got the bacteria can be

378
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:45,220
either France Italy. so. so initially when you ingest bacteria those bacteria

379
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:50,940
are transients are not necessarily stable in your guy for me last

380
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:56,021
day or so and that's it. some

381
00:35:56,021 --> 00:36:01,280
of those made and the colonized

382
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:06,380
so ones that actually are actually adapting. well adapted to your guy would

383
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:14,220
then be calling and and they stay along for a while in both cases

384
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:19,401
the idea that bacteria are amplified it in about IQ so taking antibiotics like

385
00:36:19,401 --> 00:36:25,121
to then select selectively kill off the susceptible and

386
00:36:25,121 --> 00:36:30,321
will amplify the end of my the things in your guy and so in this model of the real

387
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:35,361
antibiotic location and these animals live

388
00:36:35,361 --> 00:36:40,401
bacteria they say then get transmitted to other people

389
00:36:40,401 --> 00:36:47,641
through standard water sanitation mission

390
00:36:47,641 --> 00:36:53,720
so so we cook this model and we actually

391
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:59,561
primary type that we actually estimated parameters of transmission.

392
00:36:59,561 --> 00:37:05,281
that's beta and eight as well as an automatic row using data that we collected

393
00:37:05,281 --> 00:37:10,361
from from our side and

394
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:15,552
we did that for both in about a use in transmission and so and when we pry

395
00:37:15,552 --> 00:37:23,193
advertise those and selected values based on our data.

396
00:37:23,193 --> 00:37:28,272
we came up with this result which I'll walk you this basically

397
00:37:28,272 --> 00:37:33,792
is grass showing on the Y axis the radio transmission rate.

398
00:37:33,792 --> 00:37:39,853
hello versus far as how much increased transmission is there on the road villages

399
00:37:39,853 --> 00:37:45,133
villages and then ask ask this is that ratio of introduction

400
00:37:45,133 --> 00:37:50,213
rate for the introduction of bacteria so how much more bacteria is

401
00:37:50,213 --> 00:37:55,633
being introduced outside and Road Village

402
00:37:55,633 --> 00:38:01,633
and the colors are basically the results that I showed you and you slide before

403
00:38:01,633 --> 00:38:09,393
which was how much more and about us every see you know Road Village versus

404
00:38:09,393 --> 00:38:16,458
redwood quite a bit more Lou

405
00:38:16,458 --> 00:38:21,599
and so the most interesting thing here is an antibody about excuse which is normally

406
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:26,958
thought of that main the effect for an about an assistant is actually in effect modifier

407
00:38:26,958 --> 00:38:32,059
it's actually determining whether or not the introduction of passage

408
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:37,859
in from the outside world is explaining that versus transmission.

409
00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:43,299
and so basically it's an amount of use is low a really doesn't matter what the ratio

410
00:38:43,299 --> 00:38:48,319
of transmission rates are with respect to the pattern we see it's

411
00:38:48,319 --> 00:38:54,859
all about the introduction of an IQ 's is high. the opposite.

412
00:38:54,859 --> 00:39:00,079
so if provided us with the way to think about it what is the role

413
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:06,938
about used versus these other mechanism. contact what

414
00:39:06,938 --> 00:39:12,677
you know region. so

415
00:39:12,677 --> 00:39:19,136
jumping too quickly to our chicken on

416
00:39:19,136 --> 00:39:24,296
our chicken worked with had a magnificent this is like this is again example I mention these

417
00:39:24,296 --> 00:39:30,536
that one. nice one. broiled chicken that people raised to sell

418
00:39:30,536 --> 00:39:35,976
these are genetically bred chickens and they're being fed antibiotics as growth and this is

419
00:39:35,976 --> 00:39:41,156
looks a little bigger I think I'm in our Ronnie little backyard chicken that's

420
00:39:41,156 --> 00:39:46,276
running around and ask Gavin very and nice

421
00:39:46,276 --> 00:39:51,749
probably you as much calories. so um

422
00:39:51,749 --> 00:39:56,788
these guys are roaming around freely in the community and in houses these are

423
00:39:56,788 --> 00:40:02,448
generally gotten confined

424
00:40:02,448 --> 00:40:07,448
so here's just the design we we basically looked at check for credit. we saw the

425
00:40:07,448 --> 00:40:12,448
production chickens on the chickens that are farmed the back household chickens are those backyard chickens

426
00:40:12,448 --> 00:40:18,229
that are that are running around in

427
00:40:18,229 --> 00:40:23,749
and that along in the community and production chickens are limited to people that actually

428
00:40:23,749 --> 00:40:29,068
have the resources actually buy those chickens and take some initial resources

429
00:40:29,068 --> 00:40:34,408
actually create small-scale chicken whereas household

430
00:40:34,408 --> 00:40:40,308
chickens are very and then so then we also

431
00:40:40,308 --> 00:40:45,608
look at CNN. um that those that were associated with production

432
00:40:45,608 --> 00:40:50,684
of chicken and these farming conditions and also

433
00:40:50,684 --> 00:40:55,804
those those household. either I tried toll

434
00:40:55,804 --> 00:41:00,884
number um that were enrolled in this daddy

435
00:41:00,884 --> 00:41:05,944
and we kind this was collecting over time. but this analysis

436
00:41:05,944 --> 00:41:11,064
I'm gonna show is also a cross section comparing productions you can

437
00:41:11,064 --> 00:41:18,704
also check and comparing humans.

438
00:41:18,704 --> 00:41:23,884
so the first results of that we see elevated level and production check and

439
00:41:23,884 --> 00:41:28,924
not. we see them both. you know typically

440
00:41:28,924 --> 00:41:34,244
I would this is a receipt them you know typically that's what this is and probably most importantly

441
00:41:34,244 --> 00:41:39,404
to the story of our neighbors all that we see that any

442
00:41:39,404 --> 00:41:44,484
expression of the CNN Bronson in Negron is a genetic mechanism which

443
00:41:44,484 --> 00:41:49,709
makes it much more vision for a bacteria to get to attract and

444
00:41:49,709 --> 00:41:54,909
and about and so if you guys have a bacteria has vinegar on.

445
00:41:54,909 --> 00:42:01,909
it it's much easier for notches resistance at one

446
00:42:01,909 --> 00:42:08,270
possible and so this became a big important finding for even

447
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:13,990
chickens that were associated production. we're more likely to

448
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:19,289
check in and we see if this is just you know type differences across

449
00:42:19,289 --> 00:42:29,469
different antibiotics. again not surprisingly a lot resistant

450
00:42:29,469 --> 00:42:34,869
and then if we look at the human is not quite as drastic of a difference I still consistent

451
00:42:34,869 --> 00:42:42,209
and erotic though it's human. so if they would production check higher than

452
00:42:42,209 --> 00:42:48,089
household check. we see that for both genetic you know Quebec

453
00:42:48,089 --> 00:42:53,208
and interestingly we have what we look genetically at the strains

454
00:42:53,208 --> 00:42:58,468
of bacteria we see that there are quite similar between humans the back

455
00:42:58,468 --> 00:43:03,868
taken and the productions you can suggest

456
00:43:03,868 --> 00:43:08,868
things that prevent us on evidence is looking at one particular antibiotic some evidence

457
00:43:08,868 --> 00:43:14,728
that there is fellow from and about seeing house

458
00:43:14,728 --> 00:43:22,528
production checking into the house of check human

459
00:43:22,528 --> 00:43:27,848
this slide here is um we're looking

460
00:43:27,848 --> 00:43:32,948
at the relationship between the

461
00:43:32,948 --> 00:43:37,948
impact of having I factory happening in the

462
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:43,048
garage and back and whether or not. chicken in the house

463
00:43:43,048 --> 00:43:48,048
chicken of and so this is just go exactly that's resolved so it's

464
00:43:48,048 --> 00:43:53,443
a biological possibility we see that there are some antibiotics which have this kind of pattern

465
00:43:53,443 --> 00:43:59,043
that basically if we if there's if they

466
00:43:59,043 --> 00:44:04,223
express and then grind. they are what

467
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:09,643
kind of seven likely to have cells methos and

468
00:44:09,643 --> 00:44:15,163
that clearly is the most important feature though

469
00:44:15,163 --> 00:44:20,283
farming has a little bit of any really whether or not you have the and

470
00:44:20,283 --> 00:44:25,403
this else sauce in the is all along with a few other and about it. if this

471
00:44:25,403 --> 00:44:30,703
makes sense because subject also has a physical link to the answer and so we expect

472
00:44:30,703 --> 00:44:36,063
to see this relationship with softness off for another group

473
00:44:36,063 --> 00:44:41,243
of antibiotics we seem up much

474
00:44:41,243 --> 00:44:46,583
more and added. so if you have that um the presence of any on. you have

475
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:51,768
a certain increased risk resistant. um and then

476
00:44:51,768 --> 00:44:57,488
if you are a production check grabbing you by basically having out. so

477
00:44:57,488 --> 00:45:02,628
within the class of antibiotic. they are. there's no physical link like there

478
00:45:02,628 --> 00:45:07,648
in the south in the south cell but they're much more associated and connected with these any

479
00:45:07,648 --> 00:45:13,427
of any other antibiotics and then the third.

480
00:45:13,427 --> 00:45:18,548
so there's a synergistic effect really there's very little happening in my

481
00:45:18,548 --> 00:45:25,648
third closing anytime. so this kinda goes to a

482
00:45:25,648 --> 00:45:30,708
possibility and then

483
00:45:30,708 --> 00:45:36,128
the last there's only one who was wanted to show you is this evidence for environmental

484
00:45:36,128 --> 00:45:41,868
transmission. so here at the relationship between

485
00:45:41,868 --> 00:45:46,927
house sold chicken that reside in villages where

486
00:45:46,927 --> 00:45:53,812
there is production farming compared to household chicken that in reside villages where there is no production

487
00:45:53,812 --> 00:45:59,832
these household chicken in both cases. neither of which had direct exposure

488
00:45:59,832 --> 00:46:04,972
my fellow chicken that live in communities with the production check and even though the production

489
00:46:04,972 --> 00:46:10,072
chickens are any more likely have a higher levels and

490
00:46:10,072 --> 00:46:15,352
record this and send a check or not and so that's

491
00:46:15,352 --> 00:46:20,752
remote this idea that there is some vinyl transmission occurring within

492
00:46:20,752 --> 00:46:25,932
the check and then some spillover is actually occurring not just him taking the human from

493
00:46:25,932 --> 00:46:30,944
farming chicken to use backyard chicken and one

494
00:46:30,944 --> 00:46:36,124
thing I want to highlight sonic work that graduate student Hayden had

495
00:46:36,124 --> 00:46:41,264
and we just finished his work. he was looking act he was interested in actually

496
00:46:41,264 --> 00:46:46,404
looking at chicken movement data to help explain. three active he Jeep provides to put

497
00:46:46,404 --> 00:46:51,584
a GPS unit on five chicken. the pilot

498
00:46:51,584 --> 00:46:56,784
study and white and recorded where they were owned and collected

499
00:46:56,784 --> 00:47:02,064
huge amount today. I think every every second date.

500
00:47:02,064 --> 00:47:07,404
the so edge same thing and the gist of that result is that chickens move a fair amount set

501
00:47:07,404 --> 00:47:12,884
on average this the mean on average they're moving six seventeen meters from their

502
00:47:12,884 --> 00:47:17,944
household and households are separated in the same community on every five fifteen. so

503
00:47:17,944 --> 00:47:23,104
we can see that chickens can play actually a big role. they're not just hanging out

504
00:47:23,104 --> 00:47:28,164
in their one household their move. thank you play a big role in transmitting

505
00:47:28,164 --> 00:47:35,747
environment transmission so

506
00:47:35,747 --> 00:47:41,807
I mean collusion of this piece one piece that I I didn't emphasize

507
00:47:41,807 --> 00:47:46,867
but I think is a really critical pieces that the importance of the of the

508
00:47:46,867 --> 00:47:52,267
results that we found that these genetic mobile element and figure on the underground that are

509
00:47:52,267 --> 00:47:57,307
able to track and about Chris and Jean Judy 's bacteria and

510
00:47:57,307 --> 00:48:02,727
help protect them from antibiotics. is something that we're seeing

511
00:48:02,727 --> 00:48:08,587
as a as a very significant relationship between farming

512
00:48:08,587 --> 00:48:14,407
and this expression of the and we think biologically that has the fact that

513
00:48:14,407 --> 00:48:19,687
the chickens are being fed antibiotics continuously through the speed

514
00:48:19,687 --> 00:48:24,687
the companies that are putting out of action if need are changing antibodies the continuous basically find a

515
00:48:24,687 --> 00:48:29,825
cheaper and place it in for the chickens or notches being exposed to one antibiotic

516
00:48:29,825 --> 00:48:36,705
they're just being exposed to a broad spectrum and and from an evolutionary perspective

517
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:41,825
expressing anybody's gonna be the best way to protect your bacteria protect to

518
00:48:41,825 --> 00:48:47,205
yourself from a broad spectrum and about IQ so one of the messages from this work

519
00:48:47,205 --> 00:48:53,705
is that it's not just about the volume or the mounds of antibiotics. it is about

520
00:48:53,705 --> 00:48:58,965
the spectrum and about being in this explains the fact and he actually complicates

521
00:48:58,965 --> 00:49:04,245
the fact that just by stopping using this particular antibiotic.

522
00:49:04,245 --> 00:49:10,325
you may not see a decrease in an Iraqi citizens of because of

523
00:49:10,325 --> 00:49:17,225
compensatory neck and so

524
00:49:17,225 --> 00:49:22,505
they said the second result is our conclusion is just to reemphasize the fact that we

525
00:49:22,505 --> 00:49:27,525
when we're thinking about what we can do about this question we do have to appreciate the fact

526
00:49:27,525 --> 00:49:33,577
there's a tension between why do why this

527
00:49:33,577 --> 00:49:38,577
health implications. thank you about kind of interventions and we're starting to

528
00:49:38,577 --> 00:49:43,577
think about times intervention idea and

529
00:49:43,577 --> 00:49:48,637
then just lastly reconnecting this work and my persistence and

530
00:49:48,637 --> 00:49:53,857
and chickens and human with one how this is

531
00:49:53,857 --> 00:49:59,137
the one help is really a call floor combine surveillance of human animal on the environment

532
00:49:59,137 --> 00:50:04,297
I think we have to think more about that in in these kinds of disease transmissions that

533
00:50:04,297 --> 00:50:12,077
are public out. need to be thinking more about animals and and the environment

534
00:50:12,077 --> 00:50:17,677
water sanitation infrastructure can use be used to minimize that in environmental transmission

535
00:50:17,677 --> 00:50:23,057
of anabolic resistance and psychological essential

536
00:50:23,057 --> 00:50:28,115
and I just wanna end here the fact that you know to wanted collect these kinda date

537
00:50:28,115 --> 00:50:33,735
in this kind of this kind of scale takes a lot. a big team

538
00:50:33,735 --> 00:50:39,055
and so I wanted to thank our Ecuadorian team

539
00:50:39,055 --> 00:50:44,775
reside both in Chico and also again we've we've hired quite a bit local people

540
00:50:44,775 --> 00:50:49,915
feel seeing all the health promoters of these villages that contributed to

541
00:50:49,915 --> 00:51:20,475
a lot of

542
00:51:20,475 --> 00:51:27,423
I think with the tired

543
00:51:27,423 --> 00:51:41,683
who I mean

544
00:51:41,683 --> 00:51:47,163
I mean I think they're they're they're pretty different I don't have a they are yeah

545
00:51:47,163 --> 00:51:52,663
and these these I mean they're they're really grad to

546
00:51:52,663 --> 00:52:02,703
one farm chickens

547
00:52:02,703 --> 00:52:08,083
that yes and that is a big issue with respect to we see a lot of movement but

548
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:13,103
this kind of activity and a lot of it has to do with it doesn't take much day.

549
00:52:13,103 --> 00:52:18,243
yes. disease is Brad an epidemic the make

550
00:52:18,243 --> 00:52:24,243
population it and then there's that family left when they need to reinvest

551
00:52:24,243 --> 00:52:29,787
in new chicken and sides we do see that

552
00:52:29,787 --> 00:52:41,909
likely because

553
00:52:41,909 --> 00:52:48,398
okay
