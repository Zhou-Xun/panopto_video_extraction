1
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:24,900
Laura Power: So how's everybody doing this afternoon, welcome to class get your videos on let's see let's get some energy going.

2
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:36,420
Laura Power: hi everybody it's nice to see you I don't know about you guys, but in well, maybe For those of you who have class in the morning i've been attached to my computer all day too so it's good to.

3
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:42,360
Laura Power: get some energy and say hello how's everybody doing today.

4
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,670
Laura Power: doing good.

5
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:53,880
Laura Power: All right, ready so today i'm trying to get your energy up because Dave going to be a little bit of a shift from how we've been talking before we started off with.

6
00:00:53,880 --> 00:01:00,240
Laura Power: Some very you know general leadership and public health, three point also kind of Nice concepts we've got to.

7
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:16,530
Laura Power: Think about our own you insight into ourselves into leadership and now we're going to delve into the idea of systems thinking and understanding systems and so it's actually I think are really nice concept and.

8
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:24,900
Laura Power: It starts to make sense when you really get it if you're not if you're not familiar with the idea of thinking and systems and using systems thinking gimbal deep.

9
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:42,990
Laura Power: And are times in this lecture will kind of get into what might seem like the weeds of Problem Solving and thinking, but I actually really enjoyed this and I hope that thinking through this will inspire you to think more about it, first let me just ask the Group.

10
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:48,450
Laura Power: who's familiar with systems thinking.

11
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:53,820
Laura Power: I see a couple of heads there I see Victoria, Kate.

12
00:01:53,820 --> 00:02:07,320
Laura Power: Do you guys want and Laura and I feel like maybe do you hear about the something i'd like to maybe hear a little bit more like what your experiences with it, or how you've used it or thought about it before.

13
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,500
Laura Grage: I would just say this is Laura.

14
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:18,720
Laura Grage: One of my instructors used it extensively in our environmental health course for my mph.

15
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,800
Laura Power: some excellent.

16
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,240
Laura Power: That is where you often come with a lot of times the five in the environmental health.

17
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:34,260
Laura Power: Setting so okay great well lori please feel free to add in ideas are other ways, and I think there's a lot of different approaches to it, so please do.

18
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,570
feel free to add to that.

19
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,880
Laura Power: Victoria, Kate I thought you both nod your heads.

20
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,800
Laura Power: To go okay.

21
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:50,160
Kate E Schedel: yeah we have my we're currently working on a teen pregnancy prevention grant and it's a collaborative agreement, which means the federal funders are really involved.

22
00:02:50,160 --> 00:03:05,100
Kate E Schedel: They are really into systems thinking, they have asked us to think about like multiple leverage points that can reduce teen pregnancy so it's not just directly working with teens and education, but how are we are we working with health systems with Community.

23
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:19,620
Kate E Schedel: You know, social services providers places where kids are involved or anyone that serves youth in general, so it's serious it's just a it's sort of like a Community saturation not just reaching out to teens.

24
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,490
Laura Power: And they asked.

25
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:23,700
Laura Power: I do certain tools or like, how do you do.

26
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,070
Laura Power: The systems, thinking that.

27
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:33,330
Kate E Schedel: We have so many tools we have many so many tools, but Community mapping asset mapping.

28
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:41,100
Kate E Schedel: system support mapping, I mean just that we have to do about a new homework assignment every other week it seems.

29
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,760
Laura Power: yeah fascinating and Victoria how about you, you look like you're.

30
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,290
Laura Power: nodding in agreement there.

31
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:54,900
Victoria Walker: yeah my introduction, was there, like a coin on collaborative addressing say sleep so looking at all the different.

32
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:05,760
Victoria Walker: I guess what I got from the social, ecological model like who all can we tap into to make a difference, so looking at churches, looking at health care providers, looking at the family unit and then.

33
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:13,620
Victoria Walker: I work well, I sit on the State health improvement committee for our FAB accreditations so we're constantly thinking about systems thinking.

34
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:25,080
Victoria Walker: As we build out our strategic plan for the next couple of years and then my work as a child different view coordinator, I have many different agencies as sit on that committee reviewing deaths to reduce.

35
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:42,060
Victoria Walker: infant, child injuries and so everybody is a system and it's understanding, whose role, who can affect this policy who's doing this type of work, where does your system in and the other one picks up, especially when you start looking at child abuse cases that it gets very complicated quickly.

36
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:58,680
Laura Power: And do you use it is it a formal we do use it like in a formal approach, or is this something you've just kind of built into your practice them again as you're working together and collaborating and trying to address these really complex issues, how do you pull it in.

37
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:12,870
Victoria Walker: um it's been kind of like learn as you go for me, especially when I started as a child depth review coordinator, because that was my first time working with so many different agencies that are not directly tied to help a lot of my title policy.

38
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:24,330
Victoria Walker: and are more like given direct services in the Community for different you know, social services and so I really had to like learn where people fit into the big picture.

39
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:27,720
Victoria Walker: And then, as we work on our recommendations for the N report.

40
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:35,370
Victoria Walker: leveraging their understanding and knowledge of the policy landscape in Mississippi and how we can craft better recommendations so let's kind of learn as you go.

41
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:52,320
Victoria Walker: I if there are tools, I think that would be helpful to kind of leverage the work i'm doing now, with the point we did to license systems thinking mapping and that was helpful, especially when it, but it was also kind of challenging at times too yeah.

42
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,960
Laura Power: I have a feeling from from what i've learned about it and kind of heard about it too.

43
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:10,560
Laura Power: I think that sounds like it goes sometimes it's like learning as you go lots of different ways of doing it, and can be like many iterative processes and trying to get to.

44
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,620
Laura Power: A common understanding and I I feel like this, all fits in you know we're public health 3.0.

45
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:25,230
Laura Power: Cross sector collaboration we talked about collective leadership and collective impact and a lot of that is about having a shared understanding.

46
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:33,810
Laura Power: And having also as we'll talk about today, understanding, then like unintended consequences or other things that happened from actions that you do and different.

47
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:46,800
Laura Power: policies or procedures that are put in place and systems thinking is to help us try to at least understand or foresee are trying to prevent unintended consequences, especially negative ones.

48
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:57,000
Laura Power: So, as I learned about it, it when I first got into trying to understand systems thinking, I was kind of overwhelmed with it all these ideas so many list of tools and.

49
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:05,040
Laura Power: What i've come to take away and we say I find it most useful it's just that it's a way of thinking and it's a way of approaching.

50
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:15,360
Laura Power: difficult situations and way of organizing and getting people on the same page in some ways I think of it as a way of brainstorming and then helping us but but it's a way to really get to the bigger picture.

51
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:21,120
Laura Power: and bring about shared understandings and the tools have to do a lot with.

52
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:31,980
Laura Power: A lot of types of mapping as well, Kate inventory of just described it's often and Laura said to her you environmental health studies, you know it's often just how things are.

53
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:36,300
Laura Power: You map things out how you see things and how you think about the connectedness.

54
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:41,220
Laura Power: So it can get you know when you I know when I first started learning you, I think.

55
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:48,660
Laura Power: Later I have a slide that shows this too, but you know it starts to feel kind of overwhelming you first start to learn about it, but then, when you get what it really is like.

56
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:53,370
Laura Power: Okay, this is just really seeing the big picture and helping me know how to do that.

57
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:58,740
Laura Power: that's where it's like Okay, this is actually not that overwhelming and it's a good tool to have.

58
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:14,580
Laura Power: And I think it fits in, especially when we're thinking about a class about leadership, about being strategic and planning and having vision, it really is important to understand how everything fits in together so that's how i'm leading into this today and.

59
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:28,320
Laura Power: But it will include some I don't know I think it's a little bit deeper discussion and I always every time I prepare her this lecture I always go into rabbit holes are reading about complex problems and mapping systems and.

60
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:36,300
Laura Power: I find it fascinating and also you can definitely get into a rabbit hole so i'm going to take you down the rabbit hole a little bit, but then I hope i'll bring you back out.

61
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:41,010
Laura Power: To just see that you know these are just it's a nice way of thinking about things.

62
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:48,300
Laura Power: Before we dive into the lecture First, I just wanted to have each group share, you know yesterday at the end of the day, you are.

63
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:57,540
Laura Power: selecting the public health talented you're all going to work on and so i've seen them and maybe you could each share out just so you all know what the groups are working on.

64
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:08,190
Laura Power: So somebody from the first team from my optimizer is what What did you want to tell the group what you're working on.

65
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:18,780
Samantha Lyons: we're we're gonna focus a little bit on vaccine hesitancy and then we're just trying to figure out how to narrow it down in the context of the club in 19 pandemic excellent.

66
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:35,370
Laura Power: I think that will be a very good one to think about especially especially to use that today, thinking about systems will be a lot of inputs and outputs that you can think about for that so that's a good one team to the midwesterners.

67
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:50,160
Anthony Mack: We are going to be looking at the topic of maternal mortality, specifically in Texas, but we also thought that would be a good topic to choose, because it is applicable to a extremely global scale.

68
00:09:50,160 --> 00:10:01,230
Anthony Mack: We have numbers working, both at the local and global sectors, so it helps to be able to create that type from the smaller community to community at large.

69
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:02,850
Laura Power: yeah I think it'll be a great one really.

70
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:05,010
Important.

71
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:15,210
Laura Power: You know just, especially with you in your team, you have people working on this, I think this will be a nice way to really practice this in class i'm glad you guys chose that.

72
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:19,470
Laura Power: team three the masters of none.

73
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:23,070
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: you're going to look at.

74
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:33,810
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: insulin and how we can like solve the problem, the United States, of the lack of insulin for patients that do not have insurance are under insured.

75
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:47,850
Laura Power: that's a great one that's a really great one thing about this, all the systems in play for access to something like insulin to people who needed so there'll be a good one, one of the system structures, I think about there.

76
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:52,380
Laura Power: And team for our FAB five.

77
00:10:52,380 --> 00:11:02,460
Gabriel Gardner: Our topic is centered around promoting equity amongst knowledge of breastfeeding, and we did that, because a good number of our Group members have a background in.

78
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:11,550
Gabriel Gardner: The maternal field of public health, so we wanted to create you know, a project Center around looking at breastfeeding, and how to increase in knowledge and education on it.

79
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,180
Laura Power: perfect.

80
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,670
Laura Power: yeah I think this will be great and it's great that you've.

81
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:22,410
Laura Power: chosen topics that either kind of fit into work you're doing or interesting you have, so I think that that will be good and he's all.

82
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:29,370
Laura Power: can be complex problems as we'll talk about and can benefit from systems thinking.

83
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:42,570
Laura Power: And so to let me just review the canvas page with you, so we all see what we're what we got up for today, so we are on day three.

84
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:51,330
Laura Power: And we basically will do some lecture in a little activity which will be more of an individual activity, this time.

85
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:59,520
Laura Power: And then we'll take a break and we'll come back and so the first part is more about like just systems and thinking about the components of a system.

86
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:06,090
Laura Power: And then we'll get kind of deep into it, where we think about causal diagrams and understanding the behavior and the system.

87
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:15,030
Laura Power: will take a break and then we'll come back and then we'll think more about systems thinking in general kind of the intro we just had like what is it, how do we use it or the different tools.

88
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:34,320
Laura Power: And then you'll come together as your team and you'll think about mapping the system using some kind of tool, whether it's a more advanced cause a loop diagram that you've started earlier or some other type of visualization tool to do systems thinking so that's the plan for today.

89
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,160
Laura Power: The times here will be our kind of an estimate, I have a feeling the lecture.

90
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:54,960
Laura Power: will go for a little bit then we'll I think I had changes, a little bit so i'm just going to have you do something individual first and we'll see how much time sounds right for you will come back reflect we'll take a break do more, a little more lecture and then let's work on this together.

91
00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:03,930
Laura Power: Like I said, for those of you miss it I just uploaded the slide So if you might need to refresh your canvas page if you don't see the link there for the day three slides.

92
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:13,350
Laura Power: And lots of lots of resources, here too I do want to point out, just as we kind of go through there's you know many papers pointed out.

93
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:25,740
Laura Power: I will, whereas dylan meadows do I do talk about her alive and she said, so this is a special in the environmental health world, I know, or if you're familiar with, vanilla meadows, but she.

94
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:37,860
Laura Power: Has the book thinking and systems of primer she's often cited when talking about systems thinking so that's just a nice primer the fair and you can download that.

95
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:45,480
Laura Power: And then there's a whole bunch of sort of think tanks that kind of curate their own tools for systems thinking.

96
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:50,010
Laura Power: we're going to be playing with loopy a little bit later and there's some other.

97
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:56,250
Laura Power: Free things like bubble us to make content there's all kinds of tools and they're getting to be more and more especially as we've been like.

98
00:13:56,250 --> 00:14:04,080
Laura Power: All in the virtual world and having to collaborate, you know digitally there's there's other things that are out there, too, and these are some of them.

99
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:12,990
Laura Power: So just different tools here, so you can kind of pick through those there's another one to the CDC is actually pretty into systems thinking and they have a whole.

100
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:22,800
Laura Power: web page dedicated to this as well and i've you'll see in the slides I fold some stuff out from that, but just want to point out the resources there.

101
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,980
Laura Power: So i'm like a plan.

102
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:31,920
Laura Power: Alright, so let's do it, so let me get let me get.

103
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,740
Laura Power: lean okay.

104
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:45,150
Laura Power: So I like to start off with this quote the 21st century is full of complex and perplexing problems that have proven tough to solve pandemics, and this was from before.

105
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:55,740
Laura Power: pandemics market crashes global warming, poverty and crime, if these problems could be explained by simple cause and effect relationships we'd have a solution by now.

106
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:07,350
Laura Power: And then I always like to ask tell me what what's the difference between complicated and complex with simple was complicated what's complex.

107
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:22,860
Laura Power: I know my normal conversation I tend to use the words complicated and complex interchangeably but they're actually different does anybody want to try to explain what something is it's complicated and give me what something that's complex.

108
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:35,220
Aliyah Abdul-Wakil: hey, this is a Leah um I would say that when I think of complex I think of something that has like multiple layers to it it's multifaceted.

109
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:46,080
Aliyah Abdul-Wakil: Not necessarily that it's difficult to do but there's just like several layers but then complicated to me it gives a sense of difficulty.

110
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,300
Laura Power: Okay interesting yeah I like your interpretation of.

111
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,710
Just.

112
00:15:49,710 --> 00:16:01,170
Laura Power: One the difficulty versus maybe not so hard but lots of where so that's one way of looking at it, I like that other thoughts.

113
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:06,990
Laura Power: At this picture here too, so like a rocket going to the moon i'll tell you there's an analogy there.

114
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:19,050
Laura Power: Maybe some of you have seen it before.

115
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:23,430
Laura Power: Probably many of you are like me and you might just use complicated and complex kind of.

116
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:31,020
Laura Power: You know, in your vocabulary kind of interchangeably, but when you start thinking about Problem Solving and reading about this a little bit more.

117
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:41,460
Laura Power: it's kind of lines up with what we'll do is saying that complex can be very messy lots of layers often when something is said to be complicated.

118
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:53,250
Laura Power: there's there's an answer somewhere might be really hard like you were saying earlier, there, there may be a lot of steps like getting the rocket you know flying to the moon, that is definitely not easy that's really hard.

119
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:59,280
Laura Power: But there's a technical answer there's a way to do it, there are experts out there that can solve that problem.

120
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:12,660
Laura Power: So it can be done and there's a there are ways to do it it's it's um experts can solve that but complex, you know there's not necessarily a right answer there's many layers like you said aaliyah.

121
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:23,160
Laura Power: Often, some examples, when you compare a simple complicated and complex simple as like, how do you bake cookies you follow a recipe it's pretty simple not too many layers to it.

122
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:31,950
Laura Power: That simple complicated is often the example flying to the moon and complex the example is often raising a child.

123
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:39,720
Laura Power: Something like that, like how to raise a child into a you know, an adult and get them to be a functional adult that's complex.

124
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:50,310
Laura Power: You know there's there's not one right way to do it there's a lot of different layers to that so complex is kind of means it's really messy and difficult.

125
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:57,990
Laura Power: Maybe difficult and just because it's messy and there's not really one is the right way of doing things.

126
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:08,730
Laura Power: I think it's important to start with this framework, because it has to do with Problem Solving and thinking through, especially as a leader and especially as public health leaders addressing.

127
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:20,580
Laura Power: complex problems, you may be faced with things that are simple like you know baking a cookie maybe not in public health, but just.

128
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:31,260
Laura Power: You know, maybe for making I don't know supplying giving medications or something that's more simple like Okay, this is the answer, like.

129
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:41,400
Laura Power: it's an STI, and this is a treatment and I need to get this done but then maybe it's more you know complicated the different maybe the person has.

130
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:52,740
Laura Power: An allergy to penicillin so there's a lot of different layers that come about in a complicated problem and you need experts and you need to console people to figure out what's the right way to give medication.

131
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:59,130
Laura Power: But maybe there's a challenge with access, so I that person may be able to show up to clinic or.

132
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:13,080
Laura Power: You know there there's a lot of things that are complex that will come into that and sometimes leaders are faced with having to make decisions, and you have to figure out what was done, are you in are you.

133
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:24,090
Laura Power: facing a simple more technical challenge, or even a complicated technical challenge, are you in something that's more complex with these messy problems.

134
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:32,970
Laura Power: And sometimes you don't know where your assets can be considered chaotic, so what you know we walk into a situation, you have to figure out what's going on.

135
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:49,950
Laura Power: i've heard examples of this, even like you some like a paramedic coming into a house to help somebody and when they see oh they're like leg is obviously broken Okay, simple, I know what I gotta do I gotta fix that but maybe you know somebody is.

136
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:58,410
Laura Power: There not sure what's wrong, we don't feel good, and you have to you have to you have to gain more information for sense and analyze and respond to what the situation is.

137
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:15,960
Laura Power: Or maybe you're facing something where the person is not even able to give you any information they are not awake they are not conscious and you have to just assess what's going on, you might walk into that house trying to figure out where you're at, and then you can.

138
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:31,200
Laura Power: From there kind of reduce which way how you do your problem solving so this this framework that i'm pointing to here is called the seven framework has anyone use this or or seen this before.

139
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,520
Laura Power: For anybody okay any thumbs up.

140
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:50,730
Laura Power: Okay, this is the rabbit hole i'm about to take you on, so please come along with me on this one, I think this is a very interesting thing for those of you facing challenging problems or just faced with decision making.

141
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:57,090
Laura Power: You know, in your leadership roles, or just in your work like understanding, where you're at and how to respond.

142
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:10,620
Laura Power: I am going to show you a video this is definitely a little bit of a rabbit hole by weren't you this was going to happen today we're going in a little bit of a rabbit hole, and this is one of them, but I have found i've kind of found this fascinating when I.

143
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:14,700
Laura Power: got into this, so let me just share this.

144
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,340
Ahya Sajawal Ali: just trying to share something that.

145
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,540
Laura Power: I believe.

146
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:32,490
Ahya Sajawal Ali: And i'm like when the Arctic i'm thinking a little bit about the pandemic and how the hospital's had to respond in the sense that we just looked at prior knowledge and we put on masks and.

147
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:44,670
Ahya Sajawal Ali: The whole hazmat suits and all of that, and after that, when enough information was available, we went in decreased on the urgency to just math and stuff so.

148
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:53,280
Ahya Sajawal Ali: make sense that chaotic needs to be acted on first and then later on the response rate against them.

149
00:21:53,280 --> 00:22:08,130
Laura Power: yeah I think that's a great example of thinking about responding when there's unknown uncertainty, where are we what i've been breaking it down, depending on what you're facing you know breaking it down into some of the parts, while trying to see the big picture, at the same.

150
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:11,670
Laura Power: Time and understanding how you need to respond.

151
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:20,340
Laura Power: So I definitely agree and maybe you're all kind of thinking through like situations and are these complicated complex simple so.

152
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:31,530
Laura Power: Please come along with me and my rabbit hole here, but I want to show you because i've learned about the connivance first I started googling because I had no idea how to pronounce this word it as well and it's Kevin and I learned that from this video.

153
00:22:31,530 --> 00:23:06,270
Laura Power: So i'm going to share with you it's a little bit on the longer side, but I think he's he is the man that created this framework, and he explained therefore explains it better than I can explain it to you so i'm going to show you this video.

154
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:12,570
Laura Power: This is the Canadian framework pronounce can nevin For those of you who don't speak well.

155
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:23,550
Laura Power: And the origin of the name itself as deserving of explanation its literal translation is habitat so place, but what it actually means it's a place of your multiple belongings.

156
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:31,650
Laura Power: Is is very sense that you're rooted in many different paths which profoundly influenced what you are within which you can only ever be perfectly aware.

157
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:43,920
Laura Power: And the reason is a good name for complexity bottle is that a complex system, you have thousands of modulators influencing the development of the system influence what you are, but you can never fully know what they are.

158
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:49,980
Laura Power: A couple of key points to make about the model, first of all it's a sense, making model of the categorization.

159
00:23:49,980 --> 00:24:00,420
Laura Power: And the difference there is key categorization model is the classic two by two matrix that you see in consultancy and books and in those models, the framework proceeds the data.

160
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:07,230
Laura Power: As a result of which is very fast, because we can just drop the dot the data into the appropriate box and decided, causing.

161
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:13,200
Laura Power: The danger is that actually we won't see subtle differences until it's too late, so will be caught out.

162
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:20,130
Laura Power: So categorization is good for expert exploitation is pretty poor for exploration or during periods of change.

163
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:30,060
Laura Power: It sounds making framework, on the other hand, the data proceeds the framework, the patterns or the framework itself emerges from the data in a social process.

164
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:36,210
Laura Power: Now for the purpose of this brief explanation i'm going to treat it as a set of categories, but that's an important distinction.

165
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:51,360
Laura Power: categorization models framework proceeds data sense, making models data proceeds framework and, of course, one can become the other and will lead reset him from time to time.

166
00:24:51,360 --> 00:25:00,000
Laura Power: We take the three basic systems here all the system complex systems.

167
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,380
Laura Power: we create a new category called disorder, can we be.

168
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:19,380
Laura Power: Simple.

169
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:29,640
Laura Power: In the simple domain, this is an older system that means the relationship between cause and effect exists is predictable, it can be determined in advance.

170
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:45,600
Laura Power: and simple order that relationship is self evident to any reasonable person as a result which the decision model is sense categorize respond you see what's coming in, we make it fit previously determined categories, we decide what to do.

171
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:52,260
Laura Power: The model here is that we apply best practice or phrase which is legitimate in this domain, but illegitimate in other domains.

172
00:25:52,260 --> 00:26:04,170
Laura Power: And the complicated domain, there is a relationship between cause and effect, there is a right answer but it's not self evident, so I either have to deploy an analytical methods and sense analyze respond.

173
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:13,740
Laura Power: All calling experts who've built expertise within that domain, who can make the right decision, because in the identify best practice I play good practice.

174
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:17,970
Laura Power: distinction between good and best practices actually quite important.

175
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:25,200
Laura Power: In a complicated domain, there are several different ways of doing things, all of which legitimate if you have the right expertise.

176
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:34,410
Laura Power: and trying to force people to adult one of them is actually quite dangerous you will basically piss people off, to be honest, to the point where they want to apply best practice, but it should be applied.

177
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:43,800
Laura Power: So, simple and complicated with familiar with sense categorize respond sense analyze respond best practice or good practice.

178
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:51,750
Laura Power: complexity, on the other hand, is a system without causality it's a system of like constraints on agents agents body for the system.

179
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:59,190
Laura Power: So our decision model here is prob sense respond we conduct safe failed experiments we don't do fail safe design.

180
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:11,880
Laura Power: If an experiment succeeds be amplified experiments starts to fail, we don't forget that we shouldn't even do an experiment and as we've identified our amplification and dumplings strategies in advance.

181
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:23,910
Laura Power: And, of course, what happens here is we get emergent order is something we've comes out to this is emergent practices, a new way of doing things it's novel it may be some combination, but it's different and it's unique.

182
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:32,520
Laura Power: In a chaotic environment if we enter it deliberately it's for innovation, but if we enter it accidentally, then we need to stabilize the position quickly.

183
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:43,860
Laura Power: So the decision model is act sense respond we move very quickly to stabilize the situation any practice will be completely novel in terms of the way things work.

184
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:51,540
Laura Power: Now you'll notice that that gives us a very easy way of deciding how to work, but it gives us a divergent we sometimes call this.

185
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:59,010
Laura Power: requires it applicability it basically says dependent on which space you're in you should think differently, you should analyze differently.

186
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:10,110
Laura Power: Rather than a one size fits all which has been traditional management theory and the central space disorder and this is key, is the space of not knowing which are the domains urine.

187
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:17,910
Laura Power: And that's where we are most of the time, the trouble, then, is, we will interpret situation, according to our personal preference for action.

188
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:27,570
Laura Power: dangerous if you spend two or three years of your life in a purely bureaucratic process based role, then you tend to see all problems as a failure process.

189
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:34,140
Laura Power: If you're a deep expert than any problem is a failure to give you enough time or resources to do analysis.

190
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:43,530
Laura Power: Natural complexity workers battlefield commanders politicians their reaction to a crisis is to get lots of different people together from lots of different backgrounds and the desperate hope.

191
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:47,700
Laura Power: That somebody will come up with the right solution that's actually quite a good strategy.

192
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:54,420
Laura Power: And of course the fascist level crisis because then they can be given absolute command of everybody who has to do what they're told.

193
00:28:54,420 --> 00:29:02,970
Laura Power: So what you get in a normal decision environment is that people are in a disordered space assessing the situation according to their preference ranch and.

194
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:19,770
Laura Power: One of the main functions of the Canadian framework is to allow people to say hang on a minute is complex, therefore, we probe or hang animate that's complicated which expert, should we bring to bear.

195
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:26,040
Laura Power: Another key aspect of having framework which is frequently must have five people try to oversimplify.

196
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:39,600
Laura Power: Is the boundary between simple and chaotic is different from the other boundaries it's actually represented in the Harvard Business Review article as a cliff or in other articles as a symbolic type of wave at the bottom.

197
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:46,320
Laura Power: The principle here is, if you start to believe that things are simple you start to believe that they're all did you start to believe in your own myths.

198
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:55,860
Laura Power: You start to believe that past success means you're vulnerable to feature failure you effectively move to the complacent zone, which is the boundary between simple and Celtic.

199
00:29:55,860 --> 00:30:07,560
Laura Power: And you fall over the edge in a crisis, and all the other boundaries around for transitions to this you fall over the edge and recovery is very, very expensive.

200
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:23,760
Laura Power: therefore follows that you should manage in the complicated and complex basis and only move a very small amount of material down into simple because that's actually highly vulnerable to rapid or accelerated change.

201
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:28,470
Laura Power: So the Canadian framework is a decision framework it's an analytical framework.

202
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:34,680
Laura Power: it's been used for the session theory has been used for knowledge management has been used for it designed for project management.

203
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:49,500
Laura Power: Because it recognizes the causal differences that exist between different types of system and gives people a very quick and easy way to flick between them so they can use the appropriate method for the appropriate.

204
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:54,090
Laura Power: Right, what do you think about the kidnapping framework.

205
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:58,050
Ahya Sajawal Ali: Against the cliff I didn't really quite understand that part.

206
00:30:58,050 --> 00:30:58,500
Laura Power: yeah.

207
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,630
Laura Power: Let me go back to the picture here so.

208
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:07,380
Laura Power: In the cliff he's talking about when you when you're acting and so you're you're kind of in the frame of mind with the.

209
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:14,070
Laura Power: Mind frame that things are simple and you can just act quickly you just categorize things, and do so almost knee jerk like this.

210
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:21,840
Laura Power: algorithm I do this and that's the right way to do it the best practice, but you can be complacent or just kind of get used to that can become mechanical.

211
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:30,660
Laura Power: And you may not be paying attention that there's something else going on, and so you can kind of easily sort of miss and then.

212
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:39,300
Laura Power: You know, it can become more chaotic so maybe you're heading, maybe you're in a more complex or chaotic situation but you're not really paying attention, so I think it.

213
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:46,860
Laura Power: I think, in simple terms it's really just you can become complacent in ways when you're comfortable operating instead of a simple procedure.

214
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:56,250
Laura Power: And you know there's other ways of thinking about this to just how we process and decision make you know they talked about medicine, a lot where it's like you know okay I.

215
00:31:56,250 --> 00:32:06,810
Laura Power: I know what to do here here here and i'm not really stepping back to think about Am I missing a diagnosis, or you know if I miss, something else is going on and I just operate on these knee jerk quick thinking.

216
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:15,510
Laura Power: You know, saving my brain energy just yep yep yep okay see that do that so just being careful not to do that as what they're saying.

217
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:21,120
Laura Power: The reason I like this is one it is you know thinking about.

218
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:29,340
Laura Power: decision making and that's important for leaders and leaders have to often be making difficult decisions, it also brings in the idea of complexity.

219
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:40,920
Laura Power: And I think within public health and all the challenges we're facing those are often complex problems so understanding the difference between being a complicated problem a complex problem.

220
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:51,600
Laura Power: that's The other reason why I like bringing this into this class is just that you kind of build on to that and he also talks about systems, which is what we're kind of going to get into is understanding what a system is.

221
00:32:51,600 --> 00:33:00,450
Laura Power: This was new to me a few years ago I, so I I it's taken me time honestly, so if this is new to you might still be a little bit.

222
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:07,050
Laura Power: hard to understand, I think, just the basic things I would take away from this is that there are different.

223
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:20,580
Laura Power: frameworks are just ways of thinking through different problems, and you know you can kind of categorize them what's simple what's complicated what's complex I think that's just one helpful thing to think about.

224
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:32,430
Laura Power: You can definitely go down this rabbit hole here into it there's lots of things are so he actually has several videos and, of course, I was in that rabbit hole earlier this morning watching other ones, but I stuck with this one for you guys.

225
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:47,520
Laura Power: So you may come, you may want to come back to this if you're into it, but I think it just helps set up the discussion about complex problems and how we approach them and that will lead us into systems thinking so that's why I bring it in here.

226
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,910
Laura Power: I was get stuck in there at real every time, though.

227
00:33:50,910 --> 00:34:01,890
Laura Power: So alright so we've kind of talked about what complexity and this idea of complex problems and probably you've heard the term wicked problems as well too.

228
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:06,930
Laura Power: And these are often talked about in some of the many issues that we face today.

229
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:18,810
Laura Power: So team problems are also sort of simple problems, these are things again there's usually a straightforward approach can often be solved in a linear fashion, you can reduce things down to smaller parts.

230
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:23,130
Laura Power: And it's just sort of linear and this leads to that and it's a simple solution.

231
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:31,650
Laura Power: Whereas complex as you've all said, and we have pointed out different layers there's you know, maybe not one right answer difficult to understand.

232
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:38,520
Laura Power: And it's sometimes better to really have the bigger picture as opposed to reducing to smaller parts is a complex problem.

233
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:48,150
Laura Power: The term wicked problem has actually been around for a while, sometimes it's used interchangeably I tend to use it interchangeably too complex versus wicked.

234
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:53,700
Laura Power: But these are sometimes just started, like the hardest problems to solve there's really no one clear definition.

235
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:57,540
Laura Power: I was, I found it interesting to learn that there's actually a.

236
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:08,490
Laura Power: wicked problems have actually been defined, there was a paper in policy sciences in 1973 that actually outlined what is a wicked problem so it's not just an adjective to us about a problem.

237
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:22,140
Laura Power: But there really is some thought, around a wicked problems and it's truly a very, very, very complex so complex wicked but here is just just So you see it, this is how wicked problems were defined in this paper.

238
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:32,790
Laura Power: That there is no definitive formulation, how do you even define the problem like there's something wrong but there's many ways of defining it or looking at what the problem is.

239
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:40,620
Laura Power: there's no stopping rule meaning you don't necessarily know and the problem is solved there's not like Okay, we solve this issue and we can move on.

240
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:53,340
Laura Power: And this solutions aren't always right or wrong they might be more you know better or worse, but there's not necessarily one right answer you can't necessarily test the solution, so you just have to kind of.

241
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:59,160
Laura Power: Just you do it and you see what happens, but there's not like an experiment that you can do to solve it first.

242
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:12,450
Laura Power: So there and there's like you can't go back so it's not trial and error you just happens and you've affected the system in itself you do something to try to fix it that leads to other things and you're in different state and keep going.

243
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:18,750
Laura Power: And you know multiple ways of looking at it, are all unique and.

244
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:24,480
Laura Power: So lots of different things that can make something a wicked problem.

245
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:34,680
Laura Power: Another term that's often use or or I have heard, sometimes I hear complex and awakened more of a social message is sometimes another term that's used and.

246
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:49,860
Laura Power: it's kind of the same concept but I like to one because of the little pictures and It just shows you again, some of those ideas that match up with being a wicked problem or a complex problem, like know correct view of the problem, everyone has different perspectives.

247
00:36:49,860 --> 00:37:08,220
Laura Power: there's lots of constraints around things, whether this money or ideology, there are sometimes things that just start really logical associated with them, there can be great resistance to change many different ways to intervene.

248
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:24,390
Laura Power: So just lots of different ways to think about this, but this is kind of how you can you can think of many different issues that we're facing today in public health that are social messages or wicked problems and here's.

249
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:51,450
Laura Power: Some there are others, these examples gun violence opioid crisis homelessness Kobe certainly examples, what are, maybe some other wicked problems that you think are important to public health today.

250
00:37:51,450 --> 00:38:02,280
Laura Power: Probably things you're all, especially those of you working in public health right now probably concerned about.

251
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:18,630
Samantha Lyons: I was putting in the chat i'm hungry i'm not sure if this one is a as a wicked problem, but I also think that I don't think it gets a lot of attention, but I think of like the trash crisis and how much waste we have and what we're doing with that waste.

252
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:22,710
Samantha Lyons: yeah I don't think that gets talked about as as as much.

253
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:23,580
Laura Power: Definitely not.

254
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:24,780
Laura Power: I think that's a good one.

255
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:29,670
Laura Power: I think that's an example for sure, climate change, absolutely yeah.

256
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:44,100
Laura Power: I agree with you, Kate and and Laura to probably like in your environmental health classes often talking about like climate change and the interconnectedness of systems, and that is where that comes in infant mortality and maternal mortality.

257
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:57,360
Laura Power: Lots of layers there.

258
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:03,930
Laura Power: Are others for sure i'm sure you're thinking of them, and I think the challenges you selected.

259
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:15,390
Laura Power: Definitely reflect those as well, so I think you know whether it's vaccine hesitancy access to medications like insulin.

260
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:29,460
Laura Power: Maternal health breastfeeding there for sure complex if you're not wicked problems that you're trying to address I think so we're going to solve all these problems in this class this week I hope.

261
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:32,910
Laura Power: It was only that easy.

262
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:44,520
Laura Power: So recognizing that things are complex, it also goes along with it, things are really interconnected and as who this, this is the primer that I was pointing out on the canvas page by dinallo meadows.

263
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:55,590
Laura Power: The world is a complex interconnected finite ecological, social, psychological economic system we treat it as if it were not as if it were divisible separate will simple and infinite.

264
00:39:55,590 --> 00:40:06,900
Laura Power: are persistent intractable global problems arise directly from this mismatch so just to you know we tend to reduce things we tend to use more linear thinking.

265
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:23,610
Laura Power: But dinallo metals really points out the importance of understanding, everything is a system and really that everything is connected so sometimes the system can grow and everything is connected kind of systems within systems.

266
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:34,650
Laura Power: So thinking about systems, and so what is a system and why do we want to take a systems perspective, so this the reason we find it helpful as I can really help us understand a problem.

267
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:45,060
Laura Power: And how it relates to even the bigger system that it's in so whatever the problem is where where does it fit into a system, and how does that, why does that matter.

268
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:53,640
Laura Power: And it can really help us see leverage points that can allow effective interventions and I think, Kate use that word a lot, and she was talking about.

269
00:40:53,640 --> 00:41:01,470
Laura Power: Using systems thinking is trying to identify leverage points where you can, if you have an intervention, you will have.

270
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:15,150
Laura Power: ideal, you will have more leverage you want more things to happen because of the change that you made it also helps you see potential or like look out for unintended consequences and my happen in an action.

271
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:26,040
Laura Power: And i'm sure you can all think of things just all of us having to live through the pandemic in the past year and how our whether it's our government or our work organizations or whatnot but.

272
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:33,840
Laura Power: You know, has been responding in this very chaotic time you know was there a systems perspective always taken.

273
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:46,260
Laura Power: And that's I realized it's easier said than done, sometimes and it's you know not trying to be super critical it's just that you know, trying to have a good understanding of the system is important.

274
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:56,970
Laura Power: So thinking about a system it's an it's an interconnected set of elements that is coherently organized in a way that achieves something.

275
00:41:56,970 --> 00:42:06,750
Laura Power: So that's broken down into three components or so three things one of them is components or elements so it's the things it's the items it's the elements.

276
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:23,220
Laura Power: that make up the part of the system, it can be very tangible like you know books and paper and pencils, and these are learning supplies, or something like that it can also be intangible it could be.

277
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:39,000
Laura Power: values and feelings and things like that so there's elements are components, then there's the interconnections between those things and it's how they they affect how they affect each other so just recognizing how things are interconnected.

278
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:53,100
Laura Power: And that the tricky part is that there's a purpose, a function or purpose that can sometimes be hard to see so you may think of something as a system, maybe.

279
00:42:53,100 --> 00:43:04,170
Laura Power: You know the the academic system, maybe the education system that's a system can you see what the purpose is.

280
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:13,200
Laura Power: The purpose, there might be hopefully educating you know furthering people in their careers, a business might have a purpose and.

281
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:19,050
Laura Power: All the things that come together take it in that direction, but sometimes that can be hard to see.

282
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:30,930
Laura Power: Sometimes people have certain behaviors they may say they have a certain purpose, but the behaviors are not actually showing that purpose and so maybe that's not really the purpose of the organization.

283
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:51,120
Laura Power: So a system is more than the sum of its parts, so it's not just you know tire steering wheel seat, but those are things but, together with the engine and things that the car that goes somewhere, and it has a purpose of transportation so that's more of a system.

284
00:43:51,120 --> 00:44:03,570
Laura Power: And, of course, like I said earlier, systems tend to be nested into systems so they're within other parts of car that maybe is a system but it's also part of the you know the the highway system.

285
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:13,350
Laura Power: and global transportation so they're all like you can keep kind of getting wider and zooming out further and further and seeing these from different perspectives.

286
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:24,270
Laura Power: And there's lots of different ways of looking at it, so it can really depend on the viewpoint that you come out so in some ways idea, the system is pretty straightforward and, in some ways it's a bit abstract.

287
00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:27,180
Laura Power: All right, you guys with me still.

288
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:35,550
Laura Power: Okay cool I know I know I feel like this one gets it gets starts to get a little abstract so that's why i'm i'm looking at a few of you get your videos i'm looking at you.

289
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:46,410
Laura Power: But anybody, please just stop me if you're like what are you talking about so okay so we've got about the systems and how the what the components are that everything's connected.

290
00:44:46,410 --> 00:44:49,590
Laura Power: This is getting at the purpose of the system.

291
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:58,260
Laura Power: And this is another element was quote if a frog turns right and catch the fly and then turns left and catches a fly and then turns around backwards and catches a fly.

292
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:03,240
Laura Power: The purpose of the frog has not to do with turning left or right or backward folk catching flies.

293
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:09,990
Laura Power: If a government for proclaims interest is protecting the environment, but allocates little money or effort toward that goal.

294
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:20,370
Laura Power: Environmental protection is not in fact the government's purpose purposes are deduce from behavior not from rhetoric or stated goals.

295
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:30,090
Laura Power: So that's just again an element was was very much an environmentalist and focus on global systems environmental climate change.

296
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:41,490
Laura Power: So you can see that coming out in her quotes here, but that really gets at the function of purpose of a system, sometimes not that obvious and sometimes it's not what is stated, or what what is maybe.

297
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:50,910
Laura Power: Thought at first glance it's like what are the behaviors that are going, what is this is an actual doing.

298
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:59,070
Laura Power: from her primer, how do you know if you're looking at a system or just a bunch of stuff so, can you identify the parts to the parts affect each other.

299
00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:15,150
Laura Power: Do they have an effect greater than individually on their own, and does the effect of the behavior over time persist in a variety of circumstances so that's how you kind of think if something is a system.

300
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:16,950
Laura Power: Okay.

301
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:24,210
Laura Power: So you've heard about the components of a system and now we're going to talk a little bit behavior of a system.

302
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:33,420
Laura Power: And this is important as well, apply to to any problem you might be facing, and you can map them out using these understanding of these behaviors.

303
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:41,400
Laura Power: So when we talked about the the parts of a system, one of them was just the things in it the elemental the component sometimes it's also kind of called stocks.

304
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:46,620
Laura Power: So these are the elements of the system that you can see, feel counter measure in some way.

305
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:53,550
Laura Power: Those are the stacks and stacks can change over time, they can have inflows and outflows so they're like.

306
00:46:53,550 --> 00:47:02,790
Laura Power: going up and going down for different reasons and it's often you know you'll see a picture of the bathtub the faucet in the bathtub filling up.

307
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:10,590
Laura Power: It could be things like filling and draining it could be births and deaths that are changing, those are the flows that are changing the population.

308
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:17,970
Laura Power: purchases and sales growth and decay deposits and withdrawals those that can be the flow is that affects a stock.

309
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:24,840
Laura Power: Usually they're kind of slow and there's also the way that they relate there's often buffers and things that kind of.

310
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:40,410
Laura Power: buffer the system as they go in and out, but in a very simple way of looking at it, you have something that is bringing it in an increasing the stack and then something that's bringing it out okay.

311
00:47:40,410 --> 00:47:49,470
Laura Power: This is from the CDC page, so I taking their nice little infographics here the little gift these I guess you call these.

312
00:47:49,470 --> 00:48:06,120
Laura Power: So you know here's an inflow here's the sack filling up, but then there's also an outflow and then you can think about, of course, obviously, if one is faster than the other than the sack will have a certain a certain stock of that.

313
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:18,510
Laura Power: They give the example of diabetes so there's more people getting diabetes, but then there's also people, maybe, maybe eventually dying from complications so, then the stock.

314
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:32,940
Laura Power: of people with type two diabetes is affected by these things, and you can of course think a lot of different things affect these parts as well it's not just that those two steps, but you can think through the inflow and outflow.

315
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:37,290
I.

316
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:44,940
Laura Power: just wanted to give some other examples of stocks and flows, this is from a nice there's a nice three I think it's a three part article.

317
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:52,410
Laura Power: Talking about using systems thinking and in cities so like city planning and city functioning and to the government.

318
00:48:52,410 --> 00:48:58,230
Laura Power: and its systems thinking in there and what I liked about this is that they give examples of stocks and flows so.

319
00:48:58,230 --> 00:49:09,600
Laura Power: For the stocks you they have you can be lots of different things I said it's items, it can also be unmeasurable things love trust, but it could be things like water, food.

320
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:24,360
Laura Power: Power money so those could be considered stocks from a city perspective and then, when you look at flows, it could be things like births and deaths legislation droughts surveys harvesting.

321
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:38,940
Laura Power: inspiration So these are different ways of looking at the items and then the actions are the behaviors of the activities that can affect those stocks.

322
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:40,620
Okay.

323
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:47,910
Laura Power: Any questions.

324
00:49:47,910 --> 00:49:56,310
Laura Power: Alright, so we talked about this ABS and flows and now we'll talk about feedback loops, and this is when you know there's some there's a.

325
00:49:56,310 --> 00:50:04,950
Laura Power: Feedback loop is formed when changes in the stock affect the flows into or out of that same stock, so they can be balancing or reinforcing.

326
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:11,580
Laura Power: So balancing means it helps us backstage and acceptable range is sort of regulating stabilizing.

327
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:20,130
Laura Power: Reinforcing means it keeps it going more in the same direction, sometimes called a vicious a virtuous cycle run away or snowballing effect so.

328
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:30,480
Laura Power: You know one makes more than it just keeps getting more and more more and more and there's nothing balancing that and it's just going to keep growing exponentially or fizzling way.

329
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:36,780
Laura Power: Of course, the CDC example of these, so the positive reinforcing feedback loop.

330
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:49,020
Laura Power: So he makes more be be makes makes more a he makes more be keeps getting bigger bigger bigger bigger bigger those are positive, reinforcing feedback loops.

331
00:50:49,020 --> 00:51:09,330
Laura Power: Then there's a negative or balancing feedback loops where he makes the smaller and b makes a bigger and it's the opposite, but therefore this Doc stays actually around the same size.

332
00:51:09,330 --> 00:51:18,930
Laura Power: So the interesting part is really trying to find the feedback what what is happening so when you start breaking something down and thinking of something as a system.

333
00:51:18,930 --> 00:51:27,750
Laura Power: or trying to map the system, then just trying to find what what is the feedback in that system to give you a better understanding of what's happening.

334
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:41,400
Laura Power: So it's really trying to find it and you do that by trying to map it out in some ways, so you just think through a problem you think through a scenario and you try to see and brainstorm really what the different ways of feedback are.

335
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:57,330
Laura Power: So this is an example just susceptible and infected people and trying to find the feedback loops so you know susceptible more the more susceptible people and the more people become infected the more infected people there are.

336
00:51:57,330 --> 00:52:01,440
Laura Power: Then, eventually, the less susceptible people are.

337
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:09,840
Laura Power: So the point of this is just that it's helpful to find the feedback loops when you're thinking through.

338
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:13,050
Laura Power: A scenario or a system.

339
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:18,390
Laura Power: And there's lots of different ways of looking at it and it depends on what components you bring into it so.

340
00:52:18,390 --> 00:52:25,350
Laura Power: we'll get to the idea of boundaries at some minute here.

341
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:38,700
Laura Power: Okay here's another example, this is the dyno meadows primer but just looking at the inflows and outflows with births and deaths affecting population, and so you know fertility if.

342
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:59,070
Laura Power: increases birth mortality leads adapts and those can regulate reinforce births reinforce the population and the B is for balancing deaths balance the population there's a lot of other factors, and you can I think we're i'll show you a much bigger.

343
00:52:59,070 --> 00:53:03,870
Laura Power: Feedback loop related to this.

344
00:53:03,870 --> 00:53:05,910
Okay.

345
00:53:05,910 --> 00:53:22,290
Laura Power: So we talked about the components of the system, how they interact sort of and remember interaction between things as part of a system and those behaviors inflows outflows feedback loops is important.

346
00:53:22,290 --> 00:53:28,620
Laura Power: But can be tricky, though, because you can imagine, like how far out do you want to go, so what is the boundary.

347
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:40,410
Laura Power: And it really everything is connected, so you could go all the way out, you know you could be started talking about something that's very local and then quickly booming out to include something global and beyond.

348
00:53:40,410 --> 00:53:51,930
Laura Power: So it can be overwhelming to think about is a system, because things are really according to this way of thinking there's no there's no boundaries there's no separate systems, everything is connected.

349
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:59,040
Laura Power: But when you're thinking through a system, you do have to think about boundaries of how you approach it so.

350
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:08,760
Laura Power: You set a boundary when you're trying to think through a system and you through that you kind of decide what you value what you don't pay attention to what you bring into it.

351
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:29,400
Laura Power: So it can really shape how you see something, and it can maybe you know, sometimes you might be limited by boundaries you place on a system as you're thinking through it, but it can also be helpful, sometimes to kind of keep things manageable.

352
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:39,960
Laura Power: I always put this in here because it just tells us that when we think about our map a system is really a model it's never perfect so we're just trying to understand something that is complex.

353
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:48,570
Laura Power: Everything we think about we know about the world everything we think we know about the world is a model, our models do have a strong congruence with the world.

354
00:54:48,570 --> 00:54:57,990
Laura Power: But our models fall far short of representing the real world fully so just remember like anything in epidemiology you're kind of estimating you're you're trying to.

355
00:54:57,990 --> 00:55:04,920
Laura Power: You know, get a better understanding, but they are models and they're not perfect.

356
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:11,550
Laura Power: um let's see Kate does this look familiar thinking about the ideas of leverage.

357
00:55:11,550 --> 00:55:12,660
Kate E Schedel: Yes.

358
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:14,820
Laura Power: yeah so you've seen this before huh.

359
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:27,930
Laura Power: yeah, and so we you've had to find leverage points have you been able to do you think through the levels of leverage, how do you how does this kind of come into play for you and your work.

360
00:55:27,930 --> 00:55:35,460
Kate E Schedel: yeah i'm thinking specifically of another project we're working on about family engagement in our work and.

361
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:48,480
Kate E Schedel: We have to think about all these different how to like from not only having people advise our work, but how we're advertising and who are reaching out to to is it equitable is inclusive.

362
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:56,400
Kate E Schedel: Does everyone have a fair shot, are they all based just in indianapolis are there, further around the state and so.

363
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:05,220
Kate E Schedel: We really have to just think about all the different, I guess, like, I would say leverage points of impact for this.

364
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:08,970
Laura Power: Great yeah and so, in that it really gets to what impact, you can have like you.

365
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:18,240
Laura Power: said so, you know you're thinking through some kind of system, whether it's maternal health infant mortality.

366
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:33,720
Laura Power: Access to medications you're you're kind of thinking through something that's part of a system and then you're thinking through different ways to intervene in those connections that you see in those relationships and sometimes you can have.

367
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:47,400
Laura Power: You know, make changes that are maybe not as high in their their hierarchy of leverage so maybe you can change the, just like the number of things that are in flowing out flying you can slow down the flows.

368
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:59,970
Laura Power: You know, you can maybe affect the feedback loops and you can see it with the way it's shown, this figure is that the further out you go these can have even much bigger impact so something.

369
00:56:59,970 --> 00:57:10,470
Laura Power: going all the way out to having a paradigm shift shifting power, you know those are hard things to do, but can have massive changes on the way a system is functioning.

370
00:57:10,470 --> 00:57:18,510
Laura Power: So a lot of times we're kind of acting more down in this area, here I think probably the easier things to intervene on.

371
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:33,270
Laura Power: But really understanding those deeper paradigms that affect why things are the way they are, and trying to get it back can have much higher leverage, sometimes, so this is called the 12 leverage points or the hierarchy of leverage.

372
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:48,510
Laura Power: And can affect the impact that some intervention might have on a system so sounds like in practice, Kate has really had to think through this and think about how things will affect the system.

373
00:57:48,510 --> 00:58:08,760
Laura Power: Okay i've got another video for you this is oh so pretty soon i've done most of the lecture part of this part that I wanted to talk about systems i've introduced to the system behavior we've talked about the components, the inflows outflows feedback loops.

374
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:28,020
Laura Power: and trying to find them and so thinking through things, so this is because, after this i'm going to ask you to just try drawing your own maybe using the public health challenge that you selected as a team individually i'm going to ask you to draw out using a causal diagram.

375
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:34,920
Laura Power: i've kind of walked you through it a little bit, but i'm going to show you this video as well, so you can see how it's used why it's used.

376
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:53,310
Laura Power: And then, after this video i'm going to show you the loopy software we'll just play around with it for a minute and then i'll ask you to work on that for a little bit kind of on your own we'll take a break and we'll come back any questions before I play this video.

377
00:58:53,310 --> 00:59:08,820
Laura Power: games all right, my blowing your mind here is like to like deep is this you like to simple where you guys think.

378
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:19,140
Laura Power: Okay i'm going to take it that you're like deep into this and it's a deep thought about systems right now.

379
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:44,730
Laura Power: All right, causal loop diagrams this isn't the climate climate is as often is used for systems, thinking of or pointed out, this is using the climate leader and how they talk about causal diagrams to help do systems thinking.

380
00:59:44,730 --> 00:59:48,930
Laura Power: If you're working on climate change, then you're working on systems change.

381
00:59:48,930 --> 00:59:55,560
Laura Power: Whether you're trying to convince the neighbors in your apartment building to spend more money each month, in order to purchase renewable energy.

382
00:59:55,560 --> 01:00:06,420
Laura Power: Or whether you're leading a global campaign to keep colon the ground what you're doing is trying to change the interconnections have a system so that that system produces different behavior.

383
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:11,730
Laura Power: But how do you know which interconnections matter, how do you know where to invest your energy.

384
01:00:11,730 --> 01:00:24,420
Laura Power: is easier said than done right well one very good place to start is with causal diagrams which are simple way to get down on paper, a theory about how the connections in a system, give rise to that systems behavior.

385
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:35,010
Laura Power: And how changing those connections could change the system's behavior causal diagrams can be very simple showing how just two elements of a system interact.

386
01:00:35,010 --> 01:00:40,380
Laura Power: or they can be more complex telling a more detailed story.

387
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:46,470
Laura Power: That can even show how a change in the system can feed back on itself.

388
01:00:46,470 --> 01:00:57,480
Laura Power: In a complex interconnected world where your actions can ripple out to influence distant parts of the system causal diagrams can help in three ways First they can help you test and clarify your thinking.

389
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:05,160
Laura Power: What is it about the interconnections of this system that give rise to its behaviors how could different interconnections, give rise to different behaviors.

390
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:14,310
Laura Power: Second causal diagrams can help you enroll people and action toward a goal why can't we wait, you see, on climate change, why should we do this action and not that action.

391
01:01:14,310 --> 01:01:24,090
Laura Power: causal diagrams can help you bring people along with your strategic thinking and third causal diagrams can help you find allies, sometimes in unexpected places.

392
01:01:24,090 --> 01:01:32,070
Laura Power: Because causal diagrams help you see the other parts of the system that share some of your goals and that's where you can look for allies.

393
01:01:32,070 --> 01:01:42,930
Laura Power: If you want to learn to read you start with the alphabet if you want to learn to play music you start with notes and, if you want to learn systems thinking you start with causal diagrams so let's give it a try.

394
01:01:42,930 --> 01:01:50,670
Laura Power: The first part of a causal diagram are the words you use words to represent the elements are the variables in the system.

395
01:01:50,670 --> 01:02:01,560
Laura Power: number of cars miles traveled per car per year availability of public transportation tons of CO2 per mile traveled and tons of CO2 emissions are all system variables.

396
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:11,370
Laura Power: In it causal diagram arrows show the causal relationships and arrow from one variable to the next, shows that a change in the first variable causes a change in the second.

397
01:02:11,370 --> 01:02:18,600
Laura Power: For example, if the number of cars in the city increases all else being equal, the tons of CO2 emissions will also increase.

398
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:32,040
Laura Power: Or if the number of cars decrease the times of emissions would decrease this type of causal relationship or change in the first variable create the change in the second variable in the same direction is marked with a plus sign.

399
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:43,710
Laura Power: let's add the rest of the arrows to this causal diagram as tons of CO2 per mile traveled in cases tons of CO2 emissions also increases, so we draw an arrow and market with the plus.

400
01:02:43,710 --> 01:02:53,640
Laura Power: Similarly, as miles traveled per car per year increases tons of CO2 emissions per year increases, so we mark that with another arrow with a plus sun.

401
01:02:53,640 --> 01:03:02,760
Laura Power: Sometimes, an increase in one variable results in a decrease in another, for example, what happens if the availability of public transportation in the city increases.

402
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:11,850
Laura Power: All else being equal, miles traveled per car per year will decrease we represent this kind of causal relationship with a minus sign.

403
01:03:11,850 --> 01:03:27,300
Laura Power: When you have two causal links in a row, you can trace through the causal logic as the availability of public transportation increases the miles traveled per car decreases causing the tons of CO2 emissions per year to decrease.

404
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:41,820
Laura Power: Alright, so now you've had a chance to see the basics of causal diagrams use words to represent the elements of the system connect the elements with arrows with a plus or minus sign the show the direction of causation let's try a few more examples.

405
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:49,650
Laura Power: Imagine a small business wants to invest in energy efficiency, reducing its use of energy and saving money on its energy bill.

406
01:03:49,650 --> 01:04:05,340
Laura Power: In this example, we can see that some variables in the causal diagram can have more than one arrow leading into them This just shows that that variable response to several influences, for example, energy bills depend not only on energy use, but also on the price of energy.

407
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:11,400
Laura Power: and energy use influences not only energy bills, but also CO2 emissions.

408
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:25,200
Laura Power: Sometimes the chain of causation can circle around to reach back and effect, one of the variables earlier in the chain, for example, imagine the company where to take it savings from lower energy bills and reinvest them in energy efficiency.

409
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:34,740
Laura Power: This is a feedback loop something will explore much more in future videos the behavior of systems starts to get really interesting once you add feedback loops.

410
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:46,470
Laura Power: But elements of a causal diagram don't always need to be physical quantities like CO2 emissions or measurable quantities like energy bills, they can be other elements of the system things like happiness or trust or well being.

411
01:04:46,470 --> 01:05:00,840
Laura Power: So you in a group of colleagues are building a coalition to address climate change if you find that the level of trust between groups is important for the effectiveness of your coalition, you could use causal diagramming to design your coalition with that in mind.

412
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:08,370
Laura Power: factors that might be important could include the openness of decision making processes and the transparency of the coalition's finances.

413
01:05:08,370 --> 01:05:13,050
Laura Power: which could improve the level of trust between groups and the ability to get results.

414
01:05:13,050 --> 01:05:20,520
Laura Power: A diagram like this one isn't right or wrong, of course, it's a theory and useful to the extent it helps improve your joint thinking.

415
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:35,460
Laura Power: Even a simple diagram can help you think ahead, especially if you ask yourself hard questions about your simple diagram here's an example from the workshop I lead recently an organization was trying to improve its visibility in order to attract new members.

416
01:05:35,460 --> 01:05:47,280
Laura Power: Their strategy was to spend a lot of effort, getting press coverage to increase the visibility of their project which they expected would lead to more people being interested in their work and an increase in the number of new members.

417
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:52,410
Laura Power: When they ask themselves what else would have to be true for the strategy as they diagram that to pay off.

418
01:05:52,410 --> 01:06:06,390
Laura Power: They realized that, at the same time, is working for more press coverage, they also needed to build their capacity to orient and train new members, so that the percentage of interested people who went on to become new members was as high as it could be.

419
01:06:06,390 --> 01:06:13,260
Laura Power: A simple causal diagram can help you understand, someone else's theory of how the system works, and it can help you find new partners.

420
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:23,100
Laura Power: And one project were involved in a regional wastewater Agency began to look for the best ways to prepare for the expected increase in rainfall their city would see with climate change.

421
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:37,170
Laura Power: They became particularly interested in green infrastructure, this is things like green roofs rain gardens and pores pavement and as simple causal diagram will show you the opportunities for partnership that come along with an approach that green infrastructure.

422
01:06:37,170 --> 01:06:49,770
Laura Power: An increase in expected future rainfall causes increased pressure to invest in stormwater management one approach is to invest in pipes and storage tanks, which will help reduce future flooding.

423
01:06:49,770 --> 01:06:59,190
Laura Power: But another approach is to invest in rain gardens green roofs and alike, which helps prevent future flooding by absorbing and slowing the flow of water.

424
01:06:59,190 --> 01:07:14,220
Laura Power: This green infrastructure also increases the beauty and property values of a neighborhood increases economic opportunity by providing jobs in the building and maintenance of their gardens and green roofs and by reducing summer temperatures helps reduce energy bills.

425
01:07:14,220 --> 01:07:19,110
Laura Power: The causal diagram by tracing out more connections starts to point toward potential partners.

426
01:07:19,110 --> 01:07:26,070
Laura Power: Those who care about economic opportunity the bills paid by people on fixed incomes and the beauty and vitality of the neighborhood.

427
01:07:26,070 --> 01:07:30,330
Laura Power: If we're going to make a difference on a big interconnected issue like climate change.

428
01:07:30,330 --> 01:07:42,660
Laura Power: Then a good place to start is simply noticing interconnections and when all is said and done, that's what causal diagrams are best at reminding us to look for interconnections encouraging us to try to sketch them out and discuss them with others.

429
01:07:42,660 --> 01:07:54,750
Laura Power: And the payoff if you really work at it with causal diagrams is that they can help you understand the world more clearly work together with others more smoothly and get better results.

430
01:07:54,750 --> 01:08:11,130
Laura Power: Right, I really like especially what she says that the end I think that's the takeaway is that you know, the point is is to really understand the interconnections and very useful way of approaching things in so many so many things.

431
01:08:11,130 --> 01:08:21,660
Laura Power: As any any comments or thoughts about that or questions from the video.

432
01:08:21,660 --> 01:08:27,300
Laura Power: I can tell you definitely just you know even in work things.

433
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:34,710
Laura Power: You know, sometimes systems thinking could be beneficial and it's not always done, like a change to a program recruiting more students to something.

434
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:42,390
Laura Power: Well then, why well, what about the advisors, what about who's going to teach them, whereas the space going to go, like all these other things that can be affected by.

435
01:08:42,390 --> 01:08:51,510
Laura Power: You know a great idea like yes, we want to recruit more students, but then, did we think about the downstream effects of doing that and I think we, we see that.

436
01:08:51,510 --> 01:08:56,910
Laura Power: happen, probably more than we should I don't know, maybe you've seen that too.

437
01:08:56,910 --> 01:09:06,480
Laura Power: All right, so that's kind of how to now i'm going to take you to the movie.

438
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:19,590
Laura Power: And so, go ahead, maybe some of you are already on it go ahead and pull up loopy if you can, or you guys if anybody on it, yet has anyone tried it out go ahead and pull this up it's linked here's the.

439
01:09:19,590 --> 01:09:26,340
Laura Power: website it's also on there's a link on the canvas page as well, so you can pull that up.

440
01:09:26,340 --> 01:09:31,920
Laura Power: And this is the reason I like this and there are many tools, this one is free and so that's Nice.

441
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:47,340
Laura Power: it's cute it's kind of cute one so that's why I like it there's others out there, but this one is just sort of free and kind of more fun one is a play with so when you go to the website, they have different things they can give different ones, you can play with.

442
01:09:47,340 --> 01:09:55,440
Laura Power: They give you some others, then you can try out or you can make a model from scratch, so you click on that.

443
01:09:55,440 --> 01:10:04,470
Laura Power: And then they have some stuff in here already, but you can easily just delete it or you can fill things in so i'm just going to delete it.

444
01:10:04,470 --> 01:10:19,770
Laura Power: And so you start off just fresh like this and you can choose your little pencil here you draw a circle, and then it makes a little circle, you can change the colors if you want to put something in like.

445
01:10:19,770 --> 01:10:23,280
Laura Power: say you know I had.

446
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:30,090
Laura Power: Random without this right now gas prices and then you can put something else it's like.

447
01:10:30,090 --> 01:10:38,670
Laura Power: What something that affects gas prices.

448
01:10:38,670 --> 01:10:40,380
Erin Thompson: Availability of oil.

449
01:10:40,380 --> 01:10:43,590
Laura Power: All right, thank you.

450
01:10:43,590 --> 01:10:52,140
Laura Power: i'm not an expert on this, but that makes sense to me, and then you can say okay whoops sorry.

451
01:10:52,140 --> 01:11:01,680
Laura Power: hold on I mean in the states, I read that I meant to draw a line so i'm gonna draw my line as an arrow and then, so the availability of oil.

452
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:02,820
Laura Power: increase.

453
01:11:02,820 --> 01:11:07,110
or decrease.

454
01:11:07,110 --> 01:11:08,490
Laura Power: So when there's more availability.

455
01:11:08,490 --> 01:11:13,530
Laura Power: of oil or gas prices, probably go with way.

456
01:11:13,530 --> 01:11:14,490
Kate E Schedel: down.

457
01:11:14,490 --> 01:11:33,810
Laura Power: You change perfect so, then you can choose your relationship over here like more more of one is more of the other or more one is less of the other so that seems like that maybe if gas prices are high, maybe we think about travel and there's maybe i'll change the color.

458
01:11:33,810 --> 01:11:37,200
Laura Power: Travel and the gas prices are high.

459
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:42,210
Laura Power: Then, probably, maybe travel maybe it goes down.

460
01:11:42,210 --> 01:11:44,310
So you can put that.

461
01:11:44,310 --> 01:11:48,090
Laura Power: I had started one earlier.

462
01:11:48,090 --> 01:11:58,320
Laura Power: Usually was when I think i'll always when I do example that has to do with students, so I thought hmm.

463
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:07,500
Laura Power: You know I started off with a happy or engage students, maybe that will lead to good learning and maybe that leads to good grades, and who knows where that can lead.

464
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:15,360
Laura Power: Maybe there's some things that help my students to engage like fun activities, maybe boring lectures don't help them as much.

465
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:26,130
Laura Power: So you can think about other things, and then Now this is where it gets a little I think it's very not precise but it's kind of fun to see but not so precise you can make it.

466
01:12:26,130 --> 01:12:37,800
Laura Power: play and say Okay, if I have so many boring lectures what's going to happen lots of boring lectures lots of boring lectures, maybe a fun activity that helps a little bit.

467
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:44,880
Laura Power: Maybe somebody gets good grades, maybe if I go back and Edit it.

468
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:48,330
Laura Power: I can edit it now.

469
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:51,180
Laura Power: You see here.

470
01:12:51,180 --> 01:12:56,760
Laura Power: Now started over that was my good example well anyway, so the I wanted you to see how you use it.

471
01:12:56,760 --> 01:13:05,790
Laura Power: And then you can save a link so for the assignment, I would like you to work on next i'd like you to play around a movie.

472
01:13:05,790 --> 01:13:17,370
Laura Power: If you hate movie you can also draw something and take a picture of a for me, too, but I encourage you just to play with this tool, or you can save a link, you can upload that into canvas.

473
01:13:17,370 --> 01:13:26,550
Laura Power: Oh here's an example, I wanted to show you to this was one from last year that somebody did so, they were looking at coven 19.

474
01:13:26,550 --> 01:13:39,180
Laura Power: and looking at the different things that I that were influencing the code 19 incidents, so they thought of things like work exposure and Community exposure and so they these are some of the things they brainstormed.

475
01:13:39,180 --> 01:13:42,060
Just one example.

476
01:13:42,060 --> 01:13:46,290
Laura Power: So this is one of the assignments, this one will be done individually.

477
01:13:46,290 --> 01:13:57,570
Laura Power: sees just a quarter to three right now so that's perfect wow that worked out really well okay so maybe for the next time 15 minutes ish you can or however long it takes you.

478
01:13:57,570 --> 01:14:02,550
Laura Power: i'd like you to work on and doing a you cause a loop diagram.

479
01:14:02,550 --> 01:14:20,310
Laura Power: So individually, the political challenge that you chose with your team individually try to draw a causal diagram yourself ideally using movie again you're also welcome to draw you know if you have another tool, you really want to use, and you can do that to.

480
01:14:20,310 --> 01:14:26,880
Laura Power: Make sure you identify the different components and then you draw the links and do the positive or the negative.

481
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:38,640
Laura Power: try to get maybe five different components, you can probably get farther than that really and then either upload a picture, or even a link that will take me to your movie diagram.

482
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:48,750
Laura Power: So you're going to do it by yourself, now, maybe take i'm going to give you guys about 15 minutes to do that and then i'm going to give you about a 15 minute break so i'm thinking that will come back.

483
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:53,430
Laura Power: At about three.

484
01:14:53,430 --> 01:14:55,440
Laura Power: how's that sound.

485
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:58,290
Laura Power: And are there questions about.

486
01:14:58,290 --> 01:15:01,410
Laura Power: The assignment.

487
01:15:01,410 --> 01:15:07,020
Joshua Bosman: I was actually curious about i'm trying to figure out what the colors indicate.

488
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:20,850
Laura Power: yeah so it's kind of open and whatever you want it to be, and actually in there, too, you can so some people like to organize it a certain way, like all inputs will be one color outputs or another or.

489
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:30,450
Laura Power: positive things happening is one thing and negative things have these another or sometimes people organize them like these are.

490
01:15:30,450 --> 01:15:40,650
Laura Power: I don't know if you're doing like different governmental levels like local health department things state health department things federal global so you could do my different colors that way.

491
01:15:40,650 --> 01:15:50,760
Laura Power: There is a way in there, I don't focus too much on it, because it's really not super accurate, you can actually change the size of the little bubble, and when you make when you make it go.

492
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:56,130
Laura Power: It will affect the amount of the arrows and the actual loop itself.

493
01:15:56,130 --> 01:16:06,510
Laura Power: I think that part's a little emphasizes, you know it's fine if you really want to get into the way I think I use this really more for the mapping and visualization, but it will do that too so.

494
01:16:06,510 --> 01:16:17,490
Laura Power: I saw some thumbs up so i'm going to take that as a good sign, so i'm gonna let you do that on your own i'll stay on here for a little bit in case you have questions.

495
01:16:17,490 --> 01:16:20,040
Laura Power: But then, after that go ahead and take a break.

496
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:37,890
Laura Power: But trying to get it loaded up so you're done before, and then you will look at this together with your team later in the day, so have something that you can all share, because then you're going to combine forces and think about all the aspects of your public health challenge together.

497
01:16:37,890 --> 01:17:05,550
Laura Power: guys i'm going to assume you're doing well, because you're all most of you are videos off so i'm assuming you're doing well i'll sit here if you need anything, and we will come back at 315.

498
01:17:05,550 --> 01:17:17,640
Erin Thompson: i'll share mine.

499
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:18,720
Erin Thompson: You see it.

500
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:23,040
Laura Power: Yes, wow okay that's beautiful.

501
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:25,860
Laura Power: i'm already got all the colors and the number of.

502
01:17:25,860 --> 01:17:28,710
circles.

503
01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:42,090
Erin Thompson: The font really small but, so I focused on i'm a group former focusing on equity and breastfeeding, so I focused on equity or sorry black breastfeeding, and i'm in black women black women.

504
01:17:42,090 --> 01:17:50,610
Erin Thompson: So I kind of tried to spy how they I guess by the factor, the larger factor and then some factors.

505
01:17:50,610 --> 01:17:57,840
Erin Thompson: My program in Texas has taken some other friendly work site program, which is all about like promoting.

506
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:13,290
Erin Thompson: I guess breastfeeding friendly policies in work sites, so I started with that this one says mother from the workplace and then this is space to breastfeed time to breastfeed places for breast milk and then support for leadership.

507
01:18:13,290 --> 01:18:28,500
Erin Thompson: We also have another initiative that kind of works with baby friendly I think it's called baby friendly hospitals, I don't work directly with it, but I know, one of the big things is like whether or not moms are given formula at the hospital sex put that as a negative one.

508
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:40,260
Erin Thompson: Access to the lactation support lactation support specialist would be positive, as well, this was kind of a guest if health care coverage if they are able to pay for that.

509
01:18:40,260 --> 01:18:46,830
Erin Thompson: benefits to baby and benefits to mom I said, our feedback loop.

510
01:18:46,830 --> 01:18:49,740
Erin Thompson: Because mom could be motivated by.

511
01:18:49,740 --> 01:18:56,070
Erin Thompson: Wanting to provide those benefits that her baby and herself and then seeing the benefits and baby could.

512
01:18:56,070 --> 01:19:00,090
Erin Thompson: promote that behavior in her as well.

513
01:19:00,090 --> 01:19:17,520
Erin Thompson: Support from the communities for partner stigma said it could negatively affects all these and then up here, these are like internal factors education about breastfeeding desire to breastfeed and the knowledge and put that knowledge can.

514
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:26,700
Erin Thompson: Help can reduce stigma and then access to lactation support specialist can increase knowledge and education.

515
01:19:26,700 --> 01:19:30,960
Laura Power: that's beautiful Aaron have you done this before that was excellent, I love it.

516
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:32,430
Erin Thompson: yeah i've done it before.

517
01:19:32,430 --> 01:19:40,260
Laura Power: yeah I mean you really like knocked it out so that's great so team for you guys are beautiful one to start with, and then hearing when you get together with your team leader.

518
01:19:40,260 --> 01:19:46,260
Laura Power: there'll be able to add in all the you know see what other components people had died out so that's great wow.

519
01:19:46,260 --> 01:19:57,450
Laura Power: I know if any of your like me, I am not that creative, especially on the spot so sometimes I have a hard time thinking of so many photos, but when you get your team together.

520
01:19:57,450 --> 01:20:14,220
Laura Power: that's the beauty of this is like bringing everyone together and coming up with the different perspectives and just different ways of thinking about things, so thank you for sharing that Aaron anybody else want to share their screen or just kind of tell us like was it easy was hard.

521
01:20:14,220 --> 01:20:40,080
Laura Power: see what else you guys fun.

522
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:52,770
Laura Power: Well Aaron, thank you for sharing yours, and I know you all get together, I look forward to seeing them myself I know you've submitted them to canvas i'll take a peek at those as well okay good so it's 320.

523
01:20:52,770 --> 01:20:59,640
Laura Power: So that was your first attended systems thinking around a public health challenge.

524
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:10,140
Laura Power: So i'm gonna now it's kind of a continuation, but i'm trying to switch to the mode of like how to do systems thinking and what is it so in the first part, we talked about systems.

525
01:21:10,140 --> 01:21:24,090
Laura Power: kind of overlaps with complex problems and understanding the system and as though one video we just watched circle good way to start off with that as a causal the diagrams and you can see the components and how to connect in the system.

526
01:21:24,090 --> 01:21:30,570
Laura Power: there's other tools to use and so we'll go through the side, it looks I know it looks like there's a lot of slides in there that are remaining.

527
01:21:30,570 --> 01:21:43,140
Laura Power: you'll notice a lot of them are pictures of they're just different tools so basically we'll kind of quickly go through other visualization tools or mapping tools or systems thinking so that's kind of what we'll do and then.

528
01:21:43,140 --> 01:21:59,010
Laura Power: Later, a little bit later we'll get you back together as your whole team to think about this together, and you can either use a different tool, or you could build on say the loopy diagram that you just did or whatever other tools, you might have chosen to use.

529
01:21:59,010 --> 01:22:07,890
Laura Power: me pull up my slides here my screen.

530
01:22:07,890 --> 01:22:11,430
Laura Power: that's another two of us.

531
01:22:11,430 --> 01:22:17,250
Laura Power: All right, where was like.

532
01:22:17,250 --> 01:22:20,370
Laura Power: there's the preview at the pictures.

533
01:22:20,370 --> 01:22:25,920
Laura Power: Here we go.

534
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:32,700
Laura Power: Alright So how do we use this, how is this used as we approach complex problems.

535
01:22:32,700 --> 01:22:49,440
Laura Power: So this is there's a lot on this slide, and this is like complex adaptive systems and it's I feel like it's a complex thing to explain, but I will show you a short video that I feel like explains it better, but this is just thinking about.

536
01:22:49,440 --> 01:23:01,470
Laura Power: How different parts of a system kind of how they behave all interconnected, so all the different parts of the system have their own rules for behavior.

537
01:23:01,470 --> 01:23:11,040
Laura Power: And that can affect the general output that happens as a system as a whole, as well as all the little pieces of the system and.

538
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:20,010
Laura Power: What is happening in the system can adapt and evolve over time, so the behavior kind of emerges based on all these different rules within a system.

539
01:23:20,010 --> 01:23:36,300
Laura Power: sometimes called self organizing or emerging behaviors that come out, sometimes it can be referred to as the butterfly effect is like different changes happen, it can be exponential and then cause a bigger effect.

540
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:39,840
Laura Power: I know I feel like that's kind of abstract.

541
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:45,660
Laura Power: This is a, this is a diagram that I think is a bit complicated, too, so i've come across this video, which I think explains.

542
01:23:45,660 --> 01:23:45,930
Laura Power: This.

543
01:23:45,930 --> 01:24:01,170
Laura Power: Best actually It follows, along with the idea of complex systems and how things interact with that, but this links up to systems thinking so i'm going to show you this.

544
01:24:01,170 --> 01:24:10,920
Laura Power: The systems that you were part of, and that you care about our complex they're made up of many independent and connected parks and they're adapted.

545
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:18,780
Laura Power: Their parts are constantly adjusting refining converting integrating based on what is happening in the world around them.

546
01:24:18,780 --> 01:24:28,500
Laura Power: The study of complex adaptive systems or the cast can help us understand the world and thinking new ways to solve problems.

547
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:42,810
Laura Power: For centuries, we looked at complex systems like these, and wonder how do they work out of millions of birds collectively flying in one direction turn in an instant and all begin flying in another direction.

548
01:24:42,810 --> 01:24:53,970
Laura Power: Initially we assume that it must be the result of some amazingly efficient leadership structure or an alpha bird of some kind, gave crystal clear directives to the floor.

549
01:24:53,970 --> 01:25:16,650
Laura Power: We soon learned that there was no leader, there were only simple rules that each burn followed according to what its nearest local neighbors were doing.

550
01:25:16,650 --> 01:25:33,330
Laura Power: Remember, there is no leader, no bird has overall command and control there's no global scale awareness of the whole system, it is just a whole mess of birds and a few simple rules that they follow.

551
01:25:33,330 --> 01:25:44,400
Laura Power: We are seeing is a remarkable phenomenon called a super organism, a system that is made up of hundreds, thousands or even millions of individual organisms.

552
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:59,640
Laura Power: That acts like it is a single organism, we can learn a lot about how to design and implement complex adaptive systems from the experts from nature things like ants birds and fish.

553
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:09,240
Laura Power: here's an example of simple rules, leading to complex behaviors in a human system.

554
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:13,020
Laura Power: Simple up with a big effect.

555
01:26:13,020 --> 01:26:35,010
Laura Power: Human systems are complex adaptive systems to we are independent agents following local simple rules meeting to emerging complexity, sometimes it can be hard to see the rules, but they are there, and if you understand them deeply, you can see that they are amazingly simple.

556
01:26:35,010 --> 01:26:45,240
Laura Power: I hope that maybe gave you a better understanding of what a complex adaptive system is.

557
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:51,120
Laura Power: You can kind of think about this and how it links up with the idea of wicked problems to or complex problems so.

558
01:26:51,120 --> 01:27:05,070
Laura Power: Those they are associated and here's just one figure to kind of to bring that point home that wicked problem and complex adaptive systems are really related to each other and trying to link those two concepts together.

559
01:27:05,070 --> 01:27:14,640
Laura Power: Okay, so what is systems thinking we've talked about the systems earlier, it means a couple of different things to me, I think a big part of it is just.

560
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:20,790
Laura Power: big picture thinking it's kind of how we approach problems so it's being able to step back and see the big picture.

561
01:27:20,790 --> 01:27:28,350
Laura Power: It is a way to give us awareness of the whole and all the parts that make up the system so it's really thinking about the systems itself.

562
01:27:28,350 --> 01:27:33,060
Laura Power: Sometimes, when people talk about systems thinking they're really talking about the tools that are used.

563
01:27:33,060 --> 01:27:40,950
Laura Power: You heard Kate described some of the maps and all these different ways they you know visualize the system so.

564
01:27:40,950 --> 01:27:48,660
Laura Power: Sometimes, when someone says systems thinking they're they're really talking about the tools that they use try to get a broader understanding to get that big picture.

565
01:27:48,660 --> 01:27:57,600
Laura Power: And it also brings about this idea of a specific language so you're here about the system behavior and the feedback loops and.

566
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:07,770
Laura Power: You know nonlinear effects so nonlinear thinking stepping back and seeing the big picture, so to me that's what systems thinking means against is big picture, how you approach problems.

567
01:28:07,770 --> 01:28:25,080
Laura Power: And this is useful for adaptive leaders, if you remember, we learned about that yesterday, where that's stepping back getting on the balcony as it's called and that one just see the big picture and understand the complex things that needs to be addressed.

568
01:28:25,080 --> 01:28:30,900
Laura Power: Sometimes systems thinking is compared our contrasted with linear thinkers.

569
01:28:30,900 --> 01:28:41,850
Laura Power: And we talked about in the beginning, how oftentimes we try to break things down into components or pieces sometimes it's just the way our brain works it's faster we can break things down into simple components.

570
01:28:41,850 --> 01:28:51,810
Laura Power: But the opposite is systems thinkers are concerned, the whole they're concerned with the process underlying dynamics trying to find patterns find patterns in the chaos.

571
01:28:51,810 --> 01:28:56,730
Laura Power: So there's you know some differences between if you think about linear thinking and systems thinking.

572
01:28:56,730 --> 01:29:11,340
Laura Power: And it's not that there's one one's better than the other, it kind of depends on what you're doing so, sometimes linear thinking is exactly what's needed but sometimes systems thinking is needed as well, and especially when it's those complex situations.

573
01:29:11,340 --> 01:29:18,750
Laura Power: Some of the key concepts behind systems thinking is that there's many different ways of looking at things you should need multiple perspectives when you're.

574
01:29:18,750 --> 01:29:29,190
Laura Power: doing some kind of work or you know coming together, you need to get those multiple perspectives it's really important to have lots of people involved I think we've heard that from our practitioners here who's.

575
01:29:29,190 --> 01:29:34,770
Laura Power: who's done this you've had to get together with lots of different organizations to get different perspectives.

576
01:29:34,770 --> 01:29:38,520
Laura Power: it's understanding the interconnections and that everything related.

577
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:45,750
Laura Power: And that you know, there are some boundaries, so you know you have to even though everything is ultimately connected, you do have to kind of.

578
01:29:45,750 --> 01:29:50,820
Laura Power: Think about the scope and scale that you're trying to work on, because it can be otherwise overwhelming.

579
01:29:50,820 --> 01:30:02,760
Laura Power: And then just understands are the influences and those leverage points, what are the things that can help you have leverage, what are the things that can enable our black what you're trying to do.

580
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:13,020
Laura Power: And again, the benefits as we mentioned before, are thinking about you know, seeing the big picture, anticipating synergies finding leverage and really trying to avoid unintended consequences or.

581
01:30:13,020 --> 01:30:24,000
Laura Power: Maybe forcing resistance to a new plan that you might have Reno thinking ahead to trouble that you might face in in sort of problem or solution.

582
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:27,810
Laura Power: Systems thinking has also been called the fifth discipline, for those of.

583
01:30:27,810 --> 01:30:46,080
Laura Power: Those of you that are my leadership readers out there, maybe you've read the fifth discipline i'm not sure if you're familiar with this look for a thumbs up or anything from my well read students here, but the fifth discipline refers to systems thinking and.

584
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:50,460
Laura Power: This is Peter saying gay is one of the kind of.

585
01:30:50,460 --> 01:30:57,690
Laura Power: Along with the know meadows, who thinks about system Peter cengage also talk a lot about leadership and systems thinking.

586
01:30:57,690 --> 01:31:05,850
Laura Power: And so, he says, from an early age, we are taught to break apart problems to fragment the world is apparently makes complex tasks and subjects more manageable.

587
01:31:05,850 --> 01:31:13,380
Laura Power: We pay a hidden enormous price and can no longer see the consequences of our actions, we lose intrinsic sense of connection to a larger whole.

588
01:31:13,380 --> 01:31:28,680
Laura Power: So he talks about these five disciplines, including personal mastery mental models building a shared vision and team learning but also systems thinking and that's the one that integrates all the other four.

589
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:35,580
Laura Power: And it does link up with collective impact as well, so again, we talked about collective leadership yesterday in the tool of collective impact.

590
01:31:35,580 --> 01:31:44,490
Laura Power: And they definitely overlap and systems thinking is really what's needed to to do the collective impact so collective impact is the implementation.

591
01:31:44,490 --> 01:31:53,790
Laura Power: of systems thinking approach where you're trying to get a shared agenda and values and move towards a common goal with lots of different people.

592
01:31:53,790 --> 01:32:00,240
Laura Power: And here's just some ways that those link up together so mutually reinforcing activities.

593
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:08,280
Laura Power: The benefits of systems thinking will help develop trust, and you know finding vulnerability through into insights.

594
01:32:08,280 --> 01:32:16,290
Laura Power: Building understandings together so those things can help we are using systems, thinking it can help you find the mutual reinforcing activities.

595
01:32:16,290 --> 01:32:23,760
Laura Power: or doing systems thinking can help you have a shared language and a shared understanding of what the root causes of a problem are.

596
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:37,800
Laura Power: And that can help you get to the common agenda, so this is can be a way of thinking, together, they can help you do these things as a collective or collaborative process.

597
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:44,970
Laura Power: And again connecting to that concept of adaptive leadership that we talked about yesterday I mentioned just a minute ago get on the balcony.

598
01:32:44,970 --> 01:32:50,880
Laura Power: So you know understanding the situation so remember, we talked yesterday technical versus adaptive.

599
01:32:50,880 --> 01:33:04,710
Laura Power: When you have some of those adaptive challenges the leader, the adaptive leader is able to get up on the balcony to get to the bigger picture so it's sort of systems thinking and find those adaptive challenges and then help move the group.

600
01:33:04,710 --> 01:33:14,610
Laura Power: You know, to figure out the next step and do the adaptive work so i'm just trying to make the connections here what we talked about yesterday to what we're talking about today.

601
01:33:14,610 --> 01:33:28,050
Laura Power: Okay So how do we do it and I like I said, this is where I first started thinking about it, or if you start first reading about it can sometimes feel a little bit overwhelming when you step back and realize is there's not really there's no exact method.

602
01:33:28,050 --> 01:33:41,700
Laura Power: it's really more about how you see how you approach, a problem you can use all kinds of frameworks theories and tools it's just really a way of thinking so we'll go through in the next few slides just different tools and ways of thinking it, you can use.

603
01:33:41,700 --> 01:33:50,100
Laura Power: they'll sound pretty straightforward, I think I think the bigger challenge really is trying to put this into practice and actually do it.

604
01:33:50,100 --> 01:33:59,580
Laura Power: And really train your brain to do this, I think, especially this part where it's like, how do you just approach, a problem or what you know what do you think to yourself, when maybe there is you're seeing a problem so.

605
01:33:59,580 --> 01:34:11,250
Laura Power: Instead of saying you know okay it's this this person's fault or this blaming something and say well why what are the influences on that person or instead of saying I know the answer.

606
01:34:11,250 --> 01:34:21,990
Laura Power: Maybe think I have another perspective on the issue, instead of focusing on one item, maybe look at all the variables that affect that item so just it's kind of training, your brain to.

607
01:34:21,990 --> 01:34:31,260
Laura Power: process and think through a challenge in a different way, this can be hard, because I think, especially when you're reacting right away my, this is the.

608
01:34:31,260 --> 01:34:37,800
Laura Power: Sometimes the easier way to think and sometimes you do have to train your brain to try to do this.

609
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:42,840
Laura Power: Sometimes i'm able to do it and, sometimes, sometimes I really should have done it and did it.

610
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:53,970
Laura Power: I think this gets to the iceberg model like really trying to understand the deeper but what's actually going on, you might get like something's happening, and you get frustrated or.

611
01:34:53,970 --> 01:35:04,290
Laura Power: Things aren't going right or you have knee jerk responses, but you're kind of missing out on on the reasons for why those things are happening and so those mental models, deep down.

612
01:35:04,290 --> 01:35:15,390
Laura Power: it's really trying to ask questions to get you down to those understanding those paradigms and understanding those mental models that are really creating the behavior that we're actually seeing.

613
01:35:15,390 --> 01:35:27,270
Laura Power: So that's one way of is thinking just ask yourself a couple questions or sometimes it's referred to just using the iceberg model when you're approaching a problem, why is this happening, because just thinking.

614
01:35:27,270 --> 01:35:38,070
Laura Power: So you know what is it about this problem that we don't understand try the iceberg framework get different perspectives just talk to different people that's another way to start.

615
01:35:38,070 --> 01:35:45,960
Laura Power: The tips for beginners they say you know just study the archetypes which means my trying to map the system which we'll talk about.

616
01:35:45,960 --> 01:36:01,980
Laura Power: Try using it in your home life too, so I you know I feel like we could probably all think of situations where you know, maybe family or loved ones where you get upset with them, I always think of a certain example to myself, where I was.

617
01:36:01,980 --> 01:36:11,760
Laura Power: frustrated and then you know as you talk it through you realize Okay, something else is going on, so try it at home it's probably helpful in your home life too.

618
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:16,620
Laura Power: And just try to have an open mind to go through some of these things.

619
01:36:16,620 --> 01:36:24,900
Laura Power: And really I think this last item is to really does take practice because train your brain out of process different problems.

620
01:36:24,900 --> 01:36:33,300
Laura Power: So the next thing is unpacking and visualizing the system and understanding those parts of it that we were talking about.

621
01:36:33,300 --> 01:36:49,410
Laura Power: And what are those inflows and outflows where the trends what's happening, what are the boundaries who's involved, and how are things accumulating so it's just trying to visualize that which gets us into all these different mapping tools.

622
01:36:49,410 --> 01:37:00,600
Laura Power: So there's really many different ways of diagramming and mapping the systems and there's no one right way and sometimes the diagrams or.

623
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:08,820
Laura Power: visualization tools that you use some of them have different purposes, but usually you'll need if you're really trying to like embark on a.

624
01:37:08,820 --> 01:37:19,980
Laura Power: journey with a group of people and you're trying to get to a broader understanding of something this usually takes many different iterations will be different diagrams different ways of looking at things.

625
01:37:19,980 --> 01:37:27,840
Laura Power: You know and it's sometimes it can be challenging because lots of people have different ideas so they often point out be wary of forcing consensus.

626
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:39,180
Laura Power: But there are different perspectives and that's okay and there's room for having different points you know, in the process of visualizing visualizing these things.

627
01:37:39,180 --> 01:37:46,770
Laura Power: Okay, so here are some of the now i'm just going to go through different examples and to me, these are really all just ways of.

628
01:37:46,770 --> 01:37:52,500
Laura Power: Like visualizing it it's really just different ways of drawing out putting it down on paper or digitally.

629
01:37:52,500 --> 01:38:03,870
Laura Power: What it is look what the system is okay, so one is called bridge pictures, this is just like pictures, and so this is a tool for exploring complex situation.

630
01:38:03,870 --> 01:38:09,480
Laura Power: it's very good for early on, is really not structured is just drawing and brainstorming basically.

631
01:38:09,480 --> 01:38:15,930
Laura Power: Anything that seems relevant can be included, it could be questions uncertainties things you want to know more about.

632
01:38:15,930 --> 01:38:32,520
Laura Power: Problems all kinds of things and it's just it's very messy there's just pictures it's like basically getting together and thinking through the system and what it's called rich pictures.

633
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:43,950
Laura Power: Another prime a little bit more formal way of thinking about this is concept maps again it's sort of like drew bubbling out and it's kind of what you were doing earlier to do you also had the.

634
01:38:43,950 --> 01:38:52,410
Laura Power: You had sort of the causal in there, the plus and the minus the positive and the negative, but a concept map is showing relationships.

635
01:38:52,410 --> 01:38:59,370
Laura Power: So it shows the elements of the system and then how they're related to different parts of the system, sometimes there are.

636
01:38:59,370 --> 01:39:07,530
Laura Power: Also called mind maps re diagram spider diagram there's some differences but they're pretty minor they're kind of all similar.

637
01:39:07,530 --> 01:39:12,780
Laura Power: They have they're meant to be very basic and they're not necessarily focused on the.

638
01:39:12,780 --> 01:39:25,200
Laura Power: nature of the connection like if this thing makes that one go more or like how they affect each other just disconnected somehow so it's a good tool for brainstorming and communicating about complex situations together.

639
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:35,580
Laura Power: So here's a concept map as a nice colorful one sometimes they're not as colorful but just more like drawing out the buckets that are connected.

640
01:39:35,580 --> 01:39:43,020
Laura Power: This one's about food, food security and thinking through different components of that and how they're related.

641
01:39:43,020 --> 01:39:50,970
Laura Power: there's another one about obesity, I know it's hard to read, but just to get give you the idea of how they're done.

642
01:39:50,970 --> 01:40:02,250
Laura Power: stakeholder maps, I think, Kate might have mentioned that, or at least you're doing it with stakeholders, maybe, but I think you said you said, or maybe you said asset maps, Kate I can't remember.

643
01:40:02,250 --> 01:40:08,850
Laura Power: But you can do stakeholder maps to show all the different stakeholders that are important to know about when you're approaching a problem.

644
01:40:08,850 --> 01:40:19,200
Laura Power: So that is very helpful to know who are the stakeholders that are are you know can affect your work, who do you need to make sure you partner with somehow.

645
01:40:19,200 --> 01:40:32,670
Laura Power: And this can be useful in the beginning of an investigation or working on a problem because you're really trying to understand like who can who might help and who might hinder your work and who do you need to make sure you connect with.

646
01:40:32,670 --> 01:40:55,110
Laura Power: So here's an example of a stakeholder map and how they connect so here's one thinking about this was the farming one farmers organizations, the district wire board agricultural research industry, water supply company and just kind of mapping out how they're related to each other.

647
01:40:55,110 --> 01:41:10,320
Laura Power: here's a similar way of doing it, but it's sort of a little bit more organized and it's organized on geographical approach like local district national and like who the different organizations are and how they all really.

648
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:23,100
Laura Power: flow diagram so that's kind of basically similar similar to what you were doing but flow diagrams just showing how things kind of go inputs and outputs.

649
01:41:23,100 --> 01:41:28,380
Laura Power: And then, as you are all already doing what would be your causal loop diagrams.

650
01:41:28,380 --> 01:41:45,240
Laura Power: And so you guys are the experts in the aperture using that to to kind of tell a story, and you kind of can talk through it and then together when you talk with other people involved in the thinking through the problem you might be able to expand or cause a little diagram.

651
01:41:45,240 --> 01:41:57,960
Laura Power: So here's here's kind of we showed you on earlier that was births population deaths and then like just there's more components to it and different things that affect and.

652
01:41:57,960 --> 01:42:08,910
Laura Power: So again, the balancing loose the reinforcing loops the pluses and minuses sometimes in some diagrams you'll see this as an s ended oh.

653
01:42:08,910 --> 01:42:17,850
Laura Power: Instead of a positive will say as for steam and and the negative they'll say oh for opposite so just letting you know that, in case you do see other.

654
01:42:17,850 --> 01:42:33,780
Laura Power: diagrams like this as an O is the plus and the minus this little hash marks thing here is just saying that it can be a slow, maybe a slower process.

655
01:42:33,780 --> 01:42:54,450
Laura Power: causal tree diagrams is kind of similar and it really is aimed at identifying root causes of a problem and i've heard some people talk about using this in their work, called the five Wise has anyone ever use this before.

656
01:42:54,450 --> 01:42:58,740
Laura Power: See Aaron you have used it before excellent.

657
01:42:58,740 --> 01:43:04,440
Laura Power: What kind of situation was it they use it.

658
01:43:04,440 --> 01:43:12,510
Erin Thompson: um I don't remember specifically I just know like when thinking about like how things relate to each other.

659
01:43:12,510 --> 01:43:20,460
Erin Thompson: No it's like what when where, why can help you figure out how they relate and not being perfect.

660
01:43:20,460 --> 01:43:24,090
Laura Power: An example one time a student gave was that it was more in a.

661
01:43:24,090 --> 01:43:26,220
Retail.

662
01:43:26,220 --> 01:43:31,440
Laura Power: Like or maybe was like fast food or something like that job, and I think Maybe it was a fast food job.

663
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:38,580
Laura Power: And they were treating as part of their customer service and sort of just quality improvement customer service work that if something went wrong.

664
01:43:38,580 --> 01:43:46,020
Laura Power: They had to do the five Wise, and they had to say Okay, you know this person's order was wrong well why and then.

665
01:43:46,020 --> 01:43:54,630
Laura Power: You know, whatever the mistake was all the, why did that happen well why did that happen, why is it was trying to like get up and get really to the root of the problem.

666
01:43:54,630 --> 01:44:02,010
Laura Power: So I thought that was interesting that that was like built into sort of the customer service approach and just sort of the workflow.

667
01:44:02,010 --> 01:44:19,920
Laura Power: Sometimes it's drawn out in the same way, like thinking through food insecurity and then there's the levels that that can get to so kind of a similar approach to causal tree or the five Wise think that's a nice approach to.

668
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:22,320
Okay.

669
01:44:22,320 --> 01:44:28,860
Laura Power: So just real quick well not real quick, because I think i'm gonna show you a video that's like.

670
01:44:28,860 --> 01:44:44,040
Laura Power: I think it's like 10 minutes, and then you guys will get together, so this is a case study of how systems thinking was used to try to address the issue of homelessness in Michigan and calhoun county.

671
01:44:44,040 --> 01:44:47,910
Laura Power: And i've got several slides here that kind of go through.

672
01:44:47,910 --> 01:45:04,800
Laura Power: The findings and there's a nice summary of what they did, and they presented on it, but basically i'm going to show a video instead of the the person who was involved in this, and I think this is David stroh I think he's also kind of assistance thinking guru i'd say.

673
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:11,310
Laura Power: And so, he kind of lead this approach, working with calhoun county to try to address their.

674
01:45:11,310 --> 01:45:19,500
Laura Power: Just that that they weren't really making progress and their work towards addressing homelessness in battle creek and Calvin county.

675
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:27,930
Laura Power: So let me play this so it's just showing you how it was used, I will say take it with a grain of salt, because I think he's a consultant, and I believe you know.

676
01:45:27,930 --> 01:45:39,360
Laura Power: They came in, they were like consultants brought in to address this, but they use the systems thinking approach and then kind of wrote out what they did and and then here's the.

677
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:45,570
Laura Power: So here's in describing to you how systems thinking was used in a real setting.

678
01:45:45,570 --> 01:46:06,150
Laura Power: So about seven years ago, I was invited by the Kellogg foundation to help the community of calhoun county Michigan where battle creek is the main city where a Kellogg is located, to help the Community develop a 10 year plan to end homelessness.

679
01:46:06,150 --> 01:46:10,860
Laura Power: And the focusing question.

680
01:46:10,860 --> 01:46:27,660
Laura Power: Basically, what the Community was concerned about is why, despite our best efforts and we've been unable to end homelessness and counting counting there were at the time that 250 to 500 people homeless and a population of 100,000.

681
01:46:27,660 --> 01:46:40,860
Laura Power: There was a homeless coalition that had been meeting for 10 years but had not been making a lot of progress in part because of the competition among the service providers.

682
01:46:40,860 --> 01:46:55,110
Laura Power: In part, because of the lack of knowledge of best practices and disagreements about how do we actually go about doing this, there was an opportunity to receive funding from the state if they developed a viable 10 year plan.

683
01:46:55,110 --> 01:47:09,510
Laura Power: And what I in a colleague did is a systems analysis to some thinking analysis to compliment the Community organizing initiatives that were already underway.

684
01:47:09,510 --> 01:47:14,250
Laura Power: And I want to highlight two terms that are going to come back to.

685
01:47:14,250 --> 01:47:17,670
Laura Power: In the in this introduction.

686
01:47:17,670 --> 01:47:35,430
Laura Power: Community Development Community organizing I think of as acting systemically one of the best things that foundations can do is to be that neutral convener of lots of different stakeholders.

687
01:47:35,430 --> 01:47:37,890
Laura Power: However.

688
01:47:37,890 --> 01:47:43,500
Laura Power: bringing people together getting the whole system in the room.

689
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:51,090
Laura Power: is not necessarily the same as having them think systemically.

690
01:47:51,090 --> 01:47:55,170
Laura Power: about the ways in which they are connected.

691
01:47:55,170 --> 01:48:05,700
Laura Power: And I believe that thinking and acting systemically are very powerful complimentary approaches.

692
01:48:05,700 --> 01:48:10,260
Laura Power: So what did that mean to think systemically in this case.

693
01:48:10,260 --> 01:48:17,370
Laura Power: So trends and patterns, the estimated number of homeless people had been increasing over time.

694
01:48:17,370 --> 01:48:31,500
Laura Power: Interestingly, the visibility of the problem had gone up for a period of time, but that was when the homeless, shelter, was in the downtown business district, so the easiest thing to do was to move a homeless shelter.

695
01:48:31,500 --> 01:48:37,770
Laura Power: To a little bit on the outskirts of town which reduce the visibility, the problem.

696
01:48:37,770 --> 01:48:46,080
Laura Power: And the other thing we saw over time was that the efforts to reduce homelessness had increased for a period of time and then had plateaued.

697
01:48:46,080 --> 01:48:49,380
Laura Power: Those were some of the presenting trends.

698
01:48:49,380 --> 01:48:54,900
Laura Power: And what about the underlying structure, why were those trends occurring.

699
01:48:54,900 --> 01:49:07,590
Laura Power: So now we're going to start by looking at this idea in the dominoes that there's a problem or crisis we take some action or intervention that produces.

700
01:49:07,590 --> 01:49:17,910
Laura Power: Maybe in the short run, will be wanted to produce, but then also produces some unintended and delayed consequences that often make the problem worse.

701
01:49:17,910 --> 01:49:24,480
Laura Power: How did that play out in this situation.

702
01:49:24,480 --> 01:49:27,690
Laura Power: problem was homeless people.

703
01:49:27,690 --> 01:49:35,100
Laura Power: The solution in place the quick fix temporary shelters and supports.

704
01:49:35,100 --> 01:49:38,070
Laura Power: And that worked.

705
01:49:38,070 --> 01:49:43,500
Laura Power: You know people, at least for a period of time had a roof over their heads.

706
01:49:43,500 --> 01:49:46,320
Laura Power: They had some supports.

707
01:49:46,320 --> 01:49:57,450
Laura Power: And, to the extent that the shelters and these other support providers were helping homeless people.

708
01:49:57,450 --> 01:49:59,640
Laura Power: They got more funding.

709
01:49:59,640 --> 01:50:06,420
Laura Power: We can demonstrate 100% bed utilization that's great will give you more money.

710
01:50:06,420 --> 01:50:10,380
Laura Power: So another factor in this was the donors.

711
01:50:10,380 --> 01:50:25,260
Laura Power: The donor is desire for seeing short term results because that's satisfying we know we're helping now back to that phyllis that philanthropic challenge.

712
01:50:25,260 --> 01:50:31,290
Laura Power: When organizations were receiving funding to do what they were doing.

713
01:50:31,290 --> 01:50:36,510
Laura Power: They were not particularly willing newer have the time.

714
01:50:36,510 --> 01:50:40,110
Laura Power: to innovate and collaborate.

715
01:50:40,110 --> 01:50:50,370
Laura Power: And it's an innovation and collaboration that was required to implement a longer term, but more fundamental solution.

716
01:50:50,370 --> 01:50:57,270
Laura Power: which was permanent housing with critical services for those needed.

717
01:50:57,270 --> 01:51:02,970
Laura Power: But when that funding that willingness that time was not there.

718
01:51:02,970 --> 01:51:10,710
Laura Power: And the investment in the permanent housing was not there or not sufficient.

719
01:51:10,710 --> 01:51:20,550
Laura Power: It further increase the number of homeless people with the dominoes and there were some underlying assumptions or mental models.

720
01:51:20,550 --> 01:51:26,010
Laura Power: That kept that dynamic in place.

721
01:51:26,010 --> 01:51:36,390
Laura Power: So what are some of the mental models that were feeding the dynamics in calhoun county.

722
01:51:36,390 --> 01:51:43,500
Laura Power: First of all, the service providers, we got homeless people, we have to help people now.

723
01:51:43,500 --> 01:51:46,290
Laura Power: Again, service providers look.

724
01:51:46,290 --> 01:51:50,940
Laura Power: We deserve more funding we got 100% better utilization.

725
01:51:50,940 --> 01:51:53,850
Laura Power: Think about this for a moment.

726
01:51:53,850 --> 01:52:01,800
Laura Power: How on earth can we end homelessness with 100% shelter and utilization.

727
01:52:01,800 --> 01:52:06,270
Laura Power: You can't get there from here.

728
01:52:06,270 --> 01:52:08,700
Laura Power: And the donors thinking.

729
01:52:08,700 --> 01:52:18,600
Laura Power: Look we're contributing to tangible results now and that's rewarding and it is.

730
01:52:18,600 --> 01:52:24,720
Laura Power: A service providers again we've got to protect our own funding.

731
01:52:24,720 --> 01:52:39,330
Laura Power: And then the public officials taking a look at those time delays i'm delays or a significant part of complex system structures, they look at that time, the way they say this permanent housing staff housing first too expensive.

732
01:52:39,330 --> 01:52:42,000
Laura Power: too difficult to implement.

733
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,760
Laura Power: and takes too long.

734
01:52:44,760 --> 01:52:46,980
Laura Power: can't really get behind it.

735
01:52:46,980 --> 01:52:50,760
Laura Power: And so the process keeps feeding on itself.

736
01:52:50,760 --> 01:52:59,190
Laura Power: I wanted to briefly touch base on the lot of bottom of the iceberg, and then move into how do you take this stuff home.

737
01:52:59,190 --> 01:53:06,270
Laura Power: bottom of the iceberg is purpose now remember remember I said there's a difference between a system that achieved something.

738
01:53:06,270 --> 01:53:11,760
Laura Power: and achieving the purpose, you would want it to achieve.

739
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:16,620
Laura Power: In the homeless, this case.

740
01:53:16,620 --> 01:53:24,240
Laura Power: We can feel good about helping people cope with homelessness.

741
01:53:24,240 --> 01:53:30,420
Laura Power: We can reduce the visibility of the problem out of sight out of mind.

742
01:53:30,420 --> 01:53:38,850
Laura Power: We can reduce the severity of the problem at least they're not under the bridge.

743
01:53:38,850 --> 01:53:47,010
Laura Power: And we can get funding for it, that sounds like a pretty good set of arguments to me.

744
01:53:47,010 --> 01:53:53,760
Laura Power: Does any of that end homelessness.

745
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:56,520
Laura Power: perfectly good reasons.

746
01:53:56,520 --> 01:54:00,780
Laura Power: But it's not going to end homelessness.

747
01:54:00,780 --> 01:54:15,660
Laura Power: i'm going to talk for a moment about the results actually this plan ended up being funded the leverage points that were identified by this analysis became the basis for the plan for the goals and the plan.

748
01:54:15,660 --> 01:54:23,400
Laura Power: Very important thing happened there was a breakthrough and collaboration among members of the homeless coalition.

749
01:54:23,400 --> 01:54:31,440
Laura Power: Whereas previously they competed for funds, the next time that hud funding came into the coalition.

750
01:54:31,440 --> 01:54:37,920
Laura Power: All of the members of the coalition collectively agreed to funnel the money.

751
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:46,020
Laura Power: To the one shelter that was actually providing bridging deliberate bridging into more permanent housing.

752
01:54:46,020 --> 01:54:55,590
Laura Power: That means a lot of those other providers were willing to give up funding in service of the whole.

753
01:54:55,590 --> 01:54:59,010
Laura Power: And is a huge shift.

754
01:54:59,010 --> 01:55:06,300
Laura Power: Thinking systemically not just acting systemically and i'll come back to that at the end.

755
01:55:06,300 --> 01:55:17,310
Laura Power: Finally, from a quantitative point of view, in the first in the plans first four years of operation 2007 and 2009 which included the recession of 2008.

756
01:55:17,310 --> 01:55:20,610
Laura Power: homelessness decreased by 13%.

757
01:55:20,610 --> 01:55:35,400
Laura Power: eviction rates declined by 3% despite a 70% increase in unemployment and a 15% increase in bankruptcy Alex.

758
01:55:35,400 --> 01:55:45,690
Laura Power: A huge impact on a quantitative skill as well.

759
01:55:45,690 --> 01:55:57,150
Laura Power: Alright, so I just wanted to show that to you as as an example of how system thinking was used and actually he didn't share it in his video there but.

760
01:55:57,150 --> 01:56:02,100
Laura Power: You can also read his paper about the experience to, and you can find these.

761
01:56:02,100 --> 01:56:11,040
Laura Power: Some of the diagrams of us to kind of think through the problem, and so they you know they mapped out stages of homelessness and you saw he talked a lot about.

762
01:56:11,040 --> 01:56:16,560
Laura Power: Temporary housing versus permanent housing and how basically some of the feedbacks are really just.

763
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:26,280
Laura Power: Increasing and kind of keeping people within shelters or decreasing the visibility of the problem, but not necessarily moving towards a more permanent solution.

764
01:56:26,280 --> 01:56:33,000
Laura Power: And so they like, through their processes, he talked about the map those things out found some of the contributing factors.

765
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:48,150
Laura Power: which he didn't kind of go through in the video as much, but just thinking about you know risk for homelessness that they outline other problems that were contributing like unethical landlords are well intentioned landlords but we're worried about their own situations.

766
01:56:48,150 --> 01:57:02,730
Laura Power: You know the fact that they had a va hospital, there were they were getting many veterans around and they did not have housing of the attempts to help that maybe we're not really assisting in the long term solution.

767
01:57:02,730 --> 01:57:12,270
Laura Power: So he went through that and then thinking about like the deeper issues behind it, like the elected official So yes, permanent housing, with support.

768
01:57:12,270 --> 01:57:22,290
Laura Power: Services and jobs are important, but it takes a long time expensive so just these other parts of the process that really made it more difficult.

769
01:57:22,290 --> 01:57:30,960
Laura Power: Donors were committed to helping homeless people now with our board wants to help people now so Those are just different ways of looking at it.

770
01:57:30,960 --> 01:57:34,020
Laura Power: So they had.

771
01:57:34,020 --> 01:57:44,310
Laura Power: You know, different difficulty finding the permanent solutions, and so they went through they painted their own feedback causal loop diagram.

772
01:57:44,310 --> 01:58:00,240
Laura Power: And a lot of it had to do with the decrease in the visibility of the current concerns about funding for the situation and, as you heard you know here by thinking about reducing the inflows and increasing outflows trying to figure out where the leverage points were.

773
01:58:00,240 --> 01:58:06,690
Laura Power: And so they looked at increasing visibility increasing collaboration and alignment enhancing the collaboration.

774
01:58:06,690 --> 01:58:22,260
Laura Power: increasing access to permanent housing and so that ended with it with the collaboration that that shift in paradigm, they talked about towards the end and then that they were able to actually see results in the decrease in homelessness at that time.

775
01:58:22,260 --> 01:58:30,390
Laura Power: So that's an example, you know it's interesting, you can go back and look, I think, after that time, this is what you're on 2012 I think it like.

776
01:58:30,390 --> 01:58:36,570
Laura Power: went up again, so one issue that you know how to maintain that so they came in, they worked on it, but then.

777
01:58:36,570 --> 01:58:44,610
Laura Power: I think that the homelessness rate, I believe, increase last I checked I haven't checked this past year, but I think it increase in has fluctuated since then, so it takes a.

778
01:58:44,610 --> 01:58:53,850
Laura Power: You know i'm going consistent approach to addressing an issue, but that was the use of systems thinking for a very complex problem.

779
01:58:53,850 --> 01:59:03,180
Laura Power: I these links to these resources are in the canvas page that showed you on that additional resources tab there, but you can find.

780
01:59:03,180 --> 01:59:13,410
Laura Power: websites like this, I will list all kinds of things you can do to try to think through how you know how you want to map a system or visualize the system.

781
01:59:13,410 --> 01:59:19,320
Laura Power: here's another one sort of just they're just different different think tanks I call them different.

782
01:59:19,320 --> 01:59:30,990
Laura Power: Groups that kind of curate and think about think about systems thinking and the different tools for that, so you can look at different things here and kind of help you walk you through different ways of doing them.

783
01:59:30,990 --> 01:59:40,200
Laura Power: And then I put here I won't I showed you a lot of videos i'm not going to show you these, but I just wanted you to know that these are here and.

784
01:59:40,200 --> 01:59:54,810
Laura Power: there's the systems thinking mindset dynamic thinking and staffing so mapping, which are from that CDC website where the CDC has really focused on the use of systems thinking in a problem solving and addressing complex problems.

785
01:59:54,810 --> 02:00:04,470
Laura Power: And then some other free software so louisa nice one bubble us is one here's the bubble us one where you can just kind of add, and that was a free one you can just.

786
02:00:04,470 --> 02:00:16,680
Laura Power: click the button says just use now, instead of creating an account, and you can use something like this, so this was from one of my students, a couple years ago, who worked on one for global warming and you can see, she made this massive.

787
02:00:16,680 --> 02:00:27,240
Laura Power: concept map about global warming, she had a little more time to work on this, then the new guys have had for this class, but this is a big one.

788
02:00:27,240 --> 02:00:31,830
Laura Power: Okay, so we are at the point is about four o'clock so that's perfect.

789
02:00:31,830 --> 02:00:41,940
Laura Power: So I want you all you're now going to get together so last hour you'd be like sitting there listening relaxers and now it's time to like get your energy back you're going to you're going to meet up with your team.

790
02:00:41,940 --> 02:00:54,270
Laura Power: And you're going to think about mapping the system or the public health challenge that you've chosen together, so you can do this, a couple different ways and i'll leave it up to each team to decide which you could.

791
02:00:54,270 --> 02:01:07,920
Laura Power: Just think through and share your causal loop diagrams and build on that and make like a nice big one, you could choose a different mapping tool if you'd like and use that.

792
02:01:07,920 --> 02:01:12,150
Laura Power: Either way, it is a way for you to map the system.

793
02:01:12,150 --> 02:01:19,920
Laura Power: So you'll see here, this is a team as a group assignment so you'll do it together as a group, one person can upload it for your whole team.

794
02:01:19,920 --> 02:01:27,840
Laura Power: And this is where we start building on to the presentation, so this will be something on Friday, we will actually share this out so.

795
02:01:27,840 --> 02:01:41,730
Laura Power: Each group can see what the others did so, you could then take that template that I had for you in the presentation assignment or make your own if you'd like or you could add this in there, so you could kind of start working on that.

796
02:01:41,730 --> 02:01:54,000
Laura Power: Let me stop and see what questions you have.

797
02:01:54,000 --> 02:02:06,480
Laura Power: Alright, so i'm going to leave you to it to work together on this so four o'clock so you guys have plenty of time, you can work on this together, and I think you can, I think you should also start looking at.

798
02:02:06,480 --> 02:02:12,540
Laura Power: The just the presentation and how just kind of thinking through it there's stuff in there you chose a problem.

799
02:02:12,540 --> 02:02:26,670
Laura Power: Last night, maybe you read a little bit or kind of did a Google search about the topic to get some ideas, think about the background to get started thinking about that and that you know mapping the system will help you think through some of the background topics as well.

800
02:02:26,670 --> 02:02:41,400
Laura Power: we'll put you in the breakout rooms i'll pop around and check on you, for a little bit, and I think I will let you all just sign off when you're done as I see if you come back, but I have a feeling you're all going to take different times on this, I think.

801
02:02:41,400 --> 02:02:46,020
Laura Power: i'm going to do that and also get an indication otherwise.

802
02:02:46,020 --> 02:02:57,090
Laura Power: And let's see, I also want to mention since i've got you here, your sort of assignment, or what to think about overnight.

803
02:02:57,090 --> 02:03:08,430
Laura Power: is just thinking about a policy that relates to the your public health challenge, so if you've chosen the vaccine hesitancy related to cove it.

804
02:03:08,430 --> 02:03:24,990
Laura Power: What are some policies that might affect or be related to your public health challenge, maybe find one maybe you could each try to find one and then tomorrow we'll talk more about it and you guys look at it together as a team.

805
02:03:24,990 --> 02:03:39,360
