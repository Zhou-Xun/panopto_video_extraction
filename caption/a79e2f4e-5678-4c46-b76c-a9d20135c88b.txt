00:00:05,733 --> 00:00:07,935
Hi, I’m Carrie Karvonen-Gutierrez and

2
00:00:07,935 --> 00:00:11,710
I’m a faculty member in
the Department of Epidemiology.

3
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:14,650
Today we’re going to take a look
at chronic inflammation and

4
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:20,690
how this is related to many of our
underlying age-related chronic diseases.

5
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:25,520
Within our body, inflammatory processes
are critical to our health and well-being.

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,970
Acute inflammatory processes are needed
to address the incoming invaders,

7
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,900
pathogens, or
injuries that we experience, and

8
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:37,560
to mount an efficient response to
destroy those and heal our tissue.

9
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,400
However these inflammatory
processes must be tightly regulated

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,970
to avoid excess tissue damage and
spillover to normal tissue.

11
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:49,170
What we see is that in
a situation with ongoing or

12
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,930
persistent exposure to pathogens or
injuries, we can experience chronic

13
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:57,800
inflammation, which is when
the inflammatory response goes on.

14
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,780
For such a long period of time or in such
high levels that it damages the tissue and

15
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:06,530
causes health consequences.

16
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:10,760
There are several ways in which our body
might experience chronic inflammation.

17
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:15,190
For example, we may have an unrelenting
injury, exposure to a persistent

18
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:19,890
infectious pathogen, or
prolonged exposure to toxic agents.

19
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:24,580
All of these are things that initiate
an acute inflammatory response, but

20
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:29,010
if the exposure is persistent,
unrelenting or prolonged,

21
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:34,320
we may experience an ongoing high level
of an acute inflammatory response.

22
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,500
And in doing so, the exposure to these
ongoing inflammatory mediators can

23
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:44,380
actually damage the tissue within our body
and be detrimental rather than helpful.

24
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:47,440
Another way that our body
initiates chronic inflammation

25
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,880
is through autoimmune conditions.

26
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,320
These conditions
are characterized by having

27
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,690
an inflammatory response as part of
their underlying pathophysiology.

28
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:01,460
And understanding how these conditions
initiate that inflammatory response and

29
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:05,470
how that inflammatory response then
is related to disease outcome,

30
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:08,600
is an area of ongoing research.

31
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,045
Obesity is the condition that is
associated with chronic inflammation

32
00:02:12,045 --> 00:02:17,050
because many of the byproducts associated
with inflammation are actually secreted by

33
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,100
adipose tissue themselves.

34
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:23,310
And so we often see the individuals
who are obese have high levels

35
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,100
of inflammatory markers.

36
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,880
And there's great interest in
understanding how obesity is a condition

37
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:33,780
can be related to persistent and
ongoing chronic inflammation.

38
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:38,830
Similarly, diseases such as chronic
illnesses and aging related processes,

39
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:44,310
also are known to have associations
with chronic inflammation.

40
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:49,510
Many diseases or conditions that have
inflammation in their pathophysiology,

41
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:53,660
or cause inflammation,
have a name that ends in itis.

42
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:58,150
Seeing diseases ending in itis is
an easy for us to identify them as

43
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:02,330
having an inflammatory component
to their pathophysiology.

44
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:06,830
For example,
arthritis is inflammation of the joints.

45
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:10,020
Cystitis is inflammation of the bladder.

46
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,920
Colitis is inflammation of the colon.

47
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,820
And otitis media is
inflammation of the middle ear.

48
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:21,594
However, not all diseases or disorders
with inflammation as part of their

49
00:03:21,594 --> 00:03:26,443
pathophysiology are classically named
as this itis, and an ongoing area of

50
00:03:26,443 --> 00:03:33,991
research is understanding the inflammatory
component underlying many diseases.

51
00:03:33,991 --> 00:03:38,322
In this figure, you'll see the depth and
breadth of the types of diseases and

52
00:03:38,322 --> 00:03:42,853
disorders that are now known to have
an inflammatory component underlying their

53
00:03:42,853 --> 00:03:44,665
pathophysiology.

54
00:03:44,665 --> 00:03:49,670
These include many types of cancers,
many of the neurological diseases,

55
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:54,030
complications of diabetes,
pulmonary disease, bone and

56
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:57,430
joint diseases,
as well as metabolic disorders.

57
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:00,776
Of course, autoimmune disorders
as we mentioned earlier and

58
00:04:00,776 --> 00:04:03,040
cardiovascular diseases.

59
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,099
All of these disorders have documented
evidence showing that there is

60
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:12,051
an inflammatory component associated with
not only the onset of these diseases, but

61
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:14,790
also the progression and severity.

62
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:19,170
And so understanding and characterizing
the impact of the inflammatory response

63
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:23,420
on these types of disorders helps us to
understand not only how to measure their

64
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:27,980
impact but also to think about strategies
that we might use to prevent these

65
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:32,520
diseases and treat them in the long term.

66
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,590
There are several new avenues and
inflammation research hinged on the idea

67
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:40,980
that there both pro and
anti-inflammatory agents within our body,

68
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,925
which work to facilitate our
overall inflammatory burden.

69
00:04:44,925 --> 00:04:50,960
Pro-inflammatory agents are those in which
trigger an inflammatory response and

70
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,240
are characteristically associated
with poor health outcomes.

71
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,800
Much of the research that is focused on
age related diseases has demonstrated

72
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,990
the individuals with high markers
of pro-inflammatory markers,

73
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:08,980
such as interleukin 6 or
C-reactive protein, have greater risk

74
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:14,840
of diseases such as cardiovascular
disease, diabetes, and osteoarthritis.

75
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:19,310
And so the overall burden of these
pro-inflammatory biomarkers is known as

76
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,550
inflammaging.

77
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:25,880
Because we often see an increase in these
markers associated with the aging process.

78
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:31,250
And so we perhaps deem these individuals
as having unsuccessful aging.

79
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:35,310
The question of what to do for these
individuals who have high pro-inflammatory

80
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:39,780
burden across the life course is
compounded by the other conditions that

81
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,000
can be related to
an inflammatory response.

82
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,470
And so much interest has been focused on

83
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:49,100
the other part of the scale in
understanding the impact and

84
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,820
the responsiveness of
anti-inflammatory markers.

85
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:57,630
The idea is that pro-inflammatory markers
might be balanced out by anti-inflammatory

86
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,660
markers.

87
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:02,615
And that perhaps some individuals
who are resistant to the onset of

88
00:06:02,615 --> 00:06:07,480
age-related conditions might
actually have a very robust ability,

89
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:12,650
within their body, to mount an effective
anti-inflammatory response.

90
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:17,290
Early evidence from studies conducted
among centenarians demonstrates that these

91
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:22,140
individuals who have high levels of
anti-inflammatory biomarkers actually

92
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:27,510
have better survival and length life and
fewer age related chronic conditions.

93
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:32,790
If, in fact, this is true that not only
the burden of pro-inflammatory biomarkers,

94
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:36,770
but also the ability of our body to
mount an effective anti-inflammatory

95
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:41,580
response can be related to
age-related chronic conditions,

96
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,080
it's important because
then it's two avenues for

97
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,200
which we can consider interventions to
improve one's health and well-being.

98
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,840
We can either work to reduce
the pro-inflammatory burden or

99
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,400
work to increase one's ability to
mount an anti-inflammatory response.

100
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,460
And so understanding the unique ways in
which our body works to mount inflammatory

101
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:05,980
responses and how those responses
result in chronic inflammation

102
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:10,990
is important as we work to tackle some
of the most complex chronic diseases

103
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:13,720
which are of importance to public health.

104
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,250
In this module, we reviewed
chronic inflammation which occurs

105
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,650
as our body is exposed to persistent,
prolonged or

106
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:25,640
unrelenting levels of inflammation
due to many different causes.

107
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:30,010
Chronic inflammation can be detrimental
to our body as it is related to many

108
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:33,868
chronic and other diseases
including autoimmune disorders.

109
00:07:33,868 --> 00:07:38,056
And chronic inflammation is the way
in which our body experiences

110
00:07:38,056 --> 00:07:41,493
the negative impacts
associated with information.

111
00:07:41,493 --> 00:07:44,142
And so, I encourage you to
think about your own work and

112
00:07:44,142 --> 00:07:47,400
many of the diseases of major
public health importance.

113
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,538
And how chronic inflammation might be
underlying many of those conditions.
