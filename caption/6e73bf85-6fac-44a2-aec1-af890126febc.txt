1
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:11,819
So in this lecture,

2
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:20,520
I'll be presenting research findings about the proportion of pregnant people who achieved within the gestational age making recommendations.

3
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:27,180
That is the recommendations from the 2009 National Academy report on gestational weight gain.

4
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:37,080
I'll also review the adverse pregnancy and infant outcomes associated with gestational weight gain above or below the recommended levels.

5
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:46,370
So after this presentation, you'll be able to summarize the evidence regarding the proportion of pregnant people in the

6
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:52,070
U.S. achieving or not meeting the National Academies gestational weight gain recommendations,

7
00:00:52,550 --> 00:01:02,720
as well as the consequences or concerns of not meeting gestational weight gain recommendations in the context of pregnancy and child outcomes.

8
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:16,710
So the figure in the slide presents U.S. population data of pregnant people.

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:28,140
It's cross-sectional, and it provides the proportion of pregnant people in the U.S. that either met,

10
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:35,310
exceeded or did not meet the National Academy gestational weight gain recommendations.

11
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,570
So on the Y axis, we have the proportion of the population.

12
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:46,200
And on the x axis, we have the various VMI pre-pregnancy BMI categories.

13
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:54,990
So purple is indicative of inadequate gestational weight gain.

14
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:05,610
The teal color is adequate, and yellow or gold is exceeding the Academy's gestational weight gain recommendations.

15
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:16,990
Overall, 68% of pregnant people did not meet weight gain recommendations during pregnancy.

16
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:22,510
That is, their weight gain was either inadequate or it exceeded guidelines.

17
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:46,470
The prevalence of normal weight BMI categories or excuse me, the prevalence of weight gain within the recommendations ranged from 40 to 22%.

18
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:51,060
So again, those are the proportion of the sample.

19
00:02:51,690 --> 00:03:03,780
That meant gestational weight gain guidelines ranged from 40 to 22%, depending on the or respective BMI categories.

20
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:18,780
The range that exceeded gestational weight gain recommendations ranged from 20% to 64%.

21
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:38,250
And then finally, the proportion of the sample that did not achieve or did not achieve or was inadequate weight gain ranged from 11% to almost 40%.

22
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:55,639
And that's the purple. So I just want to conclude here that the rates of an adequate or excessive gestational weight

23
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:02,300
gain are a cause for concern with respect to the pregnant person as well as infant outcomes.

24
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:16,440
So this slide presents the odds of an association or the odds of a relationship between

25
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:22,110
gestational weight gain that exceeds guidelines and adverse pregnancy outcomes.

26
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:27,180
And this is from a meta analysis, a 2017 meta analysis.

27
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:34,920
So the odds of an association between excess gestational weight gain and small for gestational age,

28
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,379
so small for gestational age is similar to low birth weight,

29
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:47,460
except in this case is defined as a birth weight, less than the 10th percentile for gestational age.

30
00:04:48,570 --> 00:05:05,280
And so you can see here that the odds of small for gestational age is lower, whereas the odds for macro Samia are almost twofold higher.

31
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:24,730
The arts for. Likewise, they found reduced odds of an association between gestational weight gain exceeding the guidelines and preterm birth.

32
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:32,469
Though I want to note that other studies have reported an increased risk of preterm birth with high gestational weight gain.

33
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:36,520
So the results in the research literature is mixed.

34
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:46,120
And then finally, the study found that the odds of a cesarean or C-section delivery was higher

35
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:51,430
among pregnant people in which gestational weight gain exceeded guidelines.

36
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:58,240
And this is due in part due to concerns of delivery complications with fetal overgrowth.

37
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:13,900
So again, these are odds of concerning outcomes or adverse outcomes when gestational weight gain guidelines are exceeded.

38
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:30,640
In this slide, we're transitioning to the implications of inadequate gestational weight gain.

39
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:39,639
So pregnant people who do not achieve the gestational weight gain recommendations are at increased odds for having a small for gestational age,

40
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:44,950
birth or preterm birth and small for gestational age.

41
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:52,000
And preterm births are a concern since both outcomes are associated with increased infant mortality and morbidity.

42
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:03,590
And finally, the odds of McChrystal, MIA, or high birth weight is lower among pregnant individuals with inadequate gestational weight gain.

43
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:22,229
And then finally the table in the slide presents the odds of lower birth weight or small

44
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:29,400
for gestational age due to inadequate gestational weight gain by pre-pregnancy BMI.

45
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:38,730
So I want you to notice that for all BMI, again, this is pre-pregnancy BMI for all BMI categories,

46
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:46,980
including obesity, inadequate gestational weight gain increases the risk of small for gestational age births.

47
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:59,850
The risk is highest for pregnant individuals who have a low pre-pregnancy BMI, which can be a proxy indicator of undernutrition or undernourishment.

48
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:06,540
I also want to note that even among pregnant individuals with obesity,

49
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:16,410
there's a 24% higher odds of small for gestational age infants if gestational weight gain is below the recommended levels.

50
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:27,719
So this is an important point because there's more recent literature or research that has

51
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:37,440
been investigating whether a pregnant individual or pregnant individuals who are obese,

52
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:48,690
if they can gain less than the academy's gestational weight gain recommendations and still have a healthy birth outcome.

53
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:58,049
And studies such as this that demonstrate there's still a risk of small for

54
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:09,780
gestational age infants when gestational weight gain recommendations are not met.

55
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:21,170
So to summarize the presentation, a large proportion of U.S. pregnant people do not meet the gestational weight gain recommendations.

56
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:27,050
And the concern is that inadequate as well as excessive weight gain,

57
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:32,980
is associated with adverse outcomes for the pregnant person as well as the infant.
