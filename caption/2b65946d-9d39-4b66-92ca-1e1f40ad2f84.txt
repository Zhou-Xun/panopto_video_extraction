2
00:00:06,112 --> 00:00:10,098
There are a number of environmental
health issues that have global impact in

3
00:00:10,098 --> 00:00:11,450
today's world.

4
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:16,055
I'd like to talk with you, briefly, about
one that's probably the defining issue for

5
00:00:16,055 --> 00:00:18,485
our generation and generations to come.

6
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:20,135
This is climate change.

7
00:00:20,135 --> 00:00:23,755
Unfortunately, in the media, we're often
presented with this message that climate

8
00:00:23,755 --> 00:00:27,885
change is very debatable and that there's
not consensus in the scientific community

9
00:00:27,885 --> 00:00:31,030
about the fact that climate
change is happening.

10
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:34,857
In fact, in the scientific community
there is very much consensus.

11
00:00:34,857 --> 00:00:36,936
We've determined, unequivocally,

12
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:39,930
that human activities
are causing climate change.

13
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,418
So the debate is over,
climate change is real.

14
00:00:42,418 --> 00:00:46,120
It is man-made or anthropogenic,
and it is happening.

15
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,100
And in environmental health,

16
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,930
what we're worried about is what can we do
to arrest climate change and ensure that

17
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:56,440
we're not impacting our health as well
as the health of generations to come.

18
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,965
One of the biggest issues we
have in environmental health,

19
00:00:59,965 --> 00:01:03,630
in fact, is the fact that countries
like the United States and

20
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:07,736
China are creating huge emissions
of what we call greenhouse gases.

21
00:01:07,736 --> 00:01:09,916
These are things that
contribute to climate change.

22
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:13,696
So we're talking the two biggest
producers of carbon dioxide in the world,

23
00:01:13,696 --> 00:01:15,910
the United States and China.

24
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:19,910
We're creating the problem, but the people
feeling the impact are, for the most part,

25
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:23,200
living in Sub-Saharan Africa and
South Asia.

26
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,870
So we have this disconnect between the
people who are emitting these pollutants,

27
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:30,670
these greenhouse gases, and
the people who are most impacted.

28
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:34,480
And as with many environmental health
hazards, the biggest impact we're seeing

29
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:39,630
from climate change is on people who
are poor or otherwise disadvantaged.

30
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,660
Many people in environmental health,
myself included,

31
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:44,490
also feel like we have a moral
obligation absolutely,

32
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,960
in addition to a scientific one, to do
something to act on climate change to

33
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,425
ensure that people in future generations
will have a habitable planet.

34
00:01:53,425 --> 00:01:56,635
So I'd like to spend just a few moments
talking about some of the impacts

35
00:01:56,635 --> 00:01:57,735
of climate change.

36
00:01:57,735 --> 00:02:02,535
You may have seen pictures, including the
one shown here, of people getting impacted

37
00:02:02,535 --> 00:02:07,010
by things like sea-level rise or
increased flooding, increased rainfall.

38
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:10,469
We know with climate change that
weather patterns are going to change.

39
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:14,467
And some areas are going to start to get
increased rainfall compared to what they

40
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:15,650
had in the past.

41
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:18,940
This can result in them having more
water than they're able to deal with,

42
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,546
from an infrastructure capacity.

43
00:02:20,546 --> 00:02:24,340
So you get flooding and
substantial impacts on health.

44
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,310
On the flip side, for every community
that's getting more rainfall,

45
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:31,030
there are going to be other communities
that go into persistent drought.

46
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:35,340
So the image you can see here is a lake
bed that used to have water in it, but may

47
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:40,010
not have water in it for the foreseeable
future because the climate has changed.

48
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:44,605
This, of course, can have huge impacts on
things like agriculture and urban centers.

49
00:02:44,605 --> 00:02:47,304
If there's no longer
a reliable source of water,

50
00:02:47,304 --> 00:02:51,310
this may become an area where
people simply can't live anymore.

51
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:54,200
And we know that when people
are forced to migrate from one area,

52
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,130
where they have traditionally evolved and
learned to live, to another,

53
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:03,670
we often have issues of conflict and
resource limitations that are substantial.

54
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,870
Those are two impacts we can think about.

55
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:11,370
A third impact would be the emergence
of increasingly strong storms.

56
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,325
So here's an image from Hurricane Katrina.

57
00:03:13,325 --> 00:03:16,500
We can find similar images
from Hurricane Sandy.

58
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,250
The intensity of these storms and

59
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:22,310
the frequency of them is absolutely
going to increase with climate change.

60
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,690
We don't have an infrastructure,

61
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:27,580
we don't have a built environment that
was designed to handle these storms.

62
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:31,420
And when we start to have storms that we
thought would only happen once every 500

63
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:36,360
years and they're happening at a much more
frequent pace, that becomes a huge issue.

64
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,030
Infrastructure takes a long time to
develop and human health impacts after

65
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:44,580
a major storm can last for
months and years and even decades.

66
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:48,100
One final issue I'd like to bring up,
with regards to climate change,

67
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:53,370
focuses not on the weather or climate or
temperature, but rather, on the effects of

68
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:59,290
those changes on insects and specifically
on insects that transmit disease.

69
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:02,620
So one of the things we're learning
as the climate changes is,

70
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,430
areas that previously have been too
cold for mosquitoes to live in, for

71
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,850
example, will now support mosquito life.

72
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,680
So there are tens of millions more people

73
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,060
now at risk of getting malaria
than there were historically.

74
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,606
Even in the United States, if we look at
the northeast United States, Lyme disease,

75
00:04:19,606 --> 00:04:23,837
a tick-borne disease, was relatively
common in 1996 in certain areas but

76
00:04:23,837 --> 00:04:26,000
not particularly widespread.

77
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,530
If we fast forward to, for
example, 2014, we've seen

78
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:34,100
a tremendous spread in the geographic area
where people are contracting Lyme disease.

79
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:38,090
And we've also seen a substantial increase
in the number of cases because there

80
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:41,750
are simply more ticks out there and
they're covering a broader range.

81
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,660
So as you can see,

82
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:47,480
climate change is a tremendous issue that
we'll have to deal with and, as I said,

83
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:52,117
one of the driving environmental
health issues of our lifetimes.
