00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:17,420
Hello. This is a retrospective recording of the lecture titled Infectious Disease Epidemiology Basic Concepts and Principles.

2
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:25,400
I so sorry that I didn't successfully record this lecture earlier.

3
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:38,760
As promised, I'm making a recording of it retrospectively and with this title we were happy to discuss.

4
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:51,810
As for the following aspects terminology classification systems, transmission means and characteristics, infectivity, pathogenicity and the variants.

5
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:58,860
Nature History of infection key components in infectious disease epidemiology.

6
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:06,240
Hopefully through the discussion of this six aspects,

7
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:19,770
you were helpful and an overview for what's of the importance of concepts and the principles that can be applied.

8
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:25,049
Infectious Disease Research and Public Health Practice.

9
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:35,670
Two Regarding terminology, I will first to introduce you to several general concepts.

10
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:42,660
Host What is host? Host is personal animal harboring capacity.

11
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:56,070
This is very important to concepts, components in infectious diseases, epidemiology studies and also vaccine development.

12
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,090
When we talk about disease eradication,

13
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:16,620
one of the very important characteristics of the pathogen of talking is the host for pen switching that involves both human and animal and so hosts.

14
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:28,560
The eradication were not be possible. Only those pathogen that's for which human is the only host.

15
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:39,570
We will be able to set the goal for disease eradication, assuming successful vaccine can be developed.

16
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:48,340
And the second general concepts alternate terms is source.

17
00:02:49,120 --> 00:03:07,000
This is a studied, absolute, very diverse to determine where the infectious agents pass to the host from where the infectious agents come from.

18
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,030
So this is very important concept to the risk.

19
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:26,590
Risk. Why is any place in the environment where an infectious agent normally lives, replicates and or maintained its presence over time?

20
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:34,450
But please note risks for can be animate or animate.

21
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:39,640
So it doesn't have to be a living object.

22
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:55,690
Then we also often use some terms specifically describing interactions between pathogen and the host.

23
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:03,280
These include infection. Disease or year this.

24
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:09,790
Then we also have the term called asymptomatic carriage.

25
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:23,790
Different term has a different implication for disease prevention and control for some of infection and the disease.

26
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:31,360
These two terms almost mean the same sense in the hospital epidemiology literature.

27
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:44,590
Often you read the articles about how to prevent, you know, lots of cold mere infection or health care associates the infections.

28
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:49,810
But a lot of time the infection also means the disease.

29
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:57,130
This is very true when a person searching has a very short incubation time.

30
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:12,100
The in the end does in that case for those searching infection and the disease of a very closely relate to each other but conceptually they

31
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:24,920
are not quite the same infection is means the presence and the replication of pathogenic microorganisms in the whole infected the host.

32
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:35,140
Why are disease? Typically its clinic means clinical signs and symptoms of the disease.

33
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,260
For example, fever, coughing.

34
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:42,880
This is the symptoms in patients.

35
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:54,040
Of course, sometimes these symptoms are more self-reported and also due to different a different person,

36
00:05:54,040 --> 00:06:01,599
they have different level of tolerance to uncomfortable is some of the differences

37
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:13,690
symptoms so often this may not so often this is not always easier to quantify,

38
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:29,140
especially based on self-reporting. So you don't usually want to use this two terms interchangeably, I believe, although it happens a lot,

39
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:39,310
especially for acute infectious diseases, once a person is infected, symptoms follow quickly.

40
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:51,549
But for some infectious agents, that causes a long period of latency infection that's not considered then infection.

41
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:59,350
And the disease are two very distinct stages of infectious diseases.

42
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:07,240
Asymptomatic carriers are also referred as the carriers states.

43
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:15,639
This includes the colorization and the subclinical infection notes.

44
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:26,110
The difference between the two presents often microbial hosts with no symptoms and no specific immune response.

45
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:32,379
Well, that's for colonization in our human body.

46
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:37,240
We have many organisms to colonize with.

47
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:44,020
In our body they don't. So they are present in our inside of our body.

48
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:56,140
But we don't have a specific immune response to a hundred different microorganism presence in our body or colonize in our body.

49
00:07:56,410 --> 00:08:04,060
So this quarter colonization and then SOP Clinic also called the appearance of infection.

50
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:11,710
The major difference between these two is in subclinical infection.

51
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:18,940
There's a detect detectable specifically immune response within the host.

52
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:36,730
And then we also in study of infectious disease epidemiology or pathogenesis, another group of terms have been used to describe infectious agent.

53
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:48,220
It's the biological or the transmission, the source of the infection or mechanism of disease, infectious disease.

54
00:08:49,030 --> 00:09:01,420
So these are the terms listed here, which includes the pathogenic means of this microorganism has the ability to produce disease.

55
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:14,880
As we know, there are many environment organisms, there are many organisms, microorganisms that lives in the human body inside of human.

56
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:21,639
Or did they don't always look there's many of them don't produce disease.

57
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:25,930
So they are lung pathogenic and the full pathogen could.

58
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:42,720
Infectious agents, we often use the term virulent invasive to describe their ability to cause severe disease or their ability to invade the tissues.

59
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:52,910
And normal flow for us is the micro-organism normally found in hosts and the environment.

60
00:09:53,360 --> 00:10:00,410
Lung cancer DNA could be immune competent to host or under normal physical condition.

61
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:14,500
So. One of the important points relate to a normal flu or microorganisms normally found in hosts and the environment

62
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:27,550
is that while there are no pathogenic in immunocompromised hosts or under normal physical condition of the host,

63
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:35,080
they can be penciled in in immunocompromised individuals.

64
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:56,410
So this is described with the term opportunistic pathogen, opportunistic pathogen, and those only cause disease in immunocompromised individuals.

65
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:06,120
And when we study the epidemiology of infectious disease, we often need to differentiate.

66
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:22,360
If the disease were caused by the pathogen, Karen's patient or its pathogen from external source, meaning new infection versus reactivation.

67
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:30,370
And these two are very important for public health program.

68
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:43,450
But because the public health intervention required for preventing for me in the origins the reactivation.

69
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:52,530
A difference from those used for prevents from exogenous infection.

70
00:11:53,240 --> 00:12:09,590
So this whole concept, a particular relevance of to pencil gene that causes lung latency such as the tuberculosis, hepatitis B, C and even rabies.

71
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:15,920
So when an individual carried the agent.

72
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:22,180
There's always the possibility for reactivation.

73
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:37,830
Then understand the mechanism of molecular pathogenesis based on which reactivation kind of hype is one very important area of research for vaccines.

74
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:47,080
Then we also use a number of terms to describe time.

75
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:59,920
For epidemiologists, study pace a lot of attention on the timing of timing and answered up for disease.

76
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:08,740
So for infectious disease, these are these three periods are important incubation periods,

77
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:16,780
which means the time between this new infection and the patients becoming symptomatic.

78
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:25,810
Latent periods is the time between initial infection and the patient's coming

79
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:33,730
infectious and period of infectivity is when infected host is infectious to us.

80
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:41,380
This is a very important concept for infectious disease prevention and the control.

81
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:58,090
Now, of course, the. Another important focus of infectious disease epidemiology study is to determine the pattern of disease.

82
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:14,890
The following six terms are often used to describe disease patterns and to reflect the degree of the spread of transmission and to the disease.

83
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:25,530
So sporadic is occasional cases, no pattern endemic.

84
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:31,000
Basically the continuous presence of infection in that area.

85
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:34,840
For example, malaria, HIV, TB.

86
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:47,860
I've long become endemic in many countries and they continue to be, you know, a presence in countries.

87
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:51,520
So they are considered this is called endemic.

88
00:14:51,790 --> 00:15:03,460
The epidemic usually is excess of cases of from that so normally infected sudden rise in incidence.

89
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:14,560
For example, when we do hospital associates, health care associates, infection investigation to determine outbreak,

90
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:22,780
it's not really how many cases function in a patient's units or clinic units.

91
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:31,150
Instead, it's if you have observed a sudden rise of incidence.

92
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:47,420
So when you notice the health care professionals, nurses or infection prevention specialists to notice sudden rise in incidence.

93
00:15:47,440 --> 00:16:02,560
Usually they were determined if there's an outbreak occur, if it's at a larger scale, usually we see there's epidemic of this disease.

94
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:11,170
Then when you study diseases transmission, often you want to identify common source,

95
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:18,970
which is the point source, multiple persons infected from the same source.

96
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:30,910
Once this source can be animates and animates, for example, and a device or a water supply source,

97
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:39,310
this can be be source of infection, not necessarily from a person or animal.

98
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:45,490
It can be from a location, a device, shelter, the device.

99
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,490
So all these can be considered as common source.

100
00:16:51,490 --> 00:17:07,090
If more than one person infected from the same source extended to source means multiple persons infected from source over period of time.

101
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:18,330
So this means a disease epidemic not to necessarily come from a common source.

102
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:23,200
Instead, multiple source presence in the community.

103
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:42,210
And so molecular epidemiology studies have enabled us to determine if a cluster of cases was associated with the same source or match source.

104
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:52,210
Then there's another term. Describing consecutive clusters of cases.

105
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:58,240
The term schools added the source.

106
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,210
And another important.

107
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:16,680
Sent to lend. In infectious disease epidemiology is how we is the classification system.

108
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:30,090
They are different to the classification systems that have been used for infectious disease classification and each of them have a different purpose.

109
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:42,120
For example, here, the very commonly used one or very well known one is the micro biological classification based on.

110
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:52,490
The type of passage, for example, you have from bacteria infection, viral infection, fungal infection, parasite infection, pro.

111
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:59,990
So each of them require two different treatments, antibacterial fire, take a sword and knapsack.

112
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:08,090
The treats of viral infection while viral infection would not be able to treat the bacteria.

113
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:17,690
So this is of particular importance for clinical management and understanding the different

114
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:29,900
paths so that the course of the disease where leads to the proper decision or selection,

115
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:37,370
choose drugs for treatment and also for vaccine research.

116
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:46,160
Developing the most powerful public health intervention disease prevention tools.

117
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:56,110
You also have to understand if this pandemic is, you know, bacterial, viral or funk,

118
00:19:56,540 --> 00:20:04,750
so because they require different treatment and then for the clinical management customer,

119
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:14,030
often we also have the treatments focused on the function of through affected system.

120
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:23,000
For example, in this classification system we have four different patent classifies the disease.

121
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:26,170
Based on the clinic.

122
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:43,780
The site's anatomy sites offer hear or clinical symptoms or physiological functions that's been that have been affected by the infection.

123
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:49,160
For example, thyroid disease usually is a GI tract infection.

124
00:20:49,180 --> 00:21:03,730
A lot of the infections had affected the spiritual research theses often of course, by your friends a respiratory pathogen which can be a bacteria.

125
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:17,700
As well as the virus or other pathogen fungus parasites see the central nervous system infection, cardiovascular infections, sepsis.

126
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:25,600
This is very straightforward. Mostly these are important for clinical management.

127
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:37,680
And another and another interesting development relevant to the clinical classification is,

128
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:47,610
you know, vaccine typically is to develop the base of the pathogen, the target species.

129
00:21:48,930 --> 00:22:00,480
However, there's a new way or new thinking in vaccine development courts, the disease oriented approach.

130
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:04,200
So basically for direct disease,

131
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:17,700
you may sync up incorporates a different pathogenic organism that may cause diarrhea disease while for vaccine focused package and reserves.

132
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:28,980
These days, you may come to incorporate antigens from the back, from the bacteria and the virus that causes respiratory disease.

133
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:43,380
So these are relevant to this classification, is relevant to both clinical management and to potential vaccine development.

134
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:53,100
Then some in the study of infectious diseases of another importance of classification system

135
00:22:53,370 --> 00:23:07,920
is related to classification oh based on risk for human animals at zoonosis and Sawyer water.

136
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:14,190
This, of course, has a relevance to disease prevention.

137
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:28,950
If it's a waterborne, our preventative strategy were focus on clean water and to clean the water that identified and source of the infection.

138
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:40,590
And then also understand to the reservoir this ranger for reservoir for a pathogen is very important to the disease,

139
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:52,800
for disease control and to the development of realistically feasible disease control strategies.

140
00:23:54,480 --> 00:24:06,890
Like I mentioned already, if a disease that can be hobbled by both the human and the animals but eradication were not be possible then.

141
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:11,100
Your most ambitious goal will be elimination.

142
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:22,560
So this is very important. And of course if there's this classification has also implication in vaccine.

143
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:30,600
Assessments. We in Vaccin cos we sometimes ask the question.

144
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:40,400
It's a vaccine that does not generate herd immunity.

145
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:44,460
Not good. Not so good and not good.

146
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:51,200
It's a vaccine that does not generate to her immunity.

147
00:24:53,660 --> 00:25:00,800
Not so good direction. The answer may not be no.

148
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:09,470
For example, tetanus is a vaccine very useful to prevent tetanus.

149
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:31,340
Infection, but. It's it is a vaccine that does not generates herd immunity because the pattern switching causing disease is not transmits to human.

150
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:43,400
To human is the risk. What is most serious source of this is the importance of relevance to vaccine development assessment.

151
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:56,399
Then transmission means and the characteristics are very important in infectious disease research has.

152
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:04,910
The one ultimate goal is to break the chain of transmission or break the networks of transmission.

153
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:14,240
So often we where we're study contact investigation and direct or indirect contact,

154
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:29,510
depending on the means of transmission of the pathogen food or water bond, that would be, you know, a lot of time, like a some of infection.

155
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:40,490
This kind of food borne disease would require difference of stress as elbow disease, vector borne disease.

156
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:50,939
Purulent disease basically is where contact in Utah during pregnancy or at the time deliver this understand

157
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:59,870
so the risk for this different kind of transmission where allow us to develop more targets the disease

158
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:14,000
prevention the Marine potentially in the we e infectious disease research we want to have for good understanding

159
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:27,319
of a severe t for the disease and also the infectivity pathogenicity virulence after the disease.

160
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:41,870
These or of the pathogens you could see this table shows you some of the examples of pathogens that fail under each category.

161
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:50,090
How, if they are highly infectious, if they are highly pathogenic,

162
00:27:50,300 --> 00:28:03,320
if they are highly virulent, if all the less infectious, less penso genic less virulence.

163
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:07,940
So infectivity cancer, genesis virulence.

164
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:21,560
I just three terms used to describe the biological characteristics of cancer in the context of human infection and the disease.

165
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:30,680
Then another important concept is nature history of infectious disease.

166
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:40,280
The nature history of disease has important implications for vaccines, strategies for treatments, strategies.

167
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:52,870
The the natural history of infectious agents or disease can be classified into acute.

168
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:09,050
We recover and the long term immunity these type of disease often and are easier for vaccine prevention

169
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:21,230
because their long term immunity could really allow the vaccine generates the immunity long lasting.

170
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:32,780
Then acute with some chronic carriers and acute disease chronic superior results carriers.

171
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:40,310
Chronic carriers come months then chronic carrier may develop to cancer.

172
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:57,430
So these different and match your history of infectious patients where allow us to sync the control prevention strategies difference.

173
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:06,680
And for example TB which is the area for my research for many childhood infectious diseases,

174
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:14,390
you can develop flashbacks and preventive from primary infection.

175
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:18,680
Then you could accomplish is a goal to control the disease.

176
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,900
That's for tuberculosis.

177
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:34,190
This is not adequate for disease control because the one third or one quarter of the world population is estimated to be latently infected.

178
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:47,900
Then you would not be able to if you only have one childhood vaccine prevents from the first infection or primary disease.

179
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:59,480
You want to be able to control the reactivation of TB in the latent infected the individual.

180
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:12,080
For diseases like these, your needs map shows that each vaccine targeting an initial infection as well as endogenous reactivation.

181
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:29,930
So understanding the natural history of the disease will allow us to develop more comprehensive targets, the vaccine that targets the vaccine.

182
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:36,580
So that's the first I repeat it.

183
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:46,579
So the last the points for this section I want to make is to we need to have a good

184
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:53,750
understanding of this epidemiological triangle in the study of infectious diseases.

185
00:31:54,440 --> 00:32:07,969
For some diseases, the interaction may be described by the interaction between the host environment and agents, but for others infectious diseases,

186
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:19,160
the interaction must also include a second, a triangle, to describe the extrinsic life cycle of agents outside of the human host.

187
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:24,680
And for example, malaria disease.

188
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:29,570
We have will host the environment agents of my propensity bats.

189
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:34,880
But this is a cancer genic parasite.

190
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:42,170
It's also a living subject. It has this you know, it's this environment.

191
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:53,540
It's a host like a mosquito and environment that facilitates the process of replication of the mosquito.

192
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:55,610
Malaria carrying was huge.

193
00:32:55,850 --> 00:33:12,770
So this idea in crude, the more complicates the scenario where you have another host introduced into the disease transmission network.

194
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:21,050
So. I think that's all basic a concept for infectious diseases.

195
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:35,930
We were. Talk about individual examples later, and I hope this is useful to your future research.

196
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:38,560
Thank you. Bye.
