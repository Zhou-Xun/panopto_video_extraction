1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:06,090
So I. So yeah, I mean it's just basically like we're having a seminar then.

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:13,590
Mhm. I'm so funny because I thought I had more slides last week on this one, but it was just this one.

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,300
So we left off on the impacts of the psychosocial factors.

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,090
So we'll talk more about this when we get into conceptual frameworks and theoretical models.

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:32,069
But one big one we'll talk about is work interference with family and family interference with work.

6
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:35,250
So it can go by directionally.

7
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:41,430
And this bigger term, like in general is just termed work family conflict.

8
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:48,810
So take for example, I'll just use like what I know in my experiences from my own life, right?

9
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:56,009
So you know, in academia in general, work, family conflict,

10
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:02,850
family interference with work is much more likely to affect the career trajectory of female faculty.

11
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:10,290
So I do. Vance, which is our center for like female faculty, you know, empowerment and development.

12
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,360
They also take care of faculty of color.

13
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:21,390
They did this really interesting study over the course of the pandemic, and they found that during the pandemic,

14
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:31,140
as you would expect, women's productivity went down and male faculty productivity went up.

15
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:36,580
Yeah. Does that seem like what you think it would be?

16
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:43,150
I mean, looking at just like the stereotypes and the like, having my own bias and I kind of agree.

17
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:50,290
I agree with it. Yeah, exactly. Like you typically think in like the mom saying care of a family as dad's like working so he doesn't care about the

18
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:57,909
family what's going on but as often that way for them mom take care past like take that extra role while she's a remote.

19
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:01,360
We're not. Yes, exactly, exactly. That's exactly what happened.

20
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:09,099
Ah, like actually in another study, they found male faculty who ended up taking paternity leave.

21
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:14,290
Actually, just use that time for their research. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

22
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:22,510
So unfortunately, like, you know, we, we think of these things like, you know, like things that were like in the 1950s or the 1980s or whatever.

23
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:26,889
But it's still very much happening today. And I don't know if you saw in the Michigan Daily,

24
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:34,180
there was a there's a currently a law professor suing the university for gender based discrimination.

25
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:38,290
Race based. And it's okay. Race based on gender discrimination.

26
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:43,560
So just to summarize it up, she's a full professor in the law school that she's black.

27
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:49,629
Right. And over the years, they've had, you know, derogatory like microaggression comments to her,

28
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:54,850
like calling her a dominatrix, which is like wildly inappropriate for the work space.

29
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:59,169
And she's, you know, kind of seeking damages because it's not even that much.

30
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:03,760
It's $75,000, which is like nothing to the university.

31
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:14,530
Right. But compared to others who are in the same rank and progressed at the same level as her, her her promotion and salary was not commensurate.

32
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,690
Additionally, because there's like a single mom, she's a single mother.

33
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:27,069
People would frequently ask her about like what her childcare situation was and then make

34
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:32,680
comments about like unsafe home environment and like the child being exposed to the virus.

35
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:36,040
All that again, like gender and race based things.

36
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:42,430
Um, but of course the university spokesperson was like, you can read the daily articles pretty short,

37
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:47,860
but they were like, these claims are like unfounded, blah, blah, blah, how dare she basically?

38
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:54,040
But the university is hemorrhaging minority faculty like crazy and this school.

39
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,189
So I'm like, you know, she's only asking for $75,000.

40
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:06,219
So maybe just like let her have it because you're paying out the sexual, you know, predator victims like way more.

41
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:12,310
And it's like this, again, signals to you like faculty of color, like they are.

42
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:18,760
They're not going to protect you here. So, you know, as you can imagine, even even as like a single mother, right.

43
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:24,400
Like we said, they use the term family broadly. So it doesn't have to be like your spouse or whatever.

44
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:30,790
It can be your support network. We'll talk more about job demands coming up as well.

45
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:36,190
Work life boundaries, mental health impacts, physical impacts.

46
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:41,650
Are there any other ways you can think of? Okay.

47
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:51,660
Well, we'll we'll get on to it. So. A little bit more background for this for this lecture.

48
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,810
So today we're going to be talking about occupational health psychology in particular,

49
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:03,780
and then defining what psychosocial factors are, just like a real bird's eye view of psychosocial factors.

50
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:07,740
Okay, now that I'm sitting, do you want me to stand? Okay.

51
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,730
Okay. Did I tell you how I hurt my back?

52
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:15,900
No. Oh, it's so lame. It's because my core is very weak.

53
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:23,920
And I was coughing so much when I was sick, so I just, like, strained the left side of my back for the last week.

54
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:33,840
So I just have like three salon cars on there right now and I'm like, Anyway, yeah, I'm dying quicker than normal, but.

55
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:39,780
Okay, so. AHP What is occupational health psychology?

56
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:48,120
So interestingly, University of Michigan is considered like one of the biggest historical AHP departments,

57
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:54,720
but they're over in LSA, so I wish that we were kind of interfaced more.

58
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,549
That would be that would be nice.

59
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:03,030
I don't even know where LSA like us LLC is all throughout campus, but I don't I don't even know where the psychology building is.

60
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,900
I get lost every time I have to go to a different building. Okay. Other than this, that's very.

61
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:12,690
Yeah. Thankfully, no one's asking for the directions because I just know how to get from the parking garage to here and like a few other things.

62
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:22,680
But the origins of occupational health psychology come from three areas preventative medicine, psychology, and then engineering.

63
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,169
So preventative medicine, obviously,

64
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:34,200
we're trying to get ahead of issues before they occurred in regard to like that primary intervention, stage psychology.

65
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:41,639
Obviously, we're thinking more about sometimes abstractly, specifically about mental processes,

66
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:47,670
but also looking at neurocognitive science in general and then engineering in particular.

67
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:54,970
This seems sometimes at odds. How many of you have, like, worked with engineering students before you have.

68
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:59,969
What what's that experience been like? Very meticulous, meticulous, very thought out.

69
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:05,010
And like, you need to understand which I enjoy and interest in all of the factors go into one thing.

70
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:10,020
But yeah. A very thought out and continuous. Yeah they are.

71
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:17,790
Yeah they have a north campus is really nice. They have their own appendix person there and support any who.

72
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:26,400
Well now that I've had a chance to work more with engineers, I realize how differently they approach their discipline than us.

73
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:30,510
So in public health, right, we're all about the population level.

74
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:41,430
And so much of public health is devoted to behavior change, public health, communication, trying to get people to do certain things.

75
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:53,160
But the way that engineers work is very like meticulous and systematic, but they never rely on the person for anything.

76
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:58,530
They always think if you don't design it right, it's the failure of the design,

77
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:03,239
or it's the failure of the engineer for why this thing didn't work correctly.

78
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,710
It's not human error or human use, which is a very different approach.

79
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:13,439
So take this, for example, I can talk about it now because the proposal was not funded.

80
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:20,730
So I myself and Dr. Shi, Dr. Chan Ruchi, we got asked to be put on this grant,

81
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:27,240
this NSF grant, National Science Foundation grant with MSU's Engineering Department.

82
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:36,750
So these engineers and people who work essentially in like artificial intelligence, these people before have been doing smart building designs.

83
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:45,780
And what they wanted to propose was dynamic modeling and prediction for pathogens.

84
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:52,379
So here is where Dr. Shi and I come in, because we're I'm an industrial hygienist and he and I do infectious diseases.

85
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:58,860
That's my other class. So they wanted to they already have this algorithm, you know, where they can take, you know,

86
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:08,010
the materials that windows are made of, square footage, you know, air exchange rates and all of that.

87
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:16,830
So they wanted to be able to predict like viral load or pathogenic load depending on like X number of factors.

88
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:23,850
So they were like, okay, if we plug in like, you know, essentially doing exposure assessment and modeling,

89
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:31,739
if you plug in how many people are in the room, what the conditions are, etc., like what, what formula can you make?

90
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:35,490
And Dr. Shi and I were like, You literally can't do that.

91
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:41,399
Like, if we could do that, we'd probably win like the Nobel Peace Prize or be like millionaires or something, right?

92
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:47,000
Because you and I all all four of us just say all four of us are exposed to ten.

93
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:50,700
To the six load of salmonella bacteria.

94
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:55,440
How Sam reacts to that, you know, million salmonella bacteria.

95
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:59,630
Who knows? I have a very sensitive Tommy, so probably not.

96
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,450
Wouldn't be good for me, right? We all would react differently to it.

97
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:12,419
So it makes it really difficult to predict who's going to potentially be infected when you don't know people's individual circumstances,

98
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:16,080
their social behavior, their health background, etc.

99
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:29,660
So it's interesting to bring engineering into this perspective because in a way, we're going to try to automate some occupational health behaviors.

100
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:38,249
So, you know, with the three of these converging together, what they're hoping for is positive advances and new horizons.

101
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:47,340
So the main point of AHP is essentially health, performance and well-being of people in organizational work settings.

102
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:52,070
So there's a couple different sub sectors of this.

103
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:59,910
First is social and organizational psychology. So this is looking at leadership, work, motivation and group processes.

104
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:09,300
How many of you have worked in a place where you've had like a really awesome, like supervisor before now?

105
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,800
I mean, they're okay. They're okay. Yeah, I've had some great supervisors.

106
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:19,049
How many of you have had some not great supervisors? What are what?

107
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:22,350
Thinking about them. Like what about them? Need them not great.

108
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:28,620
They like wouldn't listen to us. It was like most these got to an issue and we were like, we need more.

109
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:34,230
This is a bit like a summer day camp setting. They had to have a certain number of staff for how many kids you have there.

110
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:39,660
And the way we were staff was we had exactly enough staff all the time so no one could ever take a break.

111
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:45,780
Oh, and like we would be working like overtime, like one or 2 hours, like every single day.

112
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:50,459
And we were going to hire more staff and like adjust the schedules, stuff like that.

113
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:57,390
And she just didn't listen. Eventually she did like hire more people, but then it was kind of like they didn't get trained.

114
00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:02,580
Well, she should have hired them at in the summer, but this was in Michigan.

115
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:07,799
Yeah, labor laws are pretty strict here, but yeah.

116
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,920
So that sounds like essentially not receptive to feedback.

117
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,219
We're dynamically responding to the needs of the workers.

118
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:22,340
How about you, Sam? I would say similar to that I've had previous supervisors and then one that sticks out.

119
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:30,690
It's not so good with. Yeah, listening communication did not exist and then demanding quarters and then leaving like me.

120
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:35,819
This isn't like a grocery store study and so like an online apartment, so it's like demanding everything.

121
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:41,130
And then she would walk out, do nothing. So it's just like kind of expecting everything but not doing anything.

122
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,910
Mm mm. How about you? Do you have an example?

123
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:50,610
I mean, I had a bad experience when I was an undergraduate.

124
00:12:50,640 --> 00:13:02,460
Uh huh. That's my like, my supervisor is, like, never talked to me and just she would assign the job to her,

125
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:06,690
one of her students, and then the future student would tell me what to do.

126
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:11,570
And then I just do the job. And she would never communicate anything with me.

127
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:17,569
Mm. Yeah. Yeah. So it sounds like it's pretty like hierarchical there.

128
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:20,690
Not a lot of transparency generally.

129
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:29,300
Like in, in, in, in the literature, what they find is the best type of leadership is what we call transformative leadership.

130
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:36,710
So transformative leadership leads to workplaces with the best safety outcomes but the highest job satisfaction.

131
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,040
It's a more democratic style of leadership.

132
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,549
It's not necessarily like letting the workers run the place.

133
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:49,710
Right? Like you clearly have a person that's in charge, but they're not dictating everything.

134
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:53,330
They're receptive to feedback. They have.

135
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:58,120
Like what you can tell is like empathy or support towards their employees.

136
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:03,199
So that is like one of the things we'll talk about. There's also cognitive psychology.

137
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:08,450
This relates to human factors, human behavior, human technology and human interaction.

138
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:16,790
So as I mentioned, I majored in cognitive science in undergrad and a lot of my classmates ended up doing super cool stuff.

139
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:20,480
A lot of them were in human technology interaction.

140
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:28,360
So thinking about the ways humans interface with technology, like if you have a keyboard that's projected out from a laser,

141
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:33,610
how does a person interact with that or thinking about different types of A.I.?

142
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:41,059
A lot of them ended up working into like U.S. Design and Silicon Valley or videogames.

143
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:48,080
Actually, one guy ended up working at Blizzard, World of Warcraft and then health psychology.

144
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:52,160
So causes and effects of occupational stress and then health promotion.

145
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:59,480
So obviously the primary purpose of HP is to maintain, develop or promote the health of employees.

146
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:04,760
And obviously we want to prevent injury and illness by creating safe work environments and reduce

147
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:11,719
the burden associated with morbidity and mortality for economic and humanitarian reasons.

148
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,770
Like in this picture here, obvious stock photos. So you have a construction worker.

149
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:25,730
This is historically a very traditional dangerous job like mining in the sense of like physical injury and then potentially illness.

150
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:33,200
But we have a lot of workplaces that are highly psychologically vulnerable,

151
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:43,250
like what professions do you know of where there is a high burden of morbidity and mortality that isn't necessarily physical labor.

152
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:48,670
Women aren't doctors and they have a huge dropout rate and like med school and stuff,

153
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,889
but just burn burnout and then like they're like, yeah, like suicide rates is like really high.

154
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:56,180
I feel like med students compared to other professions. Yeah. Yeah.

155
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:59,630
Doctors are one in particular.

156
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:08,000
You know, anesthesiology is they make good money, but it's can be a very depressing and depressing job.

157
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,969
You're isolated a lot of the time. You don't really get to interact with a lot of your patients.

158
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:17,660
You see a lot of trauma, right?

159
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,260
Other professions you can think of researchers.

160
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:30,490
Researchers as, yeah, definitely for various, various reasons.

161
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:41,300
Just like the demand of stress, the work hours, how hierarchical academia is, that the culture is very toxic.

162
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:45,680
Interestingly, dentists and also veterinarians as well.

163
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:51,590
I can't put my finger like the doctors thing makes sense to me,

164
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:57,380
but I can't quite put my finger on the dentists and veterinarian ones and I haven't looked into it.

165
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:03,260
I mean, dentists generally, you can look at dentists generally have their own private practice,

166
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:08,239
so they set their hours and aren't generally like on call.

167
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:16,969
Like if you have a dental emergency, your dentist is like, I can see you in two weeks like just like that to give to paying veterinarians, maybe.

168
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:22,430
It's very sad to see animals die all the time and then they get higher depression rates.

169
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:25,669
But I was reading about that over the pandemic.

170
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:30,560
More more burnout and suicide among veterinarians.

171
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:37,940
Okay so as we're getting and feel free to interrupt once you so yeah.

172
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:47,960
Okay now I understand why this. Oh yeah. They're like 2.5 to 5.5 times higher for suicide rates than like white collar workers.

173
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:55,010
Dentists. Yeah, they're like the 7/7 leading industry for suicide rates.

174
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:59,180
But why? Oh, yeah.

175
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:05,600
Another one. Another area where I'm doing a study right now, obviously, is construction high high suicide rates there.

176
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:12,770
So not just physical morbidity and mortality, but high suicide rates because of the way that work.

177
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:19,170
Culture here is in the United States. Right. Like it's a very manually laborious job.

178
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:24,810
And oftentimes you might get hurt, like you might have a musculoskeletal disorder, you might hurt your back.

179
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:33,030
And previous to the years where more attention has been focused on the opioid epidemic, think about, you know, think about you.

180
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:38,129
In a situation where you're a construction worker, you've hurt your back, you are on contract.

181
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:44,700
A lot of construction workers are contract workers. So you only get paid for the work that you do for that day.

182
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:48,000
Like you don't get salaried, right?

183
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:52,740
So you need to be able to use your body in a way to earn a living.

184
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:59,130
And you've now waited for weeks to see your doctor because that's how long it took, right?

185
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:06,150
So you want some kind of quick solution to get in and out back to work, so they just throw painkillers at you.

186
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:15,030
You don't have time to do, you know, physical therapy or acupressure, relaxation or massage.

187
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:24,060
And we'll talk about this more in the substance use disorder unit. But then it's it's very easy to get addicted to opioids.

188
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:30,570
When you run out of prescription opioids, you might then dabble into illegal opioids like heroin.

189
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:41,729
And then from that, you know, you can become it affects your mental health so you can become isolated or depressed or you may be using at work,

190
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:45,480
but you're afraid of the stigma associated with it.

191
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:54,960
So then it spirals out of control, or sometimes their pain gets so unmanageable they just don't feel like they have like the will to live anymore.

192
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:59,480
So it's particularly concerning in the construction industry.

193
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:02,580
Yeah, yeah, there's fighting. Yeah. Okay.

194
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:08,700
Nothing like specific. It's just like occupational stressors, toxins and substance use and untreated mental health problems.

195
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:14,339
Okay, that could be an interesting dissertation for somebody.

196
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:17,670
Yeah. Anyway, so.

197
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:23,669
Okay, so so in regard to the history of occupational health psychology, this history just keeps on going down.

198
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:31,739
That's I'm just going to. So the caveat is we only know what was published or translated in English, really.

199
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:38,160
So it's not to say that other countries didn't have stuff going on, but we just really didn't know about it because we couldn't read it.

200
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:44,669
So really in 1845, more attention is starting to be brought to this by Friedrich Engels.

201
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:51,270
He's a German guy, but this was translated into English called The Conditions of the Working Class in England,

202
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:59,830
where they're finally drawing attention to like these poor laborers and their working conditions and not just the impact on their mental health,

203
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:02,160
physical health, but also their mental health.

204
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:09,030
So this is really the first time like these kinds of conversations are being like widely distributed in print.

205
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:14,220
In 1867, you have Das Kapital by Karl Marx.

206
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:19,500
Are you familiar with Marx? Do you know what the dust capital is about?

207
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:25,770
Okay. Do you mind sharing? I'm sorry, but I'm just a quick summary.

208
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:39,270
What's it about? Is actually it described like the working class, this situation it analyze the whole, like, capitalism system.

209
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:48,960
Yeah. And it's great though I mean that we can sfh capitalism bad it's evil is basically like the crux of the book.

210
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:59,819
So then you start in 1911, you get into the principles of Scientific Management by Frederick Taylor, and he's an engineer by training.

211
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:08,639
So he starts looking at the workplace is kind of like an engineering issue where how can you manage people in such a way

212
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:16,770
that is more methodical in order to be able to like do things like pay people more or increase worker productivity.

213
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:23,280
So in the 1920s at this Western Electric Company and a Hawthorne plant,

214
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:30,840
they essentially use his tailoring framework to look at the relationship between working conditions and productivity.

215
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:38,010
And that's where you get the term Hawthorne Effect, how you've heard thought of that before now.

216
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:46,860
So the Hawthorne Effect is essentially this term that we use where if you are taking part in a research study and you know,

217
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:53,549
you are you start to change your behavior because you know, you're being observed, right?

218
00:22:53,550 --> 00:23:04,680
So that is what's called the Hawthorne Effect. So like, you know, like just say, for example, you enroll in over in a study in psychology and they,

219
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:09,510
you know, this study is about like willingness to help other people.

220
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:18,719
So they want to see you in a scenario. Where you help an old person cross the street because you know you're doing the study and you're being watched.

221
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:24,840
You're probably going to help the old person cross the street. Right? Whereas like maybe in another scenario would have you wouldn't push them,

222
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:29,370
but you might just like keep walking by with your headphones on or something like that.

223
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:30,149
It's the same thing.

224
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:38,040
It's like, you know, when it's like Lab Day, you know, DHS is coming around like people actually wear their lab coats and they're like goggles.

225
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:44,460
But otherwise, most of the time, like people have their headphones in, they're wearing like open toed shoes and blah blah, blah.

226
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:48,270
Like, I did that when I was in the lab cause I was in one when I was in San Diego.

227
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:52,860
Definitely wore flip flops, shorts and wore gloves, but that was about it.

228
00:23:53,560 --> 00:24:00,480
Um, yeah. Things I didn't know then. And then in the fifties and sixties,

229
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:06,090
we start to get investigations into the physical and mental health problems of auto workers here in the United States.

230
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,609
Parallel studies were going on in Europe.

231
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:14,730
So there's this place called the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations in London that started to look at minors as well.

232
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:25,020
And countries in Scandinavia are like super on the cutting edge in terms of occupational health, psychology and psychosocial factors of work.

233
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:33,920
So it was so interesting. Where was I? I was at some happy hours in the lounge or something like that.

234
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:37,490
I don't know. I was with other faculty, but one of the faculty, you know,

235
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:45,380
some people do work abroad and they were talking basically about like differences in countries and in terms of like sick leave and stuff like that.

236
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:51,710
And so here in the United States, you know, just say you're a woman and you have a baby.

237
00:24:52,220 --> 00:25:01,910
You're lucky if you can file FMLA and take like six two weeks, 6 to 8 weeks off right after you've like pushed a human out of your body.

238
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:10,040
But in certain countries in Scandinavia, you get anywhere between 12 to 16 months of paid time off.

239
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:16,549
And a lot of the research about psychosocial factors like the job demands, resources,

240
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:22,400
model, work, family conflict and all that comes from Scandinavian researchers.

241
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:27,980
They've they're they've implemented the four day workweek like a way long time ago.

242
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:36,650
So if you're open to moving out of the country for a job like Sweden, Norway, Finland is great.

243
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:45,469
So in 1965, Maslow's theory of self-actualization is applied to organizations.

244
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:49,790
So how many of you know about Maslow's hierarchy of needs?

245
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:53,590
Yeah. Yeah. Do you mind sharing, Bridget?

246
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:58,310
It's just the. I like this specific category.

247
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:01,890
Yeah, I like your basic needs at the bottom.

248
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:08,270
Like you had to fulfill each level to reach, like. Yeah, it was called, like, self-actualization.

249
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:12,139
Yeah, that's what I was. Yeah. So if we take a look here.

250
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:17,930
Okay, I don't need this video to play. It looks like the hierarchy of controls, but upside down.

251
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:27,410
So at the very basic level, right, our physiological needs air, water, food, shelter, sleep, clothing, and then reproduction.

252
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:36,860
And then after you achieve that level, you can move up to personal security, employment, resources, health and property.

253
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:45,470
And then once you get that, you can move up to the next level of looking for things like friendship, intimacy, family sense of connection,

254
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:55,670
and then esteem, self-respect, status, recognition, and then self-actualization is like kind of intangible, right?

255
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:58,940
So it's like the desire to become like the best to you.

256
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:03,380
And it's not to say that you can't simultaneously be working on, like,

257
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:09,649
safety needs and love and belonging while you don't have your physiological needs met.

258
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:15,110
It's a little bit more challenging, but essentially that's what Maslow is proposing there.

259
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:29,540
So there's so what they're saying is that self-actualization, that highest level, can be applied to organizations or workplaces.

260
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:35,149
And that's when you start to see like job theory's just booming,

261
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:43,000
like people creating job theories like crazy be like so like the company itself is trying to be the best company it can be.

262
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:50,870
Is that what you're saying? I'm thinking of your workplace as a place where you can become the best version of yourself.

263
00:27:51,410 --> 00:28:00,680
And like, yeah, like and then, you know, and have a lot like, not only like your financial needs, their needs met their, but your social needs.

264
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:08,840
You, you're getting a sense of purpose, but you're also getting a sense of fulfillment more than just a paycheck situation.

265
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,200
Yeah. Which I think is, is interesting, but it like makes sense.

266
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,440
It makes sense to me. Yes.

267
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:24,710
So many OHIP and social psychology contributions actually originate from the University of Michigan.

268
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:30,260
He's long dead now, but Renzi's like Likert, not Likert.

269
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:40,220
Likert is the guy who created the Laker scale, which is the strongly agree to strongly disagree scale.

270
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:51,590
That's the only thing that's considered liquored. So if you use strongly, likely, too strongly unlikely that is now liquor type, not liquor.

271
00:28:51,950 --> 00:29:01,339
I had a professor who was very particular about that or if he used something like bad to good, not liquor semantic differential scale.

272
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:04,310
But we'll get into those nuances in a little bit.

273
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:14,600
And then in 1966, this guy named Herzberg suggested that motivation and job satisfaction can be improved in order to improve people's work.

274
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:18,860
So he was like, he, he he started doing some observations.

275
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:28,520
He's like, hey, if we can increase how happy people are and how motivated they are, we can actually get more work out of them.

276
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:39,800
So why not, right? Then in the 1960s and beyond, you have Garneau from Sweden and other figures publishing widely on technology,

277
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:43,550
autonomy and control, participation in mental health.

278
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,250
And then in 1980s, still trying to secure a guest lecture from Dr. Rosenberg.

279
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:50,930
She's the Cardiovascular Week,

280
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:58,999
but she'll talk about the Whitehall study where this is essentially like a hallmark epidemiological study that's longitudinal,

281
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:08,630
looking at the relationship between your working conditions and then cardiovascular disease, the incidence and prevalence of cardiovascular disease.

282
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:18,380
And then finally, not until 1988 did they pioneer differences in the psychosocial work environment and finally

283
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:24,530
attribute that potentially to your social class and the incidence of coronary heart disease.

284
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:33,020
So this is, I would say, compared to a lot of other things, like a pretty new field, but it's only recent,

285
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:42,709
very recently catching on like in our professional conferences, like psychosocial factors is still very much like, huh, what is that like?

286
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:47,990
I don't know what that is. So, you know, but we're all affected by it.

287
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:55,840
And then in the nineties you have Barling looking at work, family conflicts and then you have, you know, researchers looking at a.

288
00:30:56,130 --> 00:31:03,210
Ployment and interestingly found that unemployment has does not have a uniform effect.

289
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:06,180
So it's neither bad nor good.

290
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:15,329
It could really go either way when looking at the psychological effects of recession and unemployment and like how many of you know,

291
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:18,540
somebody who became unemployed during the pandemic.

292
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:27,620
Yeah. Were they happy or really sad? I don't like was forced retirement like you can take an early retirement or you can go huh.

293
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:33,660
So he was to hear that while he was through the roof, he was very excited because he was retired early.

294
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:39,780
But that's a whole nother thing at this point, really. Okay. Well, now he's retired, right?

295
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:43,470
Is he living his best life? I bet he can. Okay.

296
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:47,129
Okay. So maybe let's say it's a plus for his.

297
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:56,040
A plus. Okay. How about Bridgette? Um, I feel like when I work at Starbucks and they did like, uh, like lay off, like, strategic layoff thing.

298
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:59,970
I think a lot of people were happy to take the layoff because, like,

299
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:05,820
they made more money on unemployment at that time than they would have if they worked at Starbucks full time.

300
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:11,490
Mhm. Um, but also when I worked in Chicago as a health educator,

301
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:19,200
I had like a few patients I would call them and we would talk about like their health behaviors and like their problems and stuff and like nutrition.

302
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:25,200
And then I would call them back in like a couple of weeks and they would be like, I quit my job and I'm so much happier.

303
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,169
Like I can focus on like my health and well-being.

304
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:34,200
And I was like, okay, I'm not sure if that was like a good thing for you to do or not, but, like, you seem happy.

305
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:42,779
I don't know. Okay. Interesting. So obviously, like, when you work in a low wage job like Starbucks, for example,

306
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:51,450
where like customers yell at you all day and like through coffee at you, I don't know, but maybe I haven't had anyone throw coffee.

307
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:54,830
Have you? Might have had people, like, yell at me, like, a lot. Yeah, yeah.

308
00:32:54,870 --> 00:33:01,379
I'm sorry. Yeah. So, I mean, obviously, like, when they were giving out unemployment at the beginning of the pandemic,

309
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:05,910
like, yeah, you would make more like versus like just think if you were like an engineer,

310
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:13,110
an apple or something and you were laid off like, I don't know, your unemployment that you're getting is not cutting it compared to your usual salary.

311
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:17,460
Oftentimes, though, when we look at the balances, psychosocial factors,

312
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:25,130
the people who are happy to no longer be employed or working at that job, that wasn't the job for them.

313
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:31,379
Right. Because a lot of the little a lot of literature demonstrates that work actually

314
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:39,160
provides a positive contribution to your life and actually helps you live longer.

315
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:44,549
Unless you do like a really dangerous job, like working on a boat, doing like fishing or something like that,

316
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:48,420
like a lot of people die just because of the socialization aspect.

317
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:58,590
Again, that like self-actualization and there's tons of research out there that shows like nonworking senior citizens versus working senior citizens.

318
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:06,300
The the mental and physical decline of those who don't work but also don't have hobbies,

319
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:13,740
don't have a social support system, happens very, very rapidly once they exit the work force.

320
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:17,999
So pros, pros and cons for sure.

321
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,790
But that's why I like they haven't found a uniform effect.

322
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:28,170
So as a result, researchers continue this body of work looking at like the long term health consequences from leaving work.

323
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:34,740
But the biggest takeaway, like I said, the beneficial effects of work can definitely outweigh the risks,

324
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:43,200
like when I mentioned I started here during the pandemic. So I moved here and literally sat in my house alone for a year.

325
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:50,370
So I've met most of my neighbors now, but I know like every dog because my office faces the street.

326
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:57,470
So like I may not recognize a neighbor, but if they tell me like who their what their dog looks like, I'm like, yes, you have the same way.

327
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:05,790
And ah, like you have the like brand like mutt hand that likes to like roll around in the grass in front of my lawn like, you know.

328
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:09,899
And it was just so lonely.

329
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:15,840
I was dying to come back to the office, even if I wasn't talking to anybody just to, like, see people.

330
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:22,470
And I think I came off really strong at first because I like was feral and I hadn't really talked to anybody in years.

331
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:29,610
I would come here and see people and just like corner the custodial staff and do these conversations are like we were like,

332
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:38,430
I have to go now, but I feel like I've readjusted to that because I'm now back at my baseline, which is like, please don't that.

333
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:44,340
But yes, the beneficial effects of it can outweigh the risks, the risks of work.

334
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:49,620
So some key institutions in occupational health psychology,

335
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:55,710
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, obviously the American Psychological Association.

336
00:35:56,060 --> 00:36:04,700
And we have some international institutes. And then labor unions historically have been a champion for worker well-being.

337
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:10,910
Now, I don't I don't know if I have more slides. I mean, there's the mission today, but we can talk more about it.

338
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:20,120
So generally a healthy work organization, you know, maintains a healthy work environment for their employees and in turn, their families.

339
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:27,170
Right. Because what you do here affects what goes on at home. They're also really resistant to market and economic changes.

340
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:35,930
This is harder for small businesses like restaurants that operate on really thin profit margins.

341
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:45,200
But, you know, generally, if there is like a recession, for example, or like a lot of new technology comes out or like society collapses.

342
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:51,440
The healthy organization is adaptable enough to continue surviving under those circumstances.

343
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:59,390
High productivity, high employee satisfaction, good safety records due to disability claims,

344
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:05,330
few union grievances, and then low absenteeism and low turnover.

345
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:13,070
And then there's also an absence of violence. Thinking off the top of our heads, like what?

346
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:17,570
What do we think is like a good example of a healthy work organization?

347
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:24,079
An example is Texas Pacific, though. Okay. That's okay. It's a grocery store.

348
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:29,540
That's it's called H-E-B. It's like I've heard of grocery store and they take really, really good care of their employees.

349
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:34,400
Um, there is. Once you're in, you're in. You don't want to leave pretty much.

350
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:35,630
And that much turnover.

351
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:42,620
They really care about the health and they're always kind of pushing for trainings or just kind of new stuff that's coming together to make sure,

352
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:47,810
especially for their work, like the distribution centers and stuff.

353
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:52,510
So I always hear about that. So that was a really good example from my personal experience.

354
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:58,640
What I worked for, I mostly worked for H-E-B, was like a manager for like their curbside on my orders.

355
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,210
Ah, I've heard about their fresh tortillas.

356
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:05,630
Yes, those are the best. I miss me so much. They're the best.

357
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:13,100
What about what was it like at Starbucks? Um, not that's not not like.

358
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:16,879
Okay, yeah. Obviously not resistant to market changes, right?

359
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:23,150
Because it sounds like they had to do some layoffs during the period. I mean, they did they did have like a leave.

360
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:31,130
Like they shut down those the stores for like six weeks, I think, and they paid everyone like their average weekly, like what they would normally get.

361
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:36,110
Um, but there was like definitely high turnover at Starbucks.

362
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:41,000
But a lot of that I think is due to like they hire a lot of high schoolers.

363
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:44,390
Yeah. Don't stick around like an entry level position.

364
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:48,229
Yeah. And like in management, they would have turnover pretty frequently, I'm sure.

365
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:56,210
Sure. But you know now as well, like, as you see, there's this rise in trying to unionize Amazon warehouses,

366
00:38:56,990 --> 00:39:01,520
specific Starbucks locations, and then the specific Trader Joe's as well.

367
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:12,230
But the tactic now is that if as a a Starbucks becomes unionized, they just shut down that branch, which is really messed up.

368
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,079
But we'll talk we can talk more about unionization.

369
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:24,590
A couple of classes ago, they had this running joke all the time about pizza parties because I had a really sarcastic student where he was like,

370
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:31,220
dude, to have pizza parties because obviously that is not the solution to keep your employees happy.

371
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:41,000
You know, one place in particular I can think of that I've heard mostly positive things about is Costco.

372
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:45,410
Everybody wants a job at Costco, including me.

373
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:53,000
If I don't get tenure, I think I'm going to go work at Costco honestly, because like the same thing like H-E-B,

374
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,399
apparently they treat their employees really well, you know, depending on the job you do.

375
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:03,650
So like obviously it would be experience of someone who works at the bakery is different than someone who operates a forklift.

376
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:07,100
They have really reasonable hours, great benefits.

377
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:18,229
On Sunday you get time and a half. So like the the door greeters slash, like receipt checker, people make like $30 on Sunday or something like that.

378
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:29,750
You have awesome benefits, you know, and you don't have to like think a ton, you know, and you see people seems really nice.

379
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:34,940
It's, it's really hard to get a job at Costco. I used to think Trader Joe's was a great place to work,

380
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:38,849
but my sister's friend worked at Trader Joe's and apparently it's very dysfunctional

381
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:43,159
and like a lot of stuff coming out about I haven't looked at it or read about it,

382
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:47,780
but like it's the the shadow is now starting to be seen.

383
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:58,280
Yeah. Yeah. And then also like a lot of just like racist hiring practices, but I mean, when you have a line called trader means like,

384
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:07,690
you know, like good exact rate but also like sexual harassment claims not being explored or dealt with.

385
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:16,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I mean, I feel like most of us have a better idea of what an unhealthy organization looks like because for the most part,

386
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:20,090
a lot of organizations are pretty unhealthy.

387
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:23,300
But organizational changes is very difficult.

388
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:27,740
So, so like we talked about changes in employment in particular.

389
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:32,390
I don't think there's anything else like what's in his closet. Okay.

390
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:38,209
So on the decline, obviously, are things like agriculture, forestry, fishing, etc., etc.,

391
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:42,470
but on the rise as the gig economy and again, all these types of things we talked about.

392
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:47,810
Interestingly, not interestingly, not surprisingly, I should say home health care aides and home health aides.

393
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:56,330
With the rise of baby boomers. But the interesting thing I would kind of put home care aides and home health aides as part of the gig economy as well.

394
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,570
Just because a lot of times, if they're not a family member,

395
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:10,549
it's a it's a lower barrier to entry into the nursing assistant field because unlike a certified nursing assistant or a medical assistant,

396
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:12,470
you don't need licensure to do that.

397
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:21,410
So it's often a lot of immigrant women who are either employed as a contractor by a company or they're like self-employed.

398
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:26,900
But because of that, they don't have any occupational protections or benefits that go along with it.

399
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:34,459
My mom is a certified nursing assistant who works she's been a certified nursing assistant for like well over a decade.

400
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:37,190
But she, you know, jumps around from nursing home to nursing homes.

401
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:46,849
Over the last five years, she's been in a nursing home that's more like low income and accepts patients who have Medicare slash Medi-Cal,

402
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:55,159
which is the California version. And it is a lot physically, but also like the mental abuse and then also physical abuse.

403
00:42:55,160 --> 00:43:01,190
Like she gets punched in hit by residents and she is like a tiny Asian woman.

404
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:06,980
But it's very it's unfortunately very common and like very little protections for them.

405
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:14,630
So those are a growing areas. And then the percentage of people who have more than one job has increased over time.

406
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,530
I mean, how many of you have had more than one job at once? Oh, yeah.

407
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:21,830
Right now. Yeah. Oh, that's right. You are. Yeah. Yeah.

408
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:24,830
I mean, it's not great, but you have to do it.

409
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:31,549
Do what you got to do. Right. And then nowadays people are having many jobs over a lifetime.

410
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:36,410
So of course, like boomers look at us and they're like, you can't commit to anything, blah, blah,

411
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:43,400
blah, because for them it's very common to graduate college and stay at that job until you're 65.

412
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:47,629
Don't care how crappy it is, don't care what the work environment is like.

413
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:48,890
I'm just going to stay here.

414
00:43:49,670 --> 00:44:00,260
Whereas now people will, for various reasons, leave jobs either because it's toxic or they've hit like the ceiling on pay and upward mobility.

415
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:03,230
So they'll jump somewhere else and somewhere else and somewhere else.

416
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:09,710
So work has become like a very dynamic environment and it used to be pretty static, I would say.

417
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:22,280
So here we go. With the baby boomers now retiring, there's many negative repercussions for them from a physical and psychosocial standpoint,

418
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:31,040
but also for us as a society where we have to prepare for this like mass exodus of this specific workforce,

419
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:34,669
which is in some ways good, but in some ways not great,

420
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:39,560
because now we're going to have a greater burden on social services, the health care system and all of that.

421
00:44:40,490 --> 00:44:44,150
Younger generations definitely changing workforce dynamics.

422
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:51,020
Gen Z and Millennials. I feel like nobody in my department knows what to do with me.

423
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:58,610
I'm very vocal compared to some of the other faculty and I don't have tenure and they're like, What are you doing?

424
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:03,200
You don't know tenure. I'm just like, This is messed up, guys.

425
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:07,160
Not that I don't have tenure, but like some of the stuff happening and I will speak up against it.

426
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:11,030
I mean, how many of you have noticed stuff like that in your workplace?

427
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:17,410
And I have noticed like in certain positions when I'm like really vocally, I'm like, this is kind of weird that we do it like this.

428
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:23,770
Specifically in my AmeriCorps position that I had, I think my position isn't so, oh wow.

429
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:26,540
You're not like, I didn't have accepted you as of the time.

430
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:33,680
And they were like surprised that I was like saying not so much because I was like, said AmeriCorps volunteer.

431
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:39,740
Yeah, but well, so what did you do for AmeriCorps? I was in a federally qualified health center.

432
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:44,900
Oh, health education. Like health coaching. Okay. So my undergrad is in health education.

433
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:45,410
Oh, okay.

434
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:53,780
I was supposed to be, like, out of school, and I, um, like a community clinic, and they were like in completely different neighborhoods in Chicago.

435
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:57,889
I was like, it's not really realistic for me to be at both of these places,

436
00:45:57,890 --> 00:46:07,910
like physically in person and then like the environment at the clinic, I was mostly I was like, they didn't really know I was there.

437
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:16,129
I had to introduce myself like bad times to them. And I was like, If you're going to put an AmeriCorps member here,

438
00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:23,030
you need to make sure that the doctors are going to use them because there is like a couple of months where like I was in the clinic like

439
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:28,870
multiple times a week and they were like none of the doctors knew I was there and they were supposed to be giving me patients disease.

440
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:36,670
So I was like telling people about that. And I was like, You should have put someone here next year if you can't guarantee them something to do.

441
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:41,260
Good for you. I think they did, like, restructure it to good.

442
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:47,310
Yeah. People hate people. I mean, some certain people hate feedback, I would say.

443
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:53,660
But yeah, definitely the workforce dynamics are changing. I would say I still feel pretty guilty about it.

444
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:56,829
Mostly, I think because I'm in academia, not because I'm a millennial,

445
00:46:56,830 --> 00:47:01,510
but like clear separation of work life boundaries and work life balance and notice.

446
00:47:02,050 --> 00:47:09,220
Gen Z is particularly good about that. Like I'm not gonna kill myself for this job in particular.

447
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:13,020
That's another thing. You should be working like 45 hours a week.

448
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:19,950
I was like, I'm absolutely not going to do that. Don't Americorp I know a lot of friends in AmeriCorps where they had to file for IBT.

449
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:24,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because we're making so little.

450
00:47:24,910 --> 00:47:31,330
Yeah. And then it was like, you get vacation, like there would be holidays.

451
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:34,870
How these were kind of kind of I guess it was just the messed up system like the holidays

452
00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:40,050
would count against you and your total hours like tally so that you have to like make it up.

453
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:47,110
And I remember I was talking to one of the other members and she was like she had missed like I think two, four weeks like over the holidays.

454
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:51,250
And she was like, Yeah, all I have to do is work 9 hours every day for the next like two months,

455
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:55,389
and then I'll be cut off and I'm just like, started laughing at her so hard.

456
00:47:55,390 --> 00:48:00,010
So I was like, That sounds insane. Like, you see how that sounds insane, right?

457
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:05,530
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's changing, it's changing.

458
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:11,020
And now there's definitely like this clash in the workplace, more women in the workforce,

459
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:14,410
definitely changing demographics and shifting cultural norms.

460
00:48:14,770 --> 00:48:21,700
Less men are going to college, too, and especially so since the pandemic, most men have stayed in college.

461
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:29,170
Interestingly, in our industrial hygiene program, age and occupational health has always been really male dominated.

462
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:36,760
But for the recent years, our classes, each cohort is becoming more 5050, and this year it's actually more,

463
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:42,669
more women than men, which is yeah, really interesting and nice to see race and ethnicity.

464
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:50,500
The U.S. workforce is becoming diverse despite certain pockets of the country really hitting that and pushing against it.

465
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:57,430
But sadly, at the same time, socioeconomic differences and and socioeconomic gaps are widening as a result.

466
00:48:57,430 --> 00:49:01,690
So the rich just keep getting richer and the poor just keep getting poorer.

467
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:07,180
And essentially the absorption of the middle class is very realistic.

468
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:14,140
And then also, you know, one positive things is person with disabilities, both physical and mental.

469
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:18,130
I guess, you know, you might a, you know, for them mentally might call them neurodivergent, right.

470
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:23,410
More so present and prevalent in the workplace in the past few decades, which is awesome.

471
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:36,549
I have an aunt who is mentally disabled and she lives in Germany and it is a very different model than here where she lives and works in a

472
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:47,860
community where she has a job and works among other persons with disabilities or neurodivergent people and they take care of her like really well.

473
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:51,759
And she gets like the health care and the services that she need, she needs.

474
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:55,360
And she's had that job for like years and years and years.

475
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:59,350
I cannot imagine something like that happening here in the United States.

476
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:07,900
But so, you know, when we're looking at models that fit within occupational health psychology, obviously the social ecological model.

477
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:11,740
Right. We'll go into detail later this semester.

478
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:18,250
Um, primary, secondary and tertiary interventions. But you know, there's things like practices for achieving total health.

479
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:22,360
We'll talk more about total worker health one health models.

480
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:28,480
So what this whole class is about psychosocial factors.

481
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:33,340
What is it? Okay, so couple definitions.

482
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:39,399
Psychosocial factors are characteristics or facets that influence individuals psychologically or

483
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:45,760
socially in relation to their social environment and how this affects their mental and physical health.

484
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:53,050
This other definition social, cultural, environmental phenomenon influences that affect mental health and behavior.

485
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:58,900
Influences include social situations, relationships, pressures, competition, education, health care,

486
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:04,629
other social resources, rapid technological change, work deadlines, changes in social roles groups.

487
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:11,320
But I kind of like the first one better because it's more succinct and I feel like the second one.

488
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:14,950
It tries to be all encompassing, but it's kind of missing some stuff.

489
00:51:16,090 --> 00:51:23,380
So we're going to watch a very short video on this and hopefully the sound here just so we don't pull out your years.

490
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:29,920
Okay. The term psychosocial health is frequently used today.

491
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:38,840
But do we actually know what it means? Let's explore the life of Murray for a few minutes.

492
00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:49,580
Mary's character is shaped by her experiences of possession, her thoughts, feelings and behavior and her lifestyle.

493
00:51:51,320 --> 00:52:01,700
Mary also exists in a social environment, is an environment that consists of her close social contacts, like her family, friends, colleagues.

494
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,860
But Murray also is within a broader social context.

495
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:20,670
This can include society as a whole or a particular cultural environment, something that can vary according to the country in which it is something.

496
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:25,240
As visual health is a product of its interactive relationship that Marie shares

497
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:30,760
with a social environment that describes a state that is constantly changing.

498
00:52:35,330 --> 00:52:40,100
Psychosocial health can also be strengthened or weakened by a number of influences.

499
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:52,490
Such includes extremely most personal abilities like the development of the relationships, as well as physical qualities like a disability or disease.

500
00:52:54,320 --> 00:53:06,020
The distribution of material cause, social inequalities, workplace stress and religious spiritual beliefs could affect psychosocial health as well.

501
00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:13,140
Let us know that a traumatic event has occurred in his life.

502
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:19,710
Her brother has died. She knows the effects of his loss, both mentally and physically.

503
00:53:20,550 --> 00:53:25,170
Maureen mourns. Brother is unable to work for a temporary period of time as a result.

504
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:29,220
She also loses her eyesight and feels depressed.

505
00:53:32,290 --> 00:53:38,080
Depending on his age, woman could also negatively affect her performance in school,

506
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:43,090
the professional future, or her relationship with her close social contacts.

507
00:53:45,930 --> 00:53:51,140
During this difficult period of time. The consoled by her family and friends.

508
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:56,390
This helps her deal with the situation and then come to terms with it.

509
00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:04,440
If you take all this into account, the expression can be refined this way.

510
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:08,879
Psychosocial health is an alternating condition that involves the reciprocal

511
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:13,500
adjustment and dependency between an individual and his or her social environment.

512
00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:25,510
Okay. That's just a very. It's so hard to find good YouTube videos.

513
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:31,659
Okay. So so he defines it as the interaction between the person and their social environment.

514
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:34,870
But I think to a move broadly as the environment in general.

515
00:54:35,170 --> 00:54:36,729
So that could be the social environment,

516
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:41,950
that could be the work environment that could also be placed in the lived environment, which we'll talk more about.

517
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:49,660
So some psychosocial factors are organizational culture, leadership, as we mentioned, worker capacity.

518
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:57,879
For example, I was watching some some videos where they were talking about how like Target is becoming like a Wal-Mart,

519
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:01,540
like the perception because every target you go into is trashed,

520
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:08,620
but it's because the customers are being terrible and not putting things back and they're like so low staffed right now.

521
00:55:09,070 --> 00:55:12,280
So worker capacity like in terms of numbers as well.

522
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:17,950
But mentally like if you go into your workplace and you just see like they'll your whole department

523
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:22,929
trashed and like this is what you have to do and then only to know like when you come back the next day,

524
00:55:22,930 --> 00:55:26,440
it's going to like look like trash again. It's really disheartening.

525
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:33,760
Worker needs, safety, climates, less culture, which we'll talk more about psychological support,

526
00:55:33,790 --> 00:55:39,970
workload management, job demands, which we'll talk more about recognition and reward.

527
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:46,570
This doesn't always have to be things like a bonus, but it could even just be like a kudos or acknowledgment.

528
00:55:46,570 --> 00:55:52,810
I feel I feel like that a lot of workplaces don't even do that job satisfaction,

529
00:55:53,260 --> 00:56:00,370
social support from coworkers or even beyond creativity, engagement, role, clarity.

530
00:56:00,370 --> 00:56:02,380
This is one maybe that you you know,

531
00:56:02,770 --> 00:56:09,249
we're talking about in terms of your AmeriCorps position where you weren't really sure what you were supposed to be doing.

532
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:14,500
And it seemed like nobody knew what you were supposed to be doing either.

533
00:56:14,890 --> 00:56:17,469
So along with that, being frustrated, right.

534
00:56:17,470 --> 00:56:26,530
That impacted other facets of your work influence in decision making, how much influence and autonomy do you have in your workplace?

535
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:34,389
Job security, communication, psychological and sexual harassment in the workplace, which is very real,

536
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:43,540
unfortunately, violence and then some other psychosocial factors not related to work, loneliness, marriage status,

537
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:50,259
which I would consider this, you know, because you might think of marriage status as either you're married or you're not married,

538
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:59,830
but in an intangible way, it does affect your social environment for sure.

539
00:57:01,930 --> 00:57:06,100
Social disruption, bereavement, meaning like time you take off to grieve.

540
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:16,930
Like as we saw in the video, social integration, emotional support, stress is the biggest one hostility, depression, hopelessness and much more.

541
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:20,919
So all of these psychosocial factors we're talking about.

542
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:24,309
Like I feel like most of us have experienced it.

543
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:27,940
Right. But can you see it?

544
00:57:31,730 --> 00:57:35,840
Maybe, and like the worker standpoint, like the productivity goes down.

545
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:42,770
So that's something you could see, like a person being slower or not caring as much, but not really.

546
00:57:45,390 --> 00:57:52,440
I do think that, you know, if someone's depressed, I mean, if you have, like,

547
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:57,780
emotional intelligence or you're good at reading people's faces, you can you might be able to see it.

548
00:57:57,930 --> 00:58:01,530
Yeah. The question is, how do I measure it?

549
00:58:03,830 --> 00:58:07,890
Okay. Proxies. Yeah. That's what we're going to learn about this semester.

550
00:58:08,910 --> 00:58:16,020
Um, so, I mean, obviously early signs of health decline, so all of those psychosocial factors can lead to things like fatigue,

551
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:25,110
malaise, body aches, sleep disruption, anxiety, mild depression, and even influence your nervous system and your endocrine system.

552
00:58:25,470 --> 00:58:29,879
You know, so they have like the the what the fear response.

553
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:33,900
They say the old traditional way was fight or flight.

554
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:39,110
Right. But there's now fight flight threes and then fun.

555
00:58:39,670 --> 00:58:49,680
Fortunately for me, I am fine mode where when I get an overwhelming amount of stress, I just want to go take a nap.

556
00:58:50,070 --> 00:58:53,990
Like, my body is like, Oh, this is too much for us.

557
00:58:54,000 --> 00:59:02,260
So where you have a grant do but we're so sleepy right now, even if you just drink like four coffees, right?

558
00:59:02,490 --> 00:59:07,590
Unfortunately, I wish I was in that, like, flight mode, like some faculty are, where they're just, like, very.

559
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:12,150
Whereas I'm just like, I sometimes freeze though, right?

560
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:23,310
And now, unfortunately, because of the way things have happened, my nervous system and my digestive system, I'm very tied to one another.

561
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:28,290
So like these kinds of things can manifest itself in very negative ways.

562
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:37,559
So there's really two main categories of psychosocial factors, those that have adverse effects on health, right?

563
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:41,370
So they can can cause or exacerbate a negative outcome.

564
00:59:41,670 --> 00:59:50,640
And then those that positively contribute to worker well-being and it can have a curative or rehabilitative effect even.

565
00:59:52,200 --> 01:00:01,020
So kind of thinking of this mapping exercise, if we're thinking about something like your your GPA,

566
01:00:01,530 --> 01:00:07,830
I don't you know, I guess people still care about it at this level, right in grad school.

567
01:00:08,490 --> 01:00:11,580
But I would say not as much and not as much as undergrad.

568
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:16,950
But undergrad, yeah. Do we want to pick a different example besides GPA, then what's important to you right now?

569
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:25,110
I'd say career outcomes. That might be something that most grad students can relate to.

570
01:00:25,170 --> 01:00:31,200
Okay. So if we do career outcomes, right.

571
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:38,280
Is that securing a job? Yeah, sure.

572
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:47,730
What are some psychosocial factors that might impact you getting that job?

573
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:54,990
I would say I mean, first thing comes to me is like social support.

574
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:57,030
Okay. How so?

575
01:00:58,020 --> 01:01:07,829
You know, you have friends and stuff that either are looking for jobs and maybe some of them are getting jobs in that same you acquire the same ones.

576
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:14,210
They got it. So it's just kind of like the newness or, you know, there's a lot because it is social support, I think.

577
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:18,090
And then you get your children and get a job. Yeah, I mean, it's always nice.

578
01:01:18,090 --> 01:01:19,770
Like social support, for example.

579
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:27,299
This can come in the form of not just friends but also maybe families, mentors, people who will look at your cover letters.

580
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:31,830
People will serve as your references, right? People who are like, go you.

581
01:01:31,830 --> 01:01:40,260
And then yeah, like we'll celebrate you when you get a job. But there are also people like maybe you're still too young in this stage of your life.

582
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:48,720
Now that I'm older, I've cut a lot of people, I've got a lot of people out of my life, but also like people just like grow apart.

583
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:54,600
But like you start to realize you have these people in your life who can't be happy for you,

584
01:01:54,930 --> 01:02:02,579
or like when you share a positive experience with them, they get jealous and insecure about themselves or they try to one up you.

585
01:02:02,580 --> 01:02:05,760
And it's like, I don't have the energy for this that we're not.

586
01:02:05,910 --> 01:02:11,069
We're done. We're done. I mean, it's easier when people get married and have kids and that kind of just, like, naturally go away.

587
01:02:11,070 --> 01:02:17,190
But it's. Yeah, that's. Yes, yes, yes. What other factors might influence your your job?

588
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:31,760
Other psychosocial factors. I think like in this specific situation, if you're applying for jobs when you're in school,

589
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:37,910
like your work load will also have a big influence if you're going to have time to like put together a good application.

590
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:42,860
Yeah. Don't even have career services here anymore. Yeah, we do.

591
01:02:42,890 --> 01:02:46,360
Oh, it's great. Who replaced Krystal? Maddie. Okay.

592
01:02:46,390 --> 01:02:49,550
I worked there last year. Miller. I'm a huge advocate for the careers office.

593
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:54,760
Okay. I don't know, because the industrial hygiene students just get jobs without career services.

594
01:02:57,830 --> 01:03:06,049
What else might that we talked about on the psychosocial factors, those that might influence you, getting that job gave you that.

595
01:03:06,050 --> 01:03:12,080
I'm sorry. Like from the list that we talked about, like, you know, these things.

596
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:15,320
What else might affect you getting that job?

597
01:03:15,530 --> 01:03:20,059
I thought influence and decision making on there was a huge thing for me.

598
01:03:20,060 --> 01:03:23,530
Like when I was choosing a grad program, when I was using an internship.

599
01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:31,950
Like, just like. Decision paralysis like I think so hard about making a decision that I like.

600
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:37,350
Don't don't make it for the longest time. Yeah, I was through the same process.

601
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:42,720
Were you worried about making the wrong decision? Yeah. Okay. Do you feel like you did?

602
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:45,690
Oh, no. Okay. That's okay if you did.

603
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:59,310
You know, nowadays, I mean, we've all applied for jobs where they ask you, do you have a disability or do you require accommodations?

604
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:03,450
Yeah. Yeah. I never know how to answer those.

605
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:14,520
I mean, I know. Right. But I'm a I'm a person with depression and anxiety, which people would technically consider a disability.

606
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:20,850
Most things I'm like coming to terms with like my anxiety is like a disability technically.

607
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:29,730
Right. I think if you feel a lot of like hopelessness, depression, too, that, you know,

608
01:04:29,730 --> 01:04:35,400
you should go through the whole process of getting a job, but you're not going to jobs as it gets weaker and weaker and stuff.

609
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:43,790
Yeah, I've heard about how like right now there's so many empty like job openings and some people will apply to like 100 jobs and just like,

610
01:04:43,810 --> 01:04:48,780
never hear back. So it's like, are they actually hiring anybody?

611
01:04:50,130 --> 01:05:03,510
You know, I have a friend, for example, who is in academia and they have a formally diagnosed ADHD and also like low level autism.

612
01:05:03,510 --> 01:05:11,910
And I was like, okay, so do you plan to like disclose that when you apply because certain circumstances create triggers?

613
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:19,559
Right. And so they were like, no, like I try so hard to to mask those things without throughout my life.

614
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:28,860
So that could affect potentially what the job outlook looks like, you know, in terms of this.

615
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:33,510
Are you all concerned with job security right now or are you just want to get a job?

616
01:05:35,950 --> 01:05:39,040
And just briefly, what is his job security like long term?

617
01:05:39,070 --> 01:05:42,940
You had a job for a long time or it was job security.

618
01:05:42,970 --> 01:05:49,970
I mean, it's like, you know, you know, you know, I mean, like for some people, it's important that they start a position that won't be over in a year.

619
01:05:49,990 --> 01:05:54,100
And some people really look for something that's just going to be over in a year.

620
01:05:55,240 --> 01:06:02,049
Or like, do you want to have a job where you're basically, you know, just told what to do or do you want to,

621
01:06:02,050 --> 01:06:08,530
like, work from home and have a lot of autonomy and ability, like create your own projects.

622
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:13,840
So these are all like certain things to think about.

623
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:24,280
But I would say like if we discuss like every single type of psychosocial factor we can somehow how we were all related essentially to that.

624
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:33,610
How many of you have never applied for like a certain type of job because you were worried about psychological or sexual harassment?

625
01:06:36,140 --> 01:06:43,580
Now, I wouldn't say in particular, but, you know, like, for example, for here,

626
01:06:43,610 --> 01:06:49,610
like the university has had a lot of scandal regarding sexual misconduct.

627
01:06:50,540 --> 01:07:03,230
So I was interviewing right as Philbert was being deposed and his picture was still like hanging out in ESP one and all that kind of stuff.

628
01:07:03,830 --> 01:07:08,120
And I, now that I know what I know about him because he came from HHS.

629
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:14,419
Right? I'm really glad I was hired long after he left.

630
01:07:14,420 --> 01:07:24,499
And I never had to interact with him because like, I mean, I feel like this is unspoken, but it's kind of sad to say, like,

631
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:32,780
I feel like I'm glad I've never been sexually harassed at work before because it's very common and my friends tell me about it.

632
01:07:32,780 --> 01:07:35,870
But I'm like, I wouldn't know what to do in that situation.

633
01:07:35,870 --> 01:07:37,040
It's very uncomfortable,

634
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:43,430
especially with the power dynamics of somebody who has tenure and is more senior than you for those kinds of things happening.

635
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:51,590
So stress can be good sometimes though, right?

636
01:07:51,590 --> 01:07:57,440
So we want in the scale of stress here where we're looking at performance and demand,

637
01:07:58,580 --> 01:08:03,200
you know, if you don't have enough demand, you end up in boredom.

638
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:05,870
And if you have too much demand, you end up in exhaustion.

639
01:08:06,140 --> 01:08:11,030
And what we're kind of aiming for is this perfect curve in the middle, and it's called youth stress, right?

640
01:08:11,030 --> 01:08:17,660
Because if you're in a position where you're under stimulated, you're not going to feel very compelled to do much of anything.

641
01:08:18,980 --> 01:08:28,220
And in developing countries in particular, the socio cultural environment changes what happens with the incidence and problems of disease,

642
01:08:28,550 --> 01:08:35,930
but also socioeconomic status and educational background influence the way people react to stress and change.

643
01:08:36,290 --> 01:08:44,980
Some people take very different approaches to it and then depending on religion and cultural patterns as well, people react to stress differently.

644
01:08:44,990 --> 01:08:54,740
So like religiosity, for example, like some people use their faith as a way to cope with stress or like,

645
01:08:54,770 --> 01:08:58,669
you know, if you have like a spiritual practice, right?

646
01:08:58,670 --> 01:09:01,040
That can be stress relieving for you.

647
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:11,360
Economic conditions also, in fact, influence and capacity to handle stress and then exposure to chemicals or physical hazards.

648
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:22,670
So like these small factories, artisanal mom and pop shops generally have better psychosocial atmospheres than large industries generally.

649
01:09:24,140 --> 01:09:33,380
So like just say that you work for like a local restaurant versus like if you work for The Cheesecake Factory or something.

650
01:09:33,740 --> 01:09:40,970
My guess is you probably have a better time working at the local mom and pop shop than like a large corporation.

651
01:09:41,330 --> 01:09:48,020
There's exceptions to the rule, of course, but generally that seems to be the case with psychosocial factors.

652
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:54,440
In terms of occupational protections, it's usually flipped because occupational protections,

653
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:59,780
the most of the regulations only apply to workplaces with ten or more employees.

654
01:10:00,050 --> 01:10:04,129
So when you work in a small business like that, that's kind of the risk that you're taking.

655
01:10:04,130 --> 01:10:08,090
But a lot of people really don't realize they are taking that risk even.

656
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:17,570
So that's all I had really for today. I mean, do we have questions regarding the content?

657
01:10:18,980 --> 01:10:23,000
Okay. I guess I just want to make sure I have a definition, right.

658
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:31,530
Because just like sexual factors, like things that impact your mindset and social environment, it's always right.

659
01:10:31,900 --> 01:10:36,830
I the impact your site, your your mind really and like in the workplace or whatnot.

660
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:45,710
So essentially it's like the environment that is not the physical environment and how that impacts your physical and mental health.

661
01:10:45,750 --> 01:10:49,760
Okay. Yeah. I don't know why I always get tripped up by the wording of cycles.

662
01:10:49,790 --> 01:10:55,429
That's okay. It can be a little bit confusing. And then like, let me just preview the syllabus.

663
01:10:55,430 --> 01:11:01,010
So you actually don't have anything that is due this week?

664
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:14,750
I believe you actually don't have anything do for a while. So looking ahead on starting next week,

665
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:23,360
we'll talk about the community and environment a little bit more and then we'll start talking about survey methodology.

666
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:29,330
And then you do have a quiz do and then we'll talk more about the actual environment.

667
01:11:29,930 --> 01:11:33,650
I don't know about that, Tony. Sorry. It should just be environment.

668
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:43,640
And then we'll talk about the built environment, community environment, and then kind of start working on your questionnaires and things like that.

669
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:50,030
So yeah, starting next week we'll start getting into to survey methodology a little bit more.

670
01:11:50,690 --> 01:11:56,330
But you don't have anything to do this weekend. Anybody have exciting Labor Day plans?
