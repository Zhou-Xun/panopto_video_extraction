1
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,450
And I knew I would lose one ambition.

2
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:15,390
I was just to know which one of run.

3
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:21,450
P lambda landed zero one. But this one.

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,990
Oh, this one. Okay. So those are wrong.

5
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:33,230
I hear here? Yeah.

6
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,200
I think this is business. So is this a zero?

7
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:43,780
This Beaux Arts zero. Sorry. If that makes sense.

8
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:47,270
Right. So this is one of you, but I'm glad you zero.

9
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:52,010
So this is social? Yeah. Without the first. You know everything here.

10
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:55,490
It's 000.

11
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,209
Oh, yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah.

12
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:34,440
Sorry. Okay, thank you. Thank you. This.

13
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:01,920
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, you did?

14
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:05,670
Yeah. You need to specify the proportions.

15
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:11,230
So there were two voices. I, I also want to do something different.

16
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,170
I have to make sure that you go. Oh, yeah, I just forgot.

17
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:22,530
I was trying to follow up with that, but I forgot the user ID.

18
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,260
Sorry. Make sure you.
