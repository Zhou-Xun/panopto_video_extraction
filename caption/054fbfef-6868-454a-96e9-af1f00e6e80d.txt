1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:06,479
So if they were going to go through a cross-sectional or an ecological study, as these are true of like a lot less carbon,

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,670
you might not see these as much in a merger, but they're still like two very important study designs that we have.

3
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:19,920
We're going to go through a cross-sectional first, hopefully have time for a break and then move on to Ecological and we got time at the end.

4
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:24,890
I have a few in-class exercises and some problems working together.

5
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:28,860
So first for our cross-sectional studies,

6
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:35,970
these are for describing the relationship between an exposure and outcome as they exist in the population at a single point in time.

7
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:44,220
That's a very important thing for cross-sectional study is if you remember nothing else, we are measuring exposure and outcome at the exact same time.

8
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:47,760
There is no temporality there, both of them at the same time.

9
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,600
So since we're doing this at a single point in time,

10
00:00:51,960 --> 00:01:00,150
is it possible to identify an association with the cross-sectional study that has like the opposite true causal association?

11
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:09,030
We're like, if we're looking at exposure to outcome, it's actually the other way around what the outcome is caused by exposure in the examples.

12
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:16,620
I'm so unpopular on this kind of like the obesity paradox where like people who

13
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:21,450
are obese or have a higher weight are actually protected from heart disease.

14
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:30,159
That's not true. It's actually just like a survival bias kind of issue where people feel or like people just die before they got there.

15
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,990
And they were looking at people who are happened to be more beings who have like lower rates.

16
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,690
The same thing could be true if you're looking at like infection or malnutrition because

17
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:43,050
both can kind of cause the other one depending on where you're looking in time.

18
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:47,790
If you're measuring them at the same point in time, you can't tell which one's causing which in that situation.

19
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,089
And so for the cross-sectional, study design looks very similar to all of our other ones.

20
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:59,100
But that very key point being that it is measured at the exact same time.

21
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,310
So we could only see the people who come here at this point in time.

22
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:07,140
You do get like that survival bias issue. You do get people who are just like leaving or not.

23
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,060
We have no idea what's happening before this.

24
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:16,350
And so another way to look at it is that we're kind of just looking at right here about what's in the safe.

25
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:21,900
We have no idea how fast people are coming into it. We have no idea how fast people are leaving it.

26
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,970
We can only look at prevalent cases.

27
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:35,490
And so it's pretty much because all the episodes that we do for a cohort, so we actually can see how fast people are coming and leaving for that.

28
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,950
I'm also a scientist. We have temporality.

29
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:43,479
We do get a sense of what's going on, but for cross-sectional with only see like what's here in that one snapshot.

30
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,400
And we're like walking into the bathroom, seeing how much was in the sink and you're walking out.

31
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,370
You have no idea what happened before that. You have no idea what happens afterwards.

32
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,580
So that basic design is like, we're going to find our population,

33
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:01,860
we're going to gather our data on exposure and disease at the exact same point in time.

34
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:09,239
And then people can get filtered into one of four groups of their exposure who have a disease exposed and don't have disease.

35
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:17,490
And that's kind of like building a two by three table that long used to say very important, is that we were doing this at the same point in time.

36
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:23,490
I want to keep saying that so important time exposure and there's no temporality here.

37
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:28,320
We are looking at like what causes what people are exposed to x and does it cause outcome?

38
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:38,380
Why right now? So some measures that we can get are prevalence ratio and this is like prevalence of your people have the you're exposed

39
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:45,780
to unexposed does provide information on that relative prevalence of disease and we're exposed compared to the unexposed.

40
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:54,360
This is influenced by both the incidence among the exposed and unexposed and the duration of disease in the two groups.

41
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,880
But again, like, we're not seeing how long that happens.

42
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:06,530
So again, thinking about like the st are like insulin is like how much water is going out the st your duration is like how fat,

43
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:17,010
how long it's saying in the st before it flows out. If a disease is rare, this prevalence ratio about equals, that is our influence.

44
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:22,410
I was thinking like a really slow looking say for a prevalence odds ratio.

45
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:25,560
You talk about this exact same way you would do an odds ratio.

46
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:30,810
Make sure if anyone that if you're doing a cross-sectional study and someone asking for like a

47
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:37,740
measure say it's a prevalence odds ratio is not an odds ratio is an important distinction for that

48
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:43,130
make sure you say is a prevalence odds ratio again if the duration of disease a short this

49
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:48,300
relationship were hold where your prevalence odds ratio was about a quarter and sometimes say ratio.

50
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:56,129
And for this you can like think about like a really acute infection like someone was only going to last like maybe like three days if you

51
00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:04,680
get that's like that snapshot like that's like pretty comparable to like the insulin because it's a very short period of time if you want.

52
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,919
There is more than like a minor epi if you guys want to do it.

53
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:12,650
But the proof, I'm going to talk about it more if you really like mass marijuana.

54
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:21,810
So most data collection for our cross-sectional study is going to be face to face interviews, assessment, telephone interview,

55
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:26,100
or are you going to do like some self completion forms and you are actively gathering

56
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:31,079
information or not using historical records or anything like that for a retrospective cohort?

57
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:39,620
But you are gathering that information, actually. So some sampling for this.

58
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:43,089
You really want to find your study group for your target population.

59
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:50,600
You have to complete a set of people for whom you want those your study results apply to and then your study group or your

60
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:57,050
sample is that subset of the target population who you are going to assume as representative of that target population.

61
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,889
You really want to do that before you do the study,

62
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:06,290
because if you're at the end of it and you have to define that very well and you find out you don't have the right group of people,

63
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:10,910
then your results might not be usable. Some examples for that.

64
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:16,410
We're running the I also study you, which is a community associated with SARS-CoV-2.

65
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,240
Our target population is everyone but our subset.

66
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:26,600
This is going to be people who work at the University of Michigan, who are in our study when we're suing those people or representative.

67
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:34,400
And then the key thing is to remember this again, by which difference here when we say representative, that is going to be about like exchangeable.

68
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:41,030
And I feel like when we say like this is like representative of that, you might think like this population like looks about this way.

69
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:46,490
It might you might think more like, oh, they're about the same age and sex distributions and that kind of stuff.

70
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:53,300
It's more you want to make sure that your population is going to react the same way under your other conditions.

71
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,690
So it's not as much like do they look the same?

72
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:02,659
It's like really if like we have that time machine that we took this group of people and put them through the exact same conditions,

73
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:13,920
are they going to have the same outcome? And our survey population is growing and that subset, ideally it's representative.

74
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:18,370
You might run into a few issues where like there are not, for example,

75
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:26,349
a lot of national surveys trying to like do like the entire states will try to include people who are like servicemen from abroad,

76
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:31,780
people who live in Hawaii, Alaska, people like in institutions and like nursing homes and stuff like that.

77
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:35,110
Those people frequently get like mess because of really hard to get.

78
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:40,929
So a lot of times when someone says like a national survey, it might be more like like the continental United States,

79
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:45,850
like excluding territories, Alaska and Hawaii, because it's just a bit harder to get to those people.

80
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:58,360
So our cross-sectional sizing, so I'm going to collect that from every person of the population and take a sample or take a sample of the population.

81
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:07,090
The census does try to get everyone sometimes really into the sample population, but the theory is everyone.

82
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:14,890
Then we can just do our sampling and survey to get like a segment of the population that's like the most common thing will do.

83
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:23,830
Loss of control of us, time consuming for you. The schemes for that can either be a probability sampling or non probability.

84
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:31,299
It was probability that every single person in that population has a non-zero chance of getting included.

85
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,390
So everyone does at some level have a chance of being included in that.

86
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:43,360
The weakness for the non probability sampling when people some people do have a 0% chance that you might end up having some selection bias issues.

87
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:51,040
So our sampling frame is the population from which the sample is taken.

88
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:54,460
It might be a list of people if it's available.

89
00:08:55,030 --> 00:09:01,350
If not, it's just like the equivalent for like identifying individuals for your population elements.

90
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:07,149
I could just be like households or like farms or school districts or something like that.

91
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:12,160
You're trying to narrow it down so you can kind of like get like your general inflow of people from.

92
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:19,959
So for a probably sampling schemes, there are a lot some of them are pretty high level for this class.

93
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:28,480
Don't worry we're on the focus on these four. So for sample random sampling as a self that supports random that's when you're just like,

94
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,260
you know, you have a bag full of marbles, you're picking out people at random.

95
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:36,100
In theory, every single person has the exact same probability of being chosen.

96
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:44,290
You could even go through a systematic sampling. It's like when you take like a third individual after you pick some more random.

97
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:50,530
So you might have a random number generator, you have a group line, you have like a line of like 500 people.

98
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:53,370
Your random number generator gives you 20,

99
00:09:53,470 --> 00:10:01,150
you start at the 20th person and then you take every third individual until you meet like your sample size and some of those like early career.

100
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:07,410
So these are people like researchers would wait outside of grocery stores and like take like the 10th person,

101
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:17,379
like every type of person who came in to take a swab just to get like a great deal of like antibodies in the population for stratified sampling.

102
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:22,540
You're going to classify all your people in the subpopulations or strata and then choose from that.

103
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:26,670
In theory, it'll give you like a more like representative sample.

104
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:32,650
Those levels or strata can be all like age, sex, level of exposure, whatever you need it for,

105
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,760
just whatever is going to make your final sample of the most representative though.

106
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:46,630
So it does based on your your study question for cluster sampling kind of the same thing where we put everyone into a group.

107
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:50,889
But then when you randomly choose it, you're picking up the entire cluster,

108
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:53,920
you're not picking up people from it, you're picking up the entire cluster.

109
00:10:54,970 --> 00:11:00,610
Do be careful for these because if you're close to clusters or something like neighborhoods or like schools or something,

110
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:05,049
there could be a reason people are in that school or in that neighborhood.

111
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:10,200
If you're picking like a neighborhood that's full of like McMansions versus like apartment complexes,

112
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:14,530
like those people are probably going to be different on a number of levels.

113
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:24,700
You can also do multi stage sampling. This is where we have like hierarchies of clusters and that's like keep layering on like the clusters.

114
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:32,379
And so like you eventually get down to like sub sampling and we'll go through a more in-depth example of that a little bit.

115
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,150
But when you do multisite sampling,

116
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:41,020
a very important part of it is using your weights because not everyone is going to have the same probability of being a sample that way.

117
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:47,200
So when we use our weights, it's used when that probability sampling is less of a random sample.

118
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:55,420
I was going to just on equal selection probability. We're trying to equate the people who were not picked for whatever reason that was,

119
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:59,650
to try and make that final population more representative of what's actually there.

120
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:05,230
It will compensate for non-response adjust for like the sample based on key variables interest.

121
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:13,490
Well that be. Age, sex, race, or any other conditions like you're trying to look at for low sampling.

122
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:19,700
Rates are pretty easy. There's going to be one over your probability of being selected, and that's for each individual.

123
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:26,390
So it's going to inflate the factors or represent the number of individuals in that survey population.

124
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,020
So the higher your sampling probability, the lower your weight is going to be,

125
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:34,490
and vice versa, the lower your sampling probability, the higher your weight is going to be.

126
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:38,090
So we can just kind of like inflate your influence for those final measures.

127
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:44,090
And we're not, like, completely steamrolling over people who otherwise might just be, like, hidden in the population.

128
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:52,890
Any questions before we get going? Next we have a cross-sectional cohort.

129
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:57,719
So we're already sampling a population and cross-sectional area one point in time,

130
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:05,040
exposure and outcome and then retrospectively assessing subjects, histories of exposures and outcome over a specified period of time.

131
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:10,710
You can reconstruct some longitudinal datasets, so you kind of get some temporality here.

132
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:17,110
But do note that you are still sampling exposure and outcome at the exact same point of time.

133
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:21,030
We just like going back and doing it over a longer period of time.

134
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:27,840
It doesn't heavily recall like like rely on some recall bias.

135
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:34,320
Again, like you're you're actively collecting this information for people, so you're not looking out there both for records and stuff.

136
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:42,299
That's like a nice actual recorded history. You're asking someone to remember, okay, three months ago, did you drink water from Flint?

137
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:47,910
And then did you have your hair falling out like you're doing at the same time and really trying to make sure you're, like, recalling that.

138
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:50,040
And we'll go through more bias later.

139
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:58,859
But for some things like that, you might get like people who did perceive themselves as exposed might over report their like outcomes and vice versa.

140
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:04,799
But we'll get into that after the exam. Again,

141
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,760
this is different from a retrospective cohort because like you are actively

142
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:13,230
collecting that data and like the exposure and outcome is still at the same point.

143
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:17,010
Retrospective cohorts, remember, are usually in historical records.

144
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:21,210
Like, you're not actually talking to those people. You're using information that's already there.

145
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,830
So some advantages and disadvantages for cross sectional.

146
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:37,280
Some marriages are pretty good for describing health in the population, especially if use using the probability samples.

147
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:42,799
It's very good for hypothesis validity.

148
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,240
If you're looking at something new,

149
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:50,360
this could be like your first step to see if there even is like an association that might be worth looking into with a better study,

150
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,240
like a cohort or whatever that you want to use for it.

151
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:59,389
They're pretty efficient, they're quick, they're very low subject burden because you're just measuring everything at the same time.

152
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:02,930
You have a whole bunch of people come at once. You don't have to keep track of them.

153
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:07,700
You all have to keep having them come in for stuff. And in your cross-sectional cohort,

154
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:13,280
which can be a very useful tool if you're going to look at something that has like a more like temple association to it,

155
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:24,530
some disadvantages, you can get a reverse causation here pretty easily because you are measuring things at the same point in time.

156
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:32,749
You can't really tell which one came first. There is some more wiggle room if you're using something like race or sex as your

157
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:36,550
exposure because like most likely that came before we got to the outcome measure.

158
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:44,990
Looking at things like the obesity paradox, like or like malnutrition and infection, you kind of can't really tell which one came first.

159
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:50,719
You also can sort out the prevalent versus like the insulin cases.

160
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,280
Like you don't know if someone's a brand new case or if it's like a more car like infection that they're dealing with.

161
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,370
And when you're looking at all those numbers, you have no idea which is what.

162
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,420
So you get that late bias sampling so you're not sure of something.

163
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:06,020
It's like has a very long duration or a very short duration because again,

164
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:13,370
you'll have that temporality and then like also there's cross-sectional studies can have some problems with selecting subjects.

165
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:17,920
So getting some selection bias issues and making measurements is really easy to miss.

166
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:29,219
Measure things, especially when you're only doing it like once. Okay, we're going to go through an example for a quick show of hands.

167
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:32,420
Is anyone ever used and hands like another class or like research?

168
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,730
Yeah, that's like a go to fun data source.

169
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:42,590
So this is a probably a population based survey designed to collect information on the health nutrition of the United States household population.

170
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:49,010
It consists of home interviews and a health examination for those who are picked up so far.

171
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:54,829
And here's what I like a lot. It has helped get like whatever move from gasoline created up to the the

172
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:59,149
pediatric go charge it established national baseline estimates for cholesterol,

173
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:07,160
blood pressure and hepatitis C you can go look in this pretty easy I think if I'm like the CDC website, they have a lot of information on them.

174
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:13,520
So this was first conducted in 1971 to 1975.

175
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:19,880
It was the first wave and they gone through some of theirs after that. It was a very successful you got a lot of useful information.

176
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:23,899
So they've gone through wave two, three and it's continuous and ongoing.

177
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:30,380
Even now I think about like 7000 or 70,000 people each year get selected for this.

178
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:40,730
So for that first one, it was like the national nationwide probability sampling of approximate 32,000

179
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:46,340
people age 1 to 74 that use multi-stage sampling if you really want to get into it,

180
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:56,030
it's it's a lot. So they use that probability sampling design to use know select a go in towns like cities and counties and

181
00:17:56,030 --> 00:18:02,540
neighborhoods and households towns so the person and then they keep layering on those like clusters as they go.

182
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:13,220
This does not include people who reside in nursing homes or are first sources, institutionalized purple people, U.S. citizens living abroad.

183
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:18,650
And it has been stretched to like the continental United States. So it is excluding Alaska and Hawaii, at least for this first one.

184
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:32,120
So the selection began using like the 1960 census that divided the entire United States into about like 1900 primary sampling units.

185
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:37,879
There's a lot on here, guys. I won't read it to you, but they basically, like have group down.

186
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,780
So they collected like bigger areas and they selected that down to segment.

187
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:46,099
So these might be like neighborhoods or like growing districts and they put four to put that down.

188
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:52,250
So like homes, selected homes randomly and it's like with like so something people like from that home.

189
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:56,360
And even then like not all those people were asked to come in for like an exam.

190
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:05,490
And that's why it's very, very important. So see how we got down from earth and tired of saying stuff like one person,

191
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:12,990
this one person might be represented in like at least like 300 other people for whatever, like group they're using.

192
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:19,350
So it's very important if you're using and hands or anything that use of sampling strategies like that that you are using the population weights,

193
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:25,230
otherwise you will have biased results. So the sampling weight is assigned to each person.

194
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:33,090
It is a measure of the number of people in the population represented by that sample person and the enhanced dataset.

195
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:40,350
It does reflect that unequal probability of selection, non-response adjustment and adjustment to independent population controls.

196
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:44,729
You do have to use the weights. I think that's one of the key things.

197
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:48,060
I feel like asked to use our data the way it's going along with it.

198
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:54,740
I think it's like a like those like proc survey regression things themselves that you have to take into account the weights,

199
00:19:54,750 --> 00:20:01,750
otherwise your results will be biased in the use of core things.

200
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:08,700
So when I do like that going down to like but multi state of sampling, they do over sample certain populations of interest.

201
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:15,629
It is designed to sample larger numbers of certain subgroups and particular public interest depending on what

202
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:20,880
the public interest is that year there over the people they think are going to contribute the most for it.

203
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:30,990
This was done to increase the reliability and precision of estimates of public health status indicators for these sub subgroups and then hands.

204
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:39,060
One People of lower income preschool children, women of childbearing age and elderly were oversampled because those concerns were for those groups.

205
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:45,750
And it was for like the greater risk of malnutrition in the general population because those groups were a higher risk for it.

206
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:53,460
And then for later enhanced services, they oversample different groups depending on whatever public health concern was for that cycle.

207
00:20:55,470 --> 00:21:00,660
Any questions on cross-sectional? Cool.

208
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:05,880
So you move on to ecological studies. Kind of like you said.

209
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:16,020
We'll go through a little bit more before I give you guys a break. So for ecological your basic natural overview.

210
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:25,380
So for ecological studies we are studying using population or groups of individuals as a unit of observation.

211
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:33,980
Just like for cross-sex hormones myself, like we're at the same point in time for ecological and a broken record, a unit of analysis as a group.

212
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:38,220
It is not individual level data. It is a group of people.

213
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:44,850
It's like this entire classroom, not just one of you. This is also called an aggregate study.

214
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,070
It's for important characteristics.

215
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:54,360
Important characteristic of ecological study is that the level of exposure for each individual in a unit as being a study is unknown.

216
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:57,989
We don't know what the individual level is during the time.

217
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:06,570
We're just taking like those big summary measures. And so, again, there is no individual data.

218
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:14,850
So for ecological designs does use like the average for the groups that would be sorry.

219
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,750
These are the average group data to assess exposure and outcome in populations.

220
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:28,170
Study Group can be like countries, states, counties, census tracts, neighborhood schools, etc. As long as that individual you're good for ecological,

221
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:35,520
the exposure, end or outcome tenure can be a final answer to say something like like mortality or birth rates.

222
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:44,190
Economic employment. Demographic status is another name for these studies besides our surveys or correlational studies.

223
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,260
What about the giving analysis for Ecological Studies?

224
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:57,180
Is the group which is different from all the other studies we do, which has individual data that again,

225
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:02,610
if you forget anything else or ecological cell, you know that your unit of analysis is a group.

226
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,330
So these are graphs that you will see like pretty often for ecological studies.

227
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:14,520
So this is looking at the correlation with getting breast cancer mortality and dietary fat intake.

228
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:22,620
So we take the total dietary fat intake and our age adjusted death rates and we're going through so each one of these is the country.

229
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:30,120
We can see that there's a pretty good positive correlation there between increasing dietary fat intake and increasing mortality.

230
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:40,559
So for this, like, do you think that I can say for someone living in the way if they reduce their dietary fat intake,

231
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:45,360
is that going to reduce their mortality? No, we have no idea.

232
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:50,000
It's the entire country. Here is another one.

233
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,520
We're looking at per capita alcohol consumption and coronary heart disease.

234
00:23:54,300 --> 00:24:00,630
We are less clear about a negative correlation here between overall consumption and heart disease.

235
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,470
As you increase your alcohol, you got a decrease.

236
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:10,090
Yeah, you can increase your rates. There you go.

237
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:18,880
So some measures we have here are aggregate measures, environmental measures and global measures.

238
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,850
So for aggregate measures,

239
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:28,660
we're going to be some summarizing the characteristics of individuals within the group as a mean value of a certain parameter.

240
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:33,580
So that's going to be like your rate of a given disease is like the average amount of intake you have,

241
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:37,299
like the proportion of smokers or median income, something like that.

242
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:45,760
You're taking the average and like pushing all that individual data down to one value for the environmental measures.

243
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:51,220
They're going to represent the physical characteristics or geographic location of a group of interest.

244
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:59,500
The individuals in that group might have different degrees of exposure, as you see is a lot for like environmental.

245
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:05,710
So obviously you're we're looking at something like air pollution, intensively hours of sunlight,

246
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:13,990
even if we're looking at like radon exposure, like I know in our house like a higher than average national average of like radon radiation.

247
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:18,280
But even with a neighbor, that degree of like exposure is going to be changing.

248
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:24,610
So again, we're taking it like the average radon exposure for Ann Arbor is still going to

249
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:30,310
be different so that individuals and global measures are a little bit different.

250
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:40,960
They're going to represent like characteristics in the environment are aren't like you can't really like measure them at the individual level anyway.

251
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:50,920
So it's a more like political like laws or regulations like the health care systems, like the presence of like health inequities.

252
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:55,899
You can't really like measure that and the individual level anyway. So is going to be a global measure.

253
00:25:55,900 --> 00:26:04,550
It's an okay, so for something like this, you're looking at like exhaust on your highway commute.

254
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:16,520
What kind of measure would this be? Yes.

255
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:20,600
Thank you for someone like that. We have seatbelt laws.

256
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,700
Yes. And then for like obesity measures, allergies.

257
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:38,530
Yeah. Okay.

258
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:47,599
So we're going to go down to our level of analysis. So the unit of analysis is a common level for which the data and all the variables

259
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,860
are reduced and analyzed to make a do this up to the individual level analysis.

260
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:59,330
I'm going to come back to that completely ecological analysis, partially ecological or multi level analysis.

261
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:08,020
So for our individual level analysis, the value of each individual I'm sorry, the value of these variable is assigned to every subject.

262
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:14,570
So the ecological measures will be almost all be assigned like individually for that person.

263
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:21,389
So this might be like how many cigarets people smoke, but only how like the group outcome measure for like cancer rates.

264
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:25,880
So we're like, it's still missing part of that individual level analysis.

265
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:35,500
So very, completely ecological analysis. All the variables are equal outcome measures, all like the outcome, the exposure of the covariates.

266
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:43,940
We don't know individual level for anything and that's all just like averages, that's all like population and group level data for these the you know,

267
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:52,190
analysis of solar group, the joint distribution for any combination of the frequencies is not known, but we'll know like a marginal distribution.

268
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:59,390
So those joint ones are more like, like your probability of y or given like your exposure or anything like that.

269
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:04,340
But we don't know those, but we'll know like the whole overall.

270
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:09,860
Like what's your probability of exposure? Why? Sorry for which one?

271
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:13,010
Just one previous, one individual.

272
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:20,089
So far this might be look, we might know how many cigarets each person smokes, but we don't know, like their rate of cancer.

273
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:22,520
So we only know like the group rate of cancer.

274
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:30,080
So I can say like you smoke five cigarets and like the rate of cancer in Ann Arbor is like five per 100,000 people.

275
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:43,400
For partially ecologic analysis. The information was available on some of those joint distributions, but not all of them.

276
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:50,780
So we might know, you might have to fill out a little bit of a table or you still don't know everything.

277
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:54,800
So more so using group measures to like fill in the blanks with things like we don't know.

278
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:03,320
And then for a multilevel analysis, we'll be combining data from two or more levels.

279
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:09,770
For example, this might be individual level analysis conducted in each group, followed by an ecological analysis.

280
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:21,110
We'll go over this more. Just because you have some individual level data present does not mean you can infer anything back down to the individual.

281
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:25,970
The second you aggregate something or combine something in that group, you cannot go back down.

282
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:34,860
And we'll get on that more. Okay.

283
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,290
So four levels of inference.

284
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:47,640
So for biological inferences, let's think about effects, individual risk, etiologic inferences about effects at group rates.

285
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:53,220
So our target, a causal inference, does not always match the level of analysis.

286
00:29:55,170 --> 00:30:01,130
And so that's a the level of inferences I have as a group that are ecological multivariable designs are appropriate.

287
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:06,090
So if we're looking at a group, we want group outcomes, then why not use like those group measures?

288
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:14,160
And if the level of inference desires individual, then ecologic associations are not fairly accurately reflect that.

289
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:19,890
And we'll get that background some more because that's just like the ecological bias and they go up to fallacy.

290
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:28,450
So why do we do the logic in the first place? So low cost and pretty convenient.

291
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:35,620
Like allow some measurements for limitations of individual studies.

292
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:43,180
For example, if we're trying to look out air pollution and stuff, it's pretty hard to get people aware like those air quality monitors.

293
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:50,709
There are issues with air quality in the first place and then like actually getting someone to like wear that nonstop everywhere they go,

294
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:58,370
it can be challenging and that might not represent their overall total exposure because maybe we're only having them wear it for a week.

295
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:03,970
But that's like it's I mean, air quality is way more than this week.

296
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:11,709
They can be super expensive to do that. And that's a lot of participant burden and burden for you to keep track of.

297
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:21,340
A lot of like air quality monitors touting all those like things like overcomes like the limitations of individual level studies.

298
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,790
It doesn't interest for ecological effects.

299
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:30,340
So sometimes we are looking for things that are just more of a group level effect and that individual anyway.

300
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:38,940
And it's pretty simple analysis and presentation for this. All right.

301
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:42,860
So there are a few different display designs within this.

302
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:50,130
So we do exploratory. So these multi groups that we use time trends, studies and mix designs with our ecologic.

303
00:31:54,330 --> 00:32:03,120
So for exploratory ecological studies, we have no exposure to either the disease frequency as described rates reason and our objective

304
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:08,670
is to search for a spatial pattern that might support or help develop a logic hypothesis.

305
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:16,140
So that's something like if we want to look at air quality and asthma rates or something like that,

306
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:20,599
we're like, really, we don't really have an exposure level data on each individual person.

307
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:24,330
And we can look at the air quality monitors that we have station in our United States,

308
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:32,549
and then we can go back and we can look at that like on more individual level data looking for like tell me or like group

309
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:38,850
wide trends of like asthma rates from someplace and I'll support our hypothesis that like whatever way we're trying to go.

310
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:48,960
So for example, looking for while I can say mortality rate by state economic area so these states are like sectioned off by like or economic

311
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:56,220
status and you can like overlay other things like bladder cancer rates and try to like see like is there a correlation there?

312
00:32:56,550 --> 00:33:09,150
Is there something worth studying? So my patient studies or sometimes but my French studies are an extension of our exploratory ecological design.

313
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:15,000
We can compare the disease rates for migrants and their offspring as individuals in the to location.

314
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:25,050
So the origin and the destination if we have people moving from on a normal to like move from Canada down to Brazil,

315
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:30,930
we can like study the people who are moving so that people who stay in Canada as are the people who are in Brazil,

316
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:38,070
we can kind of get like a trend to see like what's happening for people like moving well are you guys like want to stay for that.

317
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,760
So for here I'm example we have like cancer disparities between the mainland and then Puerto

318
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:50,159
Ricans in CO c like they look like cellular cancer rates for people who stayed in Puerto Rico,

319
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,290
people who are in the mainland and the people who like to.

320
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:57,270
It's like move between them and see if there is like a disparity between like moving between these

321
00:33:57,270 --> 00:34:01,650
areas or if the people who are like actively moving have like higher rates or anything like that.

322
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:06,809
But also for multi group ecological studies,

323
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:11,520
we are assessing the ecological association between exposure and frequency or

324
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:15,450
average exposure levels and the frequency of disease among multiple groups.

325
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:27,120
So these we would allow the progression of Y on X using all our models linear regression depending on how it looks.

326
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:31,260
I won't go into bias out of it, one of many options for it.

327
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:39,300
So that's like our classic why those and I suppose we we'll get stuff like this.

328
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:45,060
So for example, each one of these points here is like a whole group of people, whatever these are individuals or groups.

329
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:52,950
So their religious composition and suicide rates and pressure, these are like suicide rates per 100,000 per year.

330
00:34:54,150 --> 00:35:03,180
And so not for these groups or geographic groups in the study, but each point again represents one year of gases in this case or like provinces.

331
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:11,430
So for this one, we kind of see a positive association between the percent of the presence in the area and the suicide rates.

332
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:17,310
We will go into that more. And again, we kind of like put that one here.

333
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:22,170
And so then we can kind of start to like make guesses and we can like kind of see of

334
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:26,790
other areas like a peak depending on like your percentage of presence in the area,

335
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:29,580
we might be able to say like your suicide rates, we might be you this.

336
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:43,770
So far, ecologic conference is one group and typically a dynamic duo of a geographically defined population is followed over time,

337
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:51,570
and we'll assess the past possible association between changes in exposure, frequency or the average level and change in disease frequency.

338
00:35:52,380 --> 00:36:01,410
Again, the analysis is a population at one time in the population that's comprised who itself identifies as compared to itself at different times.

339
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:09,780
So for this one example for a time, so sorry about the use of artificial sweeteners is associated with bladder cancer.

340
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:12,720
So these groups were taken at different points of time.

341
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:20,250
You can kind of see that using more artificial sweeteners here, you would kind of expect to see a dose response and not really.

342
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:29,130
You can argue that there might be like an uptake right here for men, but there could be so many other things in there that it's fine.

343
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:34,820
And it's sort of like the FDA ban started artificial sweeteners and so those earlier so with

344
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:39,720
look at the bladder cancer prevalence compares before and after the ride artificial sweeteners.

345
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:43,140
And again we didn't see any associations.

346
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:51,600
So for here, for another time from now, it was like polio and measles mortality rates.

347
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,820
You can probably see like graphs like this.

348
00:36:54,300 --> 00:37:04,400
Well, you'll see like the rates of polio, like the mortality rates of polio going down of vaccines, introduce and see a plummet there for measles.

349
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:11,220
It was a kind of it's already on its way down. And then vaccines were introduced and like, you know, I was like, what the opposite would have been?

350
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:16,440
The vaccine was introduced. You can probably see like another like uptake can go down, but vaccines kept it down.

351
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:29,459
For Mick's ecological studies, there'll be a mix of multi group and time term ecological studies where a number of groups of all over

352
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:35,700
time and it assesses a possible association between changes in exposure frequency among those subgroups.

353
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:42,420
So you have two comparisons and you compare among the groups and over time within the groups.

354
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:48,510
And that's about what we were talking about, last lecture with those like inter intra class correlation coefficient.

355
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:52,920
So trying to see like how much variation is happening between and those groups.

356
00:37:54,820 --> 00:38:03,209
So here is one looking at the age groups a different point of time and we're looking at changes and cardiovascular mortality

357
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:11,910
rates with increases and decreases and like the water hardness and we like change the concentrations of magnesium and calcium,

358
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:18,960
which are like protective factors for cardiovascular disease. Okay.

359
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:21,280
Before I move on to analysis,

360
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:34,980
anyone have any questions and we'll let you guys take a ten minute break because I am zooming through this so you can come back at 1050 to that.

361
00:38:40,169 --> 00:38:43,459
Oh. So back to analysis for the ecological studies.

362
00:38:44,359 --> 00:38:51,199
Um, so right off the bat, we have a ratio logic section and ecological correlation coefficient.

363
00:38:53,609 --> 00:39:01,199
So going back to the example of religious composition, suicide rates and pressure we have on all the information that they gave us.

364
00:39:02,729 --> 00:39:10,319
So if we wanted to have a rate ratio for this for multiple groups like those go her classmates like for for this

365
00:39:12,389 --> 00:39:19,229
so we can go through for our entirely expose for those who want that kind of analysis like a10 kind of situation.

366
00:39:19,229 --> 00:39:24,839
So her exposure is going to happen and not be the one for the entirely unexposed or zeros when we cancel out.

367
00:39:25,069 --> 00:39:27,599
Here's one. How about the software here? But not.

368
00:39:28,259 --> 00:39:36,539
So for that difference, since they both have it or not, you're only going to be looking at beta one and then for your rate ratio pretty similar.

369
00:39:36,779 --> 00:39:42,089
You know, we're looking at one over one plus the ratio between beta,

370
00:39:42,269 --> 00:39:49,379
one in beta not and I can get more or complicated the more factors you want to add to that model.

371
00:39:52,279 --> 00:39:59,269
For your logic fraction is calculated by substituting the rate ratio, calculating the formula for it.

372
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:03,559
So P one right here is a portion of exposed populated people in the population.

373
00:40:04,519 --> 00:40:08,179
This might look familiar if it doesn't go back to earlier formations.

374
00:40:09,109 --> 00:40:14,629
This is a variation of the population of travels or risk calculated using that ultimate formula.

375
00:40:15,499 --> 00:40:21,978
So it's the same thing as your population insurable risk percent. What that ultimate formula, it just doesn't have like the percent part.

376
00:40:21,979 --> 00:40:31,589
So you're not multiplying it by 100. And an ecological correlation coefficient qualifies the extent to which there

377
00:40:31,589 --> 00:40:35,908
is a linear relationship between our exposure and disease surrogate like that.

378
00:40:35,909 --> 00:40:42,659
Nice correlation coefficient r here is different from the Pearson's one little ah we're looking at big R here so we're looking at

379
00:40:42,659 --> 00:40:51,119
between the very variance between X and Y and it should tell you about how much of the variation of one is like influence in the other.

380
00:40:53,629 --> 00:41:04,999
Any questions or analysis of these? So our ecological fallacy, we've been saying this a lot is a very specific type of bias.

381
00:41:05,899 --> 00:41:09,169
And this is the bias that may occur between, because of the association,

382
00:41:09,169 --> 00:41:15,589
between variables on an aggregate level does not necessarily represent the association that exists at the individual level.

383
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:23,089
So if you're thinking about it, we're clumping these people together, their risk and like it is influencing that aggregate measure.

384
00:41:23,099 --> 00:41:29,389
Like if they're really high risk and I'm really, really low, then like once you group that together, you're going to have somewhere like an average.

385
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:33,439
But it doesn't reflect either of us because I'm way below it. No way above it.

386
00:41:33,799 --> 00:41:37,249
So the second you group things together, you can only go up.

387
00:41:37,249 --> 00:41:48,439
You cannot go back down. So again, looking at those suicide rates and like those high cost areas, if you look at the actual 1997 on suicide,

388
00:41:48,799 --> 00:41:52,519
they found the suicide rates were higher in the provinces that are highly Protestant.

389
00:41:52,849 --> 00:41:59,689
And they concluded that social the stronger social control among Catholics would reduce their lower suicide rates.

390
00:42:01,969 --> 00:42:05,629
As you can imagine, there are probably a lot of issues with these statements.

391
00:42:06,469 --> 00:42:14,089
So the stat that the study itself used out of a four groups of Depression provinces from 83 to 1894

392
00:42:14,089 --> 00:42:19,669
improves by ranking in the proportion of the population that were present in those 13 provinces.

393
00:42:21,499 --> 00:42:27,799
And that's what we get this for. All that kind of showed a nice, strong causal association.

394
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:32,289
Well, the more presence you have in the area of the margins I registered.

395
00:42:34,699 --> 00:42:38,179
Anyone? Anyone think about any potential reasons you would say those.

396
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:46,269
Yeah. Think religious oppression. Exactly.

397
00:42:46,389 --> 00:42:50,789
Anything else? So it's like two issues happening here.

398
00:42:53,519 --> 00:43:02,729
One, you can argue that Catholic religion like a more social structure compared to like presence, like I myself am Catholic.

399
00:43:02,739 --> 00:43:07,259
The Catholic guilt is pretty strong, so I might be less likely to commit suicide of a person.

400
00:43:09,149 --> 00:43:15,929
But then when you're looking at it like the rate ratio is 1.6 across in areas where it's non-person areas, there's so much happening here.

401
00:43:16,709 --> 00:43:21,629
So one issue for this is that you don't know who is committing suicide.

402
00:43:22,049 --> 00:43:30,239
So we have no idea. It's like and those high problem areas are all the prisons making up, all those like suicide, all the suicide rates or the like,

403
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:36,209
lower minority groups who are being like kind of shunted out of like society because we're not in like the religious majority.

404
00:43:36,569 --> 00:43:44,848
So we have no idea who is committing suicide in these groups and you have no idea like if that's going to actually apply background.

405
00:43:44,849 --> 00:43:52,979
So individual school then for this.

406
00:43:53,069 --> 00:44:01,409
I have an example for you guys. So right now we're going to look at some helmet laws and we're going looking at three different towns.

407
00:44:01,799 --> 00:44:07,739
One enforces how laws one has on enforced helmet laws. One doesn't have any helmet laws.

408
00:44:09,189 --> 00:44:12,809
These are some of the rates for 100 person years.

409
00:44:14,369 --> 00:44:20,959
Based on this, where where would you guys want to live? Yeah.

410
00:44:20,959 --> 00:44:25,759
Which, like, doesn't really make sense, right? There's no helmet laws. All these people are running out of, like, no helmets.

411
00:44:25,759 --> 00:44:27,499
Like they have like the lower stuff right here.

412
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:36,348
So this is an example of why you should be super careful with, like, ecological studies, because this one shows no helmet laws.

413
00:44:36,349 --> 00:44:40,669
You go for your ass. So like, if I saw this and I was like, someone writing policy is like, okay, cool,

414
00:44:40,879 --> 00:44:44,359
let's get rid of all the helmet laws and people can just do what they want.

415
00:44:47,149 --> 00:44:51,228
So for the first one, we have one death and then look around us.

416
00:44:51,229 --> 00:44:56,539
We have six for our next one and for our last one.

417
00:44:57,109 --> 00:45:04,099
And then you kind of see here all of them have the same like helmet this and it was like the non like causing the issue here.

418
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:10,099
So a lot of things here can like happen we might see like these different forms

419
00:45:10,099 --> 00:45:15,319
of raids because like some people are just like more reckless than others.

420
00:45:15,319 --> 00:45:19,189
Like some people if they're not wearing a helmet, like they might be like more careful about it.

421
00:45:19,579 --> 00:45:23,929
People who aren't are wearing helmets like, like beside they would be like more reckless or something.

422
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:28,679
But all these like have the exact same like deaths per helmet that he is.

423
00:45:29,569 --> 00:45:35,868
And so after an example how like that the fallacy like once you like group things together use you lose your

424
00:45:35,869 --> 00:45:44,019
ability to actually see what's happening on the individual level and like who what's happening to you know,

425
00:45:44,869 --> 00:45:49,099
for this next one. Oh, you guys should do this.

426
00:45:49,519 --> 00:45:54,349
So you guys want to calculate the cumulative incidence and each one of these populations over one year.

427
00:47:32,619 --> 00:47:37,969
Are those numbers ages? Yeah. Yeah. Sorry, it just didn't.

428
00:47:37,969 --> 00:48:41,089
If you some you want like average age in your population. The big guys are done this like look up like no one is going.

429
00:49:14,549 --> 00:49:19,169
So it looks like more time to go through each of these.

430
00:49:19,469 --> 00:49:28,229
For our first one instance right here is about 37.5 or one year, and our average age is 38.7.

431
00:49:29,279 --> 00:49:36,659
Then we have 50% over one year or average age of 40 and then we have 20% over one year and our average age is 20.

432
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:41,429
So a few things. Again, like kind of like losing an individual level there.

433
00:49:41,429 --> 00:49:45,808
We have no idea like the live kind of happening to three year context this year,

434
00:49:45,809 --> 00:49:51,749
like about average age like this is like completely hiding the fact that if we had to do a public health intervention here,

435
00:49:51,749 --> 00:49:58,018
we don't want to actually like pander to this age group because all the accidents are happening and people are younger.

436
00:49:58,019 --> 00:50:01,899
And so if we like to use that, we wouldn't be able to actually intervene on the population.

437
00:50:01,909 --> 00:50:06,989
We we need to say them here is kind of like a wider one.

438
00:50:09,179 --> 00:50:14,498
And again here like we basically losing who's like actually have more than 20% over one year.

439
00:50:14,499 --> 00:50:16,949
It feels like a lot when it's just like it's one person.

440
00:50:17,789 --> 00:50:22,949
So we don't know like who what's happening to why it's happening because again, we're losing on the individual level.

441
00:50:24,359 --> 00:50:26,518
And so put these biases into words.

442
00:50:26,519 --> 00:50:36,059
We got the aggregation bias, our specification bias and our cross level bias and our education bias is when we're losing that individual data.

443
00:50:36,349 --> 00:50:41,759
So that's our ecological fallacy specification bias, just like the suicide rate example,

444
00:50:41,759 --> 00:50:46,119
you don't know like who's having the outcome coming in here and the illness or we just like

445
00:50:46,139 --> 00:50:50,519
don't know who that's actually happening to and who to like apply any intervention to.

446
00:50:51,039 --> 00:50:58,049
At price level bias occurs when the confounding factors associated with a background race disease differently across groups.

447
00:50:58,049 --> 00:51:04,528
So for aggregating that together and as a confounder present now we like that confounders just like it's everywhere.

448
00:51:04,529 --> 00:51:06,779
We have no idea. Like it's just like different for other people.

449
00:51:06,779 --> 00:51:11,399
So we might like over like adjust on something and it will hurt one population more than or another one.

450
00:51:14,429 --> 00:51:18,239
Any question? Okay.

451
00:51:18,549 --> 00:51:26,109
Moving on to our last part. So we're going to do our strengths, limitations or ecological studies, and probably that's our group job.

452
00:51:27,129 --> 00:51:34,839
It might be the best way to reflect our exposure, depending on how we're looking at it from looking at like more like, um, like group level outcomes.

453
00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:38,039
Like, like an exposure is like a neighborhood poverty, air pollution,

454
00:51:38,049 --> 00:51:45,159
climate then like this is the best way to do it because our analysis the group so it really shows us quite a lot about on the group level,

455
00:51:45,849 --> 00:51:50,769
it's useful for identifying a problem and generating our hypotheses just like our cross-sectional ones

456
00:51:50,769 --> 00:51:56,169
is a really good first step to see if there is an association or a disparity or a problem that warrants

457
00:51:56,169 --> 00:52:03,278
like going and further study is pretty inexpensive and feasible and if that is already collected like you

458
00:52:03,279 --> 00:52:09,039
can just like hop on pretty much the CDC or I just like website and get some of these like group data.

459
00:52:09,279 --> 00:52:15,069
It's already there for you. And as you scroll for value in the fact that the effectiveness of population interventions,

460
00:52:15,429 --> 00:52:19,358
so if we're going to implement with a war on our helmets and then we get to actually

461
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:23,949
look at the group level and see like after we implement that law is are like rates of

462
00:52:23,949 --> 00:52:30,999
what motorcycle deaths like going down and then some limitations the people but the

463
00:52:30,999 --> 00:52:35,709
outcome may not be the ones with the exposure ecological policy everyone's contributing.

464
00:52:35,929 --> 00:52:38,588
We have no idea like who's actually experiencing what.

465
00:52:38,589 --> 00:52:45,849
Within that there is like a real ability to or a lack of ability to control for the effects of potential confounders

466
00:52:46,629 --> 00:52:52,419
or to assess the influences or sources of bias again or the confounders are individual like level things.

467
00:52:52,419 --> 00:53:00,278
We're not getting all that data very hard and then you can get that cross level bias when like if you can can collect some of the confounders,

468
00:53:00,279 --> 00:53:04,179
like we don't know to what degree that confounders issue within those groups,

469
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:12,789
certain data might not be available in aggregate and might be like available or it can be available ecologic

470
00:53:12,789 --> 00:53:18,569
measures and they might be too crude or incomplete or unreliable to actually use some issues like,

471
00:53:18,669 --> 00:53:20,828
look, using like those air pollution monitors.

472
00:53:20,829 --> 00:53:28,479
I think like I have an air purifier in my house and I think the closest air purifier like tower thing is like closer to the choice,

473
00:53:29,229 --> 00:53:36,399
which is not going to be like my air quality, like outside my home versus like closer to like a major city and highways.

474
00:53:36,399 --> 00:53:42,739
And I am so like we're going to lose some of that stuff and I can be as reliable for like individuals, right?

475
00:53:42,769 --> 00:53:44,709
Even like it's just like pockets of areas.

476
00:53:45,819 --> 00:53:53,348
And you often can't establish temporality with these same issue as like a cross sectional or something like that.

477
00:53:53,349 --> 00:53:54,739
You're probably going to get those matters.

478
00:53:55,419 --> 00:54:03,608
And at the same point in time sometimes, like if you're giving information on like smoking, that might be over a period of like five years.

479
00:54:03,609 --> 00:54:08,589
And some of your cancer rates are like aggregate like over time,

480
00:54:08,949 --> 00:54:14,439
cumulative like cancer rates and then like you're temporarily like temporal these off and then to get individual,

481
00:54:14,769 --> 00:54:17,919
you can't tell you which one came first. Okay.

482
00:54:18,579 --> 00:54:21,669
Any questions like ecological or cross-sectional studies?

483
00:54:25,949 --> 00:54:27,989
But we are. Where does.
