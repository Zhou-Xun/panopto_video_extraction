Hello and welcome to HMV 607. My name is Kevin Holleran and I'll be your guest lecturer for the year.

2
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:16,770
And you're probably already wondering why is Kevin leaving me an introduction message and not Professor Geoff, whose face I see in all of the videos?

3
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:20,879
It's a great question and I hope to give you a great answer. Long and the short of it,

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,620
as I work with Geoff now for for a couple of years and I've taught this class before

5
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:31,770
to his executive master's program and the need arose for a lecture for this semester,

6
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:37,560
and I volunteered. So let me give you a little bit of my history and background and maybe that'll help understand,

7
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,950
you know, why I'm here and what I'm doing and and all that sort of fun stuff.

8
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,460
So I am like you. I am an HMV graduate.

9
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:52,110
Way back when I graduated with my MHRA in 1997 and just by way of background,

10
00:00:52,110 --> 00:01:01,020
I went into health care consulting for about seven or eight years and then I spent time at a place called Standard Poor's, and now I'm at Fitch.

11
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,920
And what we do there is bond ratings combined between the two.

12
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:11,040
I've done close to 20 years or more of bond ratings, which obviously has a lot to do with financing.

13
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:19,710
And so my lifelong dream and sacred obsession is as a teacher, not to have been working in the private sector.

14
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:28,350
And one of your current professors, Kathy Kelley and I, were classmates and knew I always wanted to do this because we stayed in close touch.

15
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:35,340
And when an opportunity came up to guest lecture with Professor Jeff, I said, yes, and and here we are today.

16
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,520
So during the semester, it'll be a lot of fun. I'm looking forward to it.

17
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,320
By the way, I found that I do love the teaching part of it, especially the live art.

18
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:51,710
When we're talking, I think what I will be able to offer you versus Jeff is a different perspective.

19
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,580
So the classes entitled Corporate Finance, We're Administrators and that really is what it is.

20
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:05,610
It's a it's a class on finance for people who aren't going to be professional CFOs or treasurers or VP's of finance or anything like that.

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,990
Although if you want to be that, I'll I'll do my best to help you get there.

22
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:17,280
It really is to help you understand the decision making that goes into finance and a lot of the terminology and understanding,

23
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:24,900
if you will, sort of which way the needle moves. Jeff definitely comes from a corporate background and the logic is sound, right?

24
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:32,580
If you can do it on the corporate side and corporates can do different things at not for profits, then you can understand the not for profit side.

25
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:37,050
No, I'm a not for profit guy through and through to the heart and to the core.

26
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:43,290
And so I'll give you a lot of well, this is how it works in the textbooks and this is how it works for the corporates.

27
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:50,940
But this is what really happens in real life, in the not for profits, which is most likely where most of you will end up if you aren't there already.

28
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:58,730
So again, looking forward to a wonderful, wonderful semester and a wonderful series of sessions and we will begin soon.

29
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:02,400
Do it every Wednesday night. I'll have office hours immediately thereafter.

30
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:09,000
I think you'll find I'm reachable, accessible and and I'm an easy grader, too, because I was one of yours.

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,610
And I know what it's like as well to do so. Can't wait to meet each and every one of you and get this kick started.

32
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:19,770
And we will see you soon. Thanks so much. Room tone.
