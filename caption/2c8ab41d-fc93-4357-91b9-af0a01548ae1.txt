1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:07,200
Far from her personally. But like, you know, if you're the passenger, watch a movie.

2
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:10,430
You know, I wanted to be a sidecar almost.

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:20,190
Yeah, like that. Amazing in the car. Like doing the actual work I've been working on for hours.

4
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:23,860
Well, but also you have to bring it to Syria.

5
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:30,239
Terrible. Terrible. Can you imagine what that's like? She's even driving the car downhill.

6
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:36,620
It was terrifying, especially because, like, my friend who I love actually taught me how to draw.

7
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:45,710
I would say that somewhere like the movie shutter, like, seems like about a month before you offered me some of your favorite work.

8
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:52,350
Yeah, I was just like, you know what? If you just take the wheel like, I can't, even because I'm not who if I die out here, I'm not going to go ahead.

9
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:57,180
So I decided, well, all right, let's get started.

10
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:03,210
You announcement's. So your fourth homework was due today.

11
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,160
Your fifth and last homework is due next week.

12
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:15,989
The 10th? Yeah, a week from today. And then hopefully you all are working on your projects.

13
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:24,299
So I saw a few people today in my office hours about projects, questions if I did not see you.

14
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:30,780
I hope that you're working on those in the background. So now is a really good time to start meeting with your group and thinking about the project.

15
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:36,630
The other upcoming thing is that you have your second test on the 17th.

16
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:42,570
Haven't actually written the test yet. I plan to do so soon, but obviously I have to.

17
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,370
But there is already a practice test on here.

18
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:50,609
It should be similar. There could be questions on there that we didn't go over.

19
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,819
For example, like there might be a sample size question about survival data.

20
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:59,310
We didn't learn that I wouldn't test you on that, but everything else should be pretty similar.

21
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:06,090
This test will span everything after your first test.

22
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:17,180
So phase three and anything up to probably protocol and deviations probably won't ask you about crossover designs, but we'll see how far we get.

23
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:24,850
Yes, there are we going to get more details about like the final project videos like the timelines and what you're expecting?

24
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:31,950
Yeah. So I must say a few of those expectations now and then if you have more questions you can ask me.

25
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:44,610
So the project, right, so you all should you signed up for a group, you all see that there are these project descriptions.

26
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:53,430
Note that I wrote some of these by copy pasting and or multitasking, and so there are some errors.

27
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,850
So if something doesn't make sense, it's probably because it's a typo.

28
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,569
And so for example, if you got a question that's more like phase three,

29
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:05,700
but it asks you about defining the maximum tolerated dose or how you found that,

30
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:10,260
like just ignore that or come and ask me if that's really supposed to be the appropriate question.

31
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,269
So definitely make sure that if you have any questions about the description,

32
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:21,690
you've clarified it with me and or take liberties to like, you know, adjust the errors.

33
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:31,320
Oh, the other thing is that in these projects, so all of these are almost all of these are inspired by projects I've been involved with.

34
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,120
And so they have some like, you know, truth behind them.

35
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:44,610
However, I've given a fair amount of space for you to make some decisions and there's not necessarily a wrong or right answer.

36
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,979
So like two groups are doing each project right,

37
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:51,120
and one group may decide to go one way and the other group may decide to go another way, and that's totally fine.

38
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,609
You just need to justify the decisions that you made. So, for example, you know, maybe in phase one,

39
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:03,209
somebody decides to do three plus three and I explain why they do three plus three versus somebody decides to do S.R. our around.

40
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:08,000
They explain why they chose that. And maybe they had to come up with some extra criteria to do like a type zero.

41
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,040
That's fine. Just explain what you chose, okay? Right.

42
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,439
In real life, you probably couldn't take as many liberties because you have this back and forth with the clinician.

43
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,180
But we don't we don't have that person here.

44
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:23,790
So you can ask me if you want clarification, but I might also just say, like, you decide and you tell us why you did that.

45
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:31,349
So please, please do feel free to ask me questions. You can send emails, you can come to office hours.

46
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:35,999
You can also ask Fong, but Fong might not know as much as I know.

47
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,140
So for this I do maybe suggest that you use me more than the GSI for the project.

48
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:52,220
Questions. So you're there's the there's the information on this project page, which you get to from home and projects.

49
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:59,300
Right. But then also if you go into your assignments, you'll notice that there is like a yellow Digg video applet load.

50
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:09,410
So this has more specific directions regarding your video and how to upload it to yellow Digg if you haven't used yellow Digg before.

51
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:15,540
There's an introduction video. You do kind of have to like sign up for it, but it's not going to send you spam or anything, right?

52
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,040
It's just going to. It's totally educational. It's just for this class.

53
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:22,460
It's supposed to be somewhat like Facebook.

54
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:31,400
Ask your social media, LinkedIn, ask where you like, have a feed and you'll post your video and then everybody else can see it and put comments on it.

55
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:38,930
And then what we've done is we've gone through the back end and said that like for your when you comment on somebody is,

56
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:43,220
which by the way can't just be like, great job, right? It has to be like a constructive comment.

57
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,990
You'll get points for that and you have to have a thousand.

58
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,409
Your goal is to have a thousand points and each comment is worth 250 points.

59
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:54,560
But again, these comments need to be substantive. Constructive?

60
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:58,790
Yeah. Questions for the group.

61
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,379
So I'm hoping you're each going to soon I'm going to have a assignment list

62
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:07,450
where each of you are going to have to review specifically to group projects.

63
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:14,960
However, I hope that you look at others. And then my goal is that you have comments either to comments on the ones that

64
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,860
you review or hopefully you have comments for each of those that you review.

65
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,900
And you look at some others and you put some comments.

66
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:30,230
Also, if you're the video poster and or in that group, you should be commenting back to the comments made on your video.

67
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:40,999
So you all each group will make like a zoom or whatever you use to make a video presentation on here I say something like 10 to 25 minutes.

68
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,640
I think it's more appropriate to be probably around 20, right?

69
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:51,290
Ten is likely way too short because you're going to need some introductions and background and then really go into your questions.

70
00:06:52,430 --> 00:07:01,040
It's best if you can split the presenting between all the members of your group so we can really see how you contributed to the project.

71
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:08,930
But that's your choice, how you do that. So the video, I would say 20 minutes of it's 25, that's totally fine.

72
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:13,549
If you got everything done in 17 and you feel like it's complete or 15, that's fine too.

73
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:16,880
But don't make it over a half hour, please.

74
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:21,340
Nobody wants to watch that, right? So you're up.

75
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:30,620
You doubt you get this video, one of you in your group will upload it to Yellow Dog, and then all of you will comment and interact with Yellow Dog.

76
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:37,670
And in the last few classes, we're going to choose certain topics of the projects that we're going to have

77
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:42,800
open discussion so that hopefully everybody is a little bit knowledgeable about,

78
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:47,899
you know, watching on to time speed the videos for that day in that project that we're going to go through.

79
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:52,190
Okay, let's see what else I want to tell you.

80
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:59,300
That's all I had. Are there any other questions about expectations for the project?

81
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,000
Lot of these projects are new topics.

82
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:09,870
So there are a few that have topics that we've covered, like phase one, phase two design, although we haven't talked about putting those together.

83
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:17,600
And then there are a lot of new topics. There's also that one on the that's really like a Emulex debate.

84
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:26,270
It's I don't know how to say that drug, but if you're in that group, there's actually been more recent results or debate on that drug.

85
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:37,410
And so I would suggest that you go and look that up, Google it, because there's been additional FDA and advisory board commentary on that drug.

86
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,990
But so that one's a little bit different. The other ones, they're like new kind of designs and areas.

87
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:48,450
And so you're really the intention of these projects are really few for you both to apply the skills which we've learned,

88
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:52,139
but also introduce new concepts and designs to your classmates.

89
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:57,750
Because as a collaborative biostatistician, you have a great foundation, but you're always learning new things.

90
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:03,569
And so when you go out into the work force, whether you're a master's level statistician or a Ph.D. level statistician,

91
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:11,130
you're going to have to quickly look up these other designs and areas, have some idea about them and either implement them or give them as options.

92
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:19,110
So this is really like a first, maybe not first, but this is really like one way in which you're practicing going out into the real world.

93
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:28,050
And adding to the knowledge of your classmates for more topics that we just wouldn't have enough time to cover all of them if I were doing them.

94
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:39,060
All right. So you'll find more information there in the assignments part.

95
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:45,660
Also, I guess another thing I should tell you about your group projects is that you complete two reviews,

96
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:53,110
you complete a a peer review within your group.

97
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:59,310
So for within, you're like three or four person group, you'll put everybody's name on the sheet, you'll see.

98
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:09,930
And here it gives you a actually it takes you to like a Google sheet that you'll make a copy, download it, and then you'll upload it.

99
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:18,180
And so you have your self and your group members and you rate them on several different criteria about how well everyone did in your group.

100
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:21,870
So this is to keep you accountable in your group project.

101
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:32,340
It's also to, you know, just to be clear about how you all work together and to try to encourage balanced work,

102
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:40,090
you will also be commenting on the other people's projects on Yellow Day,

103
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:47,939
but you'll also complete a very specific between group peer review on those two projects that I've asked you to peer review.

104
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:56,190
So you'll add confidentiality, but you'll also have this other scoring rubric that you'll make a copy and upload for me for the two projects,

105
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:01,350
and you're going to give scores across presentation skills, knowledge based, critical thinking.

106
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:07,320
So I suggest that all of you look at these rubrics now and how you are acting within your group,

107
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,590
and then also how you are going to present your group so that, you know,

108
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:14,640
kind of the criteria that I'm looking for and also your classmates are looking for.

109
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,800
And like I said, I will post the Who's reviewing too soon.

110
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:26,040
It's a little bit of a combinatorics problem. I just have to go there.

111
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,860
All right. Any other questions on the projects? All right.

112
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:36,000
Okay. How many of you all like Halloween? Nobody.

113
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,630
Oh, my God. Wow. That's crazy.

114
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:44,680
I actually really love it either myself, but I didn't also have to pretend that it's exciting.

115
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:52,450
I also need to bring in a lot of candy because we had still a lot of candy, not even taking it from my children, but I totally forgot.

116
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:57,210
So Tuesday, I'll bring some candy if it's still around to keep you all weekend class.

117
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:02,610
Last year I bought all this candy, and I just put it on a table outside our house.

118
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:10,740
So I live in Burns Park. For those who don't know which is just south of here and also like the area to trick or treat if you're live in Ann Arbor.

119
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:15,600
And so everybody goes to this road called Granger. I don't live in Granger, but I live up from Granger.

120
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:22,020
And so usually I just leave like a big table of candy and say like take some and the last few years.

121
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,169
And then I go and my husband, I go out with our kids. Last few years, all of it's been gone.

122
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,809
And so we're like, Oh my God, we need more candy.

123
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:35,130
So I bought a ridiculous amount of candy this year, but I also my parents ended up visiting, so they were like guarding this bucket.

124
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:42,390
So it was very clear to me that like the only reason why it was all gone was because these like nine through 12 year olds,

125
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:46,170
you're just like empty it in their pillowcases. Candy.

126
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:50,820
So I had way too much candy left, of which I don't want at my house or for my children.

127
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,910
So I will I will bring it.

128
00:12:54,870 --> 00:13:03,510
Okay. So we're going to talk about surrogate outcomes, which on the outside sort of seems like how is this at all connected to clinical trials?

129
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:08,280
And I'm hoping to explain to you why we're going to talk about it.

130
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:19,409
It is somewhat of a tangent, but it's also really, really important to understand this concept and to see how it's integrated in clinical trials.

131
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:28,330
So basically from now through the semester, we're talking about somewhat random topics that have no real order anymore.

132
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:32,580
It's just kind of like after I was doing this, I was like, Oh, maybe I should put this after meta analysis.

133
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:38,100
It's just kind of random topics that I think are important because we've gotten this foundation of like phase one, two and three.

134
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:45,210
And now I want you to learn about these other topics. So we're going to define a statistical surrogate outcome.

135
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,410
We're going to understand when and how we can use a surrogate outcome in clinical trials.

136
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:54,970
And we want to try to identify settings in which a surrogate fails if you're at all confused.

137
00:13:54,990 --> 00:14:02,100
After today, I highly suggest that you read the readings, suggested readings for today in particular.

138
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:06,840
The second one is really goes through what we're talking about has really great examples.

139
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:10,110
And so that should clarify the topic for you.

140
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:15,240
Okay. So first, how many of you have heard of biomarkers?

141
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:25,680
Yeah, great. So this is a really common term used nowadays in the clinical trials and also in just observational data analysis.

142
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:30,150
In many disease settings, we're looking for what are called biomarkers,

143
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:36,510
and these biomarkers are physiological measurements like blood tests or chemical analyzes of tissue or bodily fluids.

144
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:40,230
It could be genetic information or metabolic data.

145
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:47,370
It could be from imaging data. It's basically like any kind of data we could get from you about you, right?

146
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:54,909
We can turn into what we call it. We could call it a biomarker. What we're hoping is that this information gives us additional information about

147
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:58,860
like how you would how you'll do in treatment or how you'll do in this disease.

148
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:07,560
Right. Has some correlation to prognosis or either with or without a treatment.

149
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:15,240
Okay. So everybody. Right. Is analyzing data, whether it's from a trial or from observational data,

150
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,620
to try to figure out like, well, what is it that's associated with this disease or the prognosis?

151
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:24,960
Because if we can figure that out and maybe if we can treat that right, maybe we'd help the individual.

152
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:31,740
So there's lots of different kinds. Basically anything now that you hear with like an old nick at the end, right?

153
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:36,059
That's all. All of those omics are being done to try to figure out these biomarkers.

154
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:43,590
Are there biomarkers, those markers that tell us how you're going to do either in terms of therapy or just in the disease?

155
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:50,640
Okay. So you can have what are called prognostic biomarkers or predictive biomarkers.

156
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:57,960
And what it means is that if it's prognostic, it means that the biomarker is associated with the disease independent of the treatment.

157
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:05,399
So knowing whatever you have. So that biomarker tells us about how well you know what, how good your prognosis is on that disease.

158
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:12,719
So for example, let's see if I can think of a good prognosis.

159
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,620
So like a good prognostic biomarker, right?

160
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:23,240
So like you. What is a good one?

161
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:28,820
Anybody have a good one? The likely course. So a lot of times there might be things like, um,

162
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:39,050
there are specific genetic aberrations that like if you have that genetic aberration, your, your, your disease might.

163
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,449
That the time to death might be faster, right?

164
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:49,299
Your disease might progress much faster. And so we have figured out these genetic aberrations.

165
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:57,310
There might be biomarkers such that if we see that you have this like level of something in your blood,

166
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:04,510
right, that that means that you might have be faster to have cancer that metastasizes.

167
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:08,440
So these are things that like it doesn't matter with what we treat us.

168
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,000
Having this level is affecting the disease outcomes.

169
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:16,240
A predictive biomarker is this interaction with treatment.

170
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:24,040
So now it's like this biomarker allows me to figure out which treatment to give you that you're going to do better or worse with.

171
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:36,940
So there is one specifically. There is many, but like one example of this is like in breast cancer, there are biomarkers of hormone receptor status.

172
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:44,400
So there's it could be your a positive or a negative, you could be PR positive or PR negative, you could be HER2 positive and first refer to negative.

173
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:54,310
And most of those biomarkers have been specific treatments that you give to the patient based on that hormone receptor.

174
00:17:54,310 --> 00:18:02,290
So er positive patients are going to receive for example like hormone replacement therapy,

175
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:09,340
HER2 positive patients are going to choose, are going to receive something called trastuzumab or Herceptin.

176
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:14,170
And so there are specific treatments that now we know this specific marker.

177
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:18,670
Right, we're going to give you that treatment because it works better for you than if we gave it to somebody who doesn't have that marker.

178
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:23,440
It has not the same effect. It could either have no effect or be detrimental.

179
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:32,830
So the prognostic is independent of treatment. Predictive is helping us figure out the treatment, the response to a specific treatment.

180
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:44,290
Okay. So the biomarker is helping us. Is what we're trying to find a biomarker that helps with this ultimate clinical endpoint.

181
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:49,479
So the clinical endpoint is that measurement that provides information on how the

182
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,960
patient feels or how their disease is right or how they're functioning or surviving.

183
00:18:53,980 --> 00:19:00,160
Often we think about survival or it might be some specific patient reported outcome.

184
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:09,600
Like maybe if the disease is depression and some survey right on a depression score or function,

185
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:18,650
it could be like, you know, I'm able to they're like, how much can I walk if you give me 6 minutes?

186
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:24,010
So that's that's a clinical endpoint, something I can measure that tells me how well I'm doing.

187
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:25,330
Right. Something about my health.

188
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:35,030
A surrogate endpoint, which we're talking about today, is attempting to be some early indicator of that ultimate clinical endpoint.

189
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:42,200
And it's hopefully an accurate prediction of both the endpoint and the effects of treatment on the endpoint.

190
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:51,770
So right, it's a surrogate endpoint is hopefully something that we see this prognostic value in and this predictive

191
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:56,570
value in in which we can figure out that the surrogate endpoint is associated with the outcome.

192
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:03,230
It's also that the effect of the treatment on the outcome is supposed to go completely through that surrogate outcome,

193
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,650
and the whole lecture is going to expand on this definition.

194
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:17,930
And then validation is saying that we need confirmation by robust statistical methods that either a candidate prognostic biomarker or

195
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:25,520
predictive biomarker or surrogate endpoint fulfills the set of conditions that are necessary and sufficient for it to be used in real life.

196
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:32,190
So we want to maybe we have some original data that shows that there's that this is a

197
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:36,870
good predictive biomarker and then we need to validate it in an independent dataset.

198
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:44,100
Right. So we're going to talk about how all these things come together and how they affect clinical trials.

199
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:52,950
So a surrogate outcome is often one or more indicators of disease progression that's measured in patients.

200
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:56,350
And this can be a surrogate outcome, could be a biomarker.

201
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:06,090
Right. So a surrogate outcome could be some type of biomarker that we're able to measure and a surrogate outcome in order to be a surrogate outcome.

202
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:12,780
It means that the surrogate has to be predictive of the primary clinical endpoints or clinical outcome.

203
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:18,689
And it also has to fully capture the effects of the intervention on the clinical outcomes.

204
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:20,729
So if we drew a little picture, right,

205
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:30,570
we have the disease and however the disease leads to the true outcome and it also affects the surrogate end point.

206
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:35,610
Right. And if we now apply some treatment to individuals with this disease,

207
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:42,720
we will see its effect on a surrogate outcome, the same effect that has on a true clinical outcome.

208
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:50,790
So essentially, right in like non-technical terms, we want a surrogate outcome to be some early indication of the ultimate outcome.

209
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,910
Right. The surrogate outcome is something we can measure faster.

210
00:21:54,600 --> 00:22:02,700
But if that thing changes that the surrogate outcome changes, then we expect the clinical, true clinical longer term outcome to similarly change.

211
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:08,080
And so you can start to see, right, if the whole goal is that this is some like early indicator,

212
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:13,860
this can be really useful in clinical trials because clinical trials we don't want to take forever and ever never to run.

213
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:20,590
We need to get information relatively fast and especially if it's phase three and we have a lot of patients,

214
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:27,100
we can't be waiting like ten years to accrue everybody and see their long term term outcome.

215
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:33,820
So if we can start, if we can figure out good surrogate endpoints and use those in clinical trials,

216
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:39,550
we can potentially save time, resources, sample size, etc.

217
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:49,060
So the whole reason why we're having this talk today is because we really need to think very critically about the outcome for clinical trials.

218
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:56,920
And when you talk to your clinicians, right, they may or may not understand or investigators, whoever they are, that wants to do this trial.

219
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:02,820
Right. They may or may not understand the surrogate outcome literature idea.

220
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:08,140
Right. And you need to figure out, like, well, what's the ultimate? What are you ultimately trying to affect in your patients?

221
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,490
Right. What is the ultimate goal? Is that actually measurable, feasible?

222
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:15,790
You know, can we do that with the resources that we have in the clinical trial?

223
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,830
And if not, what is the outcome that you think is a surrogate for that outcome?

224
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:24,570
And then you need to have some idea of like, is this a true surrogate?

225
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:28,390
What do we really be doing? If we had this outcome in the clinical trial,

226
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:38,650
would it really be the would we be answering the right question with this more easily measured or more quickly measured outcome?

227
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:45,320
So these surrogates need to be measured simply and non-invasively.

228
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:54,110
So meaning, for example, like we wouldn't want to require like bone marrow juice or whatever you call it, right?

229
00:23:56,010 --> 00:24:00,389
You wouldn't want it to be like from your bone marrow that you need to get the surrogate marker.

230
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:01,940
But that is incredibly invasive.

231
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:11,270
Like nobody wants to have to undergo anesthesia to and and and like go through this terrible pain of getting their bone marrow.

232
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:16,759
People wouldn't sign up for this trial. Right. And so we need to make sure that these things can be measured simply non-invasively.

233
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:26,780
It's usually like a quick blood draw or an image of somebody or maybe taking saliva or filling out a survey.

234
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:35,690
Right. We want this to be something that we can get quickly and easily, but it has to be justified on biological grounds.

235
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:39,049
So it can't be like, well, this is really fast to measure.

236
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:46,490
So like, we'll just do this. There has to be a reason, right, that you actually think it's in this causal pathway of the disease to the outcome.

237
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:54,500
And of course, we want it to occur quickly. That doesn't mean like within days it can still take months or maybe even a year,

238
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:58,310
but it's not as long as if you actually had to wait for that entire clinical endpoint.

239
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,250
Okay. So most of the time we actually use these surrogate endpoints in phase two.

240
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:11,330
So we usually use that for real clinical endpoint and phase three because that's our ultimate goal.

241
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:18,469
And we're going to see that it's actually really difficult to validate a surrogate endpoint.

242
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:26,540
And so because of that, we don't generally use them in phase three trials, but in phase two, we want those to be quicker, those to be easier.

243
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:32,209
Right. And so we we try to use these these surrogate endpoints in phase two and then move on to the longer,

244
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:36,830
more resource intensive phase three that has the true clinical outcome.

245
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:43,129
Now, if it's not a true surrogate, right, it may end up being a false positive or a false negative.

246
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:47,060
And phase two, which is a big problem either way, right?

247
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,439
If it's a false positive,

248
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:55,909
then we're spending all this money on phase three where we're not going to see an effect on the overall clinical outcome if it's a false negative.

249
00:25:55,910 --> 00:26:01,250
We're not moving on to phase three and we never find that that was a truly effective treatment.

250
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:11,420
And so it's very, again, very important about what this surrogate outcome is, is it will have waterfall effects in this disease, in this drug process.

251
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:23,710
So the reason why we use it in this phase two, phase two is because we can then have significant impact on the size and weight and of the trial.

252
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:31,229
Unfortunately, uniform surrogates, meaning like, well, why don't we just always use X as a surrogate outcome, right?

253
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:34,470
That that doesn't exist. So it's really not easy.

254
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:43,860
It's not easy to identify surrogate outcomes. And a surrogate outcome may exist for one disease and B, not not be appropriate for another disease,

255
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:47,080
even though you could measure it and you think like, oh, well, they're all cancers, right?

256
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,440
Why don't we just use this thing? It might not work.

257
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:56,550
And actually, I think we'll talk about at the very end how even the surrogates are treatment specific.

258
00:26:56,850 --> 00:27:01,620
And so they could be surrogates considering certain types of treatments in this disease,

259
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,800
but not surrogates in this disease for other types of treatments.

260
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:10,649
So, for example, like it's a good idea if the treatment is on cancer prevention,

261
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:18,660
education, and your ultimate goal is to decrease the number of lung cancer diagnoses.

262
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:24,930
Right. Your surrogate might be some cigaret smoking diary because you're trying to give us education.

263
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:31,260
We know that smoking is. Is associated with getting lung cancer.

264
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:40,620
And so if we can decrease the amount of people smoking or the amount of smoking, we can likely decrease the number of lung cancer diagnoses.

265
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:44,550
However, if our treatment is actually some.

266
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:54,409
Cancer, chemo prevention. So for example example some like multivitamin use and we're trying to allow we're trying

267
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:58,790
that this treatment affects the number of people who are diagnosed with lung cancer.

268
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,670
Right. Taking a cigaret smoking diary is not related at all to this treatment.

269
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:10,730
Right. Like whether you use multivitamins or not is probably not going to affect the amount of smoking that you do.

270
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:19,040
Maybe you could say there's some sort of like healthy person issue here, but if it's actually like a randomized treatment or these things are related.

271
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:22,009
And so the this is just showing the fact,

272
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:28,010
the point that the surrogate has to be not only associate with the outcome, but also associated with the treatment.

273
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:41,240
So here are some examples of surrogates. There's been a lot of work, particularly in AIDS, in cancer or HIV and AIDS in cancer,

274
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:46,280
but also in other chronic diseases that could have a long time to progression.

275
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:56,480
So try to find these shorter end points. And so in AIDS, a surrogate for an AIDS event or death is the viral load for cancer,

276
00:28:57,290 --> 00:29:05,209
a surrogate that's been looked at a lot but actually not found to be a good surrogate for many cancers,

277
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:12,170
particularly measurable cancers is tumor response, meaning tumor shrink shrinkage as a surrogate for death,

278
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:22,309
a lot of people try to use progression free survival for a surrogate, end point, a surrogate for overall survival.

279
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:27,710
So progression free survival means that your tumor is not growing or you're not getting metastasis.

280
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:36,020
You're not metastasizing. Right. We try to use that as a surrogate for how how long you live with the cancer.

281
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:41,090
And that actually has not been shown to be a good surrogate in many places as well.

282
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,870
But it's been investigated a lot. So all of these aren't necessarily good surrogates.

283
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:48,769
They're just examples of things that we've looked at, um, for glaucoma.

284
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:53,620
Have you guys gotten your eyes tested? And they do that like it used to be super annoying and now it's not that bad.

285
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:56,420
There's been huge advances, I feel like in eye testing, right?

286
00:29:56,420 --> 00:30:04,700
They used to do that like massive pus in your eye and now it's like some tiny little thing that tests your intraocular pressure, that puff of air.

287
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:05,239
Right.

288
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:14,930
And because that's been shown to be somewhat associated with vision loss, which can take a really long time to figure out how your vision is changing.

289
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:19,820
Right. But if we can just measure quickly the pressure for heart disease,

290
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:24,980
the overall clinical endpoint is whether you have a heart attack or not or maybe death.

291
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:30,020
And we found that some surrogates could be your blood pressure and cholesterol level.

292
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:35,840
And so a lot of interventions have been targeting those things to try to keep you from getting a heart attack.

293
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:42,500
Osteoporosis, the ultimate clinical outcomes are bone fractures or broken brakes.

294
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:46,610
But we try to use as a surrogate the bone mineral density.

295
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:50,989
And so that can be done in a relatively easy body scan of individuals.

296
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:54,230
And so it's easier than waiting for somebody to break a bone.

297
00:30:55,220 --> 00:31:02,870
And then we also all in the most recent, right, with all the vaccine COVID vaccine research being done,

298
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:08,659
that a lot of these trials we're using surrogate end points, particularly the early phase trials.

299
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:12,250
Right. We're using some level of immune response.

300
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:15,590
So like viral load or something, right from the shot.

301
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:24,080
But then phase three actually had to show number of infections or number of hospitalizations and that was the ultimate clinical outcome.

302
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:27,649
So you can really see, I think in this lesson,

303
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:30,979
if you're familiar with any of these areas with trials going on about how these

304
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:35,780
surrogates are are are usually used in the phase two earlier phase settings.

305
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:41,360
And the ultimate clinical outcome would be used in the Phase three setting.

306
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:47,239
And we hope that it's a good surrogate so that we're getting really good evidence, even in phase two,

307
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:51,410
that our treatments, you know what the effect is on that clinical outcome going to phase three.

308
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:57,310
Here's just an example, and I hesitate to put this.

309
00:31:57,430 --> 00:32:01,930
I took out a bunch of the details because this requires your knowledge of survival data.

310
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:10,900
But just think about the numbers. So this is saying that assume the primary outcome occurs at some small rate.

311
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:15,690
So there is like, you know, one event every 50 months.

312
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:26,290
So like one heart attack every 50 months or like one cancer death every 50 months in one treatment arm and then another one we reduce that to.

313
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:33,670
It's even faster one every 40 months. Right. And and if we have when we have time to event endpoints,

314
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:38,319
there are censoring involved because we don't actually always get to see that full event time.

315
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:43,780
Right. People aren't in the trial forever and ever until we see an event. So some people might happen and some people might not.

316
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:50,840
So that censoring is saying that, like, well, we you know, if we haven't seen an event at 36 months, right.

317
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:58,329
We just say we don't know. And if we have, we figure out the time that you've had it and people come into the trial at different times,

318
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:04,360
and some people also can drop out of the trial. So you have to take all this kind of into account when you calculate the sample size for survival.

319
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:11,270
So given that right, we would need in in this case, if we're using the survival outcome, the overall clinical outcome,

320
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:19,330
meaning 971 patients to see a difference in this event rate or the time to the event between these two treatments,

321
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:25,270
if instead we're able to find some surrogate that actually occurs four times faster.

322
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:30,730
Right. So now we can see that they've had this event within the mean event rate would be

323
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:35,680
one in every 12.5 months for one arm and one in every ten months for the other arm.

324
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:41,620
Now, if we want to find the difference between these two groups, we actually only need 404 patients.

325
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:46,380
So if we had to wait for the overall clinical outcome, we have to have a much longer trial.

326
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:52,000
We'd also have to have a much bigger trial because the event is so is rare, right?

327
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:58,389
But now, if we have a surrogate that occurs more quickly, we can see it more often.

328
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:04,720
The events not quite as rare. We have we require less patients.

329
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:13,680
And so we just went from a massive, almost 2000 person trial to now 404 in which we can run faster with less resources.

330
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:17,440
And so this would be ideal to use a surrogate in the phase two space.

331
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:25,390
Okay. So let's talk about the precise definition of a surrogate.

332
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:31,060
And this is the statistical definition, and it was first introduced by Prentice.

333
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:36,370
And so it's called the Prentice criteria. And so for a true surrogate outcome,

334
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:45,280
we should reject the null hypothesis based upon surrogate outcome if and only if we reject the null hypothesis based upon the clinical outcome.

335
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:53,479
So we're going to let this X of T denote the surrogate history at time.

336
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:56,750
T So this if you have taken survival, this is not survival.

337
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:07,100
But we can think about right this the surrogate history like did you have this surrogate this you have a surrogate or not the surrogate we can

338
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:13,430
think about as being either like time to invent an artist longitudinal measure of like what is your level of this biomarker at this time?

339
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:25,709
So statistically, the Prentice criteria are as follows that consider treatments A and B that the surrogate response.

340
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:31,650
So we'll use lambda here you can this could be like a survival time or it could just be like a response rate, right?

341
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:39,080
The response rate under treatment a a time t given the surrogate history, right.

342
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:43,010
Is the same as the response rate under treatment b at time.

343
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:46,940
T given the surrogate history is just equal to right.

344
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:49,729
If those are equal, then we don't have to say it's under A or B, right?

345
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:54,140
So they're a surrogate response is independent of the treatment is what this is saying, saying that.

346
00:35:55,470 --> 00:36:04,260
The surrogate right has that if I if I can figure out the impact of the treatment on the surrogate.

347
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:09,630
Right. That treatment, if I know the surrogate now, I know the impact on the overall clinical outcomes.

348
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,259
Right. This this pathway. We're going to see it a few more times.

349
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:16,950
But this pathway goes through the treatment effects go through the surrogate.

350
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:23,410
And also that we know that the surrogate is actually some prognostic indicator for the overall clinical outcome.

351
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:26,190
That's the second part that right.

352
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:37,560
Given the response rate of time, T or whatever, given the surrogate history, that's not equal to just the response rate at time.

353
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:44,400
T the surrogate actually has some helpful information about the the clinical end point is associated with it.

354
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:51,389
So let me we're going to show you in multiple ways what this means and also in a phase again, so we have this disease.

355
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:54,780
DX We have the treatment. T We have our surrogate outcome.

356
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:58,679
S So this is. Not necessarily a history.

357
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:06,870
Right, but our surrogate outcome. So pretend your surrogate outcome is like viral load and clinical outcome, right.

358
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:11,070
Is like whether you actually get the disease or not or hospitalized or not.

359
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:16,110
And so we have to conditioned on the knowledge of an ad enrollment that you have

360
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:21,990
this disease and we want to know the actual clinical outcome and treatment relate.

361
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:25,740
After we observe this surrogate outcome.

362
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:36,419
So the Prentice criteria. Right. Another way to say that the clinical outcome is independent of treatment, given my surrogate and my disease and so.

363
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:41,280
Right. Everything that the treatment did to me goes through my surrogate outcome.

364
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,510
So if I know how the surrogate outcome is, I know the clinical outcome.

365
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:52,380
That's what that same book and the second one says that the outcome is not independent of the surrogate given the disease.

366
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,740
Right. Is saying that actually the surrogate has some effects. Right.

367
00:37:55,740 --> 00:38:01,550
It's associated with the outcome. So that.

368
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:07,520
That outcome is independent from treatment given the surrogate and disease, is that right?

369
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:17,240
If we look at this picture, this figure that everything that the action of the intervention through the surrogate.

370
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:22,730
Right. Fully captures the effect of the intervention on a true clinical outcome.

371
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:29,540
Kind of think if you think back to like your AP classes, right. Or I don't know what other classes teach this book.

372
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:33,319
Right. When you're thinking about confounders and mediators, right.

373
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:44,300
This this surrogate end point is like a mediator of the effect of the intervention to the clinical outcome and in fact is a direct form mediator,

374
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:51,830
because you have to go the intervention has to go through this like causal pathway completely the surrogate outcome to your true clinical outcome.

375
00:38:52,490 --> 00:39:02,690
Now this criterion is actually very difficult to validate or to justify, and this is ultimately like the end to the downfall of all surrogates.

376
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:09,380
And so we'll go through specific examples of how this how we can't really figure this out.

377
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:17,030
And we'll also talk about some weakened or more flexible criteria that we can have for surrogates instead of fully required.

378
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:25,069
This now this the second practice criteria saying that the essentially the surrogate is associated with the outcome.

379
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:29,450
That's actually really easy to show or to establish.

380
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:35,330
Right. We can just show that there's this correlation between the surrogate end point and the clinical end point.

381
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:39,319
And so it's very easy to show that there's correlation between the surrogate and the clinical.

382
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:43,880
It's not so easy to show that any effect of the treatment goes completely through the surrogate.

383
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:47,990
Right. And I'll show you different ways in which that doesn't hold.

384
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:57,560
So the ways that the surrogate feels is if the surrogate is not actually in the causal pathway of the disease process.

385
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,520
And so the disease. Right.

386
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:09,440
Can affect the disease has an effect on the surrogate endpoint, but that effect is totally independent of the actual true clinical outcome.

387
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:19,730
So right. The surrogate outcome is not really associated with the true clinical outcome or it's not that it's not fully associated.

388
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:20,180
Right.

389
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:30,590
There could be other several causal pathways of the disease through which the intervention affects only the pathway mediated through the surrogate.

390
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:34,489
So like the treatment is affecting the surrogate, which affects the true outcome,

391
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:39,050
but also the disease has these other pathways of which it's affecting the clinical outcome.

392
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,110
So the treatment effect is going through the surrogate,

393
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:50,030
but there are these other causes or other things of the disease that are also affecting the true clinical outcome.

394
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:54,350
One kind of toy example, right.

395
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:58,950
If we try to poke holes at the viral load being a.

396
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:08,950
Surrogate, right. Is that like the vaccine might decrease your viral load, right.

397
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,380
Which affects whether you get COVID 19 or not.

398
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:17,299
But also, you know, your just baseline immune system, right.

399
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:26,300
If you're immuno compromised in some way, perhaps that affects these affects other issues as to whether you could get treatment or,

400
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:32,330
you know, how your viral load might be the same, but it might have a really different effect on you, on your body.

401
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,600
And that affects whether you're hospitalized or not.

402
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:45,890
Okay. Then there could be that the surrogates not in the pathway of the intervention effect or it's insensitive to its effect.

403
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:51,380
So in this case, the disease affects the surrogate outcome, which affects the true clinical outcome.

404
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:56,900
But the intervention effect isn't actually changing the surrogate outcome.

405
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:06,150
And then the fourth one, which and again, I'll show you more examples of these, and I also recommend you read that second article.

406
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:12,870
But this last one is that the intervention does effects the surrogate, which affects the clinical outcome,

407
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:19,610
but the intervention also affects these other pathways, and those other pathways also affect your true outcome.

408
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:27,240
And so we don't have that full effect of the treatment through the surrogate to the true clinical outcome.

409
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:36,159
Okay. So here is an example of the first failure where if you remember, here we go.

410
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:42,670
Right? The disease affects the surrogate outcome, but the surrogate outcome is not associated with the true clinical outcome.

411
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:48,370
So for pregnant women who have HIV,

412
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:56,800
we know that there is a strong negative correlation between maternal CD4 count and the likelihood of HIV transmission to the infant.

413
00:42:57,310 --> 00:43:09,520
And so we know that given this CD4 count, and I think it's actually the lower the C four count, the more likely you are to transmit HIV.

414
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:18,820
Right. We might think. Well, let's try to give pregnant moms who have HIV this therapy, this drug that would raise their CD4 counts.

415
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:25,600
So if we raise our city four accounts, maybe then it'd be less likely that they transmit HIV to the baby.

416
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:31,480
However, the actual CD4 count, that's not in the causal pathway of the transmission.

417
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:42,310
Right. And so this isn't a surrogate outcome because this is not the city for count is not part of the causal mechanism for HIV transmission.

418
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:53,770
And so while it might have some CD4 count might be associated with the outcome, it's not it's not in the causal pathway of the outcome.

419
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,810
It's not a mediator of the treatment of that.

420
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:09,219
There might be other biomarkers in the disease that have been useful for prognosis, but they don't lie in the causal pathway of the disease.

421
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:16,090
So there could be some variables which are associated with the clinical these surrogates that are associated with how well you do.

422
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:19,840
However, it's not actually right. It's some sort of like.

423
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:25,350
Effective something else that's happening that's associated with the outcome.

424
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:30,069
It's not in the causal pathway of the disease. Okay.

425
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:38,760
So the surrogate failure, B and C, so B was when the intervention does act on the surrogate, but it's not the full effect.

426
00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:43,180
The the disease also has some other effect on the true clinical outcomes.

427
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:51,100
So there are several causal pathways through which the intervention only affects the one through the surrogate pathway to the surrogate end point.

428
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:58,720
Or C, is that the surrogate endpoint actually isn't in the causal pathway of the intervention to the true clinical outcome.

429
00:44:59,050 --> 00:45:05,470
So it's that there are these several pathways of the disease to the true clinical endpoint and either the

430
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:10,420
intervention only acts on the surrogate endpoint or the intervention doesn't act on the surrogate endpoint.

431
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:19,960
That's B and C. And so if the intervention only affects the disease pathway through the biomarker, then this can lead to a false positive.

432
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:26,590
If the intervention only affects the pathways other than the one, including the biomarker or the surrogate.

433
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:30,940
Right here I'm using biomarker as surrogate. Then that can lead to a false negative.

434
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:36,940
So this example here is that there is this disease in children that results in serious infections.

435
00:45:37,330 --> 00:45:42,610
And so researchers wanted to test this treatment to increase the bacterial killing.

436
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:47,950
And so bacterial killing was this like biomarker of this potential surrogate outcome.

437
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:56,799
And they they they their ultimate clinical endpoint was the time to first infection.

438
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,580
Right? So they're trying to elongate the time that these children get infections.

439
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:04,480
And they think that if they kill the bacterial bacteria, they won't get the infection.

440
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:08,950
Right. So the bacteria killing is a potential surrogate of this time to first infection.

441
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:13,870
What they found was that there was a 70% reduction in the time to first serious

442
00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:18,670
infection so that there was this effect of this treatment on the clinical endpoint.

443
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:24,220
But they actually didn't see the effect of that treatment on a surrogate endpoint.

444
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:32,650
So that treatment wasn't killing more bacteria, but somehow it was elongating time to infection.

445
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:37,209
And they thought they hypothesized that it must be that the intervention is working in some

446
00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:44,260
other pathways such that it's allowing it's somehow allowing increased antibiotic uptake.

447
00:46:44,650 --> 00:46:46,600
Right. So it's not actually killing off bacteria.

448
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:51,040
There might be the same amount of bacteria, but it's somehow allowing bodies to fight that bacteria better.

449
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:51,910
Right.

450
00:46:51,910 --> 00:47:00,489
So this is bacterial killing is not a good surrogate for this treatment because this treatment is not killing the bacteria, which leads to longer.

451
00:47:00,490 --> 00:47:03,880
It's actually probably doing something else that could lead to longer time to infection.

452
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:06,729
So you have to consider that there are all these. Right.

453
00:47:06,730 --> 00:47:13,090
This is really like a as a statistician, you might be thinking like, how do you know these other pathways?

454
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:20,889
Right. You probably don't. So that's why it's like really important that you're talking to and understanding the science behind whatever area you're

455
00:47:20,890 --> 00:47:28,540
working in so that you can have this better idea of like if we're not if we're really interested in this ultimate outcome,

456
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:31,900
but you propose we use this outcome. Is this appropriate?

457
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:35,589
Because, you know, you need the scientist to explain to you?

458
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:36,400
Well, I think.

459
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:45,790
Right, based on animal models or other studies, this is the way in which this treatment is going to affect the person affects not infants.

460
00:47:45,790 --> 00:47:56,590
Fact. Okay, that last one was that the intervention right could actually effects the surrogate but also affect these other pathways.

461
00:47:58,350 --> 00:48:05,820
And so there could be these off target effects through which the intervention truly influences the clinical end point,

462
00:48:06,270 --> 00:48:09,630
that the surrogate captures some of it, but not all of that effect.

463
00:48:09,870 --> 00:48:15,000
So one example here is that there was.

464
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:22,080
So there were these treatments for trying to think the ultimate.

465
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:27,160
Yeah. The ultimate outcome was is mortality or death.

466
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:31,300
And this is for treating patients who have already had a heart attack.

467
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:36,189
They found that if they thought that if you could suppress cardiac arrhythmia.

468
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:45,610
Right. Or irregular heartbeat with one of these treatments, that if you could affect irregular heartbeat, it would help people live longer.

469
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:55,780
Right. There wouldn't be as many deaths. And so these drugs were approved because they they decreased their irregular heartbeat.

470
00:48:55,820 --> 00:49:03,340
Right. The drugs were approved on this surrogate endpoint of they did not they were able to suppress this ventricular arrhythmia.

471
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:09,520
And they thought that that surrogate endpoint was associated with ultimate death.

472
00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:15,780
But they found that after they approved this in like a phase four trial where they're actually seeing that people are taking it right,

473
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:17,410
more people are taking it. They can look at it.

474
00:49:17,410 --> 00:49:24,610
That rates that might have been rare is that they found that while perhaps it was controlling this arrhythmia,

475
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:32,800
was unfortunately there some other pathways where these treatments were actually causing a higher level of death in the patients?

476
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:36,880
Right. So the treatments were somehow detrimental to the patients.

477
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:45,580
Right. Or the disease was detrimental. And other pathways, very likely the treatment was affecting these other pathways that affected overall death.

478
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:50,859
You can imagine. Right, that perhaps treatment is affecting other parts, you know,

479
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:56,439
other cells in the body that are breaking down and leading to to death or has some toxicities.

480
00:49:56,440 --> 00:50:01,060
Right. That lead to death. Yeah, I have a question about the failure in testing.

481
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:10,030
So for me, it is although it didn't catch all the pathway, at least catch the surrogate pathway there.

482
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:15,320
So it can reduce the true outcome if it used for life.

483
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:18,540
It's also a failure. Correct?

484
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:26,820
Yeah. Right. So the surrogate endpoint. Is capturing some of the effect of the intervention, but not all of the effects of the intervention.

485
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:32,820
And first, true statistical surrogate end point has to be the full effect of the intervention.

486
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:36,990
But you can never know if there is any outer pathway.

487
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:43,740
It goes through the surrogate. And so that's why we say that this is like difficult or impossible to establish.

488
00:50:43,830 --> 00:50:50,700
Yes. So you'll see. We'll try to have some loosen criteria as we go to the end.

489
00:50:52,830 --> 00:50:56,670
Okay. So here's another example. We're going to figure out why it's a failure in a minute.

490
00:50:57,210 --> 00:51:05,610
So here's a this is a trial from a long time ago where these are patients who have cardiac disease.

491
00:51:05,610 --> 00:51:10,020
Right. They have heart problems and they're receiving hemodialysis.

492
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:17,460
So this is essentially that they have to get hooked up to a machine that helps pump their blood throughout their body.

493
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:18,300
Okay.

494
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:31,649
And a lot of people who have end stage end stage renal disease or need to be on these pumps, these dialysis pumps, they have anemia or low iron count.

495
00:51:31,650 --> 00:51:38,400
Right. Low blood count. And so they receive this often in practice, they receive this treatment called Epogen,

496
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:44,130
which tries to increase their blood count or not have them have anemia.

497
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:49,480
But after a while they were doing this and then they were like, it was, is this the right thing to do?

498
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:55,980
So they they ran this clinical trial where they randomized patients to either having

499
00:51:56,310 --> 00:52:02,400
a higher level of inadequate or a higher blood count or if they let it go lower.

500
00:52:03,330 --> 00:52:08,080
And so they had about 1200 patients enrolled over two and a half years.

501
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:15,030
They randomized to either use this treatment to maintain their hematocrit at a lower than normal level.

502
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:21,690
So they allowed it to dip low. They allow these patients to be somewhat anemic because that is like kind of what naturally would happen.

503
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:27,149
But they did stabilize it with this treatment so it wouldn't go too low or they

504
00:52:27,150 --> 00:52:30,950
got this treatment so that they would have basically like a normal level of crit,

505
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:40,410
right? Pre dialysis levels of hematocrit and their primary outcome is whether they have a heart attack, myocardial infarction or if they die.

506
00:52:43,310 --> 00:52:50,000
So on this plot up here, it's just showing you that this is the hematocrit level, right?

507
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,049
You can think of this at the blood level that like right after some titration,

508
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:59,780
they were able to get on average individuals to some like higher level of the blood levels.

509
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:05,150
Right. The normal group had higher levels of blood of these blood levels throughout time,

510
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:10,489
whereas the lower level they maintained this low level of hematocrit throughout.

511
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:14,720
So it's just essentially showing you like, look, we did the treatment the treatment groups differ.

512
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:19,910
This on average, there's a higher level versus a lower level over here.

513
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:28,489
This is just showing you how much. EPSHTEYN So this is like a level of that drug in the end in them.

514
00:53:28,490 --> 00:53:35,540
And so, again, it's just showing you that like, well, for those who wanted higher levels of of blood, we had to give them more treatment.

515
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:39,670
All right. So this is saying, yeah, we gave more treatment to the people who we, too,

516
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:44,660
needed to maintain normal levels and we gave less treatment to those who had the lower levels.

517
00:53:45,170 --> 00:53:49,879
Now, this plot over here is what we call a cumulative incidence plot, which,

518
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:53,960
if you take survival, you will learn about, is kind of like the opposite of survival.

519
00:53:54,290 --> 00:54:02,180
This is showing us the number of or showing you the probability of having a heart attack or dying over time,

520
00:54:02,810 --> 00:54:10,310
as opposed to we'll see survival plots which show us. Right. The probability of being alive or not having those things.

521
00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:17,209
Right. Those are the decreasing. So here we can see that the normal hematocrit group, those who had higher levels or maintained higher levels,

522
00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:23,000
actually had higher probability of death or having a heart attack.

523
00:54:23,330 --> 00:54:29,900
Right. They thought that if they were able to increase the levels of hematocrit to more normal levels, this would be advantageous.

524
00:54:30,290 --> 00:54:36,020
And what they actually saw was the opposite, that the people who maintain these lower levels ended up doing better.

525
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:51,110
And so they ended up stopping this trial before it was fully finished because they saw this issue of higher deaths in the normal hematocrit group.

526
00:54:52,400 --> 00:55:00,530
And and so they stopped it for safety. And then they went back and they tried to figure out was it actually the fact that they had.

527
00:55:01,550 --> 00:55:05,270
Like, what is this? Is this a real effects that they're seeing here?

528
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:12,620
And so they did this post-hoc analysis of the endpoint, the true clinical endpoint against the average hematocrit levels.

529
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:19,250
So instead of figuring out if you're randomized to A or B, where you either had low or high,

530
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:25,940
if we took every individual and saw what their average hematocrit level, which could have been different.

531
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:31,610
Right, because it might have taken them a long time to get low or a long time to get high or whatever.

532
00:55:31,610 --> 00:55:35,870
Right. If we actually look at their average level throughout, then we found that.

533
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:40,799
It was actually the opposite. This is like Simpsons Paradox kind of.

534
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:47,070
Right. It's a little it's a little bit of a difference of it's also like the intent to treat versus per protocol analysis.

535
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:50,879
Right. When we when we see what you are randomized to, we find one thing.

536
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:56,310
But now when we actually look at the raw individual level data, right, we can find something else.

537
00:55:56,310 --> 00:56:03,180
And so they actually found that if we looked at the average level when we consider what everybody had themselves,

538
00:56:04,710 --> 00:56:09,840
that as your hematocrit increased, your prognosis was better.

539
00:56:10,290 --> 00:56:17,260
So right. It's kind of like the surrogate, the hematocrit of being the somatic at level, trying to be a surrogate rate.

540
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:25,439
This trial said it's not. But if we looked at the Nonrandomized data, we say, well, it does appear that if you have better hematocrit levels,

541
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:31,590
right, that's probably telling you that you're getting better. But if we force something upon you, it might not at all.

542
00:56:32,010 --> 00:56:40,979
You know, there might be these other these are these other pathways in which that you having higher levels is working in some way

543
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:48,120
towards overall outcome that we can't and force on you with just this treatment by trying to get your level lower high.

544
00:56:49,590 --> 00:56:53,490
So they did do other trials to try to figure out what was happening here.

545
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:59,670
And basically, they said that there's probably some off target effect that was affecting the

546
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:04,680
death or having heart attacks that was not captured by this blood level alone.

547
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:14,070
Right. And so if we try to say why this is a failed surrogacy, which I basically say in this last sentence.

548
00:57:14,070 --> 00:57:19,830
Right. Would it be because it's not in the causal pathway or of several causal pathways,

549
00:57:19,830 --> 00:57:28,200
the intervention affects only the pathway mediated through the surrogate or it's not in the pathway or insensitive to of the intervention effect,

550
00:57:29,010 --> 00:57:32,400
or it has mechanisms of action independent of the disease process.

551
00:57:57,550 --> 00:58:02,680
So think about the fact that like when they actually analyze the data that might occur at levels they did see.

552
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:11,260
Right. In effect, the outcome. However, there is something else going on when you add treatment to this equation.

553
00:58:29,310 --> 00:58:38,570
Okay. We're all over the board. So it does seem like, right, that the disease,

554
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:46,170
having you have this cardiac issue and we're trying to see whether you have a heart attack or die or not.

555
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:51,239
Right. It does seem like hematocrit is in this causal pathway because we can see that

556
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:57,600
like at through that secondary analysis that when the hematocrit was higher,

557
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:06,820
there was a better outcome. The problem comes in when you add the intervention and.

558
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:15,760
Right. So I would say then we're really thinking about like B or C, so of error of several causal pathways of the disease.

559
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:21,159
The intervention affects only the pathway mediated through the surrogate or that the

560
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:26,350
intervention or this treatment has mechanisms of action independent of the disease process.

561
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:35,260
So if we want with B, right, it would say that there are like all of these different ways in which the disease is affecting death.

562
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:43,030
And and heart attack and the treatment of this Abidjan is only affecting.

563
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:51,590
The. Right. That Abidjan is affecting the hematocrit, which affects the outcome.

564
00:59:51,590 --> 00:59:58,610
But there are some. Other pathways of which the intervention doesn't affect.

565
00:59:59,450 --> 01:00:06,049
Right. I actually think it's more that the intervention has mechanisms of action that are independent of the disease process,

566
01:00:06,050 --> 01:00:09,350
that perhaps the intervention is affecting the surrogate.

567
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:15,470
Right. That the intervention is actually affecting these other things, which is increasing the death rate.

568
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:20,420
Right. Because if we take away the effect, the interventions.

569
01:00:20,830 --> 01:00:26,300
Right. If we say now let's not analyze and tend to treat, let's actually just look at your hematocrit values.

570
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:34,469
Then we see that the opposite happened. And so like something about the specific treatment, right, seemed to be harmful,

571
01:00:34,470 --> 01:00:38,120
like giving more of the treatment seemed to be harmful to the individuals.

572
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:43,760
And so it must be that this treatment is affecting this.

573
01:00:45,030 --> 01:00:52,290
Disease process is outcome in some way. That's through hematocrit, but also through these other avenues that's actually making it detrimental.

574
01:00:53,040 --> 01:01:00,150
Right. The fact that this treatment, when you look at it and there's higher levels of it, has worse effects on the outcome than if you.

575
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:04,790
Forget the actual level of treatment and just look at the hematocrit. You get the opposite.

576
01:01:05,180 --> 01:01:08,330
That makes me think that the treatment is acting through disease in other ways.

577
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:13,440
So I would say here. Okay.

578
01:01:13,890 --> 01:01:17,360
Let's consider this one the nocturnal oxygen therapy trials.

579
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:28,500
So this was done even before I was born. This is that 203 patients with this is like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that's COPD.

580
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:34,079
They're are randomized to either get 12 hours of oxygen at night or continuous oxygen.

581
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:39,870
So like imagine, right? You're either sleeping with one of those like CPAP machines with oxygen or you're like always,

582
01:01:39,870 --> 01:01:50,790
you know, you're one of those people carrying around the tubes. So they had several primary outcomes and these were all surrogate outcomes.

583
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:56,670
So it's forced expiratory volume. If any of you has asthma, you're probably use to this you like blow into.

584
01:01:58,170 --> 01:02:01,560
Cop thing or whatever. And they figure out how much air you're blowing out.

585
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:04,680
That's this there's force vital capacity.

586
01:02:04,950 --> 01:02:12,040
There's functional residual capacity and also quality of life and mortality, which is really like a true clinical outcome.

587
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:17,550
Right. We want to keep you from dying. That was secondary because it was going to take so long to observe.

588
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:25,160
And what they found is that it didn't matter whether you had 12 hours of oxygen at night or continuous oxygen.

589
01:02:25,170 --> 01:02:30,059
All of these surrogate outcomes were the same between the groups.

590
01:02:30,060 --> 01:02:40,710
There was no change in the surrogate outcomes. However, the mortality rate in those who got the only the oxygen at night nearly doubled.

591
01:02:41,490 --> 01:02:51,149
So it's this is a survival graph now. So this is saying, right, that 100% of the individuals are alive or didn't have an event.

592
01:02:51,150 --> 01:02:54,210
I think it's just mortality, right. 100% of individuals alive.

593
01:02:54,480 --> 01:03:04,049
And as we go on, right at 30 months of those who had nocturnal oxygen, only 55% of them are still alive.

594
01:03:04,050 --> 01:03:09,090
And those who had continuous oxygen, about 77%.

595
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:10,770
Right. And so we see that.

596
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:22,430
Somehow it didn't affect these surrogate outcomes, but yet getting less oxygen throughout the entire day affected the clinical outcome.

597
01:03:24,470 --> 01:03:27,950
Right. So, oops. Well, there goes the answer.

598
01:03:28,060 --> 01:03:32,600
Okay. So for this one, right,

599
01:03:32,610 --> 01:03:38,749
it's actually that the surrogate's not in the in the pathway of the intervention's effect or that it's insensitive to the effect.

600
01:03:38,750 --> 01:03:43,520
So it's C. Right. It's that if we don't see a change in the surrogate.

601
01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:48,560
Right. Then clearly the tree, it's not in the pathway of the treatment affecting the outcome.

602
01:03:48,890 --> 01:03:54,500
However, they were chosen as surrogates because they believe that these surrogates are associated with the outcome.

603
01:03:55,100 --> 01:04:03,440
Right. They believe that having better forced expiratory volume or whatever is associate quality of life is associated with longer life.

604
01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:07,790
But we didn't see any effect of the treatment on this.

605
01:04:07,790 --> 01:04:16,459
And so, therefore, this is not the the any of these surrogates are not good surrogates for mortality because there is no difference in surrogates,

606
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:21,950
whereas there is a difference in from the treatment in the overall clinical outcome.

607
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:30,400
Okay. So we can see that it's really difficult to satisfy this criteria,

608
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:35,710
particularly knowing all of these other causal pathways and being able to show that.

609
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:39,819
And so we have to acknowledge that basically, right.

610
01:04:39,820 --> 01:04:44,830
An ideal surrogate or the perfect surrogate that just never exists.

611
01:04:45,310 --> 01:04:51,760
And so trying to use Prentice's criteria, we would always say that there is a failure of a surrogate,

612
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:54,760
but that doesn't mean that we should never use that endpoint.

613
01:04:55,390 --> 01:04:59,130
Right. And in fact, perhaps we can just either one,

614
01:04:59,140 --> 01:05:06,760
we can use that endpoint because it's still useful information that might be helpful for a clinic like of helpful for patients.

615
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:09,100
They might find that those outcomes are important.

616
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:14,700
Or two, we can say, well, maybe we still can use these surrogates and they're not perfect, but they're okay, right?

617
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:17,220
They're like. Solid.

618
01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:23,760
And we believe that if we can capture some of the effect through the surrogate is still useful in the resource savings to use that in phase two,

619
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:33,690
then phase three. So usually what we do for surrogates and if you took epidemiology and you talked about surrogates,

620
01:05:33,690 --> 01:05:42,310
this is how you decided that you would find them to be a surrogate. It's that the there is correlation between the surrogate and the clinical outcome.

621
01:05:42,330 --> 01:05:46,290
Right. That's the regular practice criteria that's easy to establish.

622
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:54,630
And then that there's correlation of the effects of the treatment on the surrogates and the effect of the treatment on the clinical outcome.

623
01:05:54,870 --> 01:06:01,199
Right. So you usually say, well, I can see that the surrogate is associated with the outcome and I can see that the treatment

624
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:04,800
is associated with the surrogate and the treatment is associated with the outcome.

625
01:06:05,010 --> 01:06:09,660
Okay. That's usually how we then define how we decide that there's surrogates.

626
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:15,209
Now we want to be a little bit more statistically robust with that and not just say like,

627
01:06:15,210 --> 01:06:19,970
oh, figure out like, you know, ROE equals 0.7 or point nine, right?

628
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:23,909
We actually want to do this in a in a more statistically robust way.

629
01:06:23,910 --> 01:06:31,020
So when we talk about the correlation between the proposed surrogate and the clinical outcome, we're talking about individual level surrogacy.

630
01:06:31,290 --> 01:06:35,060
And this is like within one study, observational or clinical trial, right?

631
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:40,950
We can actually look at the correlation between everyone's surrogate and everyone's outcome and we could,

632
01:06:40,950 --> 01:06:49,139
for example, get a ROE or we can get some effects like hazard ratio or odds ratio to to show that no,

633
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:54,150
this correlation between the effect of the treatment on a surrogate and the effect of the treatment on the clinical outcome.

634
01:06:54,150 --> 01:06:58,470
This is what we call trial level surrogacy. So we cannot get this just from one trial.

635
01:06:58,860 --> 01:07:04,649
We actually need to look across multiple trials, multiple studies, and do what we call a meta analysis,

636
01:07:04,650 --> 01:07:13,740
which we'll talk more about in another week and say, well, how did these things relate in this trial now in an independent dataset?

637
01:07:13,860 --> 01:07:20,700
How did they relate in this trial? Right. How was the the surrogate associated with the effect of treatment?

638
01:07:20,930 --> 01:07:25,380
But the effect of treatment is you a surrogate and in fact, a treatment on the outcome here, here, here.

639
01:07:25,650 --> 01:07:32,220
And let's see if now we're seeing that over these multiple trials, multiple studies that we see that the effect holds.

640
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:40,379
And so one of the I think maybe it wasn't this reading that I had you do,

641
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:45,630
but the first reading of suggested readings talks about this is that there is a lot

642
01:07:45,630 --> 01:07:50,280
of effort in trying to figure out if we could use pathological complete response.

643
01:07:50,280 --> 01:08:01,169
That's PCR as a surrogate outcome for breast cancer, specifically those who have neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

644
01:08:01,170 --> 01:08:05,820
So that means that so there are women with breast cancer. This is some measurable amount of disease.

645
01:08:06,210 --> 01:08:11,520
And what we do is that before we go in and have surgery and have surgery on these women to cut the tumor out,

646
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:15,600
we actually give the women chemotherapy before surgery and try to shrink the tumor.

647
01:08:15,930 --> 01:08:18,059
That's what neoadjuvant chemotherapy is called.

648
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:26,220
So before surgery, we try to shrink the tumor now that the tumor is smaller and hopefully we decrease the cancer load of the individual.

649
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:34,440
Right. Hopefully it's not as spread that we can better cut it out. And this pathological complete response is that before we get to the surgery,

650
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:44,609
we actually see that there's no more breast cancer tissue in the individual that that that we have not only like the tumor hasn't just shrunk,

651
01:08:44,610 --> 01:08:47,730
it's actually completely gone away and it's no longer in the lymph nodes.

652
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:50,009
And so we hope that.

653
01:08:50,010 --> 01:08:58,650
Right, if we we wanted to we thought if we can get pathological complete response, they'd have way better prognosis, these women, than if they don't.

654
01:08:58,710 --> 01:09:02,910
Right. If there's tumor left over, we have to go through the surgery and more treatment.

655
01:09:02,910 --> 01:09:08,820
They're likely to have worse response or so it was thought and it was based on data.

656
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,959
Again, this is a survival curve where we can see that in the red.

657
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:19,680
For those who actually have pathological complete response rate, their time to death is much slower.

658
01:09:20,070 --> 01:09:25,469
Right. A lot of them are surviving longer than those who don't have pathological complete response.

659
01:09:25,470 --> 01:09:34,080
That survival curve is steeper. It's lower, meaning that those who still have tumor left in them right there are more there.

660
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:37,410
More of them are dying from cancer.

661
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:44,990
So this is the what we call that individual level surrogacy right in this trial.

662
01:09:45,350 --> 01:09:49,009
We can show that there is an association, right? There's clear correlation.

663
01:09:49,010 --> 01:09:53,950
And in fact, we measure in survival. The sex measurement is what we call a hazard ratio.

664
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:57,860
You can kind of think of it like an odds ratio from logistic regression, right?

665
01:09:57,860 --> 01:10:01,610
Like what's the the difference in effects for these two groups?

666
01:10:02,870 --> 01:10:08,060
It's the instantaneous likelihood of death, right, is the hazard ratio.

667
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:12,380
And so this is showing that there's a huge savings.

668
01:10:12,650 --> 01:10:16,580
Right. Or a huge benefit in survival for those who have PCR.

669
01:10:16,580 --> 01:10:20,390
And it's you know, this confidence interval is very far from mine.

670
01:10:21,290 --> 01:10:25,190
Now, this is this attempt to have trial level surrogacy.

671
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:33,319
Right. Okay. Well, that was just one instance. In one trial, I showed that pathological complete response was associated with overall survival.

672
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:40,040
But now each one of these ABC, these G, right, these are all different individual studies.

673
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:47,060
The size of the circle represents the size of the study, which you can think of as representing the strength of the evidence.

674
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:54,440
Right. The bigger the circle, the more people we have, the more we probably trust the results because there is less variability.

675
01:10:55,520 --> 01:11:00,530
And so here, if we are trying to prove that there is trial level.

676
01:11:02,310 --> 01:11:12,840
Surrogacy, right? Then we'd expect to see a pretty good lining up of these dots on a line that's not horizontal.

677
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:17,520
Right. That has some sort of slope to it, whether it's negative or positive,

678
01:11:17,850 --> 01:11:22,980
showing that on the x axis, this is the odds ratio for pathological complete response.

679
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:30,380
Right. So in that trial, if you had a pathological, what's the odds of having pathological complete response given the treatment?

680
01:11:30,390 --> 01:11:36,740
Right. One treatment over the other. Right. And on the Y axis is the hazard ratios for overall survival.

681
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:42,150
So when you compare one treatment to the other, are people more likely to live longer or not?

682
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:47,819
Right. So you would think that if you're if this treatment is more likely to give you a pathological complete response,

683
01:11:47,820 --> 01:11:50,820
this treatment should give you a better survival. Right.

684
01:11:50,850 --> 01:11:54,240
That's what we would expect. And what we see is think. Not really.

685
01:11:54,510 --> 01:12:01,290
Right. Actually, when we look across all of these trials, we're seeing basically a horizontal line such that.

686
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:08,800
Treatment might get you pathological complete response, but yet that might not actually get you better survival.

687
01:12:09,340 --> 01:12:16,930
And so once you can, we'll talk about this again, a meta analysis, but the highest level of the hierarchy, right?

688
01:12:16,930 --> 01:12:24,760
The pyramid of evidence is what's called a meta analysis that we don't just look at one study, we look across many studies and we try to figure out,

689
01:12:25,090 --> 01:12:31,050
does this with lots more lots more people, more heterogeneity, do we still see the same results?

690
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:34,930
And no, in fact, here we can't really say that we have this trial level surrogacy.

691
01:12:36,340 --> 01:12:40,330
And so pathological complete response may still be useful.

692
01:12:40,390 --> 01:12:48,310
Right. It seems like in some settings it is useful. Right. We have this individual level surrogacy, however, it's.

693
01:12:50,060 --> 01:12:57,170
It's maybe treatment specific, right? Such that like it works in some cases, but not when we look across all cases.

694
01:12:57,170 --> 01:13:00,290
And so this article, if you go back, this is a Lancet article,

695
01:13:00,290 --> 01:13:10,670
if you want to look more about this specific case of PCR in and survival of breast cancer, what they actually say is that they think that like.

696
01:13:12,510 --> 01:13:19,169
You know, there might be specific subtypes for which PCR is really important and or that like it's really only a specific chemotherapies.

697
01:13:19,170 --> 01:13:29,680
And now if you introduce other types of like immunotherapies or targeted therapies, you might not actually see the same response.

698
01:13:30,780 --> 01:13:38,580
And so they say that this pooled analysis could not validate PCR as a surrogate for overall survival.

699
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:44,159
And so, again, they say that that's probably because there's heterogeneous subtypes.

700
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:48,780
So right there specific inclusion criteria in each trial and that can differ.

701
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:52,950
And so this heterogeneity is actually probably hurting this trial level surrogacy

702
01:13:52,950 --> 01:13:56,129
because there are specific subtypes for which this is a good surrogate,

703
01:13:56,130 --> 01:14:00,960
but other subtypes for which it's not. Also that is treatment specific.

704
01:14:01,230 --> 01:14:07,920
And so those trials that used targeted treatments led to smaller differences.

705
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:13,250
So there are there could be targeted treatments of like I'm targeting people with this type of, you know,

706
01:14:13,290 --> 01:14:20,730
genetic aberration or whatever this type of hormone receptor versus I'm just giving you chemotherapy and is trying to kill all your cells.

707
01:14:21,180 --> 01:14:21,570
Right.

708
01:14:21,690 --> 01:14:28,470
And so the surrogacy of pathological complete response might only work with the chemotherapy and not with this more focused, targeted treatment.

709
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:34,350
And or there might just be factors unrelated to the primary tumor response which could have a role.

710
01:14:34,350 --> 01:14:42,060
So there could be some some way in which there's immeasurable, you know, there's not measurable disease that's already circulating in your body.

711
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:48,060
And so you may have eradicated the primary tumor, but it could be, you know,

712
01:14:48,330 --> 01:14:53,880
dormant cancer or something that or that we couldn't met, that we didn't measure is already elsewhere.

713
01:14:54,330 --> 01:14:59,160
Yeah. If you only have a PCR, your cancer isn't a serious.

714
01:14:59,910 --> 01:15:10,920
No, you can have you can have you could have a very so it was in for metastatic patients or at least measurable metastatic lesions.

715
01:15:11,250 --> 01:15:15,180
But you could have like a massive tumor and still achieve PCR.

716
01:15:16,650 --> 01:15:25,100
But there could be other things. Like there could be other severities that we're not measuring right outside of this to our size.

717
01:15:29,180 --> 01:15:33,510
Okay. So basically, we're seeing that the Prentice criteria.

718
01:15:33,710 --> 01:15:40,190
Oh, yes. Sorry. I'm just wondering, how do we integrate surrogacy in combine treatment?

719
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:47,660
So if you have, like. Yeah. So you probably can't.

720
01:15:49,180 --> 01:15:53,950
Peace out which treatment right. Is associated specifically?

721
01:15:53,950 --> 01:15:56,740
I mean, maybe you can I'm sure there are certain ways to do that,

722
01:15:57,070 --> 01:16:02,080
but likely you would you know, you would be saying that like these treatments together.

723
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:05,649
Right. Are affecting the surrogate, which is affecting the outcome.

724
01:16:05,650 --> 01:16:08,530
You're not going to piece out the specific effects of it on the surrogate.

725
01:16:11,370 --> 01:16:18,150
So the princess criteria as initially set out, are strict and basically impossible to verify or validate.

726
01:16:19,170 --> 01:16:25,200
And so there's a lot of stories of how, like, we try for these surrogate outcomes and then they're not good surrogates.

727
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:30,740
And when you read those stories, you're like, Well, yeah, that's easy to see now.

728
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:37,560
Obviously, there's this other pathway, right? But at the time, you just didn't you didn't realize or didn't understand.

729
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:42,810
And so it's really difficult and expensive to show that a surrogate outcome works.

730
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:51,000
But as we can see. Right, the surrogates are actually really helpful in clinical trials because it allows the trials to be smaller, faster.

731
01:16:51,330 --> 01:17:01,260
And so we really want to try to get good surrogates. Validating surrogate outcomes assumes that it will be suitable for future therapies.

732
01:17:01,260 --> 01:17:06,239
And as some of those examples showed, that surrogates can be very specific to treatments.

733
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:09,810
And so once treatments change, you probably shouldn't.

734
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:18,960
You probably have to revalidate that surrogate. So for example, if we decided that PCR was a good surrogate for overall survival for chemotherapies,

735
01:17:19,170 --> 01:17:22,470
and now all of a sudden we're using all these immunotherapies on patients,

736
01:17:22,770 --> 01:17:29,220
we need to go back and validate PCR as a surrogate for overall survival in the setting with this specific type of treatment.

737
01:17:30,330 --> 01:17:39,510
And so the we have to be you know, it's basically like an ongoing problem that as treatments evolve, right.

738
01:17:39,510 --> 01:17:43,800
Surrogates, what we thought were good surrogates may now not be good surrogates.

739
01:17:44,670 --> 01:17:51,000
And so this is an interesting topic, both scientifically as well as statistically to try to figure out,

740
01:17:51,270 --> 01:17:55,440
you know, so what do we decide is a good enough surrogate right to move forward with?

741
01:17:55,710 --> 01:18:00,450
And then once we find that, how long do we actually get to keep it? All right.

742
01:18:02,610 --> 01:18:08,579
And then again, just like, right. We usually do this meta analysis approach where we even if we see individual level surrogacy,

743
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:13,800
we have to we want to try to validate through analytic trial level surrogacy.

744
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:23,910
And then we have to use both the stat analysis, plus some informed medical judgment to show to say that this is really in the causal pathway.

745
01:18:28,010 --> 01:18:33,410
And essentially, while they could be really useful there, we shouldn't rely on them in phase three, right?

746
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:37,520
Where we need those actual clinical outcomes and maybe even in phase two,

747
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:42,379
we shouldn't use them unless because it's so easy to not have good surrogates.

748
01:18:42,380 --> 01:18:48,230
Right? We should only use them unless it's really limited limiting to use them for real clinical.

749
01:18:50,490 --> 01:18:54,120
Okay. That's the end of this one. Right on time.

750
01:18:56,010 --> 01:19:03,930
Next week we will continue with protocol deviations, which is kind of boring, to be honest, but it's really important.

751
01:19:03,930 --> 01:19:11,430
And then the exciting one of factors science and again, remember, those suggested readings are interesting, so please do them.

752
01:19:12,210 --> 01:19:15,570
I love you next week. Have a good day.

753
01:19:15,570 --> 01:19:28,100
And Friday. It was recently.

754
01:19:29,330 --> 01:19:39,320
If you didn't get your test. I have your tests, but my guess is that you are too soon to tell and these people are going wherever.

755
01:19:40,380 --> 01:19:47,340
I've got two spots so I can either walk here other.

756
01:19:49,460 --> 01:19:54,850
I wish we could meet on worry always to.

757
01:19:58,820 --> 01:20:02,750
Now you can e-mail me about that. I didn't see. I do.

758
01:20:03,030 --> 01:20:06,080
Okay. Oh.

759
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:10,570
It's not today's. You know what? She wants my sight.

760
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:22,129
I don't care. I'll try not using technology every time I think I should.

761
01:20:22,130 --> 01:20:25,700
Like, just think about when they're interesting conversations.

762
01:20:25,990 --> 01:20:30,930
I think that's maybe that's why I care.

763
01:20:31,340 --> 01:20:37,460
But usually, I mean, I guess, you know, if you're not a writer.

764
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:51,970
So you're saying that you're trying to say that.

765
01:20:52,050 --> 01:20:56,310
Yes. Want lots of you and you are.

766
01:20:56,490 --> 01:21:01,370
I mean, I don't you know that sometimes.

767
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:06,630
I think you do. Yeah.

768
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:16,370
What about that? Yeah.

769
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:29,000
Yeah, I already knew about it, right?

770
01:21:32,030 --> 01:21:36,950
Oh, yeah. Put it this way. And that's nice.

771
01:21:37,340 --> 01:21:44,480
Yeah, I really. I'm. I am doing a good job, though.

772
01:21:48,110 --> 01:21:54,510
Yes, I know. You know the fight between me like I've got now, what's going on?

773
01:21:54,540 --> 01:22:08,580
And regardless of your most that you should consider or no know, this is very difficult to understand earlier on.

774
01:22:08,820 --> 01:22:12,960
I still don't know. It's true. Yes, they do.

775
01:22:13,050 --> 01:22:18,600
However, they might not have. So I would just like the optimal way to do it is to run a trial.

776
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:22,770
Where you ready to go? Regular homicides there.

777
01:22:22,950 --> 01:22:31,450
So this is a bear. Looks like he tonight is going to basically he does not want to get released, just might not be able to collect it on the weekend.

778
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:38,850
Or we could just use the word also clenbuterol. Right.

779
01:22:40,180 --> 01:22:43,520
Yeah. We tend we do nice.

780
01:22:43,890 --> 01:22:47,800
Three, 4 hours. Yeah. That actually.

781
01:22:47,830 --> 01:22:53,170
And then hopefully we could. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Like that.

782
01:22:53,630 --> 01:22:57,510
Yeah. I mean, that is what like that trial. It ended early, right?

783
01:22:57,510 --> 01:23:04,590
It stopped for utility. And you need to you don't have to have like to find like a car on Saturdays.

784
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:09,900
Data monitors all questions so you can stop the trial. And so we tried to say like, oh, my God, it was nice.

785
01:23:11,190 --> 01:23:18,650
Yeah. But my feeling is like the dogs are going to be doing only once.

786
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:21,710
You said. Yeah, I thought, like we were like.

787
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:31,890
Well, like, on your own. We should. We should, like, turn out in the slides.

788
01:23:31,890 --> 01:23:41,050
Is that like or it's you know, we're surrounded up in the corner where you're walking around your house is massively good at various bars.

789
01:23:42,150 --> 01:23:51,540
And we got. So that's why you said you want to be objective. I heard you say, I don't know.

790
01:23:51,630 --> 01:23:54,930
I don't know. I don't know the numbers. I don't think it's common, but something happens.

791
01:23:55,620 --> 01:24:06,449
Me Well, you know, we just say to you and you have it and then it's not like are are you like we're heading that because we

792
01:24:06,450 --> 01:24:16,890
could do later through that split the difference so yeah all right 11 hours makes the world does it does.

793
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:20,100
I'm going to what do you do in January?

794
01:24:20,370 --> 01:24:23,430
I'm a stay until it will walk over to Bill's.

795
01:24:24,570 --> 01:24:31,100
I think I'm going to step back for that. Okay. On my way to get pizza to stay for that long but I'm is.

796
01:24:31,110 --> 01:24:34,920
Yeah, I'm basically going to stay in. Where are you going?

797
01:24:36,510 --> 01:24:41,070
I'm going to go to office hours for this class and then study.

798
01:24:42,330 --> 01:24:45,910
Absolutely. For this class that she wasn't married.

799
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:50,530
They were at two in the morning. They were? Yeah.

800
01:24:50,710 --> 01:24:53,870
They were there on time in my calendar. Yeah, I was there.

801
01:24:53,910 --> 01:24:57,610
Yeah. This class. Yeah. Kelly.

802
01:24:57,970 --> 01:25:05,980
Yeah. You know, I put, like 4 p.m. in my calendar or, you know, all that, and it's going to be another summer.

803
01:25:06,860 --> 01:25:10,040
Yeah, I'm pregnant or something. I guess I'm not.

804
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:17,510
I don't even need this. Then I'll stay for a bit if you wanna just hear that, actually.

805
01:25:17,660 --> 01:25:22,370
What? Where are you guys? What do you guys work? I'm going to work on eight.

806
01:25:22,370 --> 01:25:26,140
Ten guys. Yeah, just random stuff separately.

807
01:25:26,450 --> 01:25:29,810
I'll stay because I was. Yeah. And then we go play basketball three.

808
01:25:30,050 --> 01:25:34,129
So. Yeah, we'll stay until. That's what he told me.

809
01:25:34,130 --> 01:25:39,320
When did I agree? His place. On the same day that we tell everybody round is this year.

810
01:25:39,710 --> 01:25:43,070
Yeah, that's so weird. Was it at the tailgate?

811
01:25:43,370 --> 01:25:46,460
Just a gyro either, bro. I was [INAUDIBLE] up now.

812
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:48,070
Okay. Right. That's what I'm saying. Now.

813
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:52,970
I remember suddenly I remember Sam mentioning something about tennis on the tailgate and me being like, Yeah, text me.

814
01:25:53,810 --> 01:25:57,210
Did he text? You know, I mean, text me last night was like, still important tomorrow.

815
01:25:57,350 --> 01:26:00,620
Say, what do you mean, like those last two days?

816
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:05,340
Yeah. Sorry, you got to think that. No, I thought I told him I was like.

817
01:26:05,420 --> 01:26:10,380
Didn't remember I was agreeing to that. But I, you know, when he didn't show up, he is bad.

818
01:26:11,540 --> 01:26:14,840
What did you ask her about? And just some stuff for a project.

819
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:23,780
Oh, okay. Let me get you guys out of here, like not taking a break for lunch instead of Labor Day.

820
01:26:24,170 --> 01:26:27,500
Yeah, I might bring lunch or whatever. Yeah, yeah.

821
01:26:28,310 --> 01:26:32,670
Andre over here, though, he's probably, like, perfect, perfect opportunity to work until three.

822
01:26:32,670 --> 01:26:37,190
You get a good letter. Who needs to, like, a dude on a date?

823
01:26:37,190 --> 01:26:45,000
That's crazy to me. The. I don't eat lemons every day.

824
01:26:45,970 --> 01:27:00,580
Oh, I got to go to the bathroom, so let me know where you. And so he or she.

825
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:18,350
There was a shooting. And you can get to those things when I tell you.

826
01:28:20,150 --> 01:28:25,570
Will Kelly although some in attendance there had a good.

827
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:32,820
The rule is one way you. Your unions and.

828
01:28:48,410 --> 01:28:54,180
Thanks to. Since Spears.

829
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:12,010
To the. Six weeks.

830
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:33,690
Where it is and where to. Mothers with their.

831
01:29:35,820 --> 01:29:41,130
Severe. We're the. Good luck.

832
01:29:45,580 --> 01:29:52,350
So we're doing. I'm here to let them know.

833
01:29:52,370 --> 01:29:57,330
You looking for a post? And it kind of needs a clinical trial.
