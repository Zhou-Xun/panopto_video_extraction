00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:08,500
Sorry. The slides should be posted. Now, sometimes there's a delay between when I click first to post and then actually post.

2
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:13,200
I might have escaped out of there too soon. Can everybody see it and have access to the site?

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:19,760
Okay. Yes, sorry about that. Okay.

4
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:29,670
All right. How are you guys doing? Did you have a good break today from anywhere?

5
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:38,040
All right. Basically, you don't break. Well, hopefully it was still nice not to be in class.

6
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:46,350
A couple of things I know. Let's take a look at our assignments.

7
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:50,430
Let's see how many people look at our calendar.

8
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:59,940
So we have the exam next week, Tuesday for the case study.

9
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:04,650
I was I was going to change the due date just to give you guys some some more time.

10
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:12,000
I don't know. When do you guys usually do, like, your homework? Do you do it on the weekends with, like, the end of day next Sunday?

11
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,350
Okay. So it would be.

12
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:22,399
Let's see. I don't want it to be like too stacked.

13
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,180
We start to get into more assignments coming up here.

14
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:30,920
So that would be like the 30th by the end of next Sunday.

15
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,180
Yeah. Okay. The following after the exam.

16
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:40,250
Okay. So try and get the case study in sometime over the weekend if possible.

17
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:47,660
That way you can just kind of focus on the exam and then we'll have a nice guest speaker on next week, Thursday,

18
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:56,780
and then we'll kind of move forward into our next kind of chunk of of conditions, starting with cardiovascular disease.

19
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:04,040
Okay. So I'll change that in canvas. Does anybody have any questions on anything so far?

20
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:09,469
Feeling okay? Like I said, we're more than halfway through.

21
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:17,060
We I feel like we are. All right, so let's wrap up our Chai series today.

22
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:24,350
Hopefully, we're able to watch the videos and the disease process and we'll talk more about it.
