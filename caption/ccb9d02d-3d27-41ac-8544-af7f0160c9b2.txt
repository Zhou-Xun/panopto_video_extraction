1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,480
Really budgeting, but more decision making based off the data. Okay.

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:07,110
Okay. Let's talk a little bit about that cost benefit analysis.

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,230
Did you do that? A little bit. Okay. Well, we'll just talk.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,030
There will be numbers. Yes, there will be numbers here.

5
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:21,300
The things that people should know. Pretty prepared to be entertained, I guess.

6
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:32,100
So we're going to start out with introductions. So I know who everybody is and I have a spreadsheet so I can talk about this stuff.

7
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:40,170
So your preferred name, where are you from? All right, so it's up there and write it all down so that remember.

8
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:52,430
I will sit and talk about it. So the first person I have on the list is that I can be 100 or Abbas.

9
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:58,460
Abbas looks very different. I'm from the metro Detroit area in Michigan.

10
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:06,310
I'm a second year. I'm a student that was in work.

11
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:10,350
Was very. McComb specifically.

12
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:19,460
Oh, yeah. But if you are moving to Richmond in your second year.

13
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:28,219
My undergrad degree was in statistics here at U of M. Types of work.

14
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:38,060
I've done quite a lot of things. My primary job has been as a research assistant for Dr. Rickman, so I've worked with him since 2018,

15
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:45,530
doing a wide variety of research projects in the mining industry, the solid waste industry, the informal electronic waste industry as well.

16
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:51,800
Specifically on noise exposure, some psychosocial factors, heavy metal exposure,

17
00:01:54,170 --> 00:02:02,450
primarily doing statistical analysis over some sampling, whatever we have to do, you know, in-person monitoring for the studies.

18
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:07,100
And then my ideal future job is I have no idea.

19
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:12,830
It's a mixture of I enjoy research. So I took that idea of being a professor.

20
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:24,650
I am also interested in working in a place like my offshore and I am also one of those two paths to make a government work.

21
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:38,260
Let's see. Andrew Scott. Nasty. Yeah, I said that, right?

22
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:43,030
Yeah, I guess. Yeah. I'm actually surprised when I'm high school and the poor.

23
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:48,459
Nobody can say my last name, but most people that I meet nowadays know how to pronounce it.

24
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:57,010
So many years of German class. Yeah, my preferred name is Andy if I hear Andrew.

25
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:08,500
I'm from Harlem, Michigan. Originally, I am a first year MPH age student.

26
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:15,310
I got my undergrad of B.S. in Health Sciences.

27
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:29,920
Past work that I've done. Um, I worked as a resident peer associate or a nurse's aide before, most recently is in construction as a superintendent.

28
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,580
Before that, I was also a laborer and an operator.

29
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:42,190
I've done some strength and conditioning internships and then my ideal future job,

30
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,030
I'm not particularly sure maybe consulting NIH or occupational health in general.

31
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:56,320
Um, yeah, that's part of it. Who's next?

32
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,210
Good morning. Did the two brave people. I'll go next.

33
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:06,580
My name's Steven. You're next. Your next afternoon. Oh, my name's David.

34
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,790
I'm from Boston, Massachusetts. Torso mass action.

35
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:13,960
Something that they know. David O.

36
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:19,960
DAVIES. Yeah. My undergrad degree is in bio psychology and cognition in neuroscience.

37
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:25,390
I was confused at first what you were doing on the second shift.

38
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:29,320
Okay, I go through that because I got by or something.

39
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:35,080
So I in Michigan they call it speaking, but it's bio psychology, cognition and neuroscience.

40
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:44,830
I've worked the past four years as a consultant for large biotech and pharma companies in the US.

41
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:51,159
Specifically, in my ideal future job, I'd like to own my own age consulting firm.

42
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,640
Someday I'll come work for you. Yeah.

43
00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:02,790
Okay. My husband's from Massachusetts.

44
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:07,500
I've been where he's from. Selfridge is near Sturbridge.

45
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:11,950
Okay, cool. Worcester County. Yep. Metro was still there all the time.

46
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:16,540
Went to Boston. Mm. Nice. Yes.

47
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,160
And you were next? Yeah. All right. Hi. My name is Kyra.

48
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:26,740
I'm from second on Michigan. Busy, Kyra? Yes, it's good.

49
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:31,679
Now consider Michigan. I am a second year.

50
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:45,759
I age as well. Well, my undergrad degree was in public health and computer science and the types of work I've done on the Internet places.

51
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:50,680
I haven't really been out of school yet, but I recently worked in pharmaceuticals before that consulting.

52
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,670
Before that, the Detroit Health Department. The City of Detroit.

53
00:05:55,690 --> 00:06:01,150
Yeah. Oh, excitement for that one. And then for an ideal future job.

54
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,860
Sure. Yeah. But I'm thinking tech. Just like a tie in the countryside and public health together.

55
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:09,930
And see where I go from there. Okay, but that could change Texas Tech.

56
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:13,220
Something would say to the public.

57
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:29,280
I can go. I am remaining. I am from our boy.

58
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,170
Sometimes I think if I put you down by your first name.

59
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:42,990
So I go there. I'm from northern California like 45 minutes east of San Francisco.

60
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,560
I am a second year student as well.

61
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:57,840
My undergrad I did at UCLA and I have a B.S. in human anatomy and physiology types of work I've done.

62
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:02,370
My resume is not super consistent.

63
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,300
So I worked in a cadaver laboratory for a while.

64
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:11,430
I worked as a student athletic trainer with some of our D1 teams.

65
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:15,899
I've worked as an English teacher in Spain.

66
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:26,670
I worked on a farm, and most recently I worked as a research assistant in Thailand doing some of the pesticide exposure sampling and stuff,

67
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:35,459
and ideally for a future job, kind of like everyone else is saying, I don't really know and I don't have one lined up right now,

68
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:39,420
but I would love to work in the agricultural sector in some capacity,

69
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:45,899
just trying to do food safety enforcement and also try to minimize pesticide exposures and things like that,

70
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:53,490
and then maybe even try to participate in a push towards more organic agriculture and smaller scale farming and things like that.

71
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,850
So I live in Spain and two different kinds of chemicals, very different kinds of places.

72
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,620
Great angle.

73
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:10,829
I'm Christine Romans. So you just come, Christina. I'm from Orange County, California.

74
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:15,030
So Southern California area. I'm in between L.A. and San Diego.

75
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:19,200
Okay. I am a second year in the outreach program as well.

76
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:23,969
I attended the University of Redlands in Redlands, California,

77
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:31,290
with my B.S. and environmental science and the types of work I've done, kind of similar to Kyra.

78
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:37,799
I've done a lot of internships, but I've worked with a lot of I worked in the U.S. system for a little bit for

79
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:43,950
internships in their biosafety department and also in R e just department.

80
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:49,170
So that was actually really interesting going through all the different labs and they offered different levels as well.

81
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:54,690
And then I've looked at some I've done a little bit of animal testing as well, worked in the labs there.

82
00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:00,210
And then I recently did my internship with Siemens Healthineers in L.A.

83
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,650
Oh, yeah, it was it was a really very interesting role as a company.

84
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:12,510
And then my ideal future job. I currently already have a job lined up, but it's I don't think it's necessarily ideal.

85
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:20,460
I'd want to work more for a private company or work potentially with the military.

86
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:28,190
And I h well, I work for the Air Force.

87
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:32,880
Yep, yep. Yes. They actually require a master's.

88
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:36,450
Unlike Army, they require associate. No, no.

89
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:47,910
Yeah. It's kind of interesting. They call it bio bio environmental engineering, what they call it, which is not years ago.

90
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:51,300
That is that was just was the name for it.

91
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,980
So that was the department,

92
00:09:52,980 --> 00:10:00,900
but it was actually the industrial hygiene department and bio environmental engineering turned off into a completely different direction years later.

93
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:10,020
So just because it was I did that is the next oh no, my name is Rachel.

94
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:14,220
I am from Michigan or Metro Detroit area.

95
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:20,220
I am the second year in the whole your health education department of the School of Public Health.

96
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:31,469
I got my undergrad at Eastern Michigan University in Public Health as well, and community health, education and the types of work I've done.

97
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:39,450
I've had a couple of internships in health promotion and also wellness, most recently in corporate wellness and Marathon Petroleum Corporation.

98
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:44,670
So that was really cool to tour the refinery and green facility.

99
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:53,190
And also just in general, their wellness is also tied in with their industrial hygiene department safety too.

100
00:10:53,190 --> 00:11:02,040
So I wanted to kind of expand upon my already built up wellness skillsets to make myself more marketable to those types of industries.

101
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:09,119
And also I am genuinely interested in environment in general and I had very limited exposure throughout my degree.

102
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:16,770
But like in my undergrad we had one assignment class, so we went to a waste water and drinking water facility, treatment plant, which doesn't go.

103
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:22,000
Really cool. So, yeah, I did a little bit with your future job.

104
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:31,950
Um, ideally at this point I would say corporate wellness, but I think I can probably be flexible with where I end up with that.

105
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:36,480
I'm hoping that probably private industry or I was looking also at the government as well as and of course,

106
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:42,940
one of the a lot of places are the safest part is becoming one's partner.

107
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:49,360
Right. But only little jobs are going to take over. So. We'll talk about that a little bit.

108
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:55,139
To see the new things that happen to us become a catch, all safety becomes like this.

109
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:58,500
Oh, so this is next.

110
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:04,410
Thank you. Hi. My name is Hayley Smith.

111
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:09,840
I'm from Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania, which is a small town.

112
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,990
It's about 2 hours north of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

113
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:17,460
I am a first year student in the program as well.

114
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:29,280
And I graduated from Penn State there with a bachelor's degree in Biobehavioral Health and some types of work that I've done.

115
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,470
I did internships in health promotion and health education during my undergrad,

116
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:40,710
but I also worked in health care for a little bit as a just a patient care technician at a hospital.

117
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:46,170
And for my ideal future job, I also am not completely sure right now,

118
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:55,680
but just in the field of industrial hygiene and just trying to keep my options open and keeping up in line with what kind of feel I've been.

119
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:15,080
There's a charge here. Let's see, I guess some common names in Mr. Sturgis and from Georgia.

120
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:20,580
In Michigan, just like in Port Huron, Michigan, for some reason.

121
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,020
My first year in the Ice Age program,

122
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:39,060
and I got my degree in public health from here and been doing research for a few years and doing research with the faculty here,

123
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:52,769
as I've done some school teaching in the past couple of years, but certainly not given my ideal job somewhere in the field.

124
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:58,520
And I realize you're not sure yet, somewhere in the industry for graduation.

125
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:07,380
Justin Bieber weddings. Jason, go look.

126
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:14,090
My preferred name is Jason. Go back, women.

127
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:22,760
Yeah, I'm from Royal Oak, Michigan.

128
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:28,520
I'm a second year master's of public health student in industrial hygiene.

129
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:35,750
My undergraduate degree was Community of Global Health here at the University of Michigan.

130
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:49,520
I worked at a bagel shop. And but I've also done industrial hygiene work for a consulting company and for my ideal for future job.

131
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:57,290
I think about things, so I wouldn't mind going back there.

132
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:04,070
Yeah, I suppose that's why I'm glad. And I want a job that pays me good money.

133
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:11,080
There you go. If we're busy this. Come on, let's see how this goes when that happens.

134
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:14,770
Well, when that pays a lot, that. No, that's not enough.

135
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:21,440
All right. Do I have Nicole? Hi, I'm Nicole Seiler.

136
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:27,440
I'm originally from Middle Michigan, and I'm a first year I interested in as well.

137
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:31,700
I got my undergrad in occupation pretty soon.

138
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:40,820
Midland. Midland? Yeah. It's like 2 hours on the prairie, but I got my undergrad in Occupational Safety and Health Management.

139
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:47,479
Okay, um, and then types of work I've done, I've done mostly internships, but for good jobs,

140
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:55,100
internships for in the electric car battery manufacturing industry and also the like soybean oil refinery.

141
00:15:55,790 --> 00:16:05,179
Um, and then I also, my most recent one was, I was the H intern for a mine and then my ideal future job was pretty much anything.

142
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,110
Industrial hygiene.

143
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:17,760
Um, yeah, I'm plus one industry type, but I just love I want to do that full time for a lot of the person that's there and I don't think so.

144
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:22,550
Okay. Right. Okay, cool.

145
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:27,500
Yeah. So lots of different person things interesting that most of you are from Michigan.

146
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:35,840
One or two people who are not. But the last time I taught was during college, so everybody went home.

147
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:41,690
So I have people all over the country in my class trying to schedule stuff was really a exciting thing.

148
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:46,250
So it's interesting that he's from Michigan. That's cool.

149
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:55,180
All right. Well, welcome, everybody. Or suggestions that you only read the slides, but I'm going to do a little bit more.

150
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:59,930
This is different teaching that I've done before. I usually have to do some all this stuff.

151
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:04,010
So and I feel allies are open. So we are being recorded.

152
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:10,209
So we want to understand the system's approach to occupational health and safety management.

153
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:13,000
And that's that's really the goal of this.

154
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:22,810
In the past, the process has been mostly that you talk about policies, procedures, rules, regulations, that kind of stuff.

155
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,400
And within the Safety Department that the State Department tried to hold everything,

156
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:33,100
that's that whole approach has changed over the last few years, and that's kind of where we're headed from.

157
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:38,050
So we talked about that. Now what the components of an OHSU management program need to be.

158
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,440
There are certain things that you have to have, you have to have,

159
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:51,819
you have to have a policy for one thing, you have to have has analysis, risk management processes.

160
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:57,190
You have to know what your business is, what your industry is, but you also need to know what are your organizations like that you're working with?

161
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:01,420
Because if you don't understand the organization, you're not going to be able to do anything.

162
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:07,360
And then we're going to talk about some of the common tools and techniques essential to implement and sustain a successful system.

163
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,049
And these are things that most people know about.

164
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:14,170
You've probably taken them already, but we'll talk about some things.

165
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:18,760
I agree. I bring the field knowledge. So I've been I've been doing this for 30 years.

166
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:23,170
So some things are really good on paper, but they don't work so well when you actually have to go do them.

167
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:28,810
And other times, you know, great techniques come out and you say that, well, I'll take that and we'll work on it.

168
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:34,180
So those are our course objectives at some point in time. So if you ask about insecure, they are.

169
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:40,700
I was talking a little bit about the ground rules. Already talked about for suggestions.

170
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:44,629
I guess I got ahead of myself. So highlights of the syllabus which I posted.

171
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:50,690
So you can read all three pages of it. But I guess you the stuff that I really wanted to pay attention to right away.

172
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:59,450
So I want you to attend all the classes we are reporting so you can watch stuff at home afterwards.

173
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:06,469
But really I was talking to each other about our different experiences and our points of view are is part of the class.

174
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:10,280
So really what are we to to attend? If you are going to be here, please let me know.

175
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,900
That way, I don't think something happened to you being winter in Michigan.

176
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:21,709
I don't know. Somebody is upside down in a ditch somewhere, but don't show up. Can you talk about accommodations?

177
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:25,820
If you have one, let me know or what I will need to work out.

178
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:30,050
I would participate actively in discussion. So I want everybody to talk.

179
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:36,220
Well. So you get graded on the talking part. And again, we we are going to learn from each other.

180
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:39,310
And you're going to as you go off into life and you work in safety,

181
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:45,880
you'll find that the other people that you talk to are the people that really help you in your in your job and in doing your work,

182
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,280
really to trying devices, silencing or turning off phones, which I didn't do mine.

183
00:19:52,570 --> 00:20:01,570
I will do that this minute. Maybe if I find it doesn't do anything to get to it.

184
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:10,030
There we go. No, it will not bother me. If you didn't take it.

185
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:14,770
Urgent call or text. Go ahead. Step out. That's fine. No email or browsing in class.

186
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:21,969
I don't know what you're doing, but you do things that are constructive, courteous, communicative construction,

187
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:26,940
which are, you know, you guys are all kind of doing that anyway and having fun because the perfect thing was walking.

188
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:31,890
I like to make it like it's not too much of a grind, but it will be numbers, as I said.

189
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:35,560
So don't get too frightened. All right. Great plan.

190
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,610
So individual assignments, 20% midterm, there'll be a midterm in about seventh week.

191
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:51,910
Maybe when we get through the core classes, the core concepts, our class participation is 5%, which I think is worth your while.

192
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:58,450
And you're going to get a wonderful final project at the for 40% of your grade, which you'll notice there's no final test.

193
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:07,630
So that's a gift I think I from post office hours are by appointment.

194
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:13,870
There's my contact information and if you call me, it doesn't know your phone, it just sends you away.

195
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:17,440
So leave a message. I have a real person.

196
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,760
I have a weather policy since it is winter here in Michigan.

197
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:27,720
This today was like not for those of you who are not from Michigan, Michigan, this is terrible.

198
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:35,110
So global warming, you know, 5050 bad weather is a zoom.

199
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:44,139
It will be by zoom. So we'll we'll still meet if they shut the school down and it gets really cold or whatever, we'll still be by zoom at all.

200
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:47,920
You know, the night before the morning of you know, it's I'm in, I'm up in no way.

201
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:53,889
So if I feel like I'm going to risk my life either going or getting back or you'll risk your lives as well,

202
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:58,180
then we'll just stay home and go over the phone or the computer.

203
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:04,270
And if you prefer me to let you know about a text message, let me give you your number and I will text you.

204
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:11,500
Otherwise it'll be an email probably through canvas. So the question so far.

205
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:21,430
All right. So we're in talk about the multiverse of all OHSU professional so our role in the organization.

206
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:28,330
And this thing is going through all of the slides. It's not supposed to, but it is, so I'm just going to go with it.

207
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:37,980
Next week we might do something different. But what we have is we'll talk about organizational charts, especially in preparation.

208
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:44,850
What we are is we're staff position versus the one position. So line position, there are people actually touching things.

209
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:48,720
They're actually doing the work. And most organizations are set up.

210
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:55,260
They go from the line and they work their way up. And when you look at where safety is, that is usually kind of off to the side somewhere.

211
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:59,100
And you're working with h.r. And legal and quality.

212
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,930
Usually we're at least above quality, but we're not.

213
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:07,470
We're a people doing the work. We're at the people in charge of the work.

214
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:13,350
We're having to work through other people and kind of monitor that kind of system.

215
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:19,680
We're a member of management. We're an advisor to management, but we also protect the worker.

216
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:30,120
And so we said in both worlds of being on the employee side and big on the management side, which can be kind of a tightrope as we have here,

217
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,750
because sometimes, especially if you're in different types of environments, you know, union environments.

218
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:44,720
Multicultural environments, multi international environments that can be very difficult and you end up

219
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,760
having to kind of learn what the management is because it can just make things

220
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:55,790
frustrating for everybody if you're not really keyed into some of the assumptions

221
00:23:55,790 --> 00:24:00,260
that come along with all that and at times for the conscious of the organization,

222
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:07,880
we have to tell people, Hey, this is wrong, we don't agree with it. They may still do it, but we are on record as saying we thought it was bad idea.

223
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:15,620
I told you so. When everything falls apart and sometimes that can put you in kind of an uncomfortable position or actually endanger your job.

224
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:19,520
So. So our role is a kind of weird one.

225
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:22,639
We're not in most places. Most jobs are not like that.

226
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:27,290
So all the different that's what we do.

227
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:33,530
We have lots of things we do. A lot of you have done some of these things, tires me out to look at all this stuff.

228
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:36,589
But occupational health.

229
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:40,790
And one of the things to know about is what we call our occupational health and environmental safety,

230
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:51,050
is that occupational health is the way the man has many different things is that most places don't just hire industrial charges,

231
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:55,219
they're hiring safety professionals. And they and that will be a job.

232
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:58,250
You'll see you'll see some sort of separate safety representative, whatever.

233
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:02,239
And it will specialize potentially in industrial hygiene.

234
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:08,720
But you typically are not hired for that unless you're going into a consulting position and they want you to be an industrial prejudice.

235
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:13,400
The federal government does have still does have their industrial hygiene classification,

236
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:18,170
but typically they're those people are being rolled into occupational safety.

237
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:24,620
And as a industrial hygiene issue, although those you get hazardous material exposures, biologicals, PPE,

238
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:31,280
ergonomics, all kinds of stuff, general safety brings you into construction, fire safety, occupational safety.

239
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:36,230
You could do all that. You do a piece of that. They go to a smaller company for you, the whole ball of wax.

240
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:41,360
We just don't know. Risk management is another place a lot of people in safety go to,

241
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,650
and that has to do with worker's compensation, return to work programs and things like that.

242
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:51,979
A lot of people will spend they have a stint in in risk management.

243
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:55,580
And so a company that's also taking that person's job.

244
00:25:56,660 --> 00:26:00,680
In the engineering side, you may not be engineers, but you will be when you're done.

245
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:07,940
These are part of an injury because facilities are are the protective part of where people work.

246
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:13,160
So I think about ventilation and eye washes and things like that.

247
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:19,910
People that type of thing, that how that facility functions and how it protects people is, is a safety responsibility.

248
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:22,610
So there's processes that are going on.

249
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:30,020
People are piping nasty things all the way through the through the ceilings of the work that's of coatings and steel and all that kind of stuff.

250
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:39,840
So the project, a process called System Safety, is integrated good classes in that they teach it over at the Industrial Operations Engineering Group.

251
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,850
But system safety is a type of analysis. Thank you work. We'll talk a little bit about that.

252
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:49,310
And then there's product safety and then you can be hired by companies and all you do is look at the safety of the product.

253
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:55,250
People are, you know, are they know those little disclaimers that are on things that say,

254
00:26:55,340 --> 00:27:01,280
you know, don't use this radio wire in the bathtub, you know, part that's legal also for safety.

255
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:07,130
So that's simple things that people can get involved with. If you're in health physics, you're going to do radiation safety.

256
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:11,210
Those are people that typically are going to work in hospitals with radiation safety,

257
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,930
or they do a lot of stuff around nuclear physics, things like that.

258
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:20,780
But there's also all kinds of other things that use radiation that you wouldn't be surprised to know about.

259
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:26,419
But that's one of the things that usually that position is also an occupational health and safety possession issue.

260
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:31,670
So radiation safety specialist, sleep safety is another one and that's transportation.

261
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:35,540
So truck drivers, people that do transportation, logistics, that kind of thing,

262
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:43,640
they are safety people because that's part of the the rules of the their licenses is that how many hours are they working?

263
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:48,500
What's their health like? You have to monitor all kinds of things about them. Environmental management.

264
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:53,750
We'll talk. That's not really the E over here, but that's really another piece of safety.

265
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:59,629
And that is one of those things where when the environmental manager came on, they said, where should we put this?

266
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:03,050
Oh, the safety people do a lot of stuff with regulations. Let's put it over there.

267
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:07,969
It's completely different. But we'll talk about some of the stuff that you may be involved in.

268
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:14,300
A lot of the stuff, groundwater testing for age people do that you're doing indoor air quality testing.

269
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:24,980
Sometimes the type of testing for the combustion products and things like that will be done by IHS usually consulting firm comes in and does those,

270
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:28,460
but you can do that. Hazardous waste management.

271
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:38,480
A lot of people that I know, most of the people I know that do houses with measure the amount of age will actually a biological waste is another one.

272
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:41,930
There's another H position and the underground way.

273
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:46,110
So oh gosh, where would I do that? Oh, my gosh.

274
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:53,040
That was I never notice these things until it's now very interesting.

275
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:59,899
It's funny, though, after remember that when I maybe I'll leave it in this kind of cuz and they'll also talk about emergency management.

276
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:04,850
So emergency planning and recovery is, is usually part of the Safety Department.

277
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:10,410
Yeah, workers industries. But we talked a lot about a lot of them.

278
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,190
Construction safety was a huge, huge part of the industry.

279
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:17,610
Insurance, manufacturing, of course. Health care. That's right.

280
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:24,840
That's where I came from here. I worked for 17 years for the Michigan Medicine in the Environmental Health Safety Group.

281
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:29,790
And there's all kinds of other places in health care that people work research.

282
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:33,540
As we talked about, there's a lot of people in the research, transportation government.

283
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,680
The government is one of the largest employers of safety people.

284
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:41,070
When you look at the government as a whole, oh my gosh,

285
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:48,120
the state plans there's a lot of times the counties have safety people, all of the various groups.

286
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:50,880
There's a lot of different people that work for different levels of government.

287
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:55,800
Pharmaceuticals is huge because of the chemical hazards that they have all day.

288
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:59,759
Somebody said they were in pharmaceuticals, whatever.

289
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:05,700
Nasty stuff. Nasty stuff. The eye of Newt, boiling toads and stuff.

290
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:10,560
We're all places right there.

291
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,240
You go into some of the rooms, it's like, oh, oh, terrible.

292
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:16,830
Higher education.

293
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:24,750
So a lot of universities we have the Michigan has the environmental they're called the NHS as well, Environmental, Health and Safety Group.

294
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,850
Most universities have something like that. Most hospitals, big hospitals have a group like that.

295
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:36,090
Utility and energy is another one. So oil and gas fires a tremendous amount of safety people.

296
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:45,420
Utilities do, especially in wastewater and in electrical because it's one hazards associated both of those.

297
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,940
But we talked about product design and development and there can be products that are consumer

298
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:55,320
products and can also be products that are done for or created for commercial purposes.

299
00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:00,240
Sustainability is another thing that work is thrown at is they want to be sustainable.

300
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:08,489
So a lot of the things that we do in safety have to do with these are disposable gloves.

301
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:13,910
One time, throw away the gallon, one time throw it away that it won't do that anymore.

302
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:21,120
So how do we do that? I've spent a lot of time during COVID on how to make a 95 mass last forever.

303
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:28,530
So that was kind of a sustainable thing. Public safety is another one that's different than occupational safety.

304
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:35,100
So public safety has to do with the cops. So they are doing with law enforcement, typically security type of work,

305
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:44,280
but usually the State Department works very closely with those folks and any kind of facility and they hire their own people because they,

306
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:48,989
of course, have a lot of hazards. You know, they are dealing with behavioral problems with people.

307
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:57,059
They're dealing with physical work that they have to do extraction, mining, metal mining, mineral industry.

308
00:31:57,060 --> 00:32:06,299
So a lot of safety people work in that area. Processing, which is basically if your structure two verticals,

309
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:11,130
a hamburger or you're doing different types of chemical work, that's processing industries.

310
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:16,229
There's quite a few safety people there. There's a lot of people who do the food safety side.

311
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:22,290
There's people who do different types of testing at different levels. And a lot of times their background is industrial hygiene and safety.

312
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:26,460
But that's really not the work that they're doing. The science behind that is what they're using.

313
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:30,089
So that's another place that you may go is that your job?

314
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:34,740
May not say industrial hygiene is, but you're that background and that knowledge is what they're using.

315
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:41,220
Consulting services, which is always fun. Public health, which most of you all, you have that degree.

316
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:48,450
Aerospace and defense. A lot of people I talk about systems safety does a lot of stuff that they do there.

317
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:55,169
But there's still people because people are working, you know, the pilots are flying,

318
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:58,350
the airplanes are guys driving the tanks with people doing all that kind of stuff.

319
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:04,770
They have a lot of safety people. They don't military doesn't want to get killed until it's useful to them.

320
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:10,530
So they would rather you don't do it on your own. So there's a lot of safety people in that area.

321
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:18,030
There's a lot of maintenance activities that they do that really well, especially aircraft.

322
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:22,980
And so the system they work in and we'll talk about that. But where they these are quite a few things.

323
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:26,730
And last but not least, is chemicals as opposed to pharmaceuticals,

324
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:33,570
another area where there's constant testing, monitoring, recordkeeping and all that kind of stuff.

325
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:41,319
Yes. Can we hear about your background? Yes, you will hear about my background as well as the highlights.

326
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:47,610
That is the highlight of our class here. But we got to do all this other stuff first.

327
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:57,270
That way you'll feel teachers shindo. So some of the departments, they have all the density responsibilities of operations and maintenance.

328
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:03,090
And these are people who have responsibility, but not necessarily our safety people.

329
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:04,799
Okay. They're responsible.

330
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:12,690
So operations people on the ground touching things that they're maintaining staff if people make it to work, if you're producing things.

331
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:16,140
You know, they're they're responsible.

332
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:22,650
If you're looking at if you look at a manufacturing line, aeronautics and things like that, they're depending on the people that are doing the work.

333
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,460
Risk management, which is insurance and that kind of thing.

334
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:38,890
Occupational medicine, those those folks are what they call the the physician of record for the company or something.

335
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:42,300
Our condition is a lot of times because they're seeing the injuries come in.

336
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:48,180
So there there will be a lot of times involved in doing some mitigations for that.

337
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:54,480
Architecture, engineering and construction is the people who bring the buildings, the roads, the commodes, all that good stuff.

338
00:34:54,900 --> 00:35:00,390
They have a huge piece of safety. And we'll talk about that because sometimes they don't realize how big of a piece of safety they really have.

339
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:04,379
You have to educate them on security and public safety.

340
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:10,740
As we talked about regulatory affairs, which is basically ocean y, ocean type of people, the legal office.

341
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:13,470
So lawyers hire safety people all the time.

342
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:19,199
There's a whole legal process that goes along with, if you get hurt, the worker's compensation to pay for it.

343
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:26,040
There's all kinds of stuff that happen. They do a lot of a lot of they hire will hire people to be witnesses.

344
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:30,150
So a lot of safety. People do that as a part of their consulting practice.

345
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:35,360
But facilities are building services is a bespoke maintenance that's so much in that way.

346
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:39,200
But this the people are out there washing the windows. So think about it.

347
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:43,350
There's people that watch the windows, the cardiovascular center, five storeys up off the ground.

348
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:47,340
There's people that might that is 13 stories in there.

349
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:51,940
There's two window washers out there. So those guys are hanging by ropes and cables.

350
00:35:52,680 --> 00:36:00,480
So they're there. That building serves as the contract and how we hire people to do that, but that's what they do.

351
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:06,450
So there's a lot of things like that that go on around a building that you don't really think about, who plays the decks,

352
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:14,130
who keeps the water pipes in good shape, who who has to pull that card out of the sewer, you know, that kind of stuff.

353
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:18,620
Human resource is another place that that safety people to end up sometimes.

354
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:22,440
And last but not least a lot of them work at the Environmental Health and Safety Department of your company.

355
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:30,750
That's kind of interesting as you go around where people always come and say, well, you know, he's a safety person.

356
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:39,330
So. Yes. So have you seen companies kind of like move away from having occupational medicine folks like on the books?

357
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:45,960
Exactly. Kind of being moved to being outsourced or is it mostly it's outsourced?

358
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:51,540
Yeah, very few. The only place I've actually ever been that they were it was the hospital here that was outsourced.

359
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:54,959
And they and the campus runs their occupation.

360
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,790
Those are just as well the same for certain most places.

361
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:03,740
So they'll have they'll have somebody that they hire to do that, that that's not how things used to be, right, isn't it?

362
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:16,010
No. They used to hire their own people. And I guess really because like the first place I worked, they were the doctor.

363
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:19,799
There's two doctors and like two or three nurses and stuff and that's what they did.

364
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:29,880
And they, they also treated people there. And there was a lot of issues with that in that there's no incentive for them to actually identify problems.

365
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:34,170
It would have a very hard time and say they knew something was hurting people.

366
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,270
It was very difficult for them.

367
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:44,159
Is it by their practice they're supposed to be doing something about that and it made it very difficult for them to act that way.

368
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:49,080
So that's where the third party comes from and the risk management side, they want to see that third party.

369
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:55,740
The objective of who's doing okay. Yeah, there's there's a there's a whole universe over itself.

370
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:59,669
Is it cheaper to outsource? Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure it is.

371
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:04,020
It's a real contrast with, like, company where I used to work for.

372
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:14,340
We contracted with an Centra contract with Oakwood when they were around so that they would we would take our people that are at the urgent care.

373
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:18,300
And usually if you're setting up a program you want to,

374
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:24,570
you're going to identify your like you're going to Department of System Works department and things like that.

375
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:29,250
So we'll talk about that a little bit. And that's part of the program management piece.

376
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:34,350
We have to tell people where to go. And not to be outdone, we have the job response.

377
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:41,820
And this can be all one person. And I have even written down on stuff I've done when I think about it.

378
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:50,490
But you're going to be involved in a ton of different things, and we'll talk about most of the stuff as we were going through the class.

379
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:54,240
But when you look at people like purchasing, you think about purchasing and training.

380
00:38:56,490 --> 00:39:01,620
You don't want people to buy stuff that isn't going to work and especially ergonomics.

381
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:05,690
Right. And if they take it, the ergonomics classes. Yes. What do they do?

382
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:13,500
You want to sell something? I have an ergonomic bottle here. It's still better than any other bottle, but I do charge it 20% more for this thing.

383
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:19,400
And you do what you think it's going to do. You need to know about that.

384
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:25,020
You want to you want to buy desks and equipment, things that are not going to hurt people, get the chairs for them, that kind of stuff.

385
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:32,010
So purchasing can be a place you see people, environmental permitting, as you talked about with the and where we're talk,

386
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:36,480
we're talking about rural management, the permitting process to get involved in that.

387
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:43,440
Expert witnesses we talked about, I mentioned that a little bit. So designed air quality exposure termination, which is.

388
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:50,980
A lot of what you do is sometimes people think you're being exposed to something they're not really.

389
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:54,100
And other people don't think it's such a big deal. It's really bad.

390
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:59,590
And that's your job, is to figure out, like, where is that exactly of injury prevention?

391
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:05,290
That's that's really where we want to be as an injury prevention and diversity planning.

392
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:09,520
So that can be all of your job. You have you have more things than this.

393
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:15,730
I've even seen places where they threw quality on top of people.

394
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,450
So they get the Safety Department, they say, well, you can just do the quality stuff on top.

395
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:20,870
It's just to the side, you know.

396
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:29,140
So I mean, it's like you literally don't know what we do for a living if you're gonna think we're going to do quality, so you ask for it.

397
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:33,430
Here is why, Orangetheory? Why am I here?

398
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:38,710
You know what? You guys are here. Anybody from Utah have been to Utah?

399
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:43,870
Yeah. What part of Utah I went to.

400
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:50,380
Let's see. I can't exactly. I know I would want to say parks, but design.

401
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:53,500
Yes. Zion Canyon.

402
00:40:54,270 --> 00:41:00,729
Is this an electric discipline? Is Moab Canyon, Bryce Canyon.

403
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:04,360
And we actually just place the consultant into that.

404
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:08,830
Oh, you did it, Bryce Canyon. Oh, no, no kidding. Oh, like for the University of Utah.

405
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:14,440
Oh, did you really? Yeah. Oh, wow. So welcome to the forum.

406
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:19,100
Nobody else has been there. Salt Lake City yet. Oh, you've been there?

407
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:23,210
Even the airport. Where have you been? Yeah, it was a nice airport.

408
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:28,420
Airport? I've heard of Utah. You said you've been someplace.

409
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:33,760
Oh, yeah, I've been to Zion and Bryce, and then I just did a road trip across it.

410
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,930
So we stayed in really small town, so. Boy, this was not one of them.

411
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:41,440
No, no, Roy is small. You went through the middle here.

412
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:47,260
This is probably this is a is. And so I it was a little more so than so.

413
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:51,310
Yeah, I'm right out there. Gosh, it's like the edge of the border.

414
00:41:51,660 --> 00:42:00,610
Yeah. Well, so they didn't you, didn't you had just the for skiing or skiing were who goes there for skiing.

415
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:10,650
I mean I did I actually I from there, you know, my skiing stories are of legend.

416
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:18,160
So anyway, that's where I came from. Roy is right is I don't know. But they were Roy is up here, so I'm in northern Utah.

417
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:23,170
So it's none of the ski resorts out there. We used to have a lake.

418
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:27,430
It's drying up. We had another lake down here that's gone.

419
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:31,240
So pretty much this river doesn't work anymore. Nice place.

420
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:37,530
Anyway, we talked about environmental stuff. You told us not to place undue reliance, but they went.

421
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:43,060
That's right. They were there. So education.

422
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:49,240
So my husband was in the military, so we travel a lot. So that's how I got from here initially.

423
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:55,000
But I did go to I started out and we were stationed at Albuquerque, Kirtland Air Force Base.

424
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:01,120
So I started out in geology, the University of New Mexico part, what it's called the Hard Rock School.

425
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:06,550
So that was my went into a mine said never again.

426
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:15,610
And uh, but our major is geology and but our minor is automatically geological engineering because that at

427
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:19,360
the time was kind of an up and coming thing and they went there they go and all that good stuff.

428
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:29,320
And so I looked at the chances for jobs in geology, which are not that good, and decided that is most of an engineering degree.

429
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:34,360
So why don't I just do that? So that's what I did. So then I moved back up to Utah.

430
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:40,720
We went to where we were, stay for a little while, got some jobs in Ogden, and then we went to the University of Utah, was a graduate.

431
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:44,020
It took me a while to get somebody to graduate me, but they did.

432
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:51,880
You were less picky back then, so I was a chemical engineer by education I undergrads in mechanical engineering.

433
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:57,190
Um, I said after I left, I said, I'll never go back to school.

434
00:43:57,190 --> 00:44:06,520
And ten years later I got my graduate degree at the University of Tennessee, and I majored in industrial engineering and engineering management,

435
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:11,410
which in the engineering world that's like the MBA of the engineering world is engineering management.

436
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:18,730
So that was my educational background. I didn't and really I ended up doing other stuff.

437
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:24,880
I don't know why, but I did eventually made my way into the safety profession.

438
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:32,290
But I am a licensed engineer. I actually retired my license in Ohio, retire my license here in Michigan very shortly.

439
00:44:32,290 --> 00:44:44,350
But I was certified safety professional. I've been a member of the American Society of Depression for 20 some years, and that was a pretty hard test.

440
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,730
I didn't do the age because I said, I'm really done this time.

441
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:54,700
I didn't want to do it. So employment, it was not easy sometimes.

442
00:44:55,330 --> 00:44:59,830
Right after I graduated from University of Utah, I was an intern at a company called Hercules,

443
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:06,850
Inc. You guys are probably too young to remember the Hercules fabric, but everybody's heard of carbon fiber.

444
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:14,800
That's what they made. There was carbon fiber. They made rocket fuel. They started out as a as a originally the Backus work started out as a, uh,

445
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:20,500
they said a little white building that had the Hercules power company on it, and they made dynamite.

446
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:25,810
So a huge part of what we did at that plant was we made that glycerin, made rocket fuel,

447
00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:31,270
we wound the space shuttle engines, and we made all kinds of stuff for missiles and everything else.

448
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:35,830
And I worked on a program now called Ashland Chemical.

449
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:46,810
And then in Utah, if you ever heard of that chemical, Kennecott Copper Mine, huge giant open under open mine, it's like next door to that.

450
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,710
So it's pretty, pretty crazy place.

451
00:45:52,660 --> 00:46:00,310
But what I worked on there was we built a, um, a CAT scan machine for missiles.

452
00:46:00,850 --> 00:46:05,110
So this was a giant building about five stories tall, and they would bring a missile in.

453
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:09,280
It was a Navy one from a submarine,

454
00:46:10,330 --> 00:46:14,770
and they would roll it up and down and they would shoot it with radiation and

455
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:18,790
neutrons and try to figure out what's in the how the rocket would set up.

456
00:46:18,790 --> 00:46:23,169
Because you don't don't want holes in the rocket fuel. They still burn things and it goes, boom.

457
00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:28,810
We want you to know the exciting part about that was that here's the radiation coming this way.

458
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:33,670
The only on that side was a bunch of what we all said.

459
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:37,480
We aren't going to be in the state when they turn that thing on. But we lived.

460
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:42,070
My first real job was I was a airforce civilian. I worked at Francis.

461
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:45,760
We were an Air Force base in Cheyenne, Wyoming, and I've been to Wyoming.

462
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:52,320
Oh, you have? Where do you go? Well, uh, I went to Yellowstone and.

463
00:46:52,330 --> 00:47:01,600
Grandpa, that's a good. Great place in Syria is in the other corner.

464
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:05,050
So write it from Colorado. It's a very.

465
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:12,300
Let's just say that 25 below in the winter was unusual and the wind always blows.

466
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:14,550
And it was a very interesting environment.

467
00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:24,030
They knew their weapons system for the United States that the ground based nuclear weapon systems are based in Colorado, Nebraska and Wyoming.

468
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:27,930
And we went through a huge refurbishment of those system.

469
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:31,470
And so they had sat in their little moldy holes for 20 years.

470
00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:34,350
By the time we got around and they were going to clean them up,

471
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,850
make it more environmentally friendly, get rid of all the underground storage tanks, etc.

472
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:44,990
So that's what I did. So I was just I was a field engineer doing that kind of work, did that for about six years,

473
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:50,760
and we were transferred to Wright-Patterson, where my husband got his his master's degree in aerospace.

474
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:57,970
But I went on to be a civilian employee, and I worked for the Material Command in Dayton, Ohio.

475
00:47:57,990 --> 00:48:01,800
What we did there was we were what's called security assistance.

476
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:05,790
So what I did. So that part is like the spy versus spy world.

477
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:11,790
So we, the United States, sells arms to other countries and we build bases for them.

478
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:21,240
So that's what I did. So I managed projects, building bases in Egypt because my country, the people on the other side are opposed to Saudi Arabia.

479
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:26,280
There are all kinds of other people doing other parts of the world. But I got to Egypt.

480
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:29,310
I was happy when I went to interview.

481
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:34,500
I had twice first of two jobs. In that time, environmental engineering was just coming in.

482
00:48:34,590 --> 00:48:38,340
It was like people that others environment, they were like, Oh my gosh, I'm in trouble.

483
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:46,410
Let's do something about it. And so I had a I interviewed for that job and it was able to be a really good job, great career move.

484
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:51,720
Perfect. Then the other job interview was this project management job in Egypt.

485
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:57,430
And the guy is interviewing. He was like, this is why do we ever go to Egypt?

486
00:48:57,450 --> 00:49:02,280
He says, Oh, yeah, I go there all the time. I was like, I'm going because I always want to go to Egypt.

487
00:49:02,370 --> 00:49:07,859
So I got to go. And the good thing was, it was right after the the first Gulf War.

488
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:14,940
And so they were very nice to people. Otherwise it wasn't so good, but that I really was great.

489
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,060
I really enjoyed a lot of travel in that job.

490
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:23,430
And after that we went to a bus station, a cool place called Tullahoma, Tennessee,

491
00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:30,810
which is a very tiny little place halfway between national Nashville, Tennessee and Huntsville, Alabama.

492
00:49:31,350 --> 00:49:38,120
But it has a huge testing center for the Air Force.

493
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:41,610
And they test they test rockets a little bit, but they're also test aircraft,

494
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:46,950
but giant wind tunnels, all kinds of stuff that was brought over after World War Two.

495
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:52,590
So old stuff. And they do just that, the majority of the testing for the military.

496
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:56,009
So my husband did that and I went to work for this.

497
00:49:56,010 --> 00:50:06,719
Ah, the, the company that actually ran the base which was at that time called Sverdrup and they were a huge company built sort of civil,

498
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:10,550
built almost every large bridge in America.

499
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:16,890
They built the the sail was arch. Huge, huge company doing worldwide, huge projects.

500
00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:22,800
They had a civil group. They had a celanese group which built skyscrapers and buildings and stuff.

501
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:28,600
But the group I got was technology and they were kind of a little startup company that's got that

502
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:35,249
that some of the people from that had worked at the base and worked in the wind tunnel areas,

503
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:39,210
wanted to do a lot more high tech stuff. So they had this little startup group.

504
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:43,590
So that was that was the group that I went to, but it was a lot of fun.

505
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:49,740
We did a lot of work for the ACA. We're a consulting company, basically, so now we've branched off into.

506
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:58,550
Automotive stuff. I worked on all kinds of test facilities.

507
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:07,850
I did rocket test stands. I did all kinds of weird stuff. And then one of the jobs I worked on was building a test facility up here in Elkhart,

508
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:11,570
Michigan, called the Durability Drive the Ability to test facility.

509
00:51:12,390 --> 00:51:16,680
They built partially built. You're familiar with Chrysler.

510
00:51:16,690 --> 00:51:20,620
They built the Chrysler wind tunnel system and they're testing it up there.

511
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:27,550
They built that building. So they came down to build a smaller building, but still pretty good size down in Detroit.

512
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:33,310
And at that time, what I did for these guys, for the most part, they did the system analysis.

513
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:39,790
And so that's the type of safety that you were going to look at risk of failure of the facilities and equipment.

514
00:51:40,270 --> 00:51:45,250
And how are you going to protect the the the press, the plant and the equipment from that?

515
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:50,140
And it's a little bit of occupational. When they go to the Drivability test facility,

516
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:56,379
they decided they were going to operate it for ten years and do that at a higher cost to test technicians.

517
00:51:56,380 --> 00:52:01,450
We had facilities at that altitude so they would take you down to see that hole sea level.

518
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:04,890
They would take you up to almost 15,000 feet in your car.

519
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:14,830
So you can take this driving, Pikes Peak and all that kind of stuff. Cold temperatures down to -40 and height up to about 140 above zero.

520
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:19,209
And. One of my job is I did those facilities.

521
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:21,190
So I did the I did the altitude cells.

522
00:52:21,190 --> 00:52:27,520
I did the control systems for getting people up and down the altitude cells, the protection systems for that, the fire safety for that.

523
00:52:29,530 --> 00:52:33,370
And then they went to the operating part. They said, you know, this is kind of dangerous stuff.

524
00:52:33,370 --> 00:52:37,209
And they've got Dynamo monitors and things like that and cars and trucks and everything.

525
00:52:37,210 --> 00:52:40,840
And they said, we need a safety person. I said, Good luck.

526
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:44,410
You know all this. They said, Well, we thought it might ought to be you.

527
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:47,920
So you've done the safety stuff. I said, no, I didn't say system safety.

528
00:52:48,490 --> 00:52:52,300
And they said, well, you know, just come up and take a look at it, you know.

529
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:58,690
So they brought me up and and I interviewed and I been doing the work up here in Michigan, and I liked it, actually.

530
00:52:59,470 --> 00:53:02,980
I didn't like going to Detroit that much, but they brought me out here to Ann Arbor,

531
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:10,809
went out to the Chrysler test, chose to test a proving ground on a day that was beautiful spring day.

532
00:53:10,810 --> 00:53:17,020
I was like, This is so nice up here. And so they kept asking me.

533
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:22,509
I said, Well, I really don't want to do that. You know, my friend said, Don't do it.

534
00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:26,110
Artificial safety is horrible. It's a pit you'll never get out of on a run.

535
00:53:26,710 --> 00:53:31,600
And then they said, Here's some money. And I said, Well, that looks good to me. So here I am.

536
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:35,650
So that's what brought us up here in Michigan. And then I did.

537
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:39,010
I worked there for altogether about ten years.

538
00:53:39,010 --> 00:53:41,800
I worked at the facility for probably three or four years.

539
00:53:42,370 --> 00:53:51,549
And then it wasn't as interesting as it might be, I think, but there was a lot a lot of it was just a lot of travel.

540
00:53:51,550 --> 00:53:54,250
I had a kid and it was it wasn't much fun after a while.

541
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:58,959
So they needed a person to be the assistant director at the Safety Department finished medicine.

542
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:02,140
So that's how I got here back to the university.

543
00:54:02,770 --> 00:54:08,410
And I did that for 17 years and retired a couple of years ago. I came to work for the School of Public Health after that.

544
00:54:09,190 --> 00:54:13,510
So that's my story. I think that's a lot of story.

545
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:17,740
So I did a lot of different types of things that were safety related.

546
00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:22,060
And once you get into safety and you think that, you know, that was safety stuff, I did.

547
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:29,180
I do a lot of construction, maintenance and build engineering and project manager.

548
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:37,530
That's what I did. It was construction projects, putting stuff out, redoing old stuff, troubleshooting things that are about ready to die.

549
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:40,830
Make it come back to life long enough for me to leave for good.

550
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:42,780
So I did a lot of that thing.

551
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:51,690
I spent every time I read the the silos are about 60 feet deep and I spent most of every day I did inspections tied up in harnesses.

552
00:54:52,530 --> 00:55:02,130
We did have a little work, hands down. And so doing stuff at higher heights, being confined spaces, doing testing.

553
00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:09,240
I worked in the private sector. I the design analysis piece, the systems engineering part.

554
00:55:09,570 --> 00:55:19,320
I worked a lot of cryogenic materials because of rocket fuel. We did a hydrogen nitrogen slash at the time they were doing flush hydrogen.

555
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:25,620
When I left in health care facility, support was a huge part of what I did with all those buildings.

556
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:32,820
We built my hospital, cardiovascular center, all of the areas of the building.

557
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:36,809
I did all of the safety analysis for that from the facilities standpoint.

558
00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:44,700
So you see it, I wash the gel, I wash and I did program managed the safety program there.

559
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:48,599
I did a lot of injury analysis there. I data for injuries.

560
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:53,219
We'll talk about that a little bit and my getting back to you.

561
00:55:53,220 --> 00:56:01,050
I'm lecturing here a mentor at SSP and I also helped BXP develop their CSP test questions.

562
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,770
So I cannot answer questions about the CSP test.

563
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:10,590
I can't answer questions of the C IHS, but let me just sign up for five years.

564
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:17,070
You can't answer questions. I was going to ask you questions to ask the questions to answer.

565
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:23,720
So now let's see. I think we have time still. What time is it? I know this was so good.

566
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:28,260
An hour. This is the time for your story. I heard part of your story here.

567
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:34,770
But what I want you to think about for a few minutes is what your safety or environmental story really is.

568
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:38,879
So some of you have you got two degrees, you've done all this kind of work.

569
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:43,800
But if you think about back when you decided to go into this,

570
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:48,450
maybe you had some experience or somebody that kind of helped you to think that was a good idea.

571
00:56:49,350 --> 00:56:52,709
Mine was because because in reality,

572
00:56:52,710 --> 00:57:00,300
I've been doing safety my whole career and my father was worked on your witness a huge, huge construction projects.

573
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:09,450
He did a certain matter all over the country that he had seen a lot of pretty horrible accidents over the years.

574
00:57:09,450 --> 00:57:14,220
And this is you know, this is in the, you know, 50, 6070s and things were not very good.

575
00:57:14,670 --> 00:57:17,729
And so he was always like, don't touch this.

576
00:57:17,730 --> 00:57:26,340
Don't do that. This will hurt you. That will work. But I so I kind of grew up sort of immersed in that anyway.

577
00:57:26,850 --> 00:57:34,020
So do you think that was about 5 minutes or so and I will kind of report out and you guys can tell us what your your story is.

578
00:57:34,770 --> 00:57:42,180
So think about what it was a feeling standpoint, the emotional piece of that sensory intellectual part.

579
00:57:43,350 --> 00:57:51,100
So we'll see. What time is it? Oh, hey, this is good for 35, so.

580
00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:54,810
Sounds good. So I will sit here while you think.

581
00:57:57,410 --> 01:00:07,010
Yeah. It's kind of.

582
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:44,230
But. I don't.

583
01:01:18,930 --> 01:01:26,590
One more minute. Right.

584
01:01:27,310 --> 01:01:40,360
Right. I not.

585
01:01:52,130 --> 01:02:08,270
The whole system. And that everybody everybody thought people ran out of the room.

586
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:14,200
I just noticed that moments. Who wants to go first thing first?

587
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:22,980
All right. So the reason I got here into age is because of someone named Andre Gray Girl.

588
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:26,960
She's like a family friend. She's the initial ideas for the kind of pharmaceuticals.

589
01:02:27,470 --> 01:02:33,379
And during the pandemic, I wasn't quite sure what I wanted to do this time for like about 2 hours.

590
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:35,930
And like, I was the I sold a really good job of it,

591
01:02:36,710 --> 01:02:44,090
but she kind of pulled it my heartstrings just telling you about like a facial and doesn't like diseases, occupational diseases, so and so forth.

592
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:51,470
It made me think about my grandfather. He was in charge of transporting like hazardous materials to different countries in the Philippines.

593
01:02:52,250 --> 01:02:58,280
He almost as crude, died leukemia. I was born in the Philippines and my family's located there, we all know is occupational induced,

594
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:02,510
but the Philippines is like a developing third world country, so it wasn't really investigated.

595
01:03:03,410 --> 01:03:09,110
I know he's not my grandfather died, but I never knew was and it caused me to jump into this career.

596
01:03:09,110 --> 01:03:19,939
So yeah, those two factors together you when you're young that's that's that's a good one but what people invest

597
01:03:19,940 --> 01:03:24,139
is exposure a lot of people get into because their families who are exposed to asbestos have been.

598
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:30,890
So yeah, the old days were not the good old days because know who wants to be next.

599
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:34,880
So how I got here was actually through my dad.

600
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:43,010
He has been a digital head for the past 40 years and he's used Simone actually used to work the University of New Mexico.

601
01:03:43,070 --> 01:03:47,030
Oh yeah. And just department, but then moved to California.

602
01:03:47,750 --> 01:03:50,780
So when I was younger, I always would go to work with him.

603
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:56,360
So I'm kind of similar to where I was immersed in it my whole life and I would wear that.

604
01:03:56,690 --> 01:04:02,440
Yeah. And every time I went to work with his work, whenever I got to see kind of what he did, you know,

605
01:04:03,030 --> 01:04:08,090
and be around his coworkers who I got really close with, you know, they taught me the ropes as well.

606
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:11,930
And also whenever you came home from work, you always tell me stories.

607
01:04:11,930 --> 01:04:17,630
And, you know, being on a college campus, he would talk about all the suicides of students had tried to attend.

608
01:04:18,170 --> 01:04:23,450
And so he was part of programs of trying to know really like urban planning,

609
01:04:23,450 --> 01:04:28,340
but creating a safer environment where when it comes to like a parking structure

610
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:32,450
was a very common parking structure that a lot of people would try to attempt on.

611
01:04:32,780 --> 01:04:38,659
He would include more shrubbery putting up fencing within, you know, just that type of simple stuff.

612
01:04:38,660 --> 01:04:42,860
And as a kid growing up, you kind of see that as like a superhero type thing.

613
01:04:43,190 --> 01:04:46,370
And, you know, his constant talk about how there's not enough people in the field.

614
01:04:46,370 --> 01:04:50,419
And so that kind of edged me on to kind of go into the field.

615
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:55,010
And so that's cool. That's cool. I got involved in some of that as well.

616
01:04:55,010 --> 01:05:00,499
We had a parking structure during the hospital that we had, so I happened to.

617
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:07,550
But that's what you see. Those big fences that he put up is that you get involved in a lot of things that you think are going to.

618
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:14,000
And that's exactly what he said to Internet. Exactly. Thing is that with things like that, medical people, they take a lot.

619
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:22,370
They are trained in that kind of thing, you know, mental health issues, things like that.

620
01:05:22,370 --> 01:05:29,060
And we don't really get that kind of training in a person that is like that can really be very scary.

621
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:37,360
Yeah, it's an intense experience for sure. But you know, you're your daddy, you have to check with your dad.

622
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:52,009
And then here again said this my way through. So it's like, you know, so I thought that I was going to be a medical doctor from like the age of five.

623
01:05:52,010 --> 01:06:00,139
And I went all the way through. My undergraduate was a free medicine major, and when I was in the cadaver laboratory,

624
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:05,540
we looked at a lot of different people with a lot of different types of pathology.

625
01:06:05,540 --> 01:06:11,089
And we would try to predict, like, why does your heart like or why do your lungs look like that?

626
01:06:11,090 --> 01:06:16,909
And I remember this one lab specifically where we had one cadaver that had grown

627
01:06:16,910 --> 01:06:21,080
up in New Mexico and another one that had just been in LA their whole lives.

628
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:25,430
And we were comparing the lungs between them just to see the difference that air

629
01:06:25,430 --> 01:06:30,499
pollution specifically can make on the develop the development of lung disease.

630
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:38,930
And I mean, I really like anatomy and physiology, but there was something about medicine that just didn't quite click right with me.

631
01:06:38,930 --> 01:06:41,989
And I could never really pinpoint it until that.

632
01:06:41,990 --> 01:06:52,069
And it made me think, Oh, maybe I should do something where I can help prevent this from happening in the first place,

633
01:06:52,070 --> 01:07:01,850
because medicine is very diagnostic, like, oh, you have a knee injury, let me help you fix all the things that are ailing you specifically with your.

634
01:07:02,110 --> 01:07:07,179
Individualized problem versus public health and environmental health specifically is more

635
01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:14,200
like let's try to change up our approach entirely and maybe more for community based

636
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:19,419
or occupational based approach where we can change this mode of operations or change what

637
01:07:19,420 --> 01:07:23,590
people are exposed to so that they don't have to go to the doctor in the first place.

638
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:29,440
And so I think just through I have a pretty diverse work history and I've seen just

639
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:34,690
little bits and pieces of flaws in environmental health and safety in each of them.

640
01:07:34,690 --> 01:07:39,790
And I think all of that together has brought me to where I am now.

641
01:07:40,270 --> 01:07:43,450
Right now, medicine is definitely reactive.

642
01:07:44,050 --> 01:07:51,700
And there's, there's, there's probably help medicine that tries to get people not to do things, but but when they don't have a choice.

643
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:55,299
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

644
01:07:55,300 --> 01:08:02,980
And I have a lot of friends in medicine right now that are saying that they're trying to shift the field of medicine and how

645
01:08:02,980 --> 01:08:10,690
medicine is taught to make it more proactive rather than reactive and diagnostic like after the effects have already been done.

646
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:18,940
But yeah, I don't know. I think that being in public health, where your job is quite literally proactive,

647
01:08:18,940 --> 01:08:23,920
like we are trying to prevent disease in these giant populations of people in the first place.

648
01:08:24,620 --> 01:08:28,680
It feels a lot better for me to. Who's next?

649
01:08:30,490 --> 01:08:35,400
I can give her boss what you wanted. I kind of fell into it.

650
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:40,620
So when I graduated my undergrad in 2018, I didn't know what I wanted to do when I finished,

651
01:08:41,430 --> 01:08:44,610
but I knew I wanted to work something in science and something in a lab.

652
01:08:45,030 --> 01:08:48,389
So I applied to a million pharmaceutical companies and a bunch of labs,

653
01:08:48,390 --> 01:08:54,660
and I got one interview right as I was like in the fall of my senior year at Michigan,

654
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:59,310
and it was with a big pharmaceutical company in Boston, and they were like, It's for you.

655
01:08:59,340 --> 01:09:00,070
Just position.

656
01:09:00,090 --> 01:09:09,240
I knew absolutely nothing about CV and I'm so glad I took that job because it was something new and different every single day that I was there.

657
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:14,460
And while that was overwhelming, sometimes it was really cool to talk with all the different experts,

658
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:19,380
like the different doctors, and I got to meet with all the different PhDs that were working in the labs.

659
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:26,210
I felt like I was directly helping them on a daily basis as much as I was helping like facilities guys and stuff like that.

660
01:09:26,220 --> 01:09:33,299
So it was cool juxtaposition of people they got to work with and it really made me fall in love with like the job tasks of

661
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:39,630
something new every day and kind of connecting all those experts you talked about earlier that have a piece in health and safety.

662
01:09:40,650 --> 01:09:46,170
I really enjoy that. Yeah, that's the really good that's that's one thing that we did.

663
01:09:46,170 --> 01:09:47,080
We touch everybody.

664
01:09:47,610 --> 01:09:55,380
We're one of the few professions that is the normal route of your job is to work for literally every single person in your company.

665
01:09:55,950 --> 01:10:04,679
And that's a really it's really interesting and I say it every day can be very, very different and you don't usually have a day planned.

666
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:07,380
So just have to get used to that part of it.

667
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:17,760
But yeah, so I came into my undergrad thinking I wanted to be an actuary just because my parents taught me at sure because they make a lot of money.

668
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:25,110
And so I started like doing that kind of stuff and I realized how much I hated it.

669
01:10:25,710 --> 01:10:30,420
And so then I got I was looking for a job and was getting like a data entry job

670
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:37,410
with a biostatistician here at U of M and we kind of just talked and I was like,

671
01:10:37,410 --> 01:10:45,330
you know, we're in the math statistics world. And so he told me about everything you can do with the statistics, decreases everything in statistics.

672
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:50,100
And so then I kind of went into like the biostatistics realm of things.

673
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:56,820
I was like, Oh, I want to do research. So I somehow managed to find Rick.

674
01:10:57,150 --> 01:11:04,370
And at the time they were working on e-waste in Thailand and Chile, and I was like, That sounds fine.

675
01:11:04,650 --> 01:11:08,720
And so I started working on that and he ended up sending me to Thailand.

676
01:11:08,730 --> 01:11:21,090
We were like designing a singular tool that the workers could use that could do like many different types of electronic waste like this.

677
01:11:21,510 --> 01:11:30,210
And so for a variety of parts and try to see if that would reduce our exposures to stuff like heavy metals as well as reduce injuries.

678
01:11:30,690 --> 01:11:40,589
Um, and I really like that. And then slowly over many years, Rick kind of warming down and I was like, I should really think about doing this stuff.

679
01:11:40,590 --> 01:11:46,650
So like, I don't know what to do with the statistics degree, but he convinced me to join the program.

680
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:47,400
I don't regret it.

681
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:56,850
One thing about the data part of it is that where you saw that really come right up to the firms that are concerned because all those pictures,

682
01:11:56,850 --> 01:12:00,000
all those graphs. And so that's where that comes from.

683
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:08,850
Johns Hopkins University did a lot of those things on the verge of something that people would see and see those numbers.

684
01:12:08,850 --> 01:12:15,270
That's the kind of people have a problem with. And so it's it's one of those things that is very important,

685
01:12:15,270 --> 01:12:20,950
especially when we start getting the metrics and we talk about what that probably does for data collection.

686
01:12:21,030 --> 01:12:32,520
As we look at it, you would be interested in this next Andrew and so I'm sorry, is your fun?

687
01:12:33,150 --> 01:12:39,390
Oh, well, I started working construction when I was 19 for a small residential company,

688
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:44,460
and I started out as a laborer and had to do a bunch of different jobs.

689
01:12:44,870 --> 01:12:51,989
I started noticing a bunch of musculoskeletal problems and I even developed acute

690
01:12:51,990 --> 01:12:57,510
bronchitis at one point from inhaling just ridiculous amounts of particulates.

691
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:02,999
But towards the end of my undergraduate degree,

692
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:13,050
I started to realize after I'd taken some occupational safety classes and some environmental health classes, what I was being exposed to.

693
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:20,700
And that kind of got me thinking more or less about other people who are starting

694
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:25,739
out in construction at young ages who might be getting exposed to these things.

695
01:13:25,740 --> 01:13:29,790
And I also started realizing and learning about how these.

696
01:13:30,180 --> 01:13:34,710
These problems can also impact you 20, 30, 40 years later in life.

697
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:43,050
So that kind of made me want to get into industrial hygiene, just kind of help prevent latent issues more than anything.

698
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:45,870
I mean, acute problems are very important,

699
01:13:45,870 --> 01:13:56,790
but I just don't it kind of hurts me to think that people 20 years from now can develop the disease and not really have an idea of where it came from.

700
01:13:57,180 --> 01:14:04,700
Yeah, that's unfortunately that's an area that has like I said, the old days were not the good days for that.

701
01:14:04,710 --> 01:14:08,040
And when I started out in engineering, I was doing my lab work.

702
01:14:10,620 --> 01:14:14,280
There was just absolutely no concept of that day.

703
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:18,860
You know, there was this macho thing about, you know, yeah, for an entire roof.

704
01:14:18,870 --> 01:14:20,940
But I don't mean that, you know?

705
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:29,800
And I remember when we had this process where they they would build these really nice buildings in Hercules and then it spread with your thing full,

706
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:35,370
because if something blew out, they didn't want the they were all made out of woods then splinter.

707
01:14:35,730 --> 01:14:41,380
And so they wanted to have insulation and stuff and, you know, nasty, sticky, horrid stuff.

708
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:45,390
And these guys would be up there in shorts, you know, summer doing that stuff.

709
01:14:45,870 --> 01:14:52,320
And one of my job's delegated by the construction manager was to go tell that from shirt on and put the white hands on.

710
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:59,370
But they did not want to do that. But honestly, never take your skin off. So there was that.

711
01:15:01,530 --> 01:15:04,340
I can disagree. Yeah.

712
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:15,540
Like, I mean, I thought I was going to be a doctor, but my parents, you know, said to my older siblings that their own I was pretty set on that.

713
01:15:15,550 --> 01:15:21,600
And then I came here in the first year, I actually fell out of the classes and it's just boring.

714
01:15:22,170 --> 01:15:25,800
So then I was kind of panicking sitting there what to do.

715
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:34,340
So I decided to take an environmental science class and, you know, the the rocks and stuff.

716
01:15:34,350 --> 01:15:39,600
But they did the one section that was environmental and I really enjoyed that.

717
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:47,820
So I decided to take a mental health class in the football program and I really love that.

718
01:15:48,390 --> 01:15:59,400
So I thought of that. And then Dr. Michael came in and a talk like a lecture and very charismatic and persuasive.

719
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:03,080
So as I was doing that, I turned from that.

720
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:11,370
I don't know what you're saying. So you're doing the family that went rogue, me and then my brother.

721
01:16:11,370 --> 01:16:19,170
Yeah, it was true. Yeah. Yeah. So we're interested in that.

722
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:26,570
So I saw you do it.

723
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:31,430
I want to go home. I want to go through.

724
01:16:33,350 --> 01:16:42,110
Okay. So. So I did my first two years of undergrad and free pharmacy.

725
01:16:42,110 --> 01:16:44,329
So I took a lot of those, like science based courses.

726
01:16:44,330 --> 01:16:50,150
And I did my last two years focusing on, like, public health, but mostly like behavioral health and health education.

727
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:56,750
So I did internships in like a clinic and I did an internship at Michigan Tobacco Cessation Services,

728
01:16:57,860 --> 01:17:05,360
and I thought I was going they had a job opening during graduation, but by the time I graduated, I'm like, Oh, I got a job, that's cool.

729
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:08,870
And then I didn't get that job. So then I started like panicking.

730
01:17:08,870 --> 01:17:14,719
I was like, Oh no. And I now need to find a job. And I was applying for jobs in specialties like behavioral health.

731
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:19,700
A lot of those jobs required like master's degrees, or at least like a degree in social work.

732
01:17:20,330 --> 01:17:24,650
And I wasn't qualified for any of the jobs I was applying for and I wasn't getting any of them.

733
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:30,230
So then I, you know, kind of had to like reassess something like what I really wanted to do with myself in my life.

734
01:17:31,220 --> 01:17:36,800
And there's a stew that was did industrial hygiene for the Air Force.

735
01:17:37,220 --> 01:17:44,629
And he was getting his masters of toxicology here at the time because the Air Force Hispanic or he told me all about industrial hygiene and I'm like,

736
01:17:44,630 --> 01:17:47,180
oh, yeah, that's that sounds cool. So I'll give that a shot.

737
01:17:48,110 --> 01:17:55,849
And, you know, I got two jobs in industrial, I guess, for two years, and I really liked it because it was a blend of like all those hard sciences.

738
01:17:55,850 --> 01:18:02,419
I took the first couple of years of college and there's a lot of behavioral health tied in with, you know, safety and industrial hygiene.

739
01:18:02,420 --> 01:18:05,540
So I thought it was a nice blend of everything.

740
01:18:05,540 --> 01:18:11,000
And, you know, no one does the same. And it's a lot of cool different projects and experiences.

741
01:18:11,930 --> 01:18:15,140
And, you know, working at the NIH for two years, you know,

742
01:18:15,260 --> 01:18:21,500
it's been a lot of consultation with like a specialist remediation like during like construction projects and you can kind of see,

743
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:30,350
you know, the on of the projects, you know, kind of how there's a lot of social in terms of plan of things and how certain groups

744
01:18:30,350 --> 01:18:34,429
can get sort of picked on and marginalized even with the job sites and the jobs that,

745
01:18:34,430 --> 01:18:37,909
you know, more dangerous jobs and kind of get thrown to the wolves.

746
01:18:37,910 --> 01:18:45,890
And yeah, it's just a lot of things that you're doing, things to do, things that you were able to use your past.

747
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:49,610
You didn't have to give up all those years you spent staying with friends.

748
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:55,010
Yeah, it's always nice. Organic chemistry student is something whose nexuses.

749
01:18:55,010 --> 01:19:01,280
I think this side of the room, that's my room where I can see and do that.

750
01:19:02,930 --> 01:19:06,139
Yeah. Like a lot of other people,

751
01:19:06,140 --> 01:19:10,430
I was also pre-med throughout my entire undergrad so that I wanted to go to

752
01:19:10,430 --> 01:19:15,379
medical school after I graduated and still planning to apply to medical school.

753
01:19:15,380 --> 01:19:22,880
But I decided to take a gap year just to get some practical experience and make sure that's what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.

754
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:30,559
So I took classes for a few months and I got my EMT certification and I used that to get a job at a little

755
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:37,610
hospital near me and realize that patient care wasn't necessarily something that I really enjoyed.

756
01:19:37,610 --> 01:19:43,310
But my time working in the hospital really exposed me to different workplace injuries and illnesses,

757
01:19:44,390 --> 01:19:48,980
so that definitely opened my eyes up to the field of health and safety.

758
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:56,330
I also grew up just hearing my mom also worked in health care, and so I heard many horror stories about different injuries.

759
01:19:57,440 --> 01:20:02,089
So I started looking into different health and safety programs and I found a natural

760
01:20:02,090 --> 01:20:08,600
hygiene and returned to her school because I know she went here for an insurance on it.

761
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:13,220
And during school that health care is really interesting.

762
01:20:14,370 --> 01:20:19,489
I had no idea some of the stuff that I found out about in health care and then the

763
01:20:19,490 --> 01:20:25,640
fact that with the amount of exposure people had to especially ergonomic injuries,

764
01:20:26,510 --> 01:20:29,630
that they just wouldn't really change what they did.

765
01:20:30,380 --> 01:20:33,670
I've done it this way. I've always said it this way. This is how we have to do it.

766
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:39,530
And it's like, you know, yeah, it's funny because whenever I took EMT classes,

767
01:20:39,530 --> 01:20:45,530
they really try to ingrain in your head like proper biomechanics, you know how to properly lift somebody.

768
01:20:45,830 --> 01:20:51,920
And then one of our switched started working at the hospital was like really different people just do things how they want to and then,

769
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:57,049
you know, it's just like a totally different situation, but it's not an easy thing.

770
01:20:57,050 --> 01:21:00,680
Yes. So that was one of the things I did when I came to the hospital.

771
01:21:00,710 --> 01:21:06,680
This is I know where the organized program was, where I was.

772
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:11,690
That was my plan. My job was to build building smokers like way ahead of the people.

773
01:21:11,690 --> 01:21:17,420
That helped me. But it was quite interesting. Let's see who's who's lost.

774
01:21:17,540 --> 01:21:22,649
So if the eye contacts you that were. You're trying not to look at me.

775
01:21:22,650 --> 01:21:30,120
This is your last now. So you're out of work anyway. So, like others, my entire family does age.

776
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:38,100
So my grandpa was a CIA agent and my both my parents are these are just lucky to know about it.

777
01:21:38,790 --> 01:21:47,790
And what drew me into it was just the idea of safety being like challenging but also rewarding because of the preventative aspect of it.

778
01:21:48,270 --> 01:21:52,530
And also I just like the the Jason mentioned like it's a different day every day.

779
01:21:53,010 --> 01:21:56,610
So I was I was lucky to just know about it.

780
01:21:56,610 --> 01:22:01,919
Like I can remember my dad quoting that there's no such thing as an accident to me when I was like three.

781
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:06,000
So it's been my entire life. We'll talk about that.

782
01:22:06,030 --> 01:22:11,249
We'll talk about that. The interest was the thing that comes and goes.

783
01:22:11,250 --> 01:22:15,390
The different things are safety hazards.

784
01:22:16,810 --> 01:22:20,680
A lot of changes in our practices the way the outlook is and things like that.

785
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:23,770
So yeah, I never understood what he meant until I took classes.

786
01:22:23,970 --> 01:22:30,310
Yeah. The idea that is, is it a hazardous act or an unsafe acceptance that information.

787
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:34,320
I recommend that. And last but not least,

788
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:45,190
so I'm not in an age where you just but I have an awareness of safety as a profession for a long time as an underground public health.

789
01:22:45,190 --> 01:22:51,729
So I have like a brief exposure to it, but it really I think there was one event that happened over the summer when

790
01:22:51,730 --> 01:22:56,740
I was touring the refinery that kind of stood out to me as a safety concern.

791
01:22:56,740 --> 01:22:59,770
Even though I was fully immersed in safety the entire time I was there.

792
01:22:59,770 --> 01:23:03,959
They really pride themselves on their BP five star certification.

793
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:11,500
And you can't get caught like holding your foot in the elevator very, very serious about safety everywhere you go, at least at corporate.

794
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:15,459
And I went to the refinery and we went into there out here of the unit.

795
01:23:15,460 --> 01:23:22,360
And the man who was in there just happened to open up the first aid kit to show us what was in there.

796
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:26,149
And we had the occupational health nurse with us and she was like, why is this in here?

797
01:23:26,150 --> 01:23:31,960
It was some substance. You know, we can use this, but if anybody uses it, they don't know what it's going to do.

798
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:37,629
And I was like, Wow, they have all these procedures and safety things in place and things like that still happen.

799
01:23:37,630 --> 01:23:41,860
So I thought that was really interesting and and they hope they agree health, education.

800
01:23:41,860 --> 01:23:44,890
So like, as so people kind of mentioned safety.

801
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:49,920
So it's pretty well that was the theory and I took an injury prevention class involved.

802
01:23:49,930 --> 01:23:53,650
So it's kind of just been a building interest for me throughout this past year.

803
01:23:54,400 --> 01:24:00,190
The behavior piece is a big one and that that's kind of coming on to different theories on that.

804
01:24:00,910 --> 01:24:07,440
But it's the one thing we'll talk about is the the people down to the people who get hurt or the people that,

805
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:13,929
you know, there's corporate and think things are great. And to do certain types of, you know, inspections and things and the numbers are always good.

806
01:24:13,930 --> 01:24:16,360
But then you go out there and you're just like, oh my gosh.

807
01:24:16,510 --> 01:24:27,490
So and the company I work, Jacobs, the original Jacobs company was founded by Joe Jacobs was did what they call turnarounds in oil and gas industry.

808
01:24:27,970 --> 01:24:36,160
And they were the subject of a horrible accident, 2005, I think, and they lost like 20 people.

809
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:41,590
We'll talk about this a little bit later. That caused them to make some big changes in how they work with them.

810
01:24:41,590 --> 01:24:50,950
So back to your industry. You talk about my work with a lot of guys that worked on the plant in Wyoming.

811
01:24:50,950 --> 01:24:52,510
A lot of the people that work on our sites,

812
01:24:52,780 --> 01:24:58,540
the welders and stuff especially were pipeline welders and they had worked out on the drilling rigs and stuff.

813
01:24:58,540 --> 01:25:02,650
That was Wyoming's an oil place and some of the stuff that they would do.

814
01:25:03,910 --> 01:25:13,899
Basically, they said they were really safe because they were scared all the time, which has been a really great way to live, but that's really good.

815
01:25:13,900 --> 01:25:24,340
So and so those are the kind of the story piece is because if you kind of connect to that, what you think about it, it makes it more meaningful.

816
01:25:24,340 --> 01:25:30,190
As you're looking at it, you learn things about it. And when you talk to people, you want to bring those stories up.

817
01:25:30,700 --> 01:25:33,940
You want to try to do things where people connect with you as in telling a story.

818
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:39,249
We'll talk about it a little bit later when we talk about education and training, how important that is.

819
01:25:39,250 --> 01:25:44,170
But when you want to collect those, so you have this little bag of stories. I got horror stories forever.

820
01:25:45,550 --> 01:25:52,390
But in my case, because I started out kind of in engineering, but I started doing things in places that were dangerous, doing dangerous things.

821
01:25:53,230 --> 01:25:57,190
I was the I was the target of safety and the safety education part.

822
01:25:57,610 --> 01:26:03,400
And I worked very closely with the Safety Department, especially when I worked in the government.

823
01:26:03,820 --> 01:26:12,040
And then a lot of times those were people who they put them in safety because they got hurt on another job and they couldn't do that.

824
01:26:12,130 --> 01:26:16,300
They couldn't do the job, which is what they do with quality people to a lot of places.

825
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:21,910
So so you got these people that weren't trained for it, didn't want to be there, but they were there because at least it was a job.

826
01:26:22,990 --> 01:26:27,370
And so then you had other people that would come in and they had this idea that they were cops,

827
01:26:27,430 --> 01:26:31,419
you know, they were going to make sure they get to the line.

828
01:26:31,420 --> 01:26:39,640
And so I said a lot of different things from the other side of safety, so hopefully I'll be able to convey some of those experiences.

829
01:26:41,050 --> 01:26:46,490
So very good. And welcome to your first two points of credit in class for doing your story.

830
01:26:46,490 --> 01:26:50,469
I think it was it was worth it was 5 minutes.

831
01:26:50,470 --> 01:26:53,530
It was worth it. So wristbands, I think we have.

832
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:58,980
That's hour our good. I'm on time for once in my life.

833
01:26:59,070 --> 01:27:04,110
This would be a project. We're talking about program management just in general what this is and what we're going to talk about.

834
01:27:04,950 --> 01:27:09,600
So OAG, occupational health and safety, environmental management.

835
01:27:09,610 --> 01:27:16,560
So the E and this is actually environment meetings, the work environment, it's not the plants and the trees and stuff.

836
01:27:18,570 --> 01:27:27,240
We've added that in here because most safety departments have that component and safety is very safe, is moving to incorporate that.

837
01:27:27,780 --> 01:27:38,350
So while we're. While we're still the safety, occupational and safety side of it, the environmental peace, the safety of the environment.

838
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:43,239
It's kind of a very short session of what we do. So there's a lot of that in safety.

839
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:48,760
So. So we'll be talking about I have one module that's going to be environmental management stuff.

840
01:27:49,090 --> 01:27:55,299
Most of the environmental management techniques and requirements of things are exactly the same as the regs are different.

841
01:27:55,300 --> 01:27:58,570
The rules are a little bit different, but everything else applies completely to.

842
01:27:58,570 --> 01:28:07,280
And so it they work together pretty well. There's a real program well we'll talk about.

843
01:28:08,050 --> 01:28:13,780
And then these are standards and things like that. Two or three of them that will specifically call out.

844
01:28:13,780 --> 01:28:20,469
But the main thing with the program, while so we have we have OSHA, we've got talk about ANSI standards,

845
01:28:20,470 --> 01:28:28,209
we'll talk about ISO standards, the making of the program or whatever your company does.

846
01:28:28,210 --> 01:28:37,270
So if you're in the United States and you're covered under OSHA or the state plans that we'll talk about, you're going to want to use that model.

847
01:28:37,270 --> 01:28:42,640
That's where OSHA will come in. And they will they will inspect you based on that.

848
01:28:45,050 --> 01:28:49,390
If you are going more international, you're going to use the ISO model for TAPS.

849
01:28:50,060 --> 01:28:57,410
They're just different, but they have all of them have some common elements,

850
01:28:57,410 --> 01:29:01,490
which is the clarity of purpose and that it tells you this is a program for the purpose.

851
01:29:01,730 --> 01:29:05,690
This is what we're going to be doing, right? We're doing everything. We're doing this part of it.

852
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:12,500
A lot of times when you go into a safety program, things will start to leak out of the safety program.

853
01:29:13,070 --> 01:29:18,320
And you want to make sure that all of those parts we talked about risk management facilities and all those things,

854
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:28,010
that's a system first approach to to pulling that in because you don't want to have really great policy about how to do lockout tagout.

855
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:32,870
If people are buying the wrong equipment and people are doing the right thing, the whole thing has to be in there.

856
01:29:33,290 --> 01:29:36,800
There has to be really clear this program takes care of all of this stuff.

857
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:41,180
It has to fit the organizational culture of the place that you're working in.

858
01:29:41,660 --> 01:29:46,550
If you're especially internationally, you may have company.

859
01:29:46,950 --> 01:29:51,200
They work for a company that has has places here that stays Canada.

860
01:29:52,070 --> 01:29:58,370
They may go to Mexico or maybe going overseas. Every place there will have a little bit different culture.

861
01:29:59,060 --> 01:30:02,300
Corporate culture versus the actual people at the plant have different culture.

862
01:30:02,660 --> 01:30:07,190
And knowing what that is and kind of kind of really they'll take a measure of that.

863
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:11,120
It's going to really help you in creating that program and keeping it sustainable.

864
01:30:11,780 --> 01:30:15,650
It has to be integrated in the system, and that's system approach, basically.

865
01:30:17,810 --> 01:30:23,000
You don't want purchasing off doing whatever. You don't want people buying.

866
01:30:23,090 --> 01:30:28,670
You don't want to have interior design groups up by the desk that nobody can adjust because it's cheaper that way.

867
01:30:28,700 --> 01:30:31,940
You don't want to have that kind of stuff happening because you're not going to be able to fix it.

868
01:30:32,420 --> 01:30:37,220
If somebody comes in and they've anchored the decks to the wall, there's not anything to do about it.

869
01:30:37,670 --> 01:30:41,120
If they say this is the chair, you can't adjust it.

870
01:30:41,690 --> 01:30:47,150
And so you want to make sure that if the company is going to be spending their money on stuff that you spend on stuff that's going to work for them.

871
01:30:47,930 --> 01:30:54,110
So it needs to be integrated across the system. And if one person makes a change, you want to know and it's a good one, you want to know.

872
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:59,630
I want to distribute that through the company. If it's bad, you want to let everybody know that, Hey, don't do it this way.

873
01:31:00,470 --> 01:31:06,140
You want to make sure it's effective, and you want to make sure that it's affected the know by hard numbers that actually this is working.

874
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:18,890
A lot of times people are going to pick on health care worker nurses a lot more ergonomics know Lindsay patients.

875
01:31:19,820 --> 01:31:26,610
They don't. They'll go through a £500 patient because our crunches it fumbles a couple of people.

876
01:31:26,680 --> 01:31:31,910
Yeah, we can do it with a sheet, you know, maybe one time, but you're going to get hurt.

877
01:31:32,750 --> 01:31:44,210
But drop a vial of some drug in a tiny little vials to do nothing the drug and break it in the unit.

878
01:31:44,420 --> 01:31:47,630
And everybody panics. They run to, oh, my God, I've been exposed.

879
01:31:50,450 --> 01:31:51,590
That's the least of your issues.

880
01:31:53,810 --> 01:32:02,900
So it needs to be an effective approach integrated across the board so that people understand this is really what I'm exposed to.

881
01:32:02,900 --> 01:32:04,870
This is the important stuff here, you know,

882
01:32:04,910 --> 01:32:08,870
and I don't want to say that it isn't important for you guys to pick and choose your battles at some point.

883
01:32:09,170 --> 01:32:11,840
And there's things that, yes, that is a hazard, is something we could do,

884
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:17,120
something that there's other things that may be perceived as a hazard, but they really are.

885
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:20,450
An indoor air quality is one of those. We'll talk about that a little bit.

886
01:32:21,350 --> 01:32:25,999
And then a systems approach, which means we're looking at the whole system, we're looking at the whole plant,

887
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:30,350
looking at all of the activities that are done to that plant and also by the contractors.

888
01:32:33,260 --> 01:32:37,310
All of them incorporate what's called the PDSA cycle. Literacy in this thing is work.

889
01:32:38,140 --> 01:32:45,620
Yeah, it's called a Deming real. Deming came up with that and every one of them has this little thing in it.

890
01:32:46,220 --> 01:32:49,970
So. So they're there. It's pretty simple.

891
01:32:50,450 --> 01:32:55,069
Everybody knows what that is. But the plan do part is a check.

892
01:32:55,070 --> 01:32:58,370
So the check pieces that you can do all these things, planning is great.

893
01:32:58,370 --> 01:33:00,830
Everybody loves to play like a plan your vacation,

894
01:33:01,190 --> 01:33:06,620
but to plan your life like to plan things where you actually have to do it, that's a little bit different.

895
01:33:06,620 --> 01:33:10,579
And that's where this comes in because it's really great on paper you have to do it.

896
01:33:10,580 --> 01:33:15,290
It doesn't work so well, but you need to have a way to know that it's not working because sometimes,

897
01:33:15,290 --> 01:33:20,450
depending on how the reporting is done and how this part is implemented,

898
01:33:20,720 --> 01:33:25,010
it may be difficult to know that you're not doing it right or it's not getting the effect that you want.

899
01:33:25,430 --> 01:33:28,490
And then once you do, you got to fix it. You got to do something to change it.

900
01:33:28,820 --> 01:33:32,330
It can be really, really hard to get all the way around here and then turn around,

901
01:33:32,330 --> 01:33:36,200
say, we've got to do something different, so you got to do it all over again.

902
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:40,610
And so that constant, constant a system approach.

903
01:33:41,830 --> 01:33:45,250
It's really what you have to do with these things. And that's what most of the standards talk about.

904
01:33:45,980 --> 01:33:52,690
It's partly it the most difficult part of the job, for sure. But we got help.

905
01:33:53,350 --> 01:33:59,350
So. This is the components of the ocean safety, health and safety and health management system.

906
01:33:59,860 --> 01:34:03,160
So in the ocean world, they never dealt with ocean.

907
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:08,110
Somebody said, Yeah, sure. You know, you heard that story.

908
01:34:09,970 --> 01:34:13,960
Ocean does not have regulation on this program.

909
01:34:14,470 --> 01:34:18,520
Where they require is they tell you that they will.

910
01:34:20,220 --> 01:34:28,020
They strongly suggest you have one, that if you don't have one, then they are going to throw the book at you, basically.

911
01:34:28,740 --> 01:34:34,890
But they want to see it. So whenever they're going to do any kind of inspection or they're going to take a look and see if are going to cite you.

912
01:34:35,160 --> 01:34:39,180
Even if they don't cite you, they're going to ask for your plan, your program.

913
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:43,560
So if you don't if you look at the numbers like, I have no idea, that's not good.

914
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:51,450
But anyway, even though it's not a regulatory requirement, this is basically what they have in it.

915
01:34:51,900 --> 01:34:56,790
So management, leadership, workers participation, hazard identification assessment.

916
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:00,750
Corrosion control. Education. Training program evaluation.

917
01:35:00,750 --> 01:35:09,709
Improvement. Their components they. What you're talking about is they want to know that the leadership is in charge and driving the train.

918
01:35:09,710 --> 01:35:14,630
That leadership's on board and they're backing all this stuff. They want to know the workers are involved.

919
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:18,829
That's what worker participation is. They want to know that you have safety committees.

920
01:35:18,830 --> 01:35:24,530
You have ways to have people that have concerns or any of that kind of thing circulate stuff up to manage it.

921
01:35:24,750 --> 01:35:30,800
But it gets to management man who does something about it. There's a process for a hazard, an assessment.

922
01:35:31,460 --> 01:35:36,650
You come in, they come in and they look at somebody and somebody is wearing gloves and they'll say, Oh, what do you mean it was her?

923
01:35:37,010 --> 01:35:40,250
They'll say, Oh, well, I do this or this. Well, how do you know that's the right kind of gloves?

924
01:35:41,210 --> 01:35:44,420
And you go, Well, I don't know. They were in a box in the store room.

925
01:35:44,420 --> 01:35:52,100
That's what I used. That's not a good answer. They want to know you guys don't have those gloves because somebody somewhere looked at that,

926
01:35:52,610 --> 01:35:59,700
what you're working with and said, those are the right ones. So that's what they're talking about there, prevention and control.

927
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:06,800
So once you understood where you are, where you're going, what's your prevention program?

928
01:36:07,200 --> 01:36:14,210
As I said, I think half of people said, you know, that's really where we're at for us is prevention and where your controls are.

929
01:36:15,370 --> 01:36:22,540
So how are you making sure that that these things are implemented by people who are actually getting education and training?

930
01:36:25,220 --> 01:36:26,390
Because that can vary.

931
01:36:26,660 --> 01:36:36,890
Anybody that's ever been around probably a minority in any kind of business suit, and that's what you get for training when you go in for safety.

932
01:36:37,310 --> 01:36:46,100
I've been in places where literally the first day you come to work for like two days maybe, or the first day,

933
01:36:46,100 --> 01:36:50,810
maybe half that day, they sit there and they make you go through module after module and maybe a computer.

934
01:36:51,080 --> 01:36:56,810
They have somebody come and talk to you for a couple hours. You haven't been there, you haven't seen it, you don't know anything about it.

935
01:36:56,960 --> 01:37:02,840
And they're telling you all this stuff. Well, if you get hurt five years from now, they're go, Well, I trained you.

936
01:37:03,740 --> 01:37:08,480
Where were you when you weren't listening? That's not that's not the way to go.

937
01:37:09,710 --> 01:37:11,630
And then there's program evaluation and improvement.

938
01:37:11,630 --> 01:37:19,370
So there has to be some way that there's a metric that we understand what we're what we're working through injuries is one of them.

939
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:24,799
We're leading indicators. But upfront, you have to decide these are the things that we're going to look at and we're going to

940
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:28,100
watch these numbers and see if there's a way so we can figure out there's a problem.

941
01:37:28,610 --> 01:37:31,759
And they want data. They don't want people telling stories.

942
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:36,110
They don't want somebody saying, hey, I'm afraid of that thing. We'll never it's good to have that information.

943
01:37:36,110 --> 01:37:40,430
But they want actual numbers that you're actually did something is actually worked you know that's working.

944
01:37:41,180 --> 01:37:47,620
So that's that's this is also. And we're back up here really quick.

945
01:37:48,340 --> 01:37:51,790
So we'll talk about this. But OCE, is the federal government in the United States.

946
01:37:54,670 --> 01:37:58,210
States can also have their own plan system like my option here.

947
01:37:59,110 --> 01:38:03,460
So the state takes over and runs that system for the state.

948
01:38:03,820 --> 01:38:10,240
So there's we'll talk about there's probably about 30 states that have their own plans and they're called plan states.

949
01:38:10,660 --> 01:38:15,700
So they have to have a program that's at least as strict of ocean.

950
01:38:16,150 --> 01:38:21,100
So state when you go depending on what state you're working in, could be more or less than this.

951
01:38:25,590 --> 01:38:30,790
The standard of the United States that we have for general occupational health and safety systems,

952
01:38:30,790 --> 01:38:34,710
that you'll see that this is a health management system.

953
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:43,290
But they only put the word system on there because it used to be called the plan program and it doesn't really go far enough.

954
01:38:44,010 --> 01:38:54,120
In a lot of respects. So as we speak, the American Society of Safety Professionals, as it is, is the national guideline.

955
01:38:54,870 --> 01:39:01,130
So if you're you're reading OSHA bare minimum, if you want to get better than OSHA, you're here in this one.

956
01:39:01,470 --> 01:39:07,080
Again, you're saying management, leadership, employee participation, planning support,

957
01:39:08,490 --> 01:39:14,610
which is really kind of a part of management leadership's implementation operation where oceans really have that.

958
01:39:14,610 --> 01:39:22,730
But that's part of. They want to know how you how they they want to have a specific process of how you roll the stuff out, your voice,

959
01:39:23,030 --> 01:39:29,330
how the communication works within your company and the evaluation, corrective action you talked about and the management review.

960
01:39:29,340 --> 01:39:37,399
So when you come to the evaluation page, somebody up top is looking at this stuff and somebody is reporting out to the leadership and saying,

961
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:44,270
this is working, it's not working because you can do lots of things at the lower levels or the higher levels.

962
01:39:44,270 --> 01:39:50,150
But if the two are not talking to each other or circulate that information, then you don't really have much of a program and it's not a system.

963
01:39:52,250 --> 01:39:54,860
And last but not least, we have some international program models.

964
01:39:55,250 --> 01:40:03,800
So Austria was one of the first actually the first comprehensive safety law in the world.

965
01:40:04,340 --> 01:40:08,810
So that's why you're seeing almost everybody models after Asia. But Europe has.

966
01:40:08,930 --> 01:40:12,230
So they took from that, but then they branched out.

967
01:40:13,730 --> 01:40:16,370
ILO, International Labor Organization.

968
01:40:17,060 --> 01:40:24,920
They have this their set of guidelines, the British Standards Institute process, a whole series of these things.

969
01:40:24,920 --> 01:40:28,370
And there are also safety management program. Kind of like their.

970
01:40:29,700 --> 01:40:35,610
Kind of like their ocean, not totally different. Canada, which is basically our ocean.

971
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:41,760
And then Japan has what they call the Ministry of Labor Notification 53, which is their safety law.

972
01:40:42,090 --> 01:40:45,510
And many other countries, their own country has an ocean type thing.

973
01:40:46,350 --> 01:40:53,100
Basically what happens is when you start having multinational companies and everybody's got their own little thing,

974
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:57,030
then that becomes very difficult to try and navigate through.

975
01:40:57,510 --> 01:41:06,150
And especially when you have situations where, for example, you have United States citizens who go to a foreign country and they get hurt,

976
01:41:07,050 --> 01:41:12,690
or you have or you have a company that's got U.S. citizens with it.

977
01:41:12,690 --> 01:41:17,820
And they also have the foreign nationals are doing the work because they're too.

978
01:41:18,210 --> 01:41:24,020
So two sets of guidelines for people because when you leave the United States still offshore.

979
01:41:25,160 --> 01:41:37,250
But you may go into an environment that's totally not there. So in recognition of that, they created the ISO 45,000 family.

980
01:41:37,490 --> 01:41:49,270
So the international standard harmonization is dealt with ISO 9000 before ISO 14,001 ISO 14,001 for environment 9000 is quality.

981
01:41:50,210 --> 01:41:54,890
But one of the main factors, renters tell us that on the side of the building.

982
01:41:55,910 --> 01:42:01,630
So these are a set of model programs. They're not not intended to be adopted as a resolution.

983
01:42:01,640 --> 01:42:04,250
It's a program and it's a certification program.

984
01:42:04,580 --> 01:42:09,230
So you can get certified those you call people and they'll come in and they'll certify you to that standard.

985
01:42:09,770 --> 01:42:13,940
And what that says is this company meets all of this.

986
01:42:14,300 --> 01:42:22,520
So when a regulatory agency like OSHA or whoever your country is comes around, they say, well, we do have a certification for this.

987
01:42:23,460 --> 01:42:34,440
So it's a way to. Kind of level the playing field internationally, so to speak, because it's really nice if you have a really dangerous process.

988
01:42:35,610 --> 01:42:43,320
Like let's say we're we're burning the installation of a lot of wires in some country where children because it's cheaper to do it that way,

989
01:42:44,370 --> 01:42:48,150
that's not going to work there. You're signing up for the ISO system.

990
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:57,480
So it's a model program is a voluntary standard. So people that bought into it, the United States is one of the countries that voted into it.

991
01:42:58,950 --> 01:43:04,020
We should be able to click this little thing here and go to that which looks like it was.

992
01:43:04,830 --> 01:43:11,430
And I have a note down here that is is he has not signed on to this.

993
01:43:11,910 --> 01:43:15,629
They've kept their separate standard for now until they figure it out,

994
01:43:15,630 --> 01:43:20,960
because this is really recently this is a few years old, but I think maybe we'll get there.

995
01:43:20,990 --> 01:43:28,870
Okay. So this is the. So you see, this can come down to.

996
01:43:30,870 --> 01:43:38,360
I think the adoption. Yeah. So you look at the list of countries here that's adopted it or.

997
01:43:42,260 --> 01:43:51,080
Russia. Has adopted it. A lot of these countries are European Union countries, so they all said all about separately.

998
01:43:51,350 --> 01:43:57,500
But, you know, that's not everybody. I think there is not Italy or India is not the idea here.

999
01:43:58,110 --> 01:44:02,840
There. We're in here. Where are we are states.

1000
01:44:03,470 --> 01:44:09,380
There's a few notable people who are in Europe. But we you signed up to we said we agree with the ISO system.

1001
01:44:09,390 --> 01:44:17,340
So what that means is that. In theory, they want to use that global record of the global highway system.

1002
01:44:17,730 --> 01:44:22,230
Everybody's going to use this thing. We're going to work toward doing this or ours is still going to.

1003
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:25,680
Also can't hit you on this stuff. It can still hit.

1004
01:44:25,680 --> 01:44:30,660
You aren't. But they can get you on their rules. But this is going to be become the international standard.

1005
01:44:31,110 --> 01:44:36,060
So the more people get certified with it, it's.

1006
01:44:37,680 --> 01:44:45,660
It's not like the epitome of safety. Let's say that it's going to be a pretty barebones kind of, you know, system,

1007
01:44:46,230 --> 01:44:50,100
but at least it lets you look at apples and apples when you're going to another country or they're

1008
01:44:50,100 --> 01:44:53,790
coming here and they're saying what they need to do for safety regulations and requirements.

1009
01:44:54,240 --> 01:45:01,450
So that's basically what that is. Again.

1010
01:45:01,450 --> 01:45:07,000
It's not. No, it's nobody's law. So do I support 45,000?

1011
01:45:07,420 --> 01:45:11,220
So. It's a family because there's a bunch of them.

1012
01:45:13,110 --> 01:45:18,720
The main one is the 45,001, and that's an occupational safety health management systems.

1013
01:45:19,260 --> 01:45:28,950
So again, it's a management system focused on broad aspect of the company, but has and these are these are the actual active standards.

1014
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:36,869
So they've got a bunch of inactive ones, but part of the family. But psychosocial is the next one that just came and this one is 2021.

1015
01:45:36,870 --> 01:45:40,050
So we're in the middle of code and everybody was totally freaked out.

1016
01:45:42,190 --> 01:45:45,610
They took a psychological risk. And we'll talk a little bit about that.

1017
01:45:46,030 --> 01:45:50,320
That's a really. In the United States, we don't have that.

1018
01:45:50,710 --> 01:45:53,830
So they also have chosen not to have any role.

1019
01:45:54,100 --> 01:45:59,620
They have some guidelines, I guess you would say, if there are laws in some countries actually have laws about it.

1020
01:46:00,460 --> 01:46:03,550
But that's one of the one of the ISOs that you can sign up for. So you.

1021
01:46:03,590 --> 01:46:07,330
So if you were going to be certified, you would get certified for each one of these standards.

1022
01:46:09,640 --> 01:46:14,170
And then the last one just came out 20, 20 to 45.

1023
01:46:14,230 --> 01:46:20,020
And that's the the guideline for code. Not a moment too soon.

1024
01:46:20,030 --> 01:46:27,160
How You Can Work to recover. Reason for that is that having been in the middle of all of that with the health system,

1025
01:46:27,820 --> 01:46:33,640
when the whole wide world can get masks, the whole wide world can't get gloves, you can't get anything from anybody.

1026
01:46:34,270 --> 01:46:40,030
What are the world rules now? Because you've got to do what you can do and you end up with.

1027
01:46:42,010 --> 01:46:46,419
But I see many stories about this. But people are using plastic bags, right?

1028
01:46:46,420 --> 01:46:49,270
They're putting all the plastic bags and put those around people.

1029
01:46:49,690 --> 01:46:56,290
And, you know, we had at the health health system, we had tons of people come and say, hey, I've got a great idea.

1030
01:46:56,290 --> 01:46:57,730
Here's this thing. Buy it from me.

1031
01:46:58,150 --> 01:47:06,520
Or like, you know, we can't look at this stuff because there's rules on how what you can use in health care, there's rules on what I am 95 has to be.

1032
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:11,800
And if somebody just comes up and says, well, here's this thing that looks like one, it doesn't mean it is one.

1033
01:47:11,860 --> 01:47:13,180
It doesn't mean it's been certified.

1034
01:47:13,690 --> 01:47:18,820
So what do you do when you have this thing and you can't reuse it, but now where we're using it and how to do all that stuff.

1035
01:47:18,830 --> 01:47:26,560
So this was to kind of even things out for the whole wide world and say, Yeah, the U.S. is doing it this way because other countries,

1036
01:47:27,220 --> 01:47:31,270
I mean, basically they were just, you know, handkerchiefs and towels and things like that.

1037
01:47:32,650 --> 01:47:39,070
But to say here's a level of risk. This is what we're going to accept so that people could just at least do their work.

1038
01:47:39,910 --> 01:47:44,950
So I don't know if that will stick around, but hopefully it's going away because.

1039
01:47:47,120 --> 01:47:53,629
We got Mexicans anyway. So in work they've got three more general guidelines for implementation.

1040
01:47:53,630 --> 01:47:56,990
So we're supposed to implement it over here. That's that first one.

1041
01:47:57,380 --> 01:48:02,420
And work is the guidance for how to do it, which I always find interesting.

1042
01:48:05,490 --> 01:48:10,000
They came up with it in 2018. So it's there. But is it a work requirement?

1043
01:48:10,090 --> 01:48:14,620
They are certified against it by guidelines on performance evaluation.

1044
01:48:14,740 --> 01:48:20,260
Is it work? Having discussions about what really is and we'll talk about this a little bit,

1045
01:48:20,260 --> 01:48:27,250
what we use for four metrics, what does that really look like and how is that really valid?

1046
01:48:27,640 --> 01:48:33,130
How do you validate what you're doing and the guidelines for organizations preventing and managing infectious diseases?

1047
01:48:33,400 --> 01:48:36,670
So I think the COVID one will probably roll into that one, but.

1048
01:48:37,790 --> 01:48:44,210
There's those hospitals, basically, right? Hospitals, laboratories, people are working with bacteria or whatever else.

1049
01:48:46,220 --> 01:48:51,980
That's soup to nuts in different countries. So so we have level four biosafety systems here.

1050
01:48:52,310 --> 01:48:58,310
Other countries don't use them like that. You can buy stuff in other countries that you would never be able to buy here.

1051
01:48:58,640 --> 01:49:02,840
You could ship stuff around and trying to level with no, say no.

1052
01:49:03,280 --> 01:49:07,190
You know, just because you found it and it says anthrax on it, you can't send it to your friend.

1053
01:49:07,730 --> 01:49:11,450
That's kind of what that is. And that will probably be a long time coming.

1054
01:49:14,080 --> 01:49:17,230
So if we look a little bit at 2018 at 45,000 was.

1055
01:49:18,140 --> 01:49:25,610
I'm sure I'm staying on 28 minutes for sure, because these are important pieces of it.

1056
01:49:25,620 --> 01:49:31,730
So we'll talk depth about this request. So the context of the organization, as I said, what's the safety culture?

1057
01:49:31,820 --> 01:49:35,670
What does your organization live in? What kind of rules apply to it? What does it do for a living?

1058
01:49:35,720 --> 01:49:38,750
Where does it work? Leadership. Worker participation.

1059
01:49:38,750 --> 01:49:41,629
Talked about planning. What's the planning is?

1060
01:49:41,630 --> 01:49:49,310
Where in this standard they have all of this stuff like identification, risk assessment, mitigation, support.

1061
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:55,670
How are you going to support the system? Who's going to provide resources and training operations?

1062
01:49:56,790 --> 01:50:01,830
So when you really get it down on the ground, how are you actually going to distribute this thing and make sure everybody is doing the same thing?

1063
01:50:02,290 --> 01:50:06,990
And again, as we talked about the Demi report performance evaluation and then improvement is pulled out

1064
01:50:07,620 --> 01:50:12,840
separately because they want to see you're doing something towards it as a process improvement.

1065
01:50:12,930 --> 01:50:17,969
That's a nice little thing. As a 9000, 9004 quality is the same thing.

1066
01:50:17,970 --> 01:50:24,330
You always have to have your little improvement. So every time, like every year when you do this review with the management,

1067
01:50:24,570 --> 01:50:29,860
you really come up with a new a new improvement standard that you're going to try to use and

1068
01:50:29,880 --> 01:50:34,800
for your reading enjoyment have provided the crosswalk and looks all these things that,

1069
01:50:35,370 --> 01:50:40,710
oh dear, no, maybe it won't let me if they do, because I want to live dangerously.

1070
01:50:42,300 --> 01:50:46,470
Oh, no. Okay.

1071
01:50:46,470 --> 01:50:53,010
Sure. Oh, no. And another screen pulls up to get rid of you before I have to look at you.

1072
01:50:53,520 --> 01:51:01,320
So what this is. Is this a few years old? But it's it's these things don't change drastically that much, but this nice little bunch of tables.

1073
01:51:02,130 --> 01:51:07,440
But they talk about the differences between these things. So. In the year that they were implemented.

1074
01:51:07,450 --> 01:51:14,680
So you've got Ocean Wet in recommended practices guidelines from 1989.

1075
01:51:14,920 --> 01:51:23,080
Is that not a new thing? The VP, I think a couple of people mentioned that there companies were BP stars that that program.

1076
01:51:23,830 --> 01:51:29,320
The VP voluntary protection program that allows what they do is if you sign up for it,

1077
01:51:29,950 --> 01:51:35,620
you have this you have this written program, you allow them to come and inspect your facility.

1078
01:51:35,860 --> 01:51:38,379
And then if they ever have to come because you had an injury accident,

1079
01:51:38,380 --> 01:51:45,970
they kind of give you a little sprout on implementing any kind of citations or fines or anything like that.

1080
01:51:45,970 --> 01:51:49,360
So that's what that is. I'll always the International Labor Organization,

1081
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:54,820
we talked a little bit about that and then the National Safety Council had what they called the journey,

1082
01:51:54,910 --> 01:51:58,389
journey to Safety Excellence and that ISO 45,001.

1083
01:51:58,390 --> 01:52:02,440
So there's all these people that have this idea that, you know, here's my idea, here's my idea.

1084
01:52:02,890 --> 01:52:09,219
And basically 45,001 who takes a place of all those things, but it's pretty extensive.

1085
01:52:09,220 --> 01:52:17,110
And so that is a nice little cheat sheet to have. So depending on where you come from, goes through all the different component pieces.

1086
01:52:19,490 --> 01:52:23,360
So that's in the module. So you'll have access to it if you want to look at it.

1087
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:31,139
I may ask you a question about it at some point in your life. Gosh, right, right, Right inside of it.

1088
01:52:31,140 --> 01:52:34,480
Right here in one stuff. All right.

1089
01:52:35,120 --> 01:52:41,359
So there is the fact about 14,000. So there is the 14,000 family before 18,000.

1090
01:52:41,360 --> 01:52:44,210
One is mostly the one that people use. Same thing.

1091
01:52:44,570 --> 01:52:50,990
This is the commitment in policy planning implementation review saying that the same parts that they call it something different.

1092
01:52:51,320 --> 01:52:56,300
But what they did. It was we're all just as I got older and we got all these other things.

1093
01:52:56,780 --> 01:53:00,890
The EPA basically said, Yeah, just go to ISO. We'll just we'll just use that.

1094
01:53:01,130 --> 01:53:06,830
So there there's lines up with ISO, but that wasn't so.

1095
01:53:06,860 --> 01:53:11,299
Well, we'll talk a little bit about that. But all of this is the same exact same thing.

1096
01:53:11,300 --> 01:53:20,630
Hazard identification, worker participation, all exposed to the difference with our environmental is where safety is internal.

1097
01:53:20,930 --> 01:53:24,680
It's your employees, your company, everything. Environmental is the outside world.

1098
01:53:25,100 --> 01:53:30,830
So you have a different focus on if you're polluting other people versus you're polluting your employees.

1099
01:53:32,860 --> 01:53:36,490
Right. Same thing, but that's kind of different side of it. And we'll talk about that.

1100
01:53:38,130 --> 01:53:42,690
You know, talk about the symptoms approach, but I think we are done. Oh, we have 4 minutes.

1101
01:53:42,690 --> 01:53:46,410
I might be able to do it. So we're talking about what systems are.

1102
01:53:47,130 --> 01:53:53,570
We see this a lot. This is my basic business now. You had a purpose, right?

1103
01:53:53,630 --> 01:53:57,350
Our business makes money purposes. Doesn't make money. We don't have a business.

1104
01:53:58,650 --> 01:54:04,140
You know, it's over with. We produce something. We have to have a way to get it to the customer.

1105
01:54:04,800 --> 01:54:10,020
We sell it for more than we make, so more than it cost to make it and get to the customer.

1106
01:54:10,320 --> 01:54:16,410
And we use the extra money to buy more stuff and then we get more money. Maybe we give some of that to our employees that maybe we don't.

1107
01:54:18,110 --> 01:54:22,340
So when we produce something, we're producing something from raw materials, plants, minerals, products.

1108
01:54:22,670 --> 01:54:29,069
We bring something and we do something to it. And then we're going to sell it to somebody.

1109
01:54:29,070 --> 01:54:35,780
So we're going to pack it and transport it. So from the cost of sales and marketing in their.

1110
01:54:37,390 --> 01:54:42,130
When you go down the evil path of purchasing a receding storage.

1111
01:54:44,780 --> 01:54:48,780
You know, they're involved in all of this stuff. And then what do you do?

1112
01:54:48,930 --> 01:54:55,320
Upgrade your facilities, hire more people, pay off your loans, etc. And safety applies to where?

1113
01:54:58,070 --> 01:55:04,590
However, first of all, it doesn't it? You have the informal organization.

1114
01:55:05,310 --> 01:55:08,549
So you have your your what we call influencers.

1115
01:55:08,550 --> 01:55:22,800
We'll talk about if I go back for a minute here this is how is on paper does all kinds of other things here but where does safety fit in.

1116
01:55:24,200 --> 01:55:28,190
We talk about influencers, but you had your traditional Ashley that slides out of place.

1117
01:55:28,520 --> 01:55:33,560
Okay, so we talk about organizations structure that go really far back for a couple minutes.

1118
01:55:34,190 --> 01:55:37,630
We have a basic business, but then we have a residual structure as a course of business,

1119
01:55:37,640 --> 01:55:41,150
and it's built to support that type of business in that type of industry.

1120
01:55:41,420 --> 01:55:48,880
They may look different in different places. But basically we'll talk about traditional hierarchical ones.

1121
01:55:49,270 --> 01:55:54,920
This is kind of like the basic, you know. One World War Two, I guess.

1122
01:55:54,930 --> 01:55:58,250
But you have a president, you have a bunch of people VP's.

1123
01:55:58,530 --> 01:55:59,880
There are other people down here.

1124
01:56:01,530 --> 01:56:10,050
These are basically all of the systems that support the environment at the same time works, which hopefully is reporting to the president.

1125
01:56:10,990 --> 01:56:18,300
But you have some sort of organizational structure and that's going to determine be determined by this, the context of your organization.

1126
01:56:19,500 --> 01:56:28,820
No, no, no. This one should go afterwards but that where your business model what you do here.

1127
01:56:30,590 --> 01:56:35,960
How are you organized? How you really are organized to that other one.

1128
01:56:36,590 --> 01:56:44,540
Another one I have in here is a cross-functional matrix, which is what we do in consulting quite a bit where everybody works for everybody else.

1129
01:56:45,170 --> 01:56:49,309
So instead of having this type of a structure where it's very clear whose lines and

1130
01:56:49,310 --> 01:56:54,050
who's in charge and who's got the responsibility to this director or who is in charge?

1131
01:56:54,080 --> 01:56:59,050
Who's in charge? Engineering is a lot like this.

1132
01:57:00,150 --> 01:57:05,770
Then you have people that you'll have. This applies the project manager.

1133
01:57:05,870 --> 01:57:10,180
There's just projects the engineers get supplied to him by the various engineering managers.

1134
01:57:10,600 --> 01:57:17,110
So those people, the project manager, actually controls what those people do for work, but they're not who those people report to.

1135
01:57:17,500 --> 01:57:22,630
So they have to influence. That's what the importance or the ones that apologize for that being out of order.

1136
01:57:23,380 --> 01:57:31,240
Because you have all what you think it is and then you have this informal organization, which is how things really get done.

1137
01:57:31,870 --> 01:57:35,199
So you can have all kinds of things laid out. You can say you have the structure.

1138
01:57:35,200 --> 01:57:38,140
You have all the people involved that need to be involved.

1139
01:57:38,480 --> 01:57:44,440
There might be one person there that you want to find to connect with because that person influences a whole lot of other people.

1140
01:57:44,770 --> 01:57:49,690
And then your program can sometimes rise and fall based on the goodwill of this individual.

1141
01:57:50,260 --> 01:57:55,750
So we'll talk about that, doing that, how that works in a future class.

1142
01:57:56,230 --> 01:58:03,350
But. This is the context. Now, do you have any organization that's got this great organization on paper?

1143
01:58:03,650 --> 01:58:08,360
But it's kind of a mess down there where things really get done if you don't know the exact cause and to talk to,

1144
01:58:08,720 --> 01:58:13,320
nothing's going to happen because you've got it almost like a very every individual person, the company,

1145
01:58:13,320 --> 01:58:20,210
and say, you know, do it this way, do it this way, and how to leverage that within your program.

1146
01:58:21,560 --> 01:58:31,280
So the questions I'm actually I'm trying to figure out where, you know, there is a limit because everybody likes to read.

1147
01:58:32,570 --> 01:58:35,960
I was basically with a couple of things on the ISO four or 5001.

1148
01:58:38,040 --> 01:58:45,460
So actually I think that it's not for 10,000 words he does 45,002 that we run.

1149
01:58:45,770 --> 01:58:52,550
In fact, I know I got that wrong. Anyway, Elmer Sol is one of the architects of that standard.

1150
01:58:52,910 --> 01:58:58,370
Spent 20 some odd years writing that thing, getting it ready to go, pushing it.
