1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:11,460
Like I was just like, you don't like my computer.

2
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:18,270
It's too much for my head.

3
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,070
I'm not going to get out of it. It's pretty obvious he's going to have to get on my couch.

4
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:34,480
I don't really like that. Actually, very much.

5
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:52,760
Sure you do. Or where you go. Because she might have something more apparent from her request, like turns to go and never heard anything about it.

6
00:00:54,550 --> 00:01:01,560
But then when we talk about, you know, my neighbors, they wouldn't mind answers.

7
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:10,770
I think like all ten of them have the walls. So all ten of them at some point, they like tried to like cut things to find them.

8
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:17,640
And they just went so loud and convinced them to show up at my school.

9
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:27,900
And I was supposed and, you know, through the motions.

10
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,830
So next week we are next week, Wednesday, we have a guest lecturer.

11
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:52,020
So, you know, after my baby and I pointed to reading that she is to focusing on in her life that basically this is a paired set of lectures.

12
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:59,980
I'm going to give you an introduction to the surveillance and she is going to give you a more practical view of surveillance on the ground.

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,330
We're going to do the same thing with outbreak investigations in two weeks.

14
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,230
Guest lecturer talking about outbreaks in practice after I did that.

15
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:14,719
Intro to Outbreak Investigation. So we're going to as I mentioned before,

16
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:24,799
we're shifting I'm shifting the hallmark to release date so that we get one lecture on outbreak investigations for that homework.

17
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,980
So it's going to be released Tuesday and again in two weeks.

18
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:39,920
And we've got we'll be releasing the exam grade scoring and also the homework shortly.

19
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:48,740
Homework one. The problem was that with those, any questions you will be given?

20
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:57,820
So as I mentioned, this is a good introduction to surveillance and Eve,

21
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:06,820
who's an expert on HIV surveillance and specifically will be talking about her experiences and some of the issues that she comes up with,

22
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:13,060
actually using surveillance and advising public health departments about surveillance.

23
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:23,080
So these are some of the key points that I'll be talking about, including active and passive surveillance, central surveillance,

24
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:30,340
syndromic surveillance ways in which you're going to adjust for underreporting because surveillance is always underreported.

25
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:34,650
Sometimes. Sadly and sometimes very badly.

26
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,570
And we think it often we take surveillance for granted and the quality of the data,

27
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:50,760
but it's very difficult to collect quality surveillance data and then touch upon sensitivity,

28
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,329
specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value.

29
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:57,900
Those are all concepts that you've already seen and had.

30
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:01,470
Just to kind of as a refresher,

31
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:11,820
these are important measures in order to assess whether or not a test that's going to be used for surveillance is how good it is.

32
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,850
So it's a very public surveillance.

33
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:24,370
Is this ongoing systematic collection and analysis interpretation of health related data.

34
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:28,540
And there's two pieces to this.

35
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:35,520
One is the. The planning application, the evaluation of public health practice by collecting data.

36
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:45,080
And the next is actually. Disseminating that information so that it can be used for prevention and control.

37
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:57,660
And so I just wanted to emphasize that the use of dashboards is pretty new and it's been revolutionized with the pandemic.

38
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:08,670
And that has made the kinds of data that public health departments have been collecting much more public and much more accessible.

39
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:13,200
And so we see these dashboards. The state of Michigan has these dashboards.

40
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:20,430
The New York Times is publishing information every day and updating it constantly.

41
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:28,169
And so this is the kind of information that in the past, it would be much harder for the public to actually see.

42
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:33,540
And now it's much easier if creating these dashboards takes a lot of work,

43
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:38,820
and it's not intended to grant it, but it is now much more doable given the new technology.

44
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:49,200
So just to emphasize that surveillance has been activity has been going on for a long time.

45
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:57,750
This is the bills and mortality surveillance that was done continuously.

46
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:03,300
Tracking deaths suggests for something that we're very of interest to be tracking.

47
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:09,240
You know, this year we got into the time of the plague,

48
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:21,749
huge plague outbreak in epidemic and very noting 27, 2817 deaths, four that we expect to plague much.

49
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:26,610
All of the other numbers are much, much smaller. So it's very much parallel, again,

50
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:38,340
to this pandemic where the number of deaths associated with COVID had dwarfs all the other mortality statistics that we have and were reporting,

51
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:46,160
certainly. So this is another example of of.

52
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:52,540
Showing mortality statistics for New York City.

53
00:06:53,590 --> 00:07:00,160
These are deaths per 1000 on the Y axis time or year on the X axis.

54
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:04,420
And they're showing different periods with in New York, the old city of New York.

55
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:13,690
And then looking at the greater city of New York, extended in the late summer, the later years.

56
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:26,110
So to point out, cholera and yellow fever were huge issues with respect to mortality, causing a huge amounts of deaths in New York.

57
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:35,020
And just to illustrate and highlight one of the aspects of a critique that we often think about yellow fever,

58
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:40,929
malaria as, you know, tropical diseases, but they're actually not tropical diseases.

59
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:49,150
They're diseases that can be spreading throughout, you know, throughout the globe.

60
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:55,089
And it's through mosquito control and investment in public health infrastructure.

61
00:07:55,090 --> 00:08:04,690
In our we've been able to eliminate public health issues with respect to yellow fever and

62
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:12,160
through sanitation and water treat centralized water treatment and disinfection eliminate.

63
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:26,670
Rout of cholera in the U.S. And then also noting the time periods of instituting chlorination of water and pasteurization of milk in that in that era.

64
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,600
So this showing over time.

65
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:42,690
But also there is a lot of interest and you know, of the John Snow example of looking at occurrence by place.

66
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:47,030
And also it's been something that was interesting in that time period.

67
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:51,770
So we've been thinking about surveillance for quite a long time.

68
00:08:54,980 --> 00:09:00,950
This is often used as a way to depict how surveillance is integrated in public health.

69
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:11,450
Practice is called a surveillance loop. So we have a data collection, we collect data, and then we do analysis and reports and disseminate that data.

70
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,520
That's part of the public health system.

71
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:22,520
And then that information is sent to the health care system where there is response and intervention that occurs.

72
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:30,290
And then that that will affect the data collection, that will affect the kind of analysis,

73
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:38,330
and then the mitigation will be revised accordingly if cases are continuing to increase.

74
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:44,970
More interventions are needed if it's actually being addressed, less interventions needed.

75
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:55,370
So this loop here kind of ties the public health system with the health care system, and it's really different.

76
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,440
This is the type of thing actually that places like the CDC does quite well.

77
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:08,320
They they they and we'll talk about this how they organize data collection and do analysis, report dissemination.

78
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:15,950
Some of the critique with respect to CDC right now is both the timeliness of being able to deliver that information,

79
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:19,910
which is a key issue in an outbreak for a pandemic like COVID 19.

80
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:27,020
And also, though, the recommendations about whether to intervene or not to intervene and the policies

81
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:31,970
are also there's been a critique of that being slow with respect to the CDC.

82
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:37,700
They've never been. It's never been. Even though by title that should be what they're.

83
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:47,870
Activity is they've been much better at this collection and consolidation analysis piece, and that's clearly been their focus.

84
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:56,990
So it's important to be distinguish between active and passive surveillance.

85
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:16,320
Passive surveillance is something that's done by just collecting information that's that is just being reported without being asked.

86
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:20,990
So it's a passive way in which we collect information.

87
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:26,750
And passive surveillance is often what's happening in the public health system.

88
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:35,780
So it's. Reporter initiated active surveillance is collecting initiated.

89
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:49,100
So there's much more resources put into ensuring that data is being collected and being sent up the chain from local, regional to national.

90
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:56,419
And so, of course, is this trait of passive surveillance much cheaper to institute active surveillance,

91
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:59,630
more expensive but going to provide higher quality data?

92
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:09,350
And in reality, we can where we could be dealing with a combination of the two where active surveillance is used selectively.

93
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:13,400
And so but an active surveillance can really point out.

94
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:18,340
Things that are missing that passive surveillance will miss.

95
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:24,440
For example, and in as in studies that we've conducted in Ecuador,

96
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:29,540
we have an active surveillance going on in parallel with the Ministry of Health Passive Surveillance.

97
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:38,000
And we've been able to identify a chikungunya outbreak that occurred that was totally missed by the public health system.

98
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:42,910
The passive surveillance, which was assuming the symptoms and the cases were also super dengue.

99
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:55,640
That's what is generally seen. So that activity kind of pointed out how, you know, if there was selective active surveillance occurring,

100
00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:02,360
they would have been able to potentially catch that chicken through any outbreak which extended through a holiday season.

101
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:12,050
So lots of different ways in which information can be collected.

102
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:20,630
There's mandatory reporting on a lot of infectious diseases that are mandatory to report.

103
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:29,390
And in that case, that is is a way in which you're collecting much more reliable and consistent data.

104
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:34,480
So October 19 would be example of a mandatory reporting.

105
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:45,500
So if a clinic, somebody comes in, they're diagnosed with COVID 19, it's mandatory for that physician clinic to report to the health department.

106
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:52,550
There's laboratory based surveillance so that since laboratories come in with.

107
00:13:55,540 --> 00:14:02,170
So if a clinic has a suspect case or often send that sample to the laboratory, which diagnosis.

108
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:08,080
And so just focusing on the laboratory surveillance and as a way a surveillance can help.

109
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:14,710
Alert Health Department that something unusual is happening.

110
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:22,510
And the nice thing about a public laboratory based surveillance is that these will be considered confirmed cases.

111
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:27,280
We'll go over the definitions of confirmed a little later.

112
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:34,660
But the fact that a laboratory was able to identify the pathogen that was

113
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:42,729
suspected from a clinical visit would mean that that these are confirmed cases.

114
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:51,200
So they're considered more likely. And then the sentinel surveillance where there's sentinel populations that are used to monitor.

115
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:57,890
And this is the way you can get much higher quality data because you're focused on this population.

116
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:12,800
And so sentinel surveillance is this, again, some population that's prearranged to report cases when they if they identify them.

117
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:23,330
And there's different types in which physicians could be enrolled in this as a sentinel group clinics, hospitals and laboratories.

118
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:32,810
One example that happens in all over the country, but specifically a big activity in in California,

119
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:38,290
is using sentinel chickens to monitor for viral encephalitis.

120
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,960
So there's a lot of viral encephalitis that's circulating in Central Valley.

121
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:49,490
It only spills over to humans when when there's a lot of transmission in birds.

122
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:54,510
So they have these chickens in different people's backyards, in different places,

123
00:15:54,780 --> 00:16:00,209
in communities, and they leave these chickens periodically to see monitor for violence.

124
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:07,200
And the latest they start seeing satellite is that alerts the health department to become more

125
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:14,280
aware that cases may be coming in encephalitis or meningitis that are associated with this virus.

126
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:30,030
And also to issues. Some various control are suggestions such as because this is mosquito borne to use mosquito repellent and be a little more.

127
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:36,360
Vigilant with respect to being concerned about mosquito bites.

128
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:46,250
So this is one way which we can solve this problem of underreporting.

129
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:51,830
Again, the theme here is surveillance in general is highly underreported.

130
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:59,420
And they it's always interesting that they should they emphasize that in the in the press with respect to COVID all the time, how it's underreported.

131
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:02,390
That's just par for the course, in fact.

132
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:11,140
Covert surveillance has been in general much, much better than any other surveillance, many of the other surveillance that we've been doing.

133
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,890
But nonetheless, surveillance is going to be underreported.

134
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:29,310
Said no. Surveillance is one way to address that. So surveillance data provides information that can lead to public health action.

135
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:39,930
Right. That's where we are. So where the surveillance can do can see trends that are little, but that are a little different.

136
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:43,200
Uptrend and downtrend that can identify outbreaks.

137
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:51,390
You can identify, depending on what you're surveilling, you can actually identify changes in behavior,

138
00:17:51,390 --> 00:18:04,890
changes in practices, also changes in the actual pathogen, all things that may result in increased cases or an outbreak.

139
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:15,600
And so, again, the key to this is that surveillance needs to be tightly tied to public health and actually surveillance.

140
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,750
And it itself is only collecting data and monitoring what's happening.

141
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:28,410
If you can't link it to action and you can't have an impact with respect to public health and again.

142
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:36,250
It's not just having a link, but having a link and having it as a timely link is critical.

143
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:43,940
Over and over again we see outbreaks. We have a recently had it have it hepatitis A outbreak in Michigan.

144
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:54,960
And we did some analysis to show that, you know, the right time they actually were able to implement a vaccine, a vaccination strategy.

145
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:59,480
The outbreak was already on it. And, you know, dropping, that is.

146
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:09,170
We were we were too late that the cases, the verdict was much, much smaller than it could have been if it was even a month or so earlier.

147
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:21,920
So a big theme here is, is the timeliness between collecting information and making a decision to do something.

148
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:31,070
And again, I mentioned this before. That's not just simply an issue of, oh, somebody's got to make.

149
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:39,200
We're just not organized. It's also very risky to make decisions, making decisions early on your risk.

150
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:41,630
You're making decisions with more uncertainty.

151
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:49,160
And so it's always a risky thing to make a decision because you don't know whether or not that action needs to be taken.

152
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:53,120
But if you wait until you really know, then you're often too late.

153
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:05,860
So I alluded to this a little bit before, but so health information can be direct with or indirect,

154
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:10,149
so we can have mortality reports talked about that morbidity reports.

155
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:14,260
We talk about how that can be laboratory reports.

156
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:21,250
It could be outbreak epidemic reports, individual case investigations.

157
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:26,590
So a lot of identifying, for instance, HIV and the the AIDS outbreak.

158
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:34,270
It started with case investigations that were published about this unusual presentation of these diseases,

159
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:39,610
these very rare cancers, very rare infections that led to identifying.

160
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:50,770
HIV as initially AIDS is a syndrome and then eventually identifying the actual disease agent.

161
00:20:52,490 --> 00:21:04,820
And then we also have a host of contextual and exposure data that can be critical to interpreting these mortality and morbidity reports.

162
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:14,060
And then as well, I'll mention a little bit later, there's a lot of different databases that provide this environmental demographic data.

163
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:19,280
So some of this so here we have mortality data, which we can.

164
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,360
Gleaned from vital statistics and medical examiners data.

165
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:31,299
And they're based on these ICD ten codes.

166
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:35,950
Again, even death data we don't want to take for granted.

167
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:45,460
That is actually it in itself has can have biases associated with just the way in which these codes are developed creates certain biases.

168
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:53,860
And so we need to anytime you're using data, you want to understand where the data is coming from, how it's collected to to to best interpret.

169
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:08,569
The kinds of biases that you may get. So this is a summary of mortality registries that allowed us to allow us to create these tables,

170
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:13,130
which are sort of like the ranking of all cause death.

171
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:21,390
You could see that all of these down to number nine are not infectious diseases.

172
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:29,910
Nine is pneumonia influenza. It is noteworthy just show to observe that in 2020,

173
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:44,080
COVID 19 becomes the third most common leading cause of death in the US, second only behind heart disease and cancer.

174
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:54,179
This is a significant number of deaths that occurred in the US and highlighting

175
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:59,190
the fact that infectious diseases are still a major concern even in the US.

176
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:09,180
So. So again, morbidity data, we talked a lot about the laboratory.

177
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:13,670
We talked about the laboratory data. There's the Notifiable Disease Report.

178
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:19,500
So for diseases that are mandatory reporting, we've got these reports that come out.

179
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:21,690
Hospital data. Outpatient care data.

180
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:31,140
I just want to highlight this issue with laboratory data in low and middle income countries where co-infections common.

181
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:39,510
You know the question is what does it mean that you found giardia in this stool sample with this child that had diarrhea?

182
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:50,870
Unless you are testing for a range of pathogens, it doesn't necessarily mean that that person, that child.

183
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,510
Diarrhea was caused by diarrhea.

184
00:23:54,080 --> 00:24:05,150
And so often we use these case control design designed in order to assess whether or not something like CRT is causing the diarrhea.

185
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:12,260
So if you compare cases, those with diarrhea, with controls, these sample controls,

186
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:17,630
those without diarrhea, you find equal measures, amounts of giardia in the cases and controls.

187
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:24,710
The assumption is that the Jati is not causing the diarrhea, but there's something else causing the diarrhea.

188
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:36,890
So that's an important. Piece of work that and study design that's used in a global setting.

189
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:43,530
It's also relevant and probably more relevant to respiratory disease in the U.S. where there are multiple.

190
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:49,500
Viruses that child the child may be infected with at any given time.

191
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:59,549
That being said, what you know, we showed us some data in Ecuador that being infected with rotavirus.

192
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:06,510
And Jerry, I mean, you're more likely to have diarrhea and if you were infected with just rotavirus or just giardia.

193
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:17,790
So it looks like. So assuming that these pathogens, it looks like these pathogens do interact and result in.

194
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:22,870
Increased likelihood of having symptoms if you're co-infected.

195
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:31,569
So the important piece to be thinking about moving forward with respect to how we deal with infections,

196
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:36,880
the fact that children are likely going to be infected with more than one pathogen at a time.

197
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:50,610
So if we look at these national databases of notifiable diseases,

198
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:57,870
we see that this list changes periodically when what's causing disease is going to change.

199
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:09,780
We see that obviously with COVID 19, that's going to be a big, big have has had a big influence with respect to the notifiable diseases.

200
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:21,629
These definitions have to be standardized for this to work well and some may be

201
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:25,920
clinically diagnosed while others require laboratory confirmed confirmation.

202
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:33,690
So that kind of leads us to this idea that if it's just clinically diagnosed, it may be a suspected disease.

203
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,879
The laboratory then comes out and confirms that disease.

204
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:46,920
So you can have suspected or confirmed cases depending on the amount of evidence you have about that individual.

205
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:54,990
And so reports also can be done at an individual level or aggregate level.

206
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:59,030
Again, if it's if it's at the aggravated level, that means you got ecologic data.

207
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:04,999
And again, that's something we need to keep in mind when we're looking at aggregated or ecologic data,

208
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:11,630
the limitations of ecologic data and the ecologic fallacy and we've all been exposed to.

209
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:19,200
Doesn't allow us. We can't go from ecologic data to looking at individual level risk factors.

210
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:34,560
We need that individual level data to be able to do that. So this gives a sense of how much is actually being done in this area.

211
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:39,780
Huge number of diseases. That's 120 diseases under surveillance.

212
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:44,310
3000 public health departments are involved.

213
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:50,190
2.7 million disease events reported through this national notified system.

214
00:27:50,190 --> 00:28:00,210
So this is a huge amount of. Activity that the CDC is leading with respect to notifiable diseases.

215
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:11,370
And this is a small print, but this is a schematic of how notifiable surveillance occurs.

216
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:16,150
So first, a patient who's ill. Goes in to see a doctor.

217
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:27,960
Then there's the health care team, you know, the doctor, plus the laboratory and others that are needed to do a diagnostic.

218
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:36,499
That information then had to the is sent to the public health department has notifiable

219
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:43,010
disease and then the public health department sends all their information to the CDC.

220
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:55,830
And CDC processes that information. And in every stage the CDC can fit can can feed that into at the patient level by providing.

221
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:05,660
Information and guidance at the national level, at the health care, they can provide additional guidance to doctors about what to do.

222
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:12,140
And then with the public health departments, they can provide support in how to manage the data.

223
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:22,700
And what happens to this. Notifiable disease report depends on.

224
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:33,310
A lot of questions with respect to how urgent the follow is needed and or whether or not it's more routine.

225
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:39,460
Often what happens with the CDC is they publish these and then they are monthly mortality,

226
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:44,740
morbidity and mortality weekly reports and this information.

227
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:56,649
So these are incredibly valuable data that gets published and allows anybody to be able to publicly accessible journal that allowed anybody to

228
00:29:56,650 --> 00:30:08,550
be able to see the kinds of things that are happening with respect to outbreaks or larger scale epidemics that may be seen throughout the U.S.

229
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:18,400
The CDC functions as a way to to see what's happening on a larger scale than the regional and regional departments or local departments can do.

230
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:26,780
And they also provide this guidance back to the local in order to help with local investigations.

231
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:33,469
There's often a little bit of tension between whether or not the local team feels like they can handle local better than the CDC,

232
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:43,430
which doesn't have context. But so the CDC doesn't go in unless the local health department invites them to help with the response.

233
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:47,180
And sometimes that happens and sometimes it doesn't look.

234
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:57,810
And this gives you a sense of the timeline of reporting so the timeline doesn't happen immediately.

235
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:07,140
And because of that, we need to consider these time lags when assessing determinants of disease.

236
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:18,120
So by the time that everything time the reporting is done and you're seeing these numbers maybe weeks later,

237
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:28,650
and therefore any kind of high risk event that would have caused these cases, we have to be aware, happened weeks before that.

238
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:35,070
So that time lag is an important thing to be aware of,

239
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:43,860
especially as we as we looked at in the homework we do with deaths and deaths or even lag

240
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:50,270
more than cases because it takes time before the news gets serious and individual dies.

241
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:56,010
So we really need to think about what COVID might be a month ago that something in

242
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:01,200
the high risk events occurred before you actually see the mortality curves going up.

243
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:10,380
That happened last year with respect to when school started and a month later we saw this increase in deaths.

244
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:18,210
And that happens with a lot of other reportable diseases when measles.

245
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:24,620
Before measles. Measles vaccine. That was a very, very reliable increase.

246
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:31,590
We saw, you know, weeks after the start of school, the school was clearly a driver transmission of measles.

247
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:48,670
So I mentioned before we want to standardize our definitions of the case and this is an example of the Lyme disease and case definition in Wisconsin.

248
00:32:49,610 --> 00:33:01,920
We have this basic rash that's a type that's diagnostic of Lyme disease case that's greater than 35 centimeters in size,

249
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:14,340
and that's considered a confirmed case. This is just a note that usually the federal definition of a case requires them to be exposure.

250
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:26,640
The assumption, since the entire state of Wisconsin is endemic for Lyme disease, that everyone is exposed so they don't.

251
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:33,190
For this specific confirmed case with respect to Lyme disease in Wisconsin, they don't require that exposure.

252
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:42,710
This. And so here we just we talk there's a distinction between what a confirmed case is here,

253
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:51,050
at least one confirmatory manifestation and a lab evidence of infection as opposed to a probable case.

254
00:33:52,560 --> 00:34:01,290
Other physician diagnosed Lyme disease, not with confirmatory signs and symptoms as detailed here with the rash and lack of

255
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:08,579
evidence and then suspected case positive lab tests with no clinical information.

256
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:12,930
So you will often see. Confirm.

257
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:19,210
You know, it's some combination of these types of cases, confirmed, probable and suspected.

258
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:25,000
When you're looking at surveillance data, that's important to understand which of these you're looking at here.

259
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:32,770
You're looking at this data and then not a case B, I guess is the last category.

260
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:48,310
So here's an example of different large scale surveys that provide a wealth of information for surveillance,

261
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:59,040
in that these studies are national in scale and they share their survey data so that they collect information,

262
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:02,340
not just, you know, they may make collect blood samples.

263
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:10,930
So you get an outcome data along with a lot of exposure information about and socioeconomic status where

264
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:18,910
people live and different kinds of potentially different kinds of behavioral exposure data that these.

265
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:34,570
Different types. These three. National scale surveys are used quite a bit in public health and epidemiology

266
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:39,070
research in order to get a sense of what's happening in the general population.

267
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:47,019
And in fact, there was a huge the largest waterborne outbreak in 1993.

268
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:51,070
In Milwaukee, 400,000 people got sick from cryptosporidium.

269
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:57,130
They were able to go back to this NHANES data set and get blood samples of children to see.

270
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:01,510
How many people are actually exposed?

271
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:09,169
That is how many people converted from Sarah negative to Sarah positive for cryptosporidium before and after this outbreak.

272
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:13,520
And they were able to show that four in a thousand people got sick more likely.

273
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:17,910
But an estimated 1.6 million people were actually exposed.

274
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:27,710
So huge, huge and again, incredibly valuable data here to be able to add information to these outbreaks.

275
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:43,160
So we can get a lot of. Indirect information about status and place animal surveillance.

276
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:52,350
We talked about the Chicken Sentinel Sentinel chicken surveillance, which would be connected to one satellite as viruses like West Nile here.

277
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:57,540
So birds for West Nile would be it is basically that example looking for

278
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:03,030
looking for plague and rodents are looking for Lyme disease in deer and ticks.

279
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:09,060
Lyme disease is a tick borne virus that sustained in mammal populations like deer.

280
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:16,260
So that's that's animals here is incredibly valuable in places where we're seeing

281
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:24,530
Lyme disease or West Nile transmission to get a little bit to get some forewarning,

282
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:29,820
a potential high risk situation. Environmental data.

283
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:39,989
Often this is thought of as vector control and looking are collecting information on vectors.

284
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:50,640
How many vectors are? You can also identify what percent of the mosquitoes that one collects are actually positive for a given virus or pathogen.

285
00:37:52,440 --> 00:38:02,190
And we'll talk about this later. But wastewater the wastewater sampling for COVID that's being very used quite

286
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:09,150
a bit now is an example of environmental data looking at drug utilization.

287
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:13,050
So how much do they actually.

288
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:19,230
The way in which they identified that cryptosporidium outbreak in 1993 in Milwaukee,

289
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:29,310
was that all the shelves were clear of anti-viral over-the-counter medication and that that's what it took actually,

290
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:42,139
actually to identify this outbreak. And then variety of other absenteeism is another way in which we can gather

291
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:49,250
information about indirect information about potential outbreaks like the occurrence.

292
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:56,740
And absenteeism is actually an example of this syndromic surveillance.

293
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:59,639
Syndromic surveillance has been talked about a lot.

294
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:07,080
It's been talked about a lot in the context of using machine learning and very advanced techniques to be able to identify,

295
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:13,830
again, early warning of something occurring in the population.

296
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:29,340
And so the issue, though, is, of course, it's easy to attain, but the results can be very biased because these syndromes,

297
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:39,630
the syndromic symptoms and you're looking at a very broad spectrum and not specific to any given pathogen necessarily.

298
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:50,790
And so there's still a question to how valuable syndromic surveillance is actually going to be in, even with using.

299
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:58,680
Machine learning techniques and actually identifying early warning as an early warning system.

300
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:07,070
Do not surveillance for detecting transmission from animals to humans.

301
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:12,930
Again, we talked about most of these already with respect to testing of vectors, setting of flocks.

302
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:18,590
There's you know, connecting with veterinarians, though,

303
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:25,650
is probably something that's newly appreciated with this one health concept of connecting animals,

304
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:29,730
humans and the environment together as an integrated system.

305
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:39,560
A lot of what happens. In these different government agencies as if they're siloed in their individual activities.

306
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:45,250
So EPA, that's focused on the environment, may not communicate as well as we would like.

307
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:51,240
And due to the CDC or the FDA, who's in charge of what's happening on farms and such,

308
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:58,080
so the integration of these kind of surveillance is something that still needs a lot

309
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:03,810
of work with respect to crossing over these different silos of government agencies.

310
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:15,870
So next set of slides talking about ways in which, again, as we talked about,

311
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:24,210
as I mentioned, that surveillance is always underreported and the extent to.

312
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:31,129
That underreporting is going to be a function of the surveillance system active versus passive.

313
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:35,360
For instance, severity of the disease is much easier to identify.

314
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:41,060
It's more ensnared in disease, sensitivity and specificity of the case definition.

315
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:50,330
Available resources. And I note here that a major source of funds come from the CDC, and they they make a lot of you know,

316
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:57,740
they're making their own internal decision on what kind of resources are given to different diseases.

317
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:04,000
And so. How do we deal with this under-reporting?

318
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:11,330
Have you considered cases detected from a variety of different sources?

319
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:17,630
And so that way you're increase the chances and different study designs,

320
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:24,560
increasing the chances that you're going to actually catch these cases or catch more cases.

321
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:31,940
But of course, is that an account for the fact that there are some cases that are going to be under the radar for all and all these different systems?

322
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:38,239
We can adjust cases by probability of being identified by a surveillance.

323
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:42,530
We'll talk about that a little bit. But you can create these probability trees.

324
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:48,860
We can estimate the total number of cases through a capture recapture method.

325
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:59,420
We'll talk about that shortly also. So it gives you a way to, again, estimate this under ascertainment and correction factor.

326
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:08,470
And actually probably the best way in which the idea to estimate the underreporting of these are community based cohort studies.

327
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:18,370
To do a community based cohort study in parallel with an active surveillance system gives you a way to calibrate that surveillance system.

328
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,930
That last one is going to be the most expensive one to be able to deal with.

329
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:28,150
So here's an example of the probability tree for underreporting.

330
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:38,320
So we can see this is just conceptually, you know, we can see the nice this is a nice way to think about it.

331
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:45,400
You know, we get a case in the community. What's the probability that person visits a physician?

332
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:51,760
What's the probability that physician test the stool has been in a pathogen?

333
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:55,420
What's the probability that that stool test is positive?

334
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:59,530
That's the do again with the sensitivity specificity of the test.

335
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:05,769
And then what's the probability that that physician will actually be notified and report out,

336
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:12,250
which is not and again, not a guarantee, even if even for mandatory cases.

337
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:19,190
So. Maybe difficult to estimate these different probabilities,

338
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:26,330
but there are different ways in which you could you could you could see conducting studies that you had a sense of these different probabilities.

339
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:32,420
And if you can, you can develop this notifiable fraction.

340
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:40,940
So that gives you a separate scale or quantity to ascertain underreporting.

341
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:53,060
This just kind of shows again, the tip of the iceberg kind of. I think that illustrates basically what that probability tree illustrates.

342
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:05,030
So the other way in which people use are try and get at underreporting is through this capture recapture approach.

343
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:17,330
And so the idea here is that you've got to Sam, if you want to use at least two samples and each sample identifies cases.

344
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:27,860
So sample one identifies capital and cases sample to identify and lower case end cases.

345
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:36,440
And then there's lower case end cases, which are the total cases that appear in both these two different surveillance systems.

346
00:45:39,650 --> 00:45:44,330
So if you want to estimate the true number of cases.

347
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:56,210
Then it's basically the sampled case number in sample one capital M times scaling factor

348
00:45:56,570 --> 00:46:04,220
lowercase and over lowercase m So this is what we'd call the bias adjustment and factor.

349
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:06,140
And it basically.

350
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:19,530
Is adjusting for how many cases did we miss in sample one if in and am are equal you know so that that that then the adjustment factor is just one

351
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:31,290
that's basically saying that sample one in sample to completely coincide that every every case that sample one finds and finds and vice versa.

352
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:38,160
So this so if you can get at at least two samples in the more samples you can do,

353
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:43,169
you increase your physical power in this in estimating this bias adjustment.

354
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:48,930
But for here for illustrative purposes, we're looking at two systems.

355
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:54,690
And again, there can be a mandatory reporting system.

356
00:46:55,140 --> 00:47:00,750
There could be another an enhanced large scale survey that's done.

357
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:06,480
So there's these different types of surveillance platforms that are looking at the same outcome.

358
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:17,760
Our ways in which we can get at use this capture recapture method in order to get this under ascertainment.

359
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:24,090
The key thing here is that we're assuming that these data sources are independent, not dependent on each other.

360
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:38,340
So this is just a few ways in which we can get at how much our estimate, how much under-reporting is occurring in a surveillance system.

361
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:46,020
So just quickly go over the next set of slides, which is again.

362
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:52,870
Should be our view with respect to, you know,

363
00:47:52,930 --> 00:48:01,180
that the use of high sensitivity and specificity in order to get at and to

364
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:06,340
what extent we are measuring the true disease of interest and also predictive,

365
00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:18,219
positive predictive value and negative predictive value. To get at how what what a proportion of those again with a positive test that have the

366
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:22,330
condition or the proportion of those with a negative test that don't have a condition.

367
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:31,479
So these are valuable metrics to use in order to cast at least one aspect.

368
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:39,880
In that probability, three or few of these aspects of they probably have a probability tree assessment of underreporting.

369
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:52,230
And this is again. Just giving you the formulas for sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value.

370
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:56,220
Given you have a two by two test or again, you need a gold standard,

371
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:09,720
that is sort of your truth that you're going to compare against your test in order to gain these estimates of these metrics.

372
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:15,100
And this again, this shows that trade off.

373
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:25,780
You know, we have a healthy person, a true negative, a false negative, a disease person, a true positive and a false positive.

374
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:32,350
So sensitivity is a measure of true positive rate specificity to measure up to a negative rate.

375
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:37,120
And we get this trade off like the cutoff value for what, a positive test.

376
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:46,810
You know, when when a test is positive versus negative means you have this tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity.

377
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:51,790
And so how do you increase sensitivity and specificity?

378
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:56,490
We need to have some sort of technological innovation.

379
00:49:56,500 --> 00:50:05,620
So PCR would have been a good example of an improvement over a culture technique that guys were able to increase their sensitivity and specificity.

380
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:12,790
And this slide show is, again, a basic property of positive predictive value and negative predictive value,

381
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:20,470
where as the prevalence increases, the positive predictive value increases, the negative predictive value decreases.

382
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:27,490
So I think I'm going to stop here so we can get to the discussion.

383
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:36,040
And this confidentiality confidentiality of data is something that we would talk about because it's very obviously important with respect

384
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:52,900
to HIV and this idea that how to remain confidential with respect to HIV but still allow for contact tracing this little bit about how,

385
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:55,899
you know, we by modernizing technology,

386
00:50:55,900 --> 00:51:05,680
we can address a lot of issues with respect to improving our surveillance and making our surveillance more efficient.

387
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:12,460
Like, you know, these electronic health records have been a great, huge innovation,

388
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:18,100
but a lot I think I read recently how, you know, you've got a range of.

389
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:26,170
A different clinics and regions within even the U.S.,

390
00:51:26,770 --> 00:51:32,410
some of which are still using paper and some of which have very advanced electronic health records.

391
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:36,219
And so we need to be very aware of that.

392
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:42,950
Again, when we're interpreting surveillance data as zero, it hasn't always been a zero 11.

393
00:51:43,450 --> 00:51:48,860
Give it a look or collect that data. And I'll you look at this.

394
00:51:51,060 --> 00:52:05,300
But this was just time to give an example of an emerging infection program that collects a lot of good data with respect to different influenzas,

395
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:14,190
foodborne illness and bacterial infections. And that each of these slides kind of gives you a sense of what these different

396
00:52:14,190 --> 00:52:21,600
programs to net this active bacterial course surveillance pulse net and vaccine

397
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:28,020
adverse event reporting systems that are doing with respect to collecting surveillance

398
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:32,610
data and adding to the information that we have about these different program,

399
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,980
different outcomes. And again,

400
00:52:35,310 --> 00:52:45,900
these different surveillance programs can be used in this capture recapture technique to estimate under ascertainment of our main reporting systems.

401
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:52,150
So. That.

402
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:06,200
To include a discussion of questions that got three here.

403
00:53:08,870 --> 00:53:14,720
COVID 19 surveillance has been integral to public policy decisions for the past two and a half years.

404
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:21,739
Again, making surveillance much more apparent to the public than it had been in the past two cases.

405
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:29,600
Hospitalizations and deaths are tracked. How are they? How have the reliability of these indicators changed from the beginning of the pandemic now?

406
00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:39,860
What are the strengths, the limitations of the agent? The that strategy question one and question to even we're in a new phase of the pandemic.

407
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:47,510
Where should our investment in public health, recent public health, be focused on now using this information?

408
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:52,250
I gave some examples of contact tracing, vaccine coverage, awareness,

409
00:53:52,490 --> 00:54:02,540
clear messaging on masking distancing and then and and discuss why in the last one COVID 19 as popularized environmental sewage surveillance.

410
00:54:02,930 --> 00:54:03,950
Talk about that a bit.

411
00:54:05,230 --> 00:54:15,760
This is a form of sentinel surveillance to discuss ways that sewage surveillance can aid and public health departments beyond COVID 19 surveillance.

412
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:21,620
So microbiologists have been surveilling the sewage for decades and decades and decades.

413
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:29,530
It's only recently that public health departments and public health as a field has seen the potential value of this.

414
00:54:29,530 --> 00:54:42,430
So why don't you discuss different way, different pathogens and diseases that might benefit from this kind of environmental sewage surveillance?

415
00:54:46,350 --> 00:55:13,729
Okay. I'm just talking about like the other alternative.

416
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:18,410
It is in your face. That is everything.

417
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:24,990
But I mean, just the sense that it hasn't been reset.

418
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:36,560
You don't think? Oh, yeah, I guess I didn't like that.

419
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:44,280
Do you feel like you've gotten more reliable just in case?

420
00:55:44,930 --> 00:56:05,200
No. I mean, it seems to have some of pathogens on you that you would have more research and less with me today.

421
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:25,120
So, actually, I mean, in a way, you. No, I don't think it's like I think they don't want that.

422
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:33,120
I don't know what's happening in the middle.

423
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:51,300
She's my you know, you got that. You know, my mom's not like she had, like, concerns about what was happening.

424
00:56:51,550 --> 00:57:01,650
It's not the universe, you know, but they were the I was just trying to help, you know, I didn't like how they kind of like it because,

425
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:10,920
like, you know, it's not because I just don't like a lot of times it's not like saying no.

426
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:24,890
And I did like some things. I mean, obviously your friends, I know you yourself have a lot of time.

427
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:28,500
Did you see shopping?

428
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:34,240
Yeah. I spoke to international experts at the hospital.

429
00:57:34,490 --> 00:57:48,580
Honestly, I didn't realize to get, like, the comedy really bad response from, like, a very dark side.

430
00:57:48,810 --> 00:57:56,750
The first thing I think is kind of like shading girls.

431
00:58:00,830 --> 00:58:08,149
Oh, science. Think that's the way you ask questions?

432
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:13,200
Like, how do we have to like, you know,

433
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:24,220
it's like I was expecting like I was thinking one and I just like they have like is

434
00:58:24,230 --> 00:58:35,630
it is it really was I thought it was like because everything did stop and I'm like,

435
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:53,390
I am I used to think and I kind of like, Are you guys out of it?

436
00:58:54,110 --> 00:58:55,510
Yeah. Yeah.

437
00:58:55,800 --> 00:59:22,480
It seems like the average is like, you know, this is before you get a chance to answer that, you know, I would you know, it would be an expense.

438
00:59:22,670 --> 00:59:34,040
Like, how would you like that would be like yelling, give me a break.

439
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:55,040
I mean, you know, was like so I was thinking when I was just thinking about it directly, not be so like attention.

440
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:03,790
Seems like a good time and you just have to certainly be testing for it.

441
01:00:03,790 --> 01:00:07,600
So then it would show that it's not slides, right?

442
01:00:08,710 --> 01:00:12,250
But there's different ways.

443
01:00:12,790 --> 01:00:24,790
I wanted to ask creators because I would have to run higher power lines.

444
01:00:26,830 --> 01:00:33,910
But my call for I like to argue this line was like, I'm trying to vote.

445
01:00:36,290 --> 01:00:40,520
Like somebody would say, okay, let's look for it.

446
01:00:40,590 --> 01:00:54,010
Another so you can do that every single day and think about doing any specific things like bacteria or something like that.

447
01:00:54,010 --> 01:01:03,070
So running through my like I guess how important that is.

448
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:27,160
I always remember her name or if it came to me and I know when you guys theory is I'd like to know, tell me more.

449
01:01:27,170 --> 01:01:35,530
But right now I'm not I'm certainly probably not at the Health Department.

450
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:44,880
So I, I think it's probably something I came back more useful when I,

451
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:57,190
it was like the pathogens that are causing diseases like you said, early seventies unless really think of that.

452
01:01:57,460 --> 01:02:06,610
Yeah. It's like a maybe it would be a significant waste of resources for something that an animal surveillance but I guess sometimes you

453
01:02:06,610 --> 01:02:20,200
get to be honest and you want to use it in combination with oh we're seeing now clinics the manifestation of how they can make it.

454
01:02:20,530 --> 01:02:31,899
So like at the start when it was you could maybe try it at the time be that again, hands on.

455
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:37,950
Why are you using their past performance announcements of early warning and waiting for the situation

456
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:53,190
if it is just to even though is because of the presence generated by polio knows that once enough.

457
01:02:54,400 --> 01:03:15,309
So everybody is everybody in the country that you actually research and even to

458
01:03:15,310 --> 01:03:28,630
think that I was really expecting to hear something like what's it been like?

459
01:03:29,250 --> 01:03:36,130
You know, and I was like, that's not what if this is a bad situation?

460
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:42,790
You have something to tell me.

461
01:03:44,020 --> 01:04:00,190
Mr. President, I appreciate your time on my marriage and my dad's speech.

462
01:04:01,570 --> 01:04:07,450
But even so, I need to ask you.

463
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:25,050
I see both sides, cause it's like you think you're going to think about things like that.

464
01:04:26,610 --> 01:04:33,400
And I think I was lost by all means.

465
01:04:33,850 --> 01:04:42,550
So I think it's kind of like, I don't know.

466
01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:54,800
It's kind of like that. I don't know what they say when someone dies.

467
01:04:57,470 --> 01:05:08,420
So it's like explicitly saying, Oh, it's my fault.

468
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:30,410
Diet Coke Wastewater Census shows that, like I told you.

469
01:05:31,010 --> 01:05:45,400
I think every now and then, I'm going to get more concerned about that.

470
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:55,970
I think. I don't know anything about it.

471
01:05:55,990 --> 01:06:12,600
So I was like, the picture is not because this crisis, as far as I know, that's just for less reliable.

472
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:22,710
And like not, it is impossible for the user because I don't know either.

473
01:06:24,090 --> 01:06:27,149
I think it's interesting to see what it might be,

474
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:45,900
which as this thing and I think it is the only thing that matters more to the specific to the specific screen.

475
01:06:45,910 --> 01:06:50,520
That's crap. Because I to be like, I know what I'm talking about.

476
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:57,860
The screens are the requirements for me specifically for the screen to take like a picture.

477
01:06:58,380 --> 01:07:08,160
So it's amazing the refrain that I would write because the US government only two or three months ago.

478
01:07:09,060 --> 01:07:21,050
So if they did that, they would just consider the content cards are going to be know.

479
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:29,730
I couldn't stand out. It's like, you know, I think you're right.

480
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:41,210
If you're lucky enough to be friends or whatever, you know, if you have any of these, like I think, you know,

481
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:55,340
like these people around you may want to be a little bit more of your calls and to see exactly the same.

482
01:07:57,220 --> 01:08:01,550
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

483
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:20,760
So this has been going on. I know several people that are going to go to dinner tonight and so I would say something like that.

484
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:38,100
I would just go to Social Security checks and go back and it's just like makes it look more like your password.

485
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:52,440
Sorry, something. I think so. And so the fact is, you know, I mean,

486
01:08:52,440 --> 01:09:02,790
it's just like I suppose you want to talk about the fact that you tried to let me know when can I get more information?

487
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:10,920
And that's why that instrument especially I think because I think you sound like nobody is there yet.

488
01:09:10,970 --> 01:09:14,740
I think it's just because like you.

489
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:22,760
Easy. It was nice meeting you.

490
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:37,760
Really. And there were some interesting stories, you know, about how they lost their jobs.

491
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:52,960
Well, yeah, and we're just still like, you know, we're trying to figure out how.

492
01:09:53,120 --> 01:10:08,010
To be honest. I don't think you can do this now.

493
01:10:11,070 --> 01:10:15,780
You know, I'm really glad you did.

494
01:10:18,090 --> 01:10:21,150
It is necessary. Yeah? Yeah.

495
01:10:22,050 --> 01:10:26,340
Do you feel that? You know. Okay, let's go.

496
01:10:26,340 --> 01:10:33,900
Reporting on the power of the government. Start with one or two, maybe.

497
01:10:33,930 --> 01:10:45,209
Let's focus. Let's start with one and question one. So we we're talking about like cases sort of being unreliable to women in the pandemic.

498
01:10:45,210 --> 01:10:50,310
But then as it's become more widespread and people like it, has it become more available,

499
01:10:50,670 --> 01:10:55,770
people are less likely not at home passing to less likely to report out their cases,

500
01:10:56,310 --> 01:11:05,130
to the more surprised that there is a sweet spot in the middle where things are a lot more reliable when you have to go someplace to get tested.

501
01:11:06,530 --> 01:11:16,280
Okay. And also, we talked about like how hospitalizations are less reliable because as Amanda from last lecture last week,

502
01:11:16,670 --> 01:11:22,700
she talked about how only 20% of individuals who come to you about three times positive were there for COVID.

503
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:26,899
And the rest are there for other reasons to write.

504
01:11:26,900 --> 01:11:33,800
And it's always puzzling why they, I guess. Did she talk about why they couldn't have disaggregated that data?

505
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:38,500
It seems like there must be something difficult about which I don't I'm not aware of that.

506
01:11:38,910 --> 01:11:46,820
The fact that the difference between data coming there because of COVID versus coming there and being tested for their.

507
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:56,390
Okay. And then the only other thing I know is that tests have been pretty reliable for them, but they're not say whether they did or not.

508
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:03,320
Right. And again, it's just that, you know, what's the one thing that people don't why?

509
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:09,070
Why people are always being shying away from death. For what reason?

510
01:12:11,020 --> 01:12:18,089
Since the beginning. I mean, it could be like I know there is complaints that are getting like that,

511
01:12:18,090 --> 01:12:21,960
like a car accident and like, oh, they had coverage system, but they died from the car.

512
01:12:22,150 --> 01:12:28,200
Right. Right. Well, that that's actually there's some people are worried about like the testing, like the reporting out for that is incorrect.

513
01:12:28,290 --> 01:12:34,589
And sometimes. And that's an interesting issue about death certificates and how death certificates are filled out.

514
01:12:34,590 --> 01:12:39,000
And so that's death registry is that's one of the biases you need to be aware of.

515
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:47,070
But it's the like also they people have talked about it being a lag indicator and not that easy to estimate what the lag was.

516
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:59,150
Okay. Any group to anything to add to that discussed.

517
01:13:01,130 --> 01:13:08,030
The other aspects not to question are not to question what they cover.

518
01:13:08,030 --> 01:13:12,820
But we said, okay, you won. And then the question to.

519
01:13:17,450 --> 01:13:21,040
We said that the vaccination coverage should be.

520
01:13:23,150 --> 01:13:29,150
Where we should prioritize most of our investments because that's probably the most effective

521
01:13:29,150 --> 01:13:34,880
measure and mitigate the spread of COVID and also decreasing cases and hospitalizations and deaths.

522
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:48,950
And also contact tracing is still probably important, but I guess with vaccination right now, it's not as important.

523
01:13:48,950 --> 01:13:53,270
And then while other measures might be beneficial, like.

524
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:57,790
Awareness and asking and clear messaging.

525
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:04,300
People have a lot of COVID fatigue, so they're not really as willing to listen or follow that anymore.

526
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:13,130
Right? Right. What? Maybe I've seen group three can chime in on this.

527
01:14:13,430 --> 01:14:18,140
With respect to contact tracing, when does contact tracing actually become less useful?

528
01:14:20,830 --> 01:14:25,990
When you have like rampant community spread where it's so prevalent that everyone has a contact.

529
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:30,820
Right now we're kind of getting that is not where we are.

530
01:14:30,820 --> 01:14:33,610
One wouldn't call it rapid. Spread it just like it's just.

531
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:39,879
It's just a lot of COVID going around and just like there's a lot of other viruses going around.

532
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:50,820
And so contact tracing becomes most useful in this beginning phase of an outbreak and trying to squash these isolated cases.

533
01:14:50,830 --> 01:14:56,730
But if it's the more it's look, the more it's looking endemic and we're sort of heading in that direction.

534
01:14:58,380 --> 01:15:01,740
The less useful contact case, the.

535
01:15:06,510 --> 01:15:09,540
Any other thoughts on this question? Do.

536
01:15:21,870 --> 01:15:30,930
But we talk a lot about vaccine coverage. What is what what kind of activity with that entail right now?

537
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:36,740
They're both trying to get people vaccinated for the first time.

538
01:15:37,910 --> 01:15:48,200
And then there's also trying to get some people vaccinated. Yeah, definitely making sure that there's more administration of the Bivalent vaccine,

539
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:53,330
since it's more efficacy and you don't have to wait as long after any previous shot to get it.

540
01:15:53,840 --> 01:16:01,770
It's a clear priority point right now. So how would make the messaging be different depending on where you're dealing with?

541
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:12,900
If you're in an area that's typically has like flu vaccination rates, you're probably going to like of any vaccine, like any part of the vaccine,

542
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:17,940
probably going to want to target more hesitancy to talk about how it's efficacy

543
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:22,409
and safe and especially target areas that have high pockets of hesitancy.

544
01:16:22,410 --> 01:16:28,770
Whereas if you're in an area that's historically had high uptake on the initial dose,

545
01:16:28,770 --> 01:16:34,799
then a broader message, just about its availability probably and highlighting on accessibility.

546
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:36,660
Just so because everyone's going to want to get it,

547
01:16:36,660 --> 01:16:41,000
just getting them in the door so you don't have to be as directed than you would be in a community.

548
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:50,320
So what are you. There's actually I just saw an interview in honor of Lewinsky, the director of the CDC,

549
01:16:50,330 --> 01:16:58,010
and said one interesting thing that makes a lot of sense for vaccine hesitant people.

550
01:17:01,550 --> 01:17:09,680
There's two approaches. One could be just trying to convince them and, you know, give them more information, basically.

551
01:17:10,430 --> 01:17:16,940
And that certainly works for a certain crowd group of people that are in this, again, continuum.

552
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:22,100
But there's also this aspect of just listening to them first.

553
01:17:22,820 --> 01:17:26,880
I think we have a tendency to like what we understand, that vaccines are important.

554
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:31,670
We understand if you look at them, we just need to give them the right information and give them that.

555
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:37,920
And I don't change their mind and. That skips a step.

556
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:47,490
We really do want to understand why these people are hesitant and there's a wide variety of reasons why they might be hesitant.

557
01:17:47,490 --> 01:17:50,940
So listening first, you know, it's music, he said.

558
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:59,159
Yeah, I really love that you said that, because I also think that sometimes the conversation among scientists in reference to vaccine

559
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:03,899
hesitancy kind of ignores also the fact that scientists have also done some really unethical,

560
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:11,340
horrible things that have led, especially historically oppressed communities, to be mistrustful of doctors and scientists.

561
01:18:11,550 --> 01:18:16,890
And so when we deny people and say, oh, you're just being stupid, it's like you're also like you raising a lot of history.

562
01:18:18,450 --> 01:18:22,410
Yeah. No, I think that's probably true. And it's true.

563
01:18:22,890 --> 01:18:28,950
We talked about this. I think the forward the polio eradication campaigns in Pakistan where we you know.

564
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:35,520
Use these. He's asking you to figure out where you've been.

565
01:18:36,210 --> 01:18:39,360
And there was a lot of distrust.

566
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:41,880
But what did you hear that?

567
01:18:42,810 --> 01:18:50,520
VAX Vaccination in Pakistan is really difficult now because the way that they infiltrated Osama bin Laden's compound was through.

568
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:59,580
Yeah, that's what I. Yeah, yeah. And so, like, you know, because they utilize a public health practitioner to for militaristic purposes,

569
01:18:59,850 --> 01:19:03,240
now vaccine practitioners are being shot in the streets.

570
01:19:04,260 --> 01:19:10,020
Yeah. It wasn't very no you know not looking at the long view with that strategy at all.

571
01:19:10,050 --> 01:19:17,430
Yeah. Now I think that that's, that's an extreme example of and there's mistrust at all different levels and there's

572
01:19:17,430 --> 01:19:22,110
certainly reasons to be mistrustful of big corporations that are developing.

573
01:19:23,660 --> 01:19:30,530
Vaccines that have been public. So we. And that may or may not be the reason why somebody vaccine hesitant.

574
01:19:31,210 --> 01:19:37,660
It could be it could be for a completely different. So listening is is a key part.

575
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:48,190
This. So crude for questioning the last question about surveillance.

576
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:58,480
So we kind of talked about how with surveillance, like with other misuses, it gives officials the.
