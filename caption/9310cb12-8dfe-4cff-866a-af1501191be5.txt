1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,750
Okay. So today we're going to do carbohydrate digestion.

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:10,260
So following up on the sort of internal carbs.

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,259
So we're going to do carbohydrate digestion.

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:18,210
And I will talk about early today that's going to lead us into things that are not digested effectively, which are effectively fibers.

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:23,820
I don't need this into the microbiome. And then we're going to go all the way back to what happens after the carbohydrates are absorbed.

6
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,760
So that's the plan for the next the next week.

7
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:35,850
So I mentioned this last class, but the number one take home message to remember is that to understand, to understand if something is digestible,

8
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:43,050
all you really need to understand is what the like acidic bond is and whether or not we have an enzyme for that, like you said.

9
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,700
Right. And so there's a lot of potential electrostatic bond out there. I'll go through some examples in a moment.

10
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:53,370
But to understand that particular enzyme is going to work on it, you need to understand what the bond is.

11
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:59,790
And do we have a thing? Do we have a thing that that can digest it?

12
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,440
So it turns out there's actually only five enzymes.

13
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:09,510
Six, if you count up to nine, lies in slime in the pancreas that can do any of the digestion at all.

14
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:15,480
And in fact, one of those like taste, many of us, as I'll talk about later today, don't even have as adults.

15
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:20,190
And two of them sucrose in my saltiness are actually the same same protein.

16
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:25,680
It's a bi functional protein that has two different activities. One of us, your great side, one of the isolated side.

17
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,930
So this is the entire complement of like positives is that we can make ourselves right.

18
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:37,620
So of all of the possible orientations of, like you say, bonds, these are the only ones that we can digest.

19
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,800
And to sort of I like this diagram here.

20
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:47,430
So these are our types of dietary carbohydrates and these are all different sources of dietary carbohydrates that we've made ingest.

21
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:52,319
And you can see a lot of these are probably saturated. Some of them are no doctor from the bicycle.

22
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,790
As you can see, the whole blues, different sugars, glucose, lactose, fructose.

23
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,780
And it's none of these things like that with a whole different variety of and

24
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,410
lots and lots of possible things that we might decide to to try to ingest.

25
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:10,260
But there's only three that we can actually break down ourselves. So sucrose starch and then I'm including.

26
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:17,580
And starch, maltose and ice. All right. So this huge variety of things that we consume, almost all of these are digestible by quality.

27
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:24,070
And in fact, one of these which is up here is lactose, which again, the majority of us on the planet can't digest ourselves.

28
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,890
So if you ignore that, then really we can only digest these.

29
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:34,440
All of these other carbohydrates that we may ingest here would be grouped into largely what we're going to call pipers.

30
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,969
And we'll talk of the fibers next class. Right?

31
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:41,730
So the diversity of things that we can eat versus the diversity of things that we can digest is is absolutely right.

32
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:45,930
And it's only because we have this very limited complement of, like I said.

33
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:52,470
But okay, so before I get on to talking more about fiber, we're going to take a lot of sidetrack.

34
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:59,100
We're going to take a skip over to kill, which is to me, this week's food is a little.

35
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,010
Oh, I am surrounded by science. They are we talking about kale?

36
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:23,780
All right, so what is kale? Kale is a leafy green vegetable originally from countries in the Mediterranean.

37
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,890
It has made its way around the world through migration, as well as importation.

38
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:31,220
And as of now, California produces the most amount of kale. The U.S.

39
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,890
So Kim comes in different shapes and forms.

40
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:42,790
As I said above, we have green killed, dwarf kale, marrows, then kale, curly leaf kale, scotch kale tree kill and boar kill.

41
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:46,690
There are many others that have been listed above all of the above.

42
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:52,210
Most of these are due to the climate or the environment in which they're grown.

43
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:58,600
However, Cornell University is actually creating a genetically modified version of Kill, which will be out in a couple of years.

44
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:03,040
I have attached the link in the references if you guys are interested in taking a look at that.

45
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:09,250
They are hoping that they can alter the taste as well as the appearance to make it a little more favorable for consumers.

46
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,000
We also have organic and non-organic.

47
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:18,399
Organic kill has fewer pesticides than non-organic kill does.

48
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:24,880
But as far as nutrients go on there, roughly the same. So we can't classify organic to be healthier than that of.

49
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:33,850
So the USDA food database did show raw kale, which is classified as fragile and then frozen kale.

50
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:37,720
So I decided to compare them both and just kind of see the industry content.

51
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:50,110
So in 100 grams of fresh or raw kale, we see that there are 2.92 grams of protein, 4.2 sorry, 4.42 grams of carbohydrates and 1.49 grams of lipids.

52
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:55,060
And of the 4.42 grams of carbohydrates, 4.1 of those are fibers.

53
00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:01,120
And then the remaining point eight to come from sugars and fruit juice comes in.

54
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:06,100
I mean, sorry, fruit just makes the point more grams and then glucose makes up 0.4 grams.

55
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:11,450
And then there are multiple vitamins and minerals and kale.

56
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,860
However, calcium, potassium and vitamin C are the most abundant.

57
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:28,620
Now taking a look at frozen kale. We do see an increase in proteins as well as carbohydrates and water structure, but we do see a decrease in lipids.

58
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:38,040
As you can see here, there is one gram of sugars added in and that comes from sucrose, which our body obviously doesn't digest.

59
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:42,660
So we will need sucrose in order to break that down into glucose and toast.

60
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:53,770
And then we also see a decrease in micronutrients and they believe this is due to the process in which B, kale is frozen and then boiled.

61
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:59,740
So preparation of kill. Kill can come in various forms.

62
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:06,310
Like I said before, you can have it raw, boiled, blended, steamed, sauteed air fried or even powdered.

63
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:12,220
However, like we saw in the nutrient contents, raw will be the most nutrient dense.

64
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:22,400
Right now the health benefits. So a study was ran and they tested 11 different hypotheses or health benefits of kill.

65
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:32,150
And they did find that good kill being a great source of fiber, essential amino acids, calcium, potassium and antioxidants.

66
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:39,650
It's been proven to improve gut help, prevent cardiovascular disease and decrease the likelihood of developing certain cancers.

67
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:44,240
It has also been proven to have anti-inflammatory activity.

68
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:49,550
And then fun fact that calcium and kale is actually more bioavailable than the calcium in milk.

69
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:54,770
So our body is able to absorb it and use it more effectively and efficiently.

70
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:00,360
All right. So kale, spinach, which is the superior green.

71
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:05,650
I told myself I wasn't going to make this joke, but MSE was definitely the superior green period here.

72
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:15,900
This study did run the significance in kale and spinach and their health benefits, as well as their nutrient contents.

73
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:22,170
And kale had the greatest amount of calcium and phosphorus, and it also had the greatest concentration of amino acids among the two.

74
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:29,580
However, there wasn't a clear winner because they're both packed with nutrients, so we should be incorporating both of them into our diets.

75
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:35,339
And if any of you are like me, I've never actually made kill myself.

76
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:38,400
I've always gotten it in smoothies or from salads and restaurants.

77
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:43,920
So I have attached review recipes if you are interested in incorporating a little more into your diet.

78
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:52,950
So yeah. Any questions.

79
00:07:54,090 --> 00:08:00,250
Elizabeth, for those issues that Cornell, what like when they talk about making it more appealing to consumers.

80
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:10,740
Explain how they're attempting to do that. So they were meeting with a few of the kids that were interested in doing this, like doing this research.

81
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,980
And a few of the kids said that the taste was too bland.

82
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,600
So they are still in the works of it.

83
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:23,670
I think that's why it's going to take a couple of years until they figure out, I guess, how to alter the taste and the appearance of pills.

84
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:32,100
So yeah. So you come across that too much can actually be harmful for you?

85
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:41,280
Not that I remember, but I can take a look at that and then post it on Gaza for you because I actually looked into it before.

86
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:49,709
Oh, okay. Might be TMI, but I would kill the way that I turned orange because it's like the palms of your hand and your elbows

87
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:52,830
and your knees and the bottom of your feet literally turn orange because you're eating too much.

88
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,820
I think it was from the vitamin E. That's so. Yeah, just so yellow.

89
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:01,020
How much detail were you just literally eating it everyday?

90
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:06,540
Like I was putting it in my morning morning smoothies and then I was having a salad like every day for dinner,

91
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,500
like a chicken salad, rice pudding, kale and books. So twice a day? Yeah, basically.

92
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:21,690
Okay. So back to the Cornell study.

93
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,160
Why do you think fur kills specifically? They're trying to make it more appealing, like out of all the vegetables.

94
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:31,590
I know it's like the more popular recently, but just like the culture that's social,

95
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:35,640
like steak, more like right now, kale has been trending for the past couple of years.

96
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:39,900
It is deemed the superior green or the super green.

97
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:46,829
And I feel like since it has that healthy connotation, a lot of people are wanting to incorporate into their diet.

98
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:53,280
But if they don't like the taste of it or it's not as appealing, especially if they are a picky eater, but they're trying to eat a little healthier.

99
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:57,630
Maybe they're trying to, I don't know, alter it for those individuals.

100
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:05,570
Open helps answer your question. I was just curious. Your nutrient content, you had it in 100 grams light.

101
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:09,800
That seems like it'd be like a lot of kale. Like how much in cups with that?

102
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:13,610
So I don't remember how much it wasn't cups.

103
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:17,630
There was the cups option, but I was like, You know what,

104
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:23,000
let's just take a look at like the broader are like the biggest I guess serving size but I want to say.

105
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:29,300
It might have been 24 grams, but I can get back to you on that cup.

106
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:33,020
Yeah, that's it. It's one cup. 100 grams. Just one cup.

107
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:37,370
Is it. Has this half a cup is 50 grams. So I won't.

108
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:59,050
Okay. Good. Thank you. Okay.

109
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:05,910
Great. Okay. So that was a good entree into I she's not but I'll make a transition.

110
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:10,680
You know she mentioned that kale is a highly bioavailable. So I think going back to the question of like why kale?

111
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:15,150
Why are people pushing out, pushing ideas that we should be kale were what is that?

112
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:18,570
At least for me growing up, I never had I probably thought it was like 25.

113
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:22,050
I never heard of it until I moved to Michigan. And it's not like I didn't live it.

114
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:27,120
So certain part of it might just be people don't have a parent and they're trying to get people incorporated.

115
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,710
Whereas I have like 1,000,001 recipes for energy. And the other thing is kale.

116
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:34,990
There's a lot of micronutrients that are minerals,

117
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:42,150
conservative micronutrients in general concern in terms of people are deficient in so things like for example, sodium saturated fat,

118
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:46,410
sucrose, we're not like super deficient in those as a population, but things like calcium,

119
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:51,120
vitamin A, vitamin B, protein coli, those are all things that we are a division.

120
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,560
And so kale and the other ones, kale is a good source of those.

121
00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:01,680
So obviously another good source of of calcium, for example, is milk.

122
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,389
Right now for most people who can consume not that's their their major calories are calorie source.

123
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:15,090
So here's just some some milk facts to be clear my pharmaceutical firm so I have no no specific bias here of milk but milk does have one cup.

124
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:20,819
Milk has 70% of the RDA for protein, about a third of your calcium and about 10% of your potassium cooling.

125
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:26,730
And vitamin D, of course, it's also the major dietary sort of lactose, which is problematic if you cannot digest lactose.

126
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:32,339
Almost all of the carbs in in regular bovine whole milk are from lactose.

127
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:36,659
And then there's about eight grams of protein are split about evenly between wedding casing.

128
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,719
We'll talk about the important differences between those in the protein unit.

129
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:44,250
And then here's a breakdown of all the facts in you know as well.

130
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:50,580
Now, you might be aware there's been a lot of changes and variations in milk in the last few years.

131
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:55,679
And so thinking about bovine milk, there's variation across the country.

132
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:01,100
So cows, food supply. So depending on what the cows are eating, whether they're eating more omega three or omega six,

133
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:07,280
this will affect you big three omega sixes in their number. Right. So omega three, super mega six are nutrients that we cannot make ourselves.

134
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:09,480
We get our diet cows also get them from their diet.

135
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:14,670
So the food supply, what kinds of what they're eating on the corner grain affects omega three omega six ratio.

136
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:18,419
The bovine microbiota and we're going to talk a lot about the microbiome next week

137
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:23,100
or two also affects the sources specific fatty acids called on chain fatty acid.

138
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:31,649
So C 15, C 17 and C 19 that we do not make and most mammals do not make, but they can be broken down by gut microbiota of cows.

139
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:38,219
And then of course, also it's nothing normal. And then there might be levels of iodine and selenium, and that varies pretty dramatically regionally,

140
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:42,240
depending on whether or not that is in the soil and therefore the food stock that they're eating,

141
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:50,640
because many people, either for sustainability reasons or for just all of lactose reasons, I've been turning away from milk.

142
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:54,630
There's a lot of alternatives that come up in the last three years, so I'm just going to go through a few of them.

143
00:13:55,020 --> 00:14:02,099
You may have heard of some or all of them. So A2 Milk has to do with Ann Arbor is for people who are cow milk allergies.

144
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:06,870
So certain people are allergic to certain proteins in cow and there's milk and they've been bioengineered,

145
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:12,300
but they found cows that had a variation such that you no longer have them being a reaction to that particular protein.

146
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:17,910
That's what A2 Milk is. And that's for people with allergies, not lactose intolerance, but allergies.

147
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:21,719
There's goat milk, got camel, donkey buffalo sheep and reindeer milk.

148
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:28,770
Depending on which lactating mammal happens to be near where you live, there can be lactose reduced milk where generally it is.

149
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:34,950
They added lactase enzyme to the milk to break down the lactose and then they usually replace it with something else.

150
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:39,389
Almost always, in my experience, sucrose, and then of course several plant based milks.

151
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:48,510
And these are the only ones reasonable that I can think of that I've seen being sold, that there is an ever increasing supply of a plant based looks.

152
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:54,900
So I don't know if this is going to work. So just because you can actually the pull and I'll just tell you what the results look like.

153
00:14:55,080 --> 00:15:01,229
So what do you think? Do you think the plant based milk so with soy milk or not soy milk, coconut,

154
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:06,840
should they be allowed to call themselves, you know, since they're sort of plant or generally not around you?

155
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:21,560
I can we can see your answers here. It's just not updating. Something like temporary excessive program has lost credibility in this case.

156
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:34,800
What is believed is Paul Eby dot com slash nutrition six and Utr six three extract.

157
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:40,890
I was very interested in the invitation calls.

158
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:48,389
So right now, as of this second, the role is altered 6050 842 in phase of yes.

159
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:53,830
So somebody who voted yes. Can you explain why you think yes, they should be considered notes?

160
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:59,220
Or be allowed to comment on this. Was that 61%?

161
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:05,040
Yeah, I was kind of thinking through marketing. 4% is like the end use of the product.

162
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:13,620
So thinking of what milk like that you can use in cereals or as a drinking the same as a plant based milk,

163
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:19,470
it's kind of marketed and used in the same format. So that's why I kept it as okay.

164
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:23,270
So I think that's actually two different arguments, both which I think are interesting and compelling.

165
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:29,060
So one is that it's easier for the consumer to call it a milk. You can replace your milk with this thing, therefore it's milk, right?

166
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:34,380
If it's a substitute, then you could call it that. You can mediate the same argument of marketing butter, but I don't know people necessarily.

167
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:39,920
But then the other part is in marketing, like nobody wants to call it like Roundup only, right?

168
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:49,350
So milk is maybe a little more appealing. Other thing. Okay, so 39% of people who said no to somebody want to explain the rationale for it.

169
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:55,200
So I said no because I believe that these are not natural products.

170
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,200
Like we cannot have milk from almonds, let's say.

171
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:04,980
And I believe that only people with allergies or intolerances should drink these types of benefits because they are lower in proteins.

172
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:11,940
Usually we drink milk for proteins and calcium, so why should we drink such less proteins, less calcium unless fortified?

173
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:19,019
That's vitamins also, and that's fortified. So for me, for people that have like normal health, they don't have any problems.

174
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:22,510
They should have like the normal or not to drink at all. Yeah.

175
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,090
Because if you have something similar,

176
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:32,400
just so the definition of milk is something that comes from mammary has protein and fat, less elements of progress.

177
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:40,770
They're not milk. And then the USDA actually says it has to have a certain amount of milk solid and no protein to be called milk.

178
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:49,290
Right. So from like a official standpoint, I get from our example of my official standpoint, it's not milk, right?

179
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:53,189
So so I think, well, all of these are like, I think pretty compelling arguments.

180
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:57,840
But this goes to like at some point the USDA had to make a determination and they made a little more on this side that on that side,

181
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,890
although I think the people make it might have been like, no, no, we want to happen to be this event.

182
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:06,250
And he brought up a lot of really good points in terms of are these actually equivalent to each other?

183
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:10,320
They're certainly not all in their natural, but they're not necessarily the same.

184
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:17,130
So this is just a breakdown of from the USDA food database comparison for bovine goes with almond milk and it's

185
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,360
either looked ahead or stole my thunder on they're much much lower in protein generally higher in calcium.

186
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:28,799
But that's only because they're fortified and they're generally reasonably good in vitamin D.

187
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,300
But again, that's from fortification, right?

188
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:38,730
So that's not because when you grind up the almonds or cashews or whatever to make your milk and it has these these micronutrients and manually added.

189
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:44,190
And one thing that I'll kind of harp on a lot over the course of the semester is there's a lot of things that

190
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:48,149
are foods that we don't think are important until we take them out and that we realize they're important.

191
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:52,710
So for example, choline here, which we'll talk a lot about, is something many people are deficient in.

192
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,480
And it doesn't appear to be supplemented, at least in any of the plant based books.

193
00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:01,530
I could I could find the other major difference and you mentioned this, too,

194
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:07,550
is one advantage of almond milk, is that if you are intolerant of lactose, then you can consume that.

195
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:13,320
And now I want to say so my my wife really like almond milk and I kind to stay away and she gets upset with the jargon,

196
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:17,250
something I've never really tried comparing them cooking. Are they in parallel cooking?

197
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,420
So I see like baking bakers behind you because if you put it in like, Oh,

198
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:27,870
I love pumpkin bread, like I just put like plant milk in that and it was still great.

199
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:32,950
So. But you think I've got great. I'm sure you're. I don't know what's come off the wrong way.

200
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:39,730
Like, if you made say let's say you made biscuits or something with whole milk and and you think they would taste basically.

201
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,570
I think they would taste basically the same. I think it's like a moisture thing.

202
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:46,079
You're saying, okay, it is good, but also really depends on the type of plant milk.

203
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:53,180
Like rice milk is like very high in sugar and like it's a very thin compared to like cows milk.

204
00:19:53,190 --> 00:20:05,530
Right. It's really dependent on like the overall question, not kind of related of kind of bringing together what I learned in another class.

205
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:10,530
I've seen soy milk is what's usually in the dietary guidelines.

206
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:20,339
And I was wondering what nutrients does soy milk have that make me into that kind of like is it the protein isn't the calcium?

207
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:26,790
I was thinking about that because I see soy products like soy milk, so yogurt and I was wondering about that.

208
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:32,790
Yeah. So I guess there's two parts of that answer. So and the part clear party, I think like what would soy milk look like on here?

209
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:37,560
I don't know but I can update this slide actually get you committed to that slightly.

210
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:46,850
But your other question of like why is soy in a lot of stock? So soybeans are like a major agricultural products, right?

211
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,649
So it's just very, very, very available. So a lot of protein.

212
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:53,550
For example, it comes from soy because that's a very popular place to get plant based protein.

213
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:58,200
It's not super duper complete, but it's it's not not as bad as some like keep working, for example.

214
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,259
Extremely so that's probably part of the reason.

215
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:05,010
So it's very attractive to food manufacturers who are looking for protein source

216
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:09,720
want to be plant based to find the A because that's growing out of the world.

217
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:17,130
Yeah. Okay. So there was somebody else in this industry, you're supposed to do something, you know, I will throw.

218
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:28,050
So that is not persistent means that you are not able to digest lactose.

219
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:32,459
It is not obviously allergy, it's inability to digest lactose.

220
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:39,300
Lectins is funny. Vitamin deficiency in fact.

221
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:52,280
Is it activity? Peaks are mostly no and replaced with Japanese and ISO is as we start weaning and shift towards diet mostly rich in sucrose and ice

222
00:21:52,280 --> 00:22:04,530
some those are lactose electing production diminished and lactose persistence is not normal and it's who are able to digest lactose.

223
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:08,670
They have a mutation polymorphism of the this gene.

224
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:12,390
It allows for continued production of connecting.

225
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:22,900
It shows that regions around the world where lactase persistence is huge.

226
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:28,870
We can see that Southeast Asia and South Asia are the largest persistence.

227
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:37,090
They were really two place, so they don't have these polymorphism or mutation in their like this gene.

228
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:40,600
So they are mostly lactose intolerant or.

229
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:47,260
So now we have an assignment on great craft.

230
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:53,560
The first thing you have to think about is that we should milk our milk alternatives recommended,

231
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:58,300
not recommended or not mentioned in the USDA food recommendations.

232
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:09,520
Why or why not? Talk over your logic for a few minutes and then you have to deal with these individually recommendations on the great craft under.

233
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,010
You can read the name Milk and USDA Dietary Guidelines, many policy proposals.

234
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:24,279
So think about it for a few minutes. Whether you like it or not, why you are your opinion, you just have to ask for your opinion.

235
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:38,570
Why do you think that is? And then do something individually on think.

236
00:23:52,130 --> 00:24:12,790
Right when they're lacking any some kind of sense that you should be suggesting more than just the presidential campaign?

237
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:19,040
Oh, yeah.

238
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:36,230
I don't know how long we have to do that.

239
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:49,710
I don't think it's going to work.

240
00:24:51,900 --> 00:25:16,470
So what is the one thing I don't you can support this issue that is more like widows and orphans.

241
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:40,750
You know, I. I think I think actually, I think the commission is different.

242
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:52,890
Yeah, I agree with you guys.

243
00:25:55,290 --> 00:26:08,960
I think that's one of the things that makes me think like, you know, I think perhaps that maybe there should be information.

244
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:12,080
Yeah. What else? Getting like.

245
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:22,070
Yeah. I feel like. I don't like I.

246
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:37,360
I don't think it's important.

247
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:43,440
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

248
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:49,160
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I like.

249
00:26:50,080 --> 00:27:17,879
I like to hear about it, but I don't think that, you know, like, I think because I feel like I'm just like, I don't know, like I said.

250
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:21,840
But they're also so much variation.

251
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:28,530
Well, I don't like it so much that if you can't.

252
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:34,350
Unless they just came out with one. Yeah.

253
00:27:35,970 --> 00:28:03,560
He. Yeah. It was such a small distance.

254
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:27,870
So I was think I just have to realize, you know, you need to educate people on your program.

255
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:37,550
Oh, I think everyone at you.

256
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:42,689
And I was like, I was going to add two more minutes on this and make sure you use the picture.

257
00:28:42,690 --> 00:29:00,440
Thank you. So let's why I'm not sure about, you know.

258
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:20,970
Yes. And I have to say, it's like every every TV show, like I thought it was like a fun thing to do for Marketplace.

259
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:39,370
So I think, you know, when you work it out strongly, not a lot of people are like, oh, where do you find her team here?

260
00:29:46,360 --> 00:30:03,350
And you know. Okay.

261
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:14,250
It sounds like I already suddenly stopped talking so quickly. We'll give you one more minute to finish typing the words in here.

262
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:19,320
All right.

263
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,600
Thank you.

264
00:30:31,350 --> 00:31:03,460
You're listening to. Okay.

265
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:09,910
So we're going to move on here at least to where we're going to go on to absorption.

266
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:16,150
So the key thing about digestion is make sure you remember what enzymes we have and what we mean by gas and therefore don't know the plate.

267
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:19,390
You know, we give it a sugar and figure out whether or not the majority of us can digest it.

268
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:24,819
So carbohydrate absorption, there's really two types of carbohydrate absorption.

269
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:31,780
There's what happens, whether it's a very high levels in our gut. And then there's a separate thing, what happens when the levels start to diminish.

270
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:35,350
So when there's very, very high levels in the gut, it's pretty straightforward.

271
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:45,610
We have a transporter called Good to exist on both the equal side to this is where the fantastic food would be a beer and then this would be replaced.

272
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:50,410
And glucose can pass through its concentration gradient once and then twice into the blood.

273
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:54,550
So if there's lots glucose for processing, galactose can all go through here.

274
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:56,770
So this is considered like a very high capacity system.

275
00:31:57,010 --> 00:32:03,069
But the downside of that is that it only works if there's a concentration gradient going from here to here.

276
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:06,400
So right after you eat a high glucose meal, there's probably more glucose in your gut.

277
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:12,780
But we always have lots of glucose in our blood glucose control if your normal glycemic stays around by normal rates,

278
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:16,940
which means that if the concentration in your gut dips below 5 million molar, this won't work anymore.

279
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,520
You'll still have residual amounts of monosaccharides left in your gut.

280
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:25,569
So we have another system which is a sort of higher affinity system.

281
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:33,880
You kind of think this like this is like a vacuum cleaner where it's going to more efficiently suck in the last small amount of glucose in galactose.

282
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:39,280
And that's very lucrative because the Edulji transporter, which is a sodium transporter.

283
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:45,450
So here it exists to kind of suck out the last remaining a little amount of glucose in here.

284
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:53,530
And there are people of inherited disorders of Google's lack of patterns because they go off one and as babies are first noticed,

285
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:59,800
because they have a failure to thrive, because the glucose and galactose from lactose, which is their primary supply,

286
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:04,930
if they're nursing or if they're having to keep getting formula, they can't get enough calories.

287
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:09,790
So we get about 50% of our glucose from each of these two systems.

288
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:17,379
But you could imagine if your main energy source is glucose and then you cut half that off by not having this lower concentration working system,

289
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:20,530
then you get glucose malabsorption. Fruit.

290
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:25,080
Those in they're handled at strangers. So at lower levels of fructose, there's a separate transporter,

291
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:28,920
which is higher affinities, which means it allows fructose to transport at lower levels.

292
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:32,370
We have much less fructose in our blood glucose.

293
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:39,510
So glucose stays in our blood at about five mil. About fructose is almost always well under $1 baller unless something awry is going on.

294
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:46,540
But the problem with that is the transport of fructose, therefore, is much, much less efficient because there is no vacuum cleaner for years.

295
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:50,279
Right. So if you consume fructose, some of it is always not going to be absorbed.

296
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:54,719
And the estimates right now are we only going to talk about 60% of the fruit jokes

297
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,490
we have because we're entirely dependent on this diffusion dependent system.

298
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:06,870
There's no active transport system for proteins. So that's why people consume a lot of fructose quite often can have gastrointestinal stresses because

299
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:11,880
the food companies get absorbed and anything that doesn't get absorbed is going to end up in our colon,

300
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:19,200
in our large intestines, and that's going to cause a variety of different symptoms depending on what bacteria are in there.

301
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:23,100
So I'm going to go through a couple different examples of how this can happen.

302
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:30,690
So one thing that one common problem when you have solutes in your gastrointestinal tract is that because of osmosis,

303
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:36,209
if you have solutes in your large intestine or your colon, that's going to keep water in that region.

304
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:39,540
Right? It's going to draw water into your large intestine or your colon.

305
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:44,520
Right. By drawing water in, that means you're going to have a higher likelihood of both bloating and diarrhea.

306
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:48,750
Right. Because you've got a lot of water retention in your large intestine and then that's what can cause diarrhea.

307
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,819
So that's one common symptomology.

308
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:58,320
If you have undigested materials that are kind of hanging around for too long in your in your lower digestive tract.

309
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:01,680
The other thing is gas. And so as we'll talk about the microbiome lecture,

310
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:06,719
one of the byproducts of microbial fermentation quite often can be production of a various gas is shown.

311
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:12,299
Here are hydrogen sulfide methane and carbon dioxide or hydrogen methane and carbon dioxide.

312
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:20,580
Also, hydrogen sulfide is another one of those gases are produced that can cause also gas for being an intestinal discomfort.

313
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:25,590
So these are these are quite common. So these are shown. And I'm going to come back to Fodmaps in a minute.

314
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:29,639
But the two diseases that are most relevant to this are known as IBS and IBD.

315
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:33,210
So inflammatory bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease.

316
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:38,249
So IBS is extremely common. It's is behind obesity and diabetes.

317
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:42,330
The third most common condition that we're going to talk about in class this year.

318
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:49,709
It affects about 10 to 15% of Americans for reasons that are not entirely clear from a biological standpoint,

319
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:52,890
about 2 to 2 and a half fold higher in women than in men.

320
00:35:53,550 --> 00:36:00,640
And it can be subcategories in two different groups. So IBS is with diarrhea, IBS is with constipation, IBS is mixed.

321
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:06,480
So people can be diagnosed with with this. And this is really just marked as a disturbance in bowel symptomology.

322
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:13,990
Right. Is there any research where if it would be as simple as just like being like decrease your sucrose?

323
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:16,379
Yeah, well, so we'll come back to that.

324
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:21,840
So there's a lot of different dietary treatments for ideas and I believe a lot of the majority of which are dietary in terms of

325
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:28,589
can we reduce the inflammatory thing that is causing this and we'll get to low-fodmap diet are very popular way to do this,

326
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:34,979
which we'll get to in a minute. I know IBS is different than IBD, so IBD now has to include inflammation.

327
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:39,780
Sometimes scarring of the colon is much, much less prevalent.

328
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:48,420
So you can think of this more as like the analogy is IBD is a little more like celiac and IBS is a little more like non-celiac gluten sensitivity.

329
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,900
It affects about 1.3% of Americans, which is still a huge number of people.

330
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:57,389
We're talking 3 to 5 million people in this country. And it is associated with colon cancer risk.

331
00:36:57,390 --> 00:37:01,890
And there's pretty good evidence that chronic IBS can eventually progress through to IBD.

332
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:05,250
All right. So these are two very, very common diseases.

333
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:13,680
So covering this, this is the second and third of the five fodmaps that we talked about this not so.

334
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:20,830
Some quarters ago we were talking about polyols sugar alcohols like xylitol and Erythritol.

335
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:26,670
Those are this class down here. These are not absorbed by intent because we're not supposed to absorb them.

336
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:29,760
Right. That's why they are not like sweeteners.

337
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:41,580
They exist largely in diet foods. So sugar free foods with sweeteners and stone fruits like fructose, because it is so poorly absorbed by most people,

338
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:49,020
is also a major contributor of fodmap sensitivity and then lactose, of course, and you can't type just lactose.

339
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:56,609
So for these three here, the example is we cannot absorb them either because we can't digest the lactose or we can't absorb the fructose effectively,

340
00:37:56,610 --> 00:38:03,149
or we can't absorb the sugar alcohol at all. And in all three of them, you end up with solids that end up in the gastrointestinal tract.

341
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:06,570
And depending on the actual bacteria in your gastrointestinal tract,

342
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:10,290
they may be able to process those very quickly such that they don't bear around or they

343
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:13,769
may produce a lot of gas or they may produce they may not be able to digest them at all.

344
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:18,270
And they kind of hang out dry in water. Right. So that's right. Now what we think is driving the.

345
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:24,500
Driving the difference. Opinions of the Fermentable oligosaccharides we're going to talk about next class.

346
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:29,910
So that's going to come up with virus, but I'll be all five of these. So I'm not restricted diets generally.

347
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:34,040
But if somebody comes in with IBS and that's the concern, they remove all of them at once.

348
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:39,680
So you get a long list of foods that contains any fermentable oligosaccharides, any lactose, any fructose or any polyols.

349
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:45,640
You remove all of them for a period of generally about two weeks, although guidance is very and then you slowly reincorporate them, right?

350
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:49,460
So because you have a sensitivity usually of a sensitivity to one of those things.

351
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:55,790
So it's a very common example. The majority of people worldwide cannot digest lactose, so they come in, they have symptomology of IBS.

352
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:59,120
They are told to eliminate lactose, they eliminate lactose. They feel better.

353
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:04,370
Right. So that's a very straightforward treatment that you may not even think is a fodmap restricted diet?

354
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:09,260
No. Generally, people are not restricted for fodmaps for long periods of time.

355
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:12,710
That's because there's a lot of foods that contain these these nutrients.

356
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,080
Right. So if you cut all of those out of your diet to be very, very,

357
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:21,049
very hard to get enough calories and micronutrients in your diet with all those alternations, we'll talk about what that looks like next.

358
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:25,670
Class. You bring a group back or you bring specific foods back.

359
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:30,979
My understanding as a general, you bring a group back. Okay. But I think there's some counseling involved.

360
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:34,940
Like probably if there's a good genetic reason to think that lactose is the problem, we probably start with that.

361
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:40,790
I'm not a dietitian. I had to do the Fodmap diet.

362
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:45,120
And you have to take a long break in between the groups so you can share between the two.

363
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:50,540
Yeah. And the it was my group. And you got to like choose which ones you want in order to evacuate in the group.

364
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:57,830
And again, probably was with diet counseling. Is this person consuming more than the average amount of lactose closer or holidays or not?

365
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:04,940
Okay. So that is yes. You go over how like you you figure out if you don't have the lactase gene.

366
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:09,020
Is that just like a test? Like a blood test? Are they usually so? Right. And so there's two ways you can test that.

367
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:12,680
So historically, the way that we do it is here.

368
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,770
So as you produce gases, your microbes produce gases.

369
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:19,700
What they would do is they would feed you the food and then you would bring them into a gas detector.

370
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:27,060
And if you got a lot of microbial fermentation, you would detect that as a lot of particularly methane, hydrogen sulfide and hydrogen gas.

371
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:33,139
So that was how they used to detect it. But now it's actually like probably more likely they'll do it sort of population level because we

372
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:39,020
know from the maps that has shown various ethnicities and races have much higher prevalence of that.

373
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:44,390
So then based on that, you could do a genetic test and there is only those Bible fields that we know of that as people show.

374
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:49,339
So the genetic testing does mean you have to test the whole genome, you have to test those five particular polymorphisms.

375
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:52,820
And in fact, if you know something about their ancestral history, your brain narrowed down to that,

376
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:57,660
either the African illegals, the Saudi Arabian illegals or the European.

377
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:05,300
Okay. So the thing I want to sort of finish with for today, we're going to talk about this.

378
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:11,870
There are at least four or five of the carbohydrate lectures. Here is this idea of impaired glucose tolerance and type two diabetes.

379
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:17,480
So type two diabetes, which generally involves a lack of response and responsiveness to insulin,

380
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:23,540
what are the characteristics of that is after, you know, high carbohydrate meal, that glucose stays in your blood for too long.

381
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:29,780
Right. So this is a trace of looking at blood glucose. So normal subject, they might have a little peak of blood glucose after they consume a meal,

382
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:35,930
but then they can quickly restore back to you glycemia primarily because that glucose gets sucked into their peripheral tissues.

383
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:39,770
And as we'll talk about next Wednesday, primarily that's going to be your muscle tissue.

384
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:43,160
However, if your muscle tissue cannot effectively clear glucose,

385
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:47,810
the glucose will stay in your blood for a lot longer and that'll come with all sorts of pathologies.

386
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:52,429
And so diabetes is the second most prevalent disease we're going to talk about behind obesity.

387
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:56,299
Depending on if you consider obesity a disease, it affects 34 million Americans.

388
00:41:56,300 --> 00:42:01,100
And 88 million Americans are what are called pre-diabetic, which means they have impaired glucose tolerance.

389
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:04,969
So a huge, huge, huge number of people in America.

390
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:06,170
And of course, these numbers have been growing.

391
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:11,749
And these are probably well, okay, since this is four years old, if you look at the diagnostic criteria,

392
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:15,290
there's really three different criteria by which you can be diagnosed with diabetes.

393
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:17,300
So the first is you just come in and you look at the fasting.

394
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:22,770
What do you tell somebody, don't eat overnight, come in, check your blood glucose and you can diagnose that based on their fasting.

395
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:27,920
So here it would be a measure of looking at their two hour oral glucose tolerance test.

396
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,610
So what is your blood glucose level after a standardized glucose challenge?

397
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:35,749
Typically it's 75 grams and you can classify people as either normal,

398
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:39,830
pre-diabetic or diabetic based on where their blood glucose is 2 hours after a challenge.

399
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,760
And this is to mimic their the real AP.

400
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:51,410
What they see is a bit of a long term measurement. So we have hemoglobin on a red blood cells and if you have any glucose in your blood at all,

401
00:42:51,710 --> 00:43:00,710
every once in a while a red blood cell will get attached, will have a glucose attached to the hemoglobin, and that's called HBA one C.

402
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:07,100
And you can measure that. Now, if you have chronic high levels of glucose, chronically, you'll have more sugar adherent onto your red blood cells.

403
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:11,509
So you can just measure somebody's red blood cell glucose adherence, and then you can do that.

404
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:14,650
So this is a good measure of sort of chronic glycemia, right?

405
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:18,830
This is measuring over the course of generally red blood cells turn over the course of every three months.

406
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:24,020
So this is measuring sort of average glycemia about three months. This is looking at postprandial glycemia.

407
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:30,830
So the response to a challenge and then this is looking at what's going on during a fast and people could vary people could vary quite a lot.

408
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:35,269
They might have postprandial hypoglycemia but not fasting hypoglycemia or vice versa.

409
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:36,680
And as we'll talk about throughout the class,

410
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:41,570
this is going to mostly reflect muscle function and this is mostly going to affect adipose and liver function.

411
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:50,900
Is there like an upper limit for a C like IV? Seems like as high as 15, but I don't know if it's like if it's possible to go past as well.

412
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:56,690
So A1 C is as a percent. So hypothetically the maximum was on a present which would be 100% of your hemoglobin.

413
00:43:56,690 --> 00:44:01,400
This might what I know I've never told for example, you know, I've worked at diabetes much before,

414
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:05,390
I've never seen anyone see over 15, for example, 11 is extraordinarily high.

415
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:08,900
6.5 is already a pretty, pretty big area for you not to have.

416
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:13,430
Uncontrolled diabetes is pretty severe for a really long time to get that high, but as many people do.

417
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:18,450
Yeah, good question. Okay.

418
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:23,670
So diabetes is good, bad, because it's like our blood is sweet tasting.

419
00:44:23,850 --> 00:44:26,999
It has a lot of really, really, really, really severe complications.

420
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:32,850
And so here's a list of some, of course, not all of them. So, for example, did you know that diabetes is the leading cause of blindness in adults?

421
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:40,860
Right. It's also the leading cause of amputation. It is 25 times more likely that you're going to have nerve damage than if you don't have diabetes.

422
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,190
And the risk of death of COVID 19 is two fold higher.

423
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:48,750
Cardiovascular disease is is an interesting one because as we'll talk about when we get to lipid metabolism,

424
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:55,320
there's a lot of interplay between lipid metabolism and glucose metabolism and insulin signaling, especially what's going on in the liver right now.

425
00:44:55,320 --> 00:45:01,080
It turns out people have diabetes, have about 2 to 4 times higher risk of heart attack or stroke.

426
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:06,299
Right. So all of these are are extremely devastating, lifelong things that people have to manage.

427
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:11,970
A lot of them are not reversible. For example, nephropathy, early indications are generally not reversible.

428
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:17,459
Now, we know quite a lot about diabetes in America. We've been saying this for a pretty long time.

429
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:23,640
And as you might expect, given that you're studying public health here, there are pretty dramatic disparities in diabetes.

430
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:28,530
Some of this can be traced back to obesity rates. Obesity is by far the number one contributor.

431
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:33,540
Diabetes, probably about 80% of diabetes risk can be explained if you know somebody is BMI.

432
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:38,130
And you can see if you look here, both American Indians and black,

433
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:46,830
Hispanic and Hispanic people all have much higher diabetes rates, about 12 to 15% compared to white and Asian Americans.

434
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:52,049
And so that's a huge disparity there. There's also disparities across socioeconomic status generally.

435
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:56,520
As more poor you are, there's about a twofold increased likelihood to have diabetes.

436
00:45:56,730 --> 00:46:02,010
And so there is an activity that we put on in this class. There's a third year we had it on here called Bad Sugar.

437
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:05,400
And I really encourage if you if you're thinking about working with people who are

438
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,790
either suffering from obesity or diabetes to take a look at this documentary,

439
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:13,709
it's pretty short. It's on I will link to it because it's like for you through the university,

440
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:17,930
but I'm pretty sure it's on Netflix if you have Netflix or or your password or something.

441
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:26,730
But it's a really good documentary and it talks about the diabetes rates in a population of Indians in in the Pima region of Arizona,

442
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:31,230
New Mexico, sorry, community services.

443
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:34,560
What if I think it does a really good job of talking about how diabetes is affecting

444
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:38,090
that community and sort of some of the structural factors that have led into that,

445
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:47,310
which is some of that I'm sure some of the diabetes is because of the socioeconomic positions of those communities.

446
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:52,920
Is there also potentially a polymorphism because you see like in Polynesian communities where there's not necessarily poverty,

447
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:58,800
but there's this entire community who suffers from either from their diet or culture.

448
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:05,940
Is there any studies that either cultural polymorphisms that are potentially causing it in certain hiring, certain populations?

449
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:12,750
Okay. So that's a really good question. So I'll I'll answer in the narrowest way that I can I don't want to do in the marketplace.

450
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:19,170
So there are monogenic forms of diabetes. So generally those are called multi mature onset diabetes and beyond.

451
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:23,580
And they involve things like Google kind of applications we're going to talk about in a couple of lectures.

452
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:29,740
So there is a small number of like causal meals. This is somewhat similar to obesity to some people who have obesity because it is syndromic, right.

453
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:33,030
That's pretty rare compared to the entire milieu.

454
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:37,739
When people suffer from diabetes generally, it's because you might you bring up a Polynesian community.

455
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:41,219
And that's probably I don't know for sure, but my understanding is that's probably the driving factor.

456
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:44,910
There is is is the high rates of obesity in those communities.

457
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:52,410
But there is also and we'll talk about this five lectures now, there is also people who are unable to store fat effectively.

458
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:55,320
And they are, you know, typically quite lean but have very high diabetes rates.

459
00:47:55,470 --> 00:48:00,690
So, for example, South Asian men generally get diabetes at much, much higher rates at the same BMI than, say, white.

460
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:06,150
And that is almost certainly genetic due to genetic differences in those ancestries.

461
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:09,360
But we don't exactly know what those genes are for those people. Right.

462
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:14,399
And so that's more of an example of a liquid dystrophy here and diabetes, because they're not able to store fat as effectively.

463
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:18,150
And that ectopic fat causes that glucose intolerance that affects.

464
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:29,300
Okay. So glucose homeostasis, obviously, in general, blood glucose levels are controlled by sort of three things that are going on.

465
00:48:29,310 --> 00:48:32,700
So what is how is the glucose getting from our diet into our one?

466
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:33,750
Right. So that's that one.

467
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:41,820
If that happens like to effectively or too rapidly, you can have a higher flank and one with less glucose is also produced by the liver.

468
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:45,480
And we'll talk about that in the glycogen. Glycogen also that's in gluconeogenesis lectures.

469
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:48,750
Ideally when you eat a meal, you turn off glucose production in the liver.

470
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:52,130
But if that's effective, then you're going to keep producing glucose when you don't need to.

471
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:55,530
And then of course, as I mentioned, uptake in use by the target tissues.

472
00:48:55,860 --> 00:49:03,020
So thinking about how we manage diabetes and many of you are me working in clinical positions of management of people with obesity,

473
00:49:03,030 --> 00:49:05,670
diabetes is going to be a major part of your job.

474
00:49:05,970 --> 00:49:11,370
So I'm going to go through a few things that are helpful for mentioning diabetes and talk about what so versus,

475
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:17,010
number one, most effective thing across the board for most people for managing their diabetes is weight right now.

476
00:49:17,010 --> 00:49:21,540
Of course, we spent two lectures talking about how that's not it's not that easy by looking at this study here,

477
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:25,110
which is a very large multi-site study called Look Ahead.

478
00:49:25,350 --> 00:49:29,729
What they're showing is that people who lost weight, so here they lost a reasonable amount of weight.

479
00:49:29,730 --> 00:49:37,050
This is about a 10% weight loss. And then they had some rebound over the course of the next decade since the intervention.

480
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,850
So the intervention was just the first year.

481
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:43,620
And then, as I'm sure you could describe, using things we've talked about, this was already a bit of a rebound.

482
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:49,980
This is the control group where they were just given educational materials. They had a slight decrease, but there was still a decrease here.

483
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:55,319
The key thing is here is you do not need to go from obese or class two or class three obese,

484
00:49:55,320 --> 00:50:03,330
which would be a BMI of 35 or 40 all the way down to normal weight to manage your diabetes generally weight loss of about the order of five or 10%,

485
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:09,600
even if you still remain in either obese or class, two or three is sufficient to get blood glucose under control.

486
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:17,160
So you need relatively modest weight once you don't need complete reductions all the way down to normal weight to manage, to manage.

487
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:21,390
And that's been shown through here. So if you look at people who lost more than 10% of their body weight,

488
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:27,480
you can see that they're like in hemoglobin plus excuse me, drops pretty precipitously here.

489
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:33,000
And of course, it goes back as they as they gain weight and because it took ten years at two days as they age.

490
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:37,860
So that's the number one most proven thing to do.

491
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:45,030
Now, the second thing, especially in terms of postprandial glucose spikes, so if you're the kind of person after a meal, your blood glucose goes up.

492
00:50:45,870 --> 00:50:48,270
That's the next thing that we recommend is exercise.

493
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:52,560
Now, I realize I've talked a lot about how exercise is not particularly beneficial for weight loss,

494
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:56,250
but poor glucose homeostasis exercise is quite effective.

495
00:50:56,520 --> 00:51:03,930
And as we'll talk about in three lectures, there are separate mechanisms for insulin dependent glucose disposal in your muscle and for exercise.

496
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:11,790
And so even if your insulin doesn't work that effectively, generally exercise induced glucose disposals can still work like, right?

497
00:51:11,790 --> 00:51:20,340
So you can kind of override not having effective insulin by something simple, like going for a walk or for a brief jog after a meal.

498
00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:25,680
And so you can see here this is comparing healthy controls to diabetics and this is looking after some exercise.

499
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:29,909
You can see both groups had good glucose disposal after exercise,

500
00:51:29,910 --> 00:51:35,100
even though type two diabetic group had much less glucose disposal in the absence of exercise.

501
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:41,190
And of course, as I mentioned a few times a semester, exercise has pretty dramatic effects on overall mortality.

502
00:51:41,190 --> 00:51:50,280
And so what this is showing across here is a whole series of risk factors ranging from elevated BMI to smoking to diabetic or hypertension.

503
00:51:50,430 --> 00:51:54,660
And what this is showing is low and high intensity exercise and how it relates to that.

504
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:58,200
This solid line would be no effect of the all of those things have an effect.

505
00:51:58,410 --> 00:52:03,600
So one big advantage of exercise is exercise generally helps with overall all cause mortality,

506
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:08,220
no matter what your underlying symptomology, whether you're hypertensive or not, whether you're obese or not,

507
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:13,080
whether you have diabetes or not, whether you smoke or not, whether you have high waist hip ratio,

508
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:16,890
whether you're old, whether you're male, all of these things can be improved by exercise.

509
00:52:17,970 --> 00:52:21,990
But yes, this is I don't know if this is not off topic.

510
00:52:21,990 --> 00:52:23,219
So you can only circle back to it.

511
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:31,230
But for exercise, would you say there's something to be said about if you're exercising, like even if it's not necessarily good for weight loss?

512
00:52:31,470 --> 00:52:37,440
Like if you're feeling healthy after exercising, you might make healthier choices in your food.

513
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:41,850
Healthier choices in your food intake. Yeah. So there is some data for that, that.

514
00:52:43,650 --> 00:52:49,740
On its own. Putting people through an exercise related intervention will modify their diet in a way that,

515
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,440
whether they are told to or not, will end up being somewhat beneficial.

516
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:57,630
Part of that might be the kind of food you eat after you exercise are different.

517
00:52:58,410 --> 00:53:04,600
Part of it might be psychological, like you're feeling empowered in some way and that maybe that empowering patients are more likely.

518
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:09,330
I don't think we actually know exactly why that happens, but I think that's probably a fair comparison.

519
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:13,860
And I should be clear, this study here on my mind, you're right, is an observational study, right?

520
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:17,189
So it's the people who exercise are also qualitatively different than people who don't exercise.

521
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:20,490
They tend to have more disposable time and income and resources.

522
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:30,570
Yes, I think before that exercise is recommended for those that have diabetes because it improves insulin sensitivity by affecting food, too.

523
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:34,200
And so it would even be like taking more glucose.

524
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:37,290
That's how I would blood glucose would be better managed.

525
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:46,560
Yeah. So that's true because the fact that someone who was fat, those are those like receptors would be working more or so.

526
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:48,180
Okay. So there's two parts of that question.

527
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:53,160
So the first part is, and again, we'll go over this in a couple of classes, but the glute for translocation,

528
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:56,550
the mechanisms by which exercise promotes that are totally independent of insulin.

529
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:59,820
So you don't need better insulin sensitivity to get an exercise induced glucose.

530
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:04,170
So that's one big part of it. Now you're right, independent of weight loss.

531
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:13,470
So if you take two groups of people and you hold their body weight constant because they you overview one group or whatever and do exercise,

532
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:20,190
there is more insulin sensitivity for the people who exercise. However, that effect goes away about 72 hours after their last vote of exercise.

533
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:24,209
So it's an acute effect, but it's not a long term effect. Most people who do that.

534
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:27,420
So the goal is as they exercise, maybe there's some improvement of body composition.

535
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:30,720
So that in itself would be would be nice.

536
00:54:31,230 --> 00:54:34,980
Right. So the average person, the goal is the exercise has a little bit of weight loss,

537
00:54:35,130 --> 00:54:38,720
but then exercise also has these benefits, sort of these acute level benefits.

538
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:45,239
Right. So far, all of these habits you're talking about moderate symptoms of diabetes.

539
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:49,350
Are you talking about both type one and type two or is this specific? This is specific to type two.

540
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:53,390
Yeah. This is not a good idea. It's not talking to you.

541
00:54:53,790 --> 00:55:01,619
Although I'm sure exercise has benefits for type one as well. But none of these mechanisms are not okay.

542
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:05,580
And so of course, those of you who are interested in nutrition, which is probably most of you,

543
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:11,880
there's also management in terms of diet, the primary management is thinking about glucose influx.

544
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:17,040
So now with the main thing we're trying to control is that rate of glucose absorption of course, and minimizing the added sugars.

545
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:24,749
We talked about the somewhat failed USDA recommendation about adding sugars, reducing sugar sweetened beverages, which, as I said, two classes ago,

546
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:29,880
is a major source of added sugars in most people's diets and then emphasize non-starchy vegetables,

547
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:36,899
basically fiber rich vegetables and and more proteins. So the way that people do this in practice and again, I'm not a dietitian,

548
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:41,340
but the way I understand people do this in practice is not combination of of these three things.

549
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:45,569
So carb counting is basically just trying to figure out how many carbohydrates shares you have.

550
00:55:45,570 --> 00:55:48,480
And this is something that we trained on equipment therapy.

551
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:52,409
And then on a food level, there's something called the glycemic index and the glycemic load.

552
00:55:52,410 --> 00:55:55,080
So the glycemic index is a range of four foods.

553
00:55:55,080 --> 00:56:00,330
So each food has specific index depending on their structure and how quickly the average person can absorb it.

554
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:04,320
The glycemic load is a glycemic index multiplied by the amount of pet food you have.

555
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:08,880
So actually the glycemic load is like a more accurate type of carb counting.

556
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:16,050
Carb counting is just counting all carbs, the same glycemic load and modifying them for both the amount and for the just beginning.

557
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:22,920
Again, for the average person right now, the American Diabetes Association and USDA both recommend carb counting,

558
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:27,360
even though I think everybody agrees that glycemic load would be a more effective management tool.

559
00:56:27,570 --> 00:56:31,140
The idea is that it's hard enough to counsel people to even just do car counting,

560
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:37,680
getting them to also figure out how much they ate and exactly what the glycemic index about food is is probably intolerable or not going to work.

561
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:42,210
For most people. There's pretty good evidence that all else equal.

562
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:47,310
If you look in cohort studies as your glycemic load increases, there's going be a higher risk of diet.

563
00:56:47,490 --> 00:56:52,770
And again, some of this might be due to obesity risk, but a lot of this is probably just due to pure carbohydrate intake.

564
00:56:52,770 --> 00:57:02,280
Right. So every almost every eight years, the American diabetes comes out with clinical guidelines for the nutritional management of diabetes.

565
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:05,500
The most recent one was 2008.

566
00:57:06,070 --> 00:57:08,540
There there's an activity about it on great graphic if you're interested.

567
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:12,990
And at that point was the first time it explicitly recommended low carbohydrate diets.

568
00:57:13,010 --> 00:57:14,969
You know, we're not saying that's the only way.

569
00:57:14,970 --> 00:57:19,950
If you read through those guidelines, you'll see there's a whole host of different diets they review and recommend.

570
00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:23,390
But they that was the first time they recommended just purely low carbohydrate diet,

571
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:30,240
which would be more like carb counting as opposed to thinking about the types of carbohydrates before are now.

572
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:37,710
One of the things about the glycemic index is, as I said, the idea is that Kale's not a great example.

573
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:42,840
So let's say we all had a potato, we're all going eat the exact same platonic potato.

574
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:48,690
And we are going to look at our blood glucose. The idea is that we should all respond roughly the same to that tail.

575
00:57:48,870 --> 00:57:52,940
And then if we all then eight of his cake, we would all respond roughly equal to that piece of cake.

576
00:57:52,950 --> 00:57:53,189
Right?

577
00:57:53,190 --> 00:58:01,050
And so that digestibility and absorption of that digested potato and the absorption of it would be pretty narrow and could be definable by the food,

578
00:58:01,230 --> 00:58:04,770
not by the person. Right. So we could assign a glycemic index to a food.

579
00:58:04,770 --> 00:58:13,860
We don't assign a glycemic index to a person. This study here came out in 2015, which I think really kind of underlines why that's probably not true.

580
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:14,969
So in this study,

581
00:58:14,970 --> 00:58:24,720
what they did is they took a large number of people and they put them through a regimented series of Googles challenges while they had continuous,

582
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:30,180
remotely monitored, continuous glucose monitors so they could in real time measure their postprandial glucose response.

583
00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:35,070
And so what they're showing here, I'll go through this on the left, I called it for the small time.

584
00:58:35,310 --> 00:58:39,830
This is their response to just pure glucose. Right. So glucose does not need to be digested, right?

585
00:58:39,990 --> 00:58:49,260
This is just how we absorb glucose levels across the U.S. There's is huge variation across these subjects in terms of how they absorb, absorb food.

586
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:52,410
If you look at something a little more complicated like bread,

587
00:58:52,410 --> 00:58:55,980
you can see there is also some variation here, a good amount of variation, bread and butter.

588
00:58:56,310 --> 00:59:01,830
And then if you look at fructose, you can see it's a little narrower. Generally, fructose tends to be pretty poorly tolerated by most people.

589
00:59:02,370 --> 00:59:08,580
And the postprandial glucose response is here. But the key, what they found here was this is massive diversity in individual responses.

590
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:14,910
Right? The entire individual responses were much, much bigger and in between food responses.

591
00:59:15,170 --> 00:59:18,510
Right. So the way that I respond to bread and the way that you respond to bread is

592
00:59:18,510 --> 00:59:22,050
probably more different than bread as a canonical thing because we are different.

593
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:27,270
I don't know, maybe I don't need nearly as much care, but I like that.

594
00:59:28,230 --> 00:59:33,180
So this kind of highlights that. So here's one example of a participant number 14.

595
00:59:34,210 --> 00:59:38,370
It's a 68, and you can see this person actually responded quite poorly to glucose.

596
00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:45,689
Right. This is two separate glucose challenges in the same person in red, but they were pretty tolerable to the brim, whereas this other participant,

597
00:59:45,690 --> 00:59:51,390
given the same amount of glucose and the same amount of bread, actually had a higher response to the bread than they did to the glucose.

598
00:59:51,690 --> 00:59:56,819
Right. So this you might make some hypotheses here about this person here might have a very active alpha amylase,

599
00:59:56,820 --> 01:00:05,670
which is important to break down the starch bread, for example, whereas this person might have impaired stricken capacity in some way.

600
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:07,560
This one here, I think, is even more threatening.

601
01:00:07,570 --> 01:00:12,840
So now we're looking at this whatever this participant in 445 and this is their response to we'll start with this person,

602
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:17,790
this is their response to a cookie. So they have a big cookie response, but they have no response at all to a banana,

603
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:22,709
whereas this person here is like banana intolerant, but absolutely no response to cookies.

604
01:00:22,710 --> 01:00:28,560
Right. And I think those of us who I should point out, it's not like I can do that before even this person,

605
01:00:28,770 --> 01:00:35,280
but you can see within individual foods that you might say, well, of course, bananas are going to be more slowly absorbed to everybody than a cookie.

606
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:40,020
That's not true. Right. So in this case here, even though Cookie is certainly an ultra processed food,

607
01:00:40,230 --> 01:00:45,390
it was absorbed in this particular person much worse than than the banana.

608
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:45,719
Right.

609
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:55,200
And again, that's probably because of differences in their digestive physiology and their their absorption of those particular glucose moieties.

610
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:58,589
And that is that makes sense. All right.

611
01:00:58,590 --> 01:01:02,999
So what I want you to do and this will be where we I'm going to end talking so you guys can spend the next 50 minutes kind

612
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:08,850
of thinking about is I want you to pick something that we've learned about either today or in the intro to Digestion Class,

613
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:16,079
some form of digestive, enzyme and parasite transport or try to keep it to the gut and think about how variation in

614
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:21,740
one of those could cause different responses in two different people to the exact same foods.

615
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:26,310
And there's a sort of unlimited number of these, but I'm going to give you one which you guys not use,

616
01:01:26,970 --> 01:01:34,800
which is if you have increased levels of pancreatic amylase that will break down envelope and amla pectin into glucose.

617
01:01:34,950 --> 01:01:38,759
If you have really, really high levels of that, that could cause more digestion of starch,

618
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:42,720
so more definition of potato and therefore could have a higher postprandial glucose.

619
01:01:43,290 --> 01:01:47,189
Could he be a super potato integrator and therefore you would have a much higher response.

620
01:01:47,190 --> 01:01:51,480
Whereas if you had much less pancreatic, pancreatic, alpha amylase, you would have much reduced.

621
01:01:51,630 --> 01:01:53,790
So you might make some specific advice to this person.

622
01:01:53,970 --> 01:01:59,160
They should avoid particularly starchy foods, particularly because that seems to be a problem area, right?

623
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:03,690
So don't pick out families or pancreatic by always pick something else and then

624
01:02:03,690 --> 01:02:08,540
submit that individually to this activity whenever you're done in a few hours.

625
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:18,880
So feel free to talk with your patients because then obviously you guys want to make.
