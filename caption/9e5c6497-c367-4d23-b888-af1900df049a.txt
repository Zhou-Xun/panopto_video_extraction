1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,900
Oh, my God. Okay.

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:11,540
Okay. Okay.

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:20,630
All right. But you.

4
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:31,000
Yeah. Good morning, everybody.

5
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:36,050
How's it going? Okay.

6
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:41,150
Are you enjoying the cooler weather or are you sad? I'm sad.

7
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:47,730
Go like. Raise your hand if you like. There's always some crazy, you know.

8
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:53,210
Raise your hand if you hate it. Okay.

9
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:58,640
Oh, we're about 5050. Um, yeah, but we chose to live in Michigan.

10
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,110
Those of us we raised. Yeah, I just.

11
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:13,940
I just don't understand why we went from, like, 89 to 50, you know, like, I needed a little bit of a gradual.

12
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:17,210
Yeah. All right, I digress.

13
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,520
What say you about socioeconomic status?

14
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:31,810
So in the first couple of weeks, if you remember back, we were talking about some kind of general or broad theories.

15
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:40,340
We're going to keep talking about theories as we go through the semester, but some of them will be more specific to the topic that we're doing that,

16
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:46,069
whereas the ones that we kind of looked at in the first two weeks were very broad social

17
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:50,720
epidemiology theories that could apply to many different research questions and areas.

18
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:55,910
And then we talked a little bit about methods last week.

19
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:04,160
And hopefully that discussion will be helpful to you as we go through the rest of the semester and

20
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:09,050
reading those empirical papers and thinking through why they made some of the choices that they did.

21
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:15,110
So we're going to talk about that today when we when we talk about our discussion paper after the break.

22
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:22,470
And so now we're moving on to sort of the the second part of the class.

23
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:25,610
The class is broken down into three parts. The first, the theory and methods.

24
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:30,230
The second is focused on different dimensions of social status.

25
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:34,850
And then the third part of the class will be talking about social context and how.

26
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:42,080
So social status refers to an individual's position within a social hierarchy.

27
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:50,670
So I like this little clip art because I think it's helpful for thinking about what social status means.

28
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,280
Are you at the top of the social hierarchy or are you at the bottom?

29
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,030
Are you in the middle?

30
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:10,610
So I want us to just think a little bit about what are some of the important dimensions of social status that we see in the US today?

31
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:22,340
What are some ways in which we rank people according to social status?

32
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,079
Yeah. Okay. Income, which would be a part of socio economic status.

33
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:36,230
We're going to talk about that more today. Other ways that we think people.

34
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:47,930
Fair sex and gender identity in education laws and education.

35
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:52,219
Okay. Sure. Yeah. Okay.

36
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:55,400
So where you live? Like regional? Kind of.

37
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,029
Or do you mean regional? Or do you mean more local?

38
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,740
Like neighborhood kind of thing? Okay.

39
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,230
Yeah. That's right. Yeah. Yeah.

40
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:19,490
So there may be like sort of status hierarchies according to where you live within a city or an area or even between rural and urban.

41
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:32,830
Any others that you can think of? Yes.

42
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,530
Air immigration. Immigration status.

43
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:48,860
What about age, do you think that we sort of that people of different ages have different status?

44
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:57,590
I see some shaking, some nodding heads. Adria, do you want to say why you agree with that or who do you think in terms of age?

45
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:06,960
Who do you think has higher status in U.S. society? Okay.

46
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:13,340
So it could be older people things like that. My and. Yeah.

47
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:21,330
So I was like really thinking about particularly working age people, um, and like higher up in that.

48
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:29,280
So, you know, people who are like my, like people were in that like late forties and fifties and early sixties like kind of

49
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,799
midlife period tend to have more status because they tend to have higher earnings,

50
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,100
have accumulated more wealth, that kind of thing.

51
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:44,460
Um, older people tend to have lower status, young people tend to have lower status.

52
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:56,100
And by status, I guess you can think about differences in, you know, power differences and privilege.

53
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:04,970
Differences in various resources, some that are economic.

54
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,010
Some that are social, like social relations, social capital, that kind of thing.

55
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:19,000
Any others that you can think of? Yeah. I'm wondering how.

56
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:32,290
How someone moves, for example, I see people differently from people that's been raped, so that may be something.

57
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:40,030
Can you say that again? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I have a hole in my ear, you know, so I'm just going to tell you.

58
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:47,620
So you understand why I can't hear any of you. So I had covered at the beginning of October, not October.

59
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:51,490
See again, the hole has gone to my friend August.

60
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:56,620
Then I got a sinus infection. Then I took antibiotics and got better.

61
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:07,210
But then it came back. And now I went to the doctor again and I had a flu in my ear like I know from the like the pressure from the sinus infection.

62
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,590
And they were like, oh, okay, we have to send you to ear, nose and throat, doctor.

63
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:17,410
We're going to put an urgent request. So they call me the next morning like, Oh, thank God, because I can't hear.

64
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,170
I feel like dizzy all the time, you know?

65
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:30,219
And then her like, okay, we can't hear you in on October 17th, so I'm going to be like this for a few more weeks.

66
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:37,570
But my sister was a speech pathologist who had the study years in grad school for me that it usually will over Zoom,

67
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,290
so maybe I'll be able to hear you at some point.

68
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:53,870
But anyway, that's fine. So no more can you. I was saying, especially in American society, yeah, people want to become perfect.

69
00:07:54,430 --> 00:08:03,510
So like how someone how someone's going to. Yes, sir.

70
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:07,510
Okay. I was saying something. Be my people.

71
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:11,660
Yes, people. Yes. Body size.

72
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,800
Absolutely. Yes. Thank you. I'm sorry.

73
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,970
I just have all the requirements. I need to get a microphone.

74
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:27,100
Okay. Yes. So we absolutely rank people according to physical appearance and particularly body size.

75
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:33,340
Yeah. The other ways that people are sort of hierarchically organized.

76
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:41,230
Yeah, Patricia. It's just for us to think about it. Especially in our society.

77
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:46,720
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. I mean, we. We think about structural racism.

78
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:53,410
That's all about sort of hierarchies of ordering people by race or ethnicity.

79
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:58,330
And like white supremacy underlies that color would say.

80
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:08,200
That's how. Yeah.

81
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:16,490
So you can think about disability status or physical health status that people who are healthier tend to have higher status,

82
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:21,170
people who are less of the. I was going to say how that is.

83
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:24,980
Yeah. I guess about my kids. I got I started.

84
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:28,370
Yeah. Yeah. So marriage.

85
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:39,860
We're going to talk about that in a few weeks. Like, marital status is associated in some ways with social status and other aspects of family.

86
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:48,020
Absolutely. Yeah.

87
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:53,909
Olivia I think the type of job that you have, um, sometimes transcends income.

88
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:59,730
Um, there can be some jobs. Yeah. Trade jobs that make a decent amount of money, but are maybe looked at as a lower social status.

89
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:04,979
Yeah. So occupation, even separate from income there is, like, kind of a rent.

90
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:13,350
You know what I was thinking? How someone speaks the American people in person.

91
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:22,469
Yeah. Oh, absolutely. Like the way that we speak our dialect, that that can be sort of or I will tell you,

92
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:31,050
usually when people find out I'm from Alabama, the first thing they say is, well, first they laugh and then you.

93
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,770
And then they say, well, where's your accent?

94
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:45,690
You know, so yeah, there's the strong like we definitely rank people according to to accent and and geography and so so

95
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:55,620
I think this little exercise to show you that we sort of have all kinds of rankings in our society.

96
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:03,770
And if you grew up in a place different from the US, there may be other things on which people are stratified, right?

97
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:09,960
Like it's it's kind of a thing that we do in society is we sort of order people,

98
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:16,350
assign status to them and then going along with that are differences in resources

99
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:21,030
and power and prestige and all of that stuff that we know has an impact on how.

100
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:31,440
So over the next four weeks, we're going to talk about, uh, four different dimensions of social status and how they relate to health.

101
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:39,330
So we can certainly talk about more and we, we just listed way more than four, but we're going to talk today about socioeconomic status.

102
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:48,660
Next time we're going to talk about race and ethnicity. We're going to talk about sex and gender and sexual orientation and gender identity.

103
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:56,910
And what we're going to do each time is think about definitions of these things because you'll see as we start talking about it,

104
00:11:56,910 --> 00:12:00,270
it's like we all know what socioeconomic status is, right?

105
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:07,230
But then when we start really trying to define it and think about it in the context of research, it becomes a lot more complicated.

106
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,069
So we're talking about definitions. We're going to talk about measurement.

107
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:17,940
How do you measure in these different social statuses and epidemiologic studies mechanisms or like

108
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:25,889
reasons why this particular social status would be related to health outcomes and then evidence?

109
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:30,270
What do we know about differences based on these different social status characteristic?

110
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:35,940
And one thing that I do want to note before we start talking about socioeconomic status,

111
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:41,700
it's that these different social statuses don't exist in isolation,

112
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:47,040
right where they intersect in all kinds of ways for people,

113
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:58,350
and that the intersection of these identities can have effects on health that are above and beyond the sort of additive effects of those things.

114
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:04,979
And so we're not going to talk a lot about that in this class.

115
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,450
We will talk about it a little bit.

116
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:13,919
But I just want you to know that, yes, we were talking about SARS in a different week than we talk about race in a different reason.

117
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,690
We talk about sex and gender, but it doesn't mean that,

118
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:21,390
like there's not intersections and interactions between those things in terms of people's health.

119
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:41,340
Does that make sense? So to illustrate that point, I just want to show you some information about socioeconomic status by race in the United States.

120
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:49,520
And this data is from. It's from a publication that was in 2017, but the data would be a little older than that.

121
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:54,780
Right. It's usually kind of slow. So what this is showing is so in the columns,

122
00:13:54,780 --> 00:14:00,690
we have the different major racial and ethnic groups in the U.S. So we have black, Hispanic, Asian and white.

123
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:05,360
And then we've got these different indicators of socioeconomic status.

124
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,610
We're going to talk about more in a minute, what those things are and what they mean.

125
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:12,070
So first, is the percent better college graduates?

126
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:20,610
Oh, yeah. Here's the year where the data. Median household income, median wealth, non homo and percent homeownership and percent unemployed.

127
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:30,330
And if you kind of look across the rows, you can see the huge differences in all of these indicators by race and ethnicity.

128
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:35,940
So when we talk about race or when we talk about socioeconomic status,

129
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:44,430
it really can be hard to distinguish these things because of the particular history in the United States of racial oppression.

130
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,640
So I just want you to keep this in mind as we go through today's lecture.

131
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:59,670
I don't know if you can see those numbers from where you're sitting. But does anything on here, like, really jump out at you?

132
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:12,040
Yeah. The fact that white people don't have the highest median wealth or the highest median household income, but they do have the highest median.

133
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:16,420
Well, generationally, like. Yeah, that's really interesting.

134
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:22,480
So white population doesn't have that high of median household income, but Asian-Americans.

135
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:29,770
But they have more wealth. And that can be because of the intergenerational transfer of wealth,

136
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:35,650
which is an important reason why we see persistent racial and ethnic health disparities.

137
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:46,740
Anything else stand out on there, too? Yes.

138
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:57,200
There. Well, I don't know.

139
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:08,480
But I would guess because whatever survey they got the theater from May have had either too few Asian-Americans in the sample to us to me,

140
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:13,310
or they may have been in like an other racial category and they couldn't disagree.

141
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:20,140
That would be my guess. But I don't know. Yeah.

142
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:27,130
I mean, I think the thing that really stands out most to me when I look at the are the huge differences that.

143
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:30,550
Well, I mean, like enormous differences.

144
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:37,350
Well. We're going to talk more about that as we get there.

145
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:42,810
Yeah, Norma, I think this is just I don't know. I think you mentioned the first class of people.

146
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:47,000
I'm wondering for people. Yes.

147
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:52,440
Yeah. So usually we'll talk about this next week when we talk about the measurement of race and ethnicity.

148
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,429
But usually we measure race and ethnicity separately.

149
00:16:56,430 --> 00:17:03,060
So like, if you think about if you filled out the census, it first asks you, are you Hispanic or not?

150
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:08,040
Yes or no? And then regardless of what you answer to that, it asks you your race.

151
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:17,790
And it's usually like white, black, Asian and native Hawaiian Pacific Islander.

152
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:21,630
There's like, well, they're all three. Fletcher But there's like five or six of them.

153
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:28,920
And so, like, usually what you do is you combine those two things and you create non-Hispanic white,

154
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:33,330
Hispanic, white, non-Hispanic, black, Hispanic, black.

155
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:38,519
But a lot of times what people do is this is any Hispanic.

156
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:42,330
And then what this is, is not Hispanic, white, not Hispanic, black.

157
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:54,270
Does that make sense? Yes. So your Hispanic category usually includes people who typically can be characterized as white or black.

158
00:17:55,350 --> 00:18:00,700
So it's kind of like a mixed up. Yeah.

159
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:09,320
Okay. So let's talk about what the is.

160
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:20,240
So remember I told you this a minute ago that I know you know what ISIS is, but can you do finance?

161
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:29,810
You want to study it. You want to understand socioeconomic differences in cardiovascular disease.

162
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:41,630
What is socioeconomic status? Olivia.

163
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:48,549
I see you smiling. I think it's hard to tell. I'm smiling in the way we say socioeconomics that is so easily.

164
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:53,140
And then when you're asked this, fine. It's like, Oh, yeah, I'm not really sure.

165
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:59,139
I feel like I'd like to say it's like this subjective awareness of where you are within the social strata.

166
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:02,350
But then I don't know how we how you objectify that.

167
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:11,739
Okay. So there could be a subjective component of where you fall within a social hierarchy based on a lot of

168
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:17,280
things like everything that we already through a lot of education are the ones that I think of most often.

169
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:20,920
Okay. So in having education theory, you look like you want to add to that because I was like.

170
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:34,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's not just like.

171
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:50,800
Yeah. Well, it's like, how does that fit? Economic interest got a lot more complicated.

172
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:56,890
It's not just the economic piece. There's also the social piece in there that we have to think about.

173
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
Anybody else there to define it?

174
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:09,130
Ali, you look like you want to define it. You don't. Okay.

175
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:16,290
You don't have to do. I mean, I think normally people feel so used to education.

176
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:28,260
I mean, somehow I don't think. So sometimes in a paper you've seen where they think education and income and

177
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:32,550
try to combine them and make some kind of socio economic status indicator.

178
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:44,250
Yeah. So a very simple but not super helpful definition is an individual's position within the class structure of the society.

179
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:51,090
You're like, Yeah, that really does not clear it up because now we have to define class, right?

180
00:20:57,410 --> 00:21:02,440
So I think the most important well, let me let me go to the next one and then I'll say the second.

181
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:07,900
So you might hear people use the term social class to talk about this.

182
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:12,700
You might hear people just say social status and this is what they mean by social status.

183
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,290
Even though we've already talked about how there is like many different aspects of social status,

184
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:23,170
you might hear socioeconomic position rather than socioeconomic status.

185
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:29,070
People are all generally talking about the same thing when they use these terms.

186
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:37,090
There may be some subtle differences, but for the purposes of this class, these are all really mean the same thing.

187
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:49,760
And socioeconomic status. And this is the point, Sarah, that you are making is that it's related to social stratification and social inequality.

188
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:57,560
So it does have this social dimension to it that's beyond the economic piece.

189
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:08,260
My son is taking a personal finance class in high school right now.

190
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:15,110
When he came home and he said, Mom, what's our social class like, huh?

191
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:23,260
Okay, I'll try it. And I think what they were learning at school is they were really equating it to income.

192
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:30,100
So they were showing them like differences in income distribution across the U.S. And so he was trying to figure out where you fit in,

193
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:33,819
in the income distribution, which I think is interesting.

194
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:41,920
And gets to your point, Olivia, which is that a lot of times in kind of like the general public equate it to income.

195
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:47,710
But like you said, occupation is really important for thinking about this larger construct.

196
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:57,550
So what I want you to get out of this unhelpful definition is that socioeconomic status is a latent construct.

197
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:01,480
And by that I mean it's not directly observable.

198
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:06,140
I can't see your socioeconomic status.

199
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,730
It doesn't mean it's not real. It just means I can't see it.

200
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:21,850
And that usually when we have a latent variable, when we have something that we can't directly observe, we can't measure it with one question.

201
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:32,870
There's usually various what we would call indicators of that we can construct that kind of come together.

202
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:39,000
To define that construct that we can't directly observe.

203
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:46,450
So in a few minutes, we'll talk about what those different indicators are and what they mean.

204
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:59,610
Okay. So it's hard to define socio economic status, but it's not very hard to know how it's related to health.

205
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:07,770
What did you take away from the readings for this week? How is socioeconomic status related to health, however you define it?

206
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:31,800
Yeah. I feel like. I absolutely feel like pretty much in general there are a few exceptions for very specific diseases,

207
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:37,660
but for the most part, if you have higher socioeconomic status, no matter how you define that, it is better health.

208
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:54,490
So it's a really, really consistent finding. People with higher socioeconomic status tend to be in better health and they tend to live longer.

209
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:59,080
And that's true kind of across time and across place.

210
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:06,530
There's also a socio economic gradient and how.

211
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:12,430
And Michela, this just gets at your point about a positive correlation.

212
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:18,820
So it's like each step higher and socioeconomic status generally translates into better health.

213
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:25,719
So it's not like once you reach a certain point,

214
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:32,530
there's no there's no more advantage to having even greater socioeconomic status that continues to help.

215
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:36,580
Now, some studies do find that at some point it sort of levels off, you know,

216
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:42,670
if you have 30 million versus, you know, 20 million, maybe it doesn't make that much of a difference.

217
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:46,720
But in general, there is this gradient, socioeconomic gradient in health.

218
00:25:51,360 --> 00:26:00,600
There's also evidence from a life course perspective of cumulative advantage and disadvantage when we think about socioeconomic status.

219
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:11,190
So having more socio economic resources, the advantages that come along with that for health tend to accumulate over time.

220
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:16,499
Just like the disadvantages of low socioeconomic status accumulate over time.

221
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:21,600
And so you see widening disparities kind of across the life course.

222
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,630
Do you remember from the article when those disparities are greatest?

223
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:29,220
Few of you commented on that. I think of the discussion word.

224
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:39,090
Yeah. Patricia, it's. Yeah.

225
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:45,220
Yeah, it's mid-life. So and so there's huge disparities in birth outcomes.

226
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:54,879
But then once once you're born, you know, if you survive through the first year, then the sort of differences for kids by socioeconomic status.

227
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:03,640
There are differences in health, by family, socioeconomic status for kids, but they aren't huge in part because kids are generally pretty healthy.

228
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:10,809
And then those differences are just white over time and they're the greatest and mid-life.

229
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:18,940
So that like 45 to 65 kind of age range because these advantages and disadvantages have accumulated over time,

230
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:25,510
then this is the period where people really start to get sick, people start to develop chronic age related diseases.

231
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:34,390
And so then after that age, the disparities start to like level off or even narrow a little bit.

232
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:39,880
And why do you think that might be? Yeah, Ali.

233
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:53,570
Yeah. So there are like there are more social support like for older people in the US that can minimize economic differences.

234
00:27:54,230 --> 00:28:00,810
Any other reasons? Yes, there might be more. Yes.

235
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:05,750
Yeah. So there's also differential survival pass up point.

236
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:11,090
Right. And so then you have people who are more socially disadvantaged.

237
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:20,840
By the time you get to that late life period. Have other sort of advantages that that have helped keep them alive.

238
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:28,550
Right. So there could be differences in genetic endowments or things that might allow you to survive past that point.

239
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:43,190
Okay. So let's talk about measurement. We've already talked a little bit about this.

240
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:48,090
People have said you can measure income, you can measure education, you can put them together.

241
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:54,650
Usually that's what we do. We use these individual level measures.

242
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:01,090
Of income, education and occupation.

243
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:16,809
And then there's other measures that are less widely used but are important, like wealth and area based measures.

244
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:21,389
So sure, that gets at your point about like where you live and different resources and

245
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:25,530
where you live and how that is also a component of socio economic status.

246
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:34,890
So a lot of times studies will use one of these indicators and say this is how we're controlling for X.

247
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:42,920
But what's important to think about is that there's probably different mechanisms

248
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:48,350
by which each of these indicators of socio economic status impacts health.

249
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:57,290
So how income affects your health may be different slightly than how education affects your health and how occupation affects your health and wealth,

250
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:03,950
even though together they're capturing this like constructive socioeconomic status.

251
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:12,530
So the indicator that you use probably is going to depend on your your research question.

252
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:16,910
You're going to want it to match your research question. All right.

253
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:22,520
So now this should be easier. What is income?

254
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:29,190
Easier than defining socio economic stats, but maybe not that easy.

255
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:42,360
You're interested in doing a study on income? How would you define it?

256
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:58,330
Sure. Yeah. Okay.

257
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:03,190
So it could be money that you get from a job, you know, money that you earn, like.

258
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:10,290
So there could be dividends that you get from the stock market.

259
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:15,750
So the stocks themselves may not be income, but you earn income on them.

260
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:23,550
Yeah, maybe like people are. Sure.

261
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:28,420
So there could be government benefits like Social Security that provide income.

262
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:36,210
To get child support payments could be a source of income.

263
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:52,540
Yeah. So you can think about income of defining it in the context of some kind of time period,

264
00:31:53,770 --> 00:32:01,450
the amount of money that you've received from these things we've just talked about in a year or in a month or something like that.

265
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:03,009
Yeah.

266
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:16,410
So it's really it's about the amount of money that you get from things like a job or from investments or from the government or from child support.

267
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:24,190
I mean, even if you have student loans, that's a source of income when you get it right.

268
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:30,910
I mean, you have to turn around and give it back to the university. But still, that was it was income money that came to you.

269
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:47,090
And why would income affect your health? Pick one.

270
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:55,940
Yes. It impacts your ability to achieve the things that we're hoping for.

271
00:32:56,390 --> 00:33:06,230
So, yeah, you use it to buy things that you need to be healthy, like health care or um, like healthy food or any food.

272
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:13,810
You've got to have any other aspects of income that are important for health.

273
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:21,710
Yeah. Oh, a different story. If coming from here.

274
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:27,570
Okay. So income my indirectly influence health by reducing stress.

275
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:32,150
Yeah. Olivia, about what you're gonna say. Yeah. So? Yeah.

276
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:46,230
Yeah. Yeah. So it affects not only your ability to pay for housing, which you do, but it affects your ability to live and.

277
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:54,649
Right. So there's all these kind of all of these mechanisms by which income can affect our health.

278
00:33:54,650 --> 00:34:02,750
So it influences our material conditions, the quality, the type, the location of the housing that we have,

279
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:08,210
our ability to purchase food and clothing and transportation and medical care.

280
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:20,509
It allows us to pay for things like going to see a movie or doing other things that are fun and enjoyable and that reduce stress.

281
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:26,090
Right. And these are good for our health. It enables you to pay for child care if you have a child.

282
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:37,680
So can you think of any limitations of using income as an indicator of see us in a research study.

283
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:44,930
Yeah. Interesting. I know. Like, if you're talking about older adults, you're really.

284
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:58,930
Yeah. Income isn't really a great indicator of the resources that people have when they're retired, because oftentimes they have limited income,

285
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:07,810
but they can they can draw on other life particularly well if they need it to promote or they might like,

286
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:11,710
you know, they already they own their house, right? They don't need as much.

287
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:31,770
Yeah. Yeah.

288
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:41,829
So it could be that income is a better predictor of physical health outcomes because of the access to material conditions,

289
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:45,280
but less maybe not the best predictor of mental health.

290
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:52,140
Is that what's the outcome that you're interested in? Yeah, I don't know if this is either, but some of the things I.

291
00:35:54,490 --> 00:36:00,590
Like that or some other like thing that that money for them it's like.

292
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:06,360
I might not actually have that much. Yeah.

293
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:14,320
So I imagine somebody who makes $100,000 in San Francisco and somebody that makes $100,000 an hour.

294
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,550
Right. It's going to be really different, though. It might not be directly comparable if we're looking at people across the.

295
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:30,710
There may be a practical reason why income isn't great because people may not tell you.

296
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:41,830
And then you have a lot of. We have a very, very.

297
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:50,300
Right. Yeah. So it could be that like across I mean, think about it across racial groups.

298
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:59,570
Right. Like income for white versus black in the US is telling me something different because if you're not also capturing what.

299
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:04,969
Yeah, it would be it's not commenting at all on what expenses you have.

300
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:08,120
If you have no children versus three children, that's going to look a lot different.

301
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:15,080
Yeah, it doesn't account for like household size or how many people are depending on that income, which, you know, you can adjust for that.

302
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:22,430
But you would need. Right. Yeah. Yeah.

303
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,070
It isn't. How people are earning.

304
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,920
Yeah. Yeah.

305
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:45,860
So if you're not accounting for occupational risks associated for that income, you might be misunderstanding the relationship with of fair.

306
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:53,490
So I'm doing something I haven't had time to go on.

307
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:05,770
Yeah. Yeah.

308
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:09,099
So from a measurement perspective, I'm thinking of two things when you start that.

309
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:17,499
One, if you just used income like in dollars and you were comparing across time, you'd have a problem, right?

310
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:22,480
You would need to standardize and come to some point in time to account for inflation.

311
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:29,800
And then if you're doing something where you're categorizing people based on their income as high income, median or low,

312
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:38,920
and you're using the same cut points across target, you're probably just pacifying people as there's like changes in average income and inflation.

313
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:45,460
So yeah, you'd have to be careful about how you use that in people across time and also across place.

314
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,810
And there's a lot of tricky things about using income.

315
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:56,440
People don't like to report it. It can change a lot over the life course, too.

316
00:38:56,890 --> 00:39:02,650
So right now you're in school, your income is probably not so hot.

317
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:08,770
It doesn't mean you have low socioeconomic status. You're here getting your graduate degree right.

318
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:16,149
So looking at your income right now would probably not tell me very much about your socioeconomic status.

319
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:21,490
And there's other groups for whom that would be true, too, like older adults who are on fixed incomes.

320
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:33,220
Also, you know, you can think about if you're measuring it at one point in time, you could have someone who just experienced a temporary job loss.

321
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:40,780
And so they might have zero income or limited income because they're only receiving, you know, unemployment benefits.

322
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:46,030
But then a month later, they go back to having a high paying job.

323
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:52,540
And so you might be misclassifying their income because you're only looking at it and looking at it at one point in time.

324
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:55,780
Also, we talked about this is only one dimension of ACA,

325
00:39:55,780 --> 00:40:02,790
so you could have high income but low education or perform some kind of dangerous job that really increases your health risk.

326
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:11,110
Another thing we didn't talk about is that low income could be the result of poor health and not the cause, right?

327
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:17,440
So it could be that you have low income because you have a health condition that prevents you from working.

328
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:23,260
And so now it's not that the low income caused your poor health, but it's the other way around.

329
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:32,100
And this would be particularly true if you're looking at people in that late 50, 60 kind of age range,

330
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:38,919
you could get that being an issue, kind of like the study that you read for later today.

331
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:44,650
Right. That that was a concern in their study because of the age range that they're looking at.

332
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:54,219
So those are some limitations of income. So education, I'm not going to ask you to define education.

333
00:40:54,220 --> 00:41:02,560
I think you know that. So education is the most commonly used measure of socioeconomic status.

334
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:08,830
And why do you think that is? Why would people use education?

335
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:17,780
Yeah. Oh yeah. That one feels easier to break into categories, or you just do it by using that it would be easiest to get your hands on.

336
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:23,180
It feels pretty easy. You're right. It's just it can be years of education or it can be credentials.

337
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:30,230
It can be like degrees. It feels like we understand what education is and the different levels of it.

338
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:35,780
Any other reason why people might want to use education as an indicator?

339
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:49,720
Yeah. Yeah.

340
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:53,600
So it could be an indicator of your potential for future earnings.

341
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:59,270
So you may be out of work right now, but you have a masters degree, right?

342
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:03,110
So it's indicating potential for income.

343
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:16,520
That gives us this kind of idea that education is a foundational measure of socio economic status.

344
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:19,530
So if you think about the three kind of big indicators,

345
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:27,330
educated income education and occupation education is the foundation of your occupation and your income, right?

346
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:33,120
And so it's foundational. So that's one reason why people like to look at it.

347
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:47,040
Definitely less subject to selection bias, because typically education is completed prior to developing chronic disease.

348
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:54,270
There is evidence that kids health can impact their ultimate educational attainment.

349
00:42:55,260 --> 00:43:00,750
So it's not that that doesn't happen, but it's it's less common.

350
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:08,800
So. How might education affect health?

351
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:15,970
I mean, one way, as we just talked about, is that it kind of helps determine your income.

352
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:21,150
We already know that income affects how, but are there other ways that education might affect health?

353
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:29,130
And that's not through the path of income. To consider.

354
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:35,200
Okay. So it might impact literacy, your ability to understand information about.

355
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:43,710
The other way that education might affect help.

356
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:48,920
It's not through your income. Yeah.

357
00:43:49,110 --> 00:44:01,280
Just thinking about us. It's important during the pandemic because people with higher education level, they tend to accept low vaccination.

358
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:11,530
Yeah. So there may be differences in knowledge related to things that are health promoting.

359
00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:15,879
So like if you have, perhaps if you have higher education,

360
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:25,390
you have more exposure to biology courses or other things that help you understand vaccines and would lead to higher uptake.

361
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:43,850
Yeah. I thought I heard different.

362
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:56,150
Yeah. So the way that health care professionals interact with you may be different based on your level of education.

363
00:44:56,450 --> 00:45:04,820
This is more of an occupational thing. But when I went to the doctor the other day, I had written down like when I first had COVID,

364
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:15,860
when I went to when I saw the the limit in Eve urgent care visit, when I went to urgent care or when I started taking whatever, all this stuff, right.

365
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:24,200
All these days because I knew they were going to ask me that. And the note had I had written it on said epidemiology on the top and she saw it.

366
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:33,259
And the first thing she said was, you work here. And so not that I got the greatest have the greatest health care experience.

367
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:39,230
But but I would say that it was very clear that she was like, oh, this is someone who like,

368
00:45:39,830 --> 00:45:44,800
either I need to take seriously or I need to answer their questions, you know?

369
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:51,199
You know what I mean? Like she it made a difference in that encounter in a way that I didn't intend.

370
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:57,380
I didn't take that paper in there to be like, you have to take me seriously at that work at the university.

371
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:02,870
But, yeah, I think that does that does matter. Anything else about education?

372
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,230
Yes. Yeah. So in terms of like.

373
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:20,470
Definitely start. Our.

374
00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:28,549
Yes. Yes. Yeah.

375
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:29,300
So, you know,

376
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:39,860
if you think like back in that time and you think about different conceptions of like education is such a huge indicator of social class now in a way.

377
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:45,349
But historically it wasn't. It was more like historically, at least in the European context,

378
00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:53,540
it was more about your relationship to the means of production, like did you own stuff or were you a worker?

379
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:59,000
I think about Marx, right where you heard it privately or in the public period.

380
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:03,440
Um, and so that really didn't have a lot to do with education.

381
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:09,680
Um, whereas now education is so central to social class.

382
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:15,080
Um, but that has been a shift over time.

383
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:22,159
I mean, we can also talk about how just like there's changes over time in the meaning of income,

384
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:30,739
there's also changes over time in education because as more people get bachelor's degrees or more people get

385
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:37,280
masters degree is the sort of the name of that changes in terms of what it means for both in your life,

386
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:41,750
your kind of your status, but also your income potential.

387
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:50,690
Does that answer your question? I don't know that I have a perfect answer for that, but especially that one.

388
00:47:52,780 --> 00:48:01,659
Like if you get. Yeah. And I would say, like, it also depends on context.

389
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:07,120
So I have this paper that I did recently where we were looking at family,

390
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:14,740
socioeconomic status and child needs in Kenya in a population that's pastoralist.

391
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:21,310
So on average, the parents had about a first grade formal education.

392
00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:25,200
So that really did not indicate their social class.

393
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:33,940
The major indicator of social class in that particular context is livestock like how much livestock you have.

394
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:40,780
And then there are some other indicators too. But like we did this really cool analysis with latent class analysis and have

395
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:44,560
like all of these different potential indicators of socioeconomic status.

396
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:49,240
And the thing that really drives your status is livestock ownership.

397
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:59,440
And interestingly, generally, like in the US context here in Europe, studies find that kids whose families have higher socioeconomic status,

398
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,589
whether that's by the parents education or income or some combination,

399
00:49:02,590 --> 00:49:08,530
tend to have longer term owners, which we think of as indicating better health, less cellular aging.

400
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:16,210
In this context, having a higher social status was associated with shorter telomeres for the kids.

401
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:22,510
And so then when we looked at the individual indicators to see what was driving that, it was the livestock piece.

402
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:28,510
And we suspect that being in close proximity to livestock is associated with the

403
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:35,410
exposure to pesticides and also infectious diseases that might impact cellular aging.

404
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:42,510
So it's like looking at family socioeconomic status in relation to telomere length.

405
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:49,120
The association is going to be potentially context specific because of what it

406
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:53,590
means to have sort of higher socioeconomic status in one context versus another.

407
00:49:54,370 --> 00:49:57,009
So, you know, I thought that was for me,

408
00:49:57,010 --> 00:50:07,720
that was a really kind of interesting way of thinking about it because they have more material resources and they have higher prestige,

409
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:13,210
but it meant that they were then associated or exposed to something that was a risk factor.

410
00:50:15,770 --> 00:50:23,629
Okay. So in terms of how education affects health, it usually leads to a better job higher income,

411
00:50:23,630 --> 00:50:32,330
better housing, better neighborhoods, better working conditions. It has social value above and beyond the material benefits.

412
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:35,720
It's prestigious to have a high level of education.

413
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:40,040
It teaches you skills that can be used to maintain health.

414
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:46,580
That's what we're talking about in the Cuban context or with health. Literacy teaches you how to gather facts, how to assess information.

415
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:50,060
It also increases the sense of personal control.

416
00:50:50,210 --> 00:51:00,380
That's a really important component of education, is that the more education you have, the more you learn that you can control things in your life.

417
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:05,630
And that then has applications to health that are really super important.

418
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:13,830
Any limitations you can think of in using education.

419
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:27,050
We talked about one about how over time or across context, it might not mean the same thing.

420
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:38,960
No, I'm thinking of it. How important you think that for someone who went to Harvard Law School?

421
00:51:39,590 --> 00:51:45,590
Yeah, absolutely. So if you're just looking at years of education, you're not taking into account.

422
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:56,620
I don't want to say that Harvard is higher quality. But but but but it's not taking into account quality or perceived quality or the,

423
00:51:56,690 --> 00:52:00,980
you know, the way that employers might look at that education or something like that.

424
00:52:01,330 --> 00:52:06,740
Yeah. Yeah.

425
00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:14,389
Yeah, absolutely. So you could be a trust fund, baby. You like I'm not going to college, right?

426
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:17,440
I go to college. You have tons of resources, but you have no education.

427
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:23,630
Like when you think about, like, black.

428
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:31,080
And. The cost.

429
00:52:32,050 --> 00:52:37,690
Yeah, it's very high. And so lack of higher education.

430
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:48,620
Probably for the record today that it's been harder to pay off, therefore increasing longevity of having an equitable income.

431
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:52,450
And so that kind of money. Absolutely.

432
00:52:52,520 --> 00:53:03,620
So it could be that you have a higher education at the cost of a high level of debt, which that is like counteracting the influence of education.

433
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:07,730
And that might vary in important ways by race or other social characteristics.

434
00:53:08,090 --> 00:53:19,460
And also thinking about how discrimination can impact the way in which education translates into the benefits of income and things like that.

435
00:53:19,470 --> 00:53:27,650
Right? So so people with the same level of education, if they're experiencing discrimination and education, might not have the same returns.

436
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:38,160
Cohen. Yes.

437
00:53:38,970 --> 00:53:50,010
So it is true that there is this great vigor in this book by Raskin Roth on education and how that shows that for mental health,

438
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:58,920
like mental health gets better with each step of education until you get to the end and then it plummets.

439
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:05,040
So if you're just doing a master's, you're okay. For those who are doing it.

440
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:09,870
It really goes over the cliff.

441
00:54:10,210 --> 00:54:17,860
Yeah, that is true. Okay.

442
00:54:18,430 --> 00:54:26,710
So, yes, getting back to the point, I blame all of my silliness on the hole in my right ear.

443
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:32,590
It just wouldn't disturb you for someone to tell you there is a hole where it's not supposed to be.

444
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:42,490
And the way she said it, she was looking in my ear and she goes, Oh, that doesn't look right.

445
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:47,260
There's a hole. And I was like, There is what? She didn't explain.

446
00:54:47,470 --> 00:54:50,530
Anyway, okay, I got to let it go. I'm sure it's fine.

447
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:54,070
I'm sure it's fine. The quality of education varies.

448
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:58,510
Why? A number of years may not be a great indicator.

449
00:55:00,010 --> 00:55:06,040
I think it was. Also, it's in the in the book chapter that you read first today, and I know that's a really long chapter.

450
00:55:06,430 --> 00:55:16,329
So there's this part, but there's some really interesting work on in the United States when we still had like Jim Crow segregation,

451
00:55:16,330 --> 00:55:18,160
particularly like in the South.

452
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:28,810
So when there were separate schools for black kids and white kids, the number of days that the kids went to school was significantly different.

453
00:55:29,110 --> 00:55:35,079
And so even having the same number of years of education meant that you had radically different overall

454
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:42,069
quality of education because the number of days and then other quality indicators vary to right.

455
00:55:42,070 --> 00:55:47,920
And so even having the same number of years didn't translate into the same amount of education.

456
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:53,170
I mean, we can see this, you know, a modern example is with COVID, right?

457
00:55:53,170 --> 00:56:01,719
We know that there were differences by race in the amount of school that kids got during COVID because

458
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:07,720
of differences across place in how long schools shut down before they went back to in-person education.

459
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:14,350
But that wasn't random across the population. So we have we have that also.

460
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:24,220
All right. So occupation so occupation we can think about this is the structural link between education and income.

461
00:56:29,730 --> 00:56:36,240
And how might your occupation impact your health? Yeah.

462
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:41,050
They have occupation. That's a risk.

463
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:46,240
Yeah. So you might have an exposure to some kind of health risk as a result of your occupation.

464
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:50,110
Can you think of any example of something you might be exposed to at work?

465
00:56:54,770 --> 00:57:00,710
Health professionals like they do the best to make sure they get food and they want you to get it.

466
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:10,330
Yeah. Okay. So thinking about COVID, right? If you work in health care, you're going to be exposed potentially to more infectious diseases.

467
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:17,440
Yeah. Kind of like has to do.

468
00:57:18,670 --> 00:57:22,070
I felt like I was like, night shift.

469
00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:25,809
Yeah, like, kind of like. What? Did they like that?

470
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:35,260
I did that. Yeah. So your occupation, you could have to work night shifts or other irregular shifts that could have an impact on your health.

471
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:40,380
Yeah. Okay.

472
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:43,500
Also, your coworkers can impact your health. Certainly.

473
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:51,760
You might if you work in some kind of occupation where that's it can be good or bad, depending on the occupation.

474
00:57:56,600 --> 00:58:05,219
Very, very sure. Yeah. So it could be something like being a firefighter where you're at risk of being burned or something like that.

475
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:10,200
Or you could have to stand up all day, even holding income,

476
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:17,310
or you could do that for the amount of hours that you could do very different based on your occupation.

477
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:18,810
Let me get Norma and then healer.

478
00:58:19,450 --> 00:58:32,240
Oh, well, I got to thinking about actors and how they become hours doing things that you couldn't do when you come to you.

479
00:58:33,590 --> 00:58:41,100
Oh, yeah. It could be that you have high income, but you're working really, really long hours because of your particular occupation.

480
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:46,440
And that could be detrimental to your work in times like this.

481
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:52,380
Yeah. So you could think about some occupations come with benefits and some don't.

482
00:58:52,760 --> 00:59:04,790
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

483
00:59:04,790 --> 00:59:12,739
So if you're if you're in an occupation where they're constantly switching your schedule, you don't have a lot of control and that can be negative.

484
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:18,799
So, you know, there was just recently this almost a strike by the rail workers.

485
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:25,550
Did you hear about this? And a lot of what they were upset about was that they couldn't take time off for a doctor's

486
00:59:25,550 --> 00:59:30,980
appointment or if they got sick because their schedule was so strict and they felt like this was,

487
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:37,420
like, really negatively impacting their health. Yeah. Olivia, you could be more prone to have different environmental exposures.

488
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:45,970
So as mentioned by better smoke inhalation as a result of that house, agricultural worker, sun exposure, pesticide exposure, a lot of thing.

489
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:50,120
Yeah. So you could be exposed to the elements depending on your job.

490
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:59,360
You could be exposed to, like, chemicals or things. And you're thinking, Oh, I don't know.

491
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:08,810
Yeah, I'm constantly thinking about how if you're working in the community and if you see people strike, do you think that.

492
01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:14,380
Yes, absolutely. I think about social workers, too.

493
01:00:14,390 --> 01:00:23,810
Right. So you can have you can be exposed to a lot of distressing circumstances in your type of work, which can negatively impact your health.

494
01:00:26,970 --> 01:00:36,209
Yeah. There's lots of ways that occupations can occupation can impact our health that's not related to our education or our income.

495
01:00:36,210 --> 01:00:39,270
So there can be hazards in the physical environments.

496
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:49,950
You could be exposed to radiation, noise, dust, cold, psychosocial hazards, which we've talked about the freedom to make decisions.

497
01:00:52,330 --> 01:00:58,520
Ah. But thinking about your coworkers, you just. It could be a source of social support or social stream.

498
01:01:00,910 --> 01:01:04,600
The psychological demands associated with the occupation.

499
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:08,890
So we're going to talk about this in a few weeks when we talk about the work context and how.

500
01:01:09,310 --> 01:01:14,600
But if you have an occupation where there's high demands and low control is really bad for.

501
01:01:14,740 --> 01:01:23,390
All right. And so what might be some limitations of using occupation?

502
01:01:35,790 --> 01:01:40,190
Yeah. Ali. Yeah. I mean. Okay.

503
01:01:43,290 --> 01:01:49,769
Stay their home where you just. Yeah.

504
01:01:49,770 --> 01:01:53,870
So, like, what do you do with people who aren't in the work in the labor force?

505
01:01:53,890 --> 01:01:57,700
How would you define their occupation and what would you do with people who have more than one

506
01:01:57,700 --> 01:02:03,520
job or people who over the course of their life have had very different kinds of occupations?

507
01:02:05,310 --> 01:02:07,930
They do the same occupations and have kind of a different.

508
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:19,780
Like to just be like different depending on like there was like I don't know just have a yeah if you

509
01:02:19,780 --> 01:02:25,990
if in your occupation you have access to a union versus not that could definitely impact the Victoria.

510
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:38,700
Yeah. So how would we define like how would we define their occupation if they're that they are in between jobs

511
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:45,410
within their are limitless occupations and to be able to categorize these into groups is really challenge.

512
01:02:45,450 --> 01:02:52,460
Yeah. Can you imagine? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, the federal government does it to a lot of them, but then when you try to put it into an actual model.

513
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:58,130
Oh, yeah, you can't put it in a model. I see. Usually, like professional, skilled, unskilled and unemployed.

514
01:02:58,730 --> 01:03:01,580
Yeah. I don't know where things fall within that ranking. Right.

515
01:03:01,580 --> 01:03:09,650
Because how do you how do you rank order this to just say the same occupations differently depending on how they.

516
01:03:11,010 --> 01:03:14,370
What about if you really have the same job?

517
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:21,480
Absolutely. Like you could find so much meaning in being a social worker or being a public health professional.

518
01:03:21,870 --> 01:03:26,690
Or it could stress you out to the point that like that is really problematic.

519
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:34,330
Yeah. So it could interact with individual characteristics too. In fact, I know that someone said earlier, but it doesn't account how.

520
01:03:36,350 --> 01:03:42,420
Like. I think that's a long classified thing.

521
01:03:42,430 --> 01:03:48,010
System doesn't classify things like we might not be aware of that number and it would certainly have helped the attacks right away.

522
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:55,690
If you are staying, if you're a stay at home parent like that or you don't have your help, it's not that you have the absence of an occupation.

523
01:03:55,990 --> 01:04:00,040
But to get to your point, Olivia, where would you put that in like a ranking?

524
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:07,390
Because normally with occupations, you're trying to think of like lower versus higher status occupations.

525
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:14,950
So where would you put in something like temporarily unemployed or student or retired or a stay at

526
01:04:14,950 --> 01:04:19,990
home parent or like there's all of these things that it would be really difficult to classify.

527
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:31,530
Yeah, there. Like if they start working.

528
01:04:38,010 --> 01:04:45,650
There. You know, so that, you know, that's okay.

529
01:04:45,660 --> 01:04:46,049
But yeah,

530
01:04:46,050 --> 01:04:57,090
so how certain groups may have barriers to work in order to access other benefits and so that I would be classified that in terms of occupation, yeah,

531
01:04:57,210 --> 01:05:01,050
I think occupation is probably of the three that we talked about is the hardest

532
01:05:01,050 --> 01:05:08,430
to measure and the least used for sure because it's so difficult to capture.

533
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:15,719
And I think especially if you're thinking about it from a white person perspective, you know,

534
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:21,450
people will typically have many different jobs and could be classified by many different occupations.

535
01:05:21,870 --> 01:05:26,730
And which one indicates which one is marking their socioeconomic status?

536
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:35,610
Like I think if you're doing if you're doing a like an environmental health kind of approach, right,

537
01:05:35,610 --> 01:05:43,460
and you're really interested in exposure to carcinogens in your in your day to day work, right?

538
01:05:43,470 --> 01:05:48,570
That's like that's the kind of study where you can really get into that occupation piece.

539
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:56,310
But if you're trying to use it as an indicator of where someone falls in the social hierarchy, it becomes much more difficult to use.

540
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:00,850
Okay. So let's talk about. Well.

541
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:13,150
So we talked about income before, which is like money that you get from different sources comes in on a fairly regular basis in a specific time frame.

542
01:06:13,930 --> 01:06:18,730
How would you define. Well, it's not income.

543
01:06:22,620 --> 01:06:25,740
Yeah. No, but you have access to.

544
01:06:25,950 --> 01:06:30,330
Okay, so it can be financial resources that you have access to.

545
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:38,580
Um, what would be some examples of those financial assets or like family planning that you may provide?

546
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:45,090
Yeah. So it could be like assets in terms of things that you own.

547
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:49,660
Yeah. Yeah. Or investments. So it could. Yeah.

548
01:06:49,770 --> 01:06:53,489
So it could be things that you could sell and get money for basically.

549
01:06:53,490 --> 01:06:59,790
Yeah. And so you can think about well as the value of your assets minus your liabilities.

550
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:11,340
So what you own minus versus minus what you owe so your house can be a source of wealth if you have a lot of equity in it.

551
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:21,780
Um, when you first buy a house, it is not a source of wealth because you don't really own very much of it.

552
01:07:22,260 --> 01:07:26,130
A trust fund? No, I think that was kind of one of the things that you were getting out.

553
01:07:26,140 --> 01:07:32,280
So if you're if your parents had money and they pass away and they leave a trust fund,

554
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:39,060
that's a source of wealth for you, a savings account would even be a source of wealth.

555
01:07:40,230 --> 01:07:45,150
If you have a401k or some other kind of retirement plan, that's a source of wealth.

556
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:54,810
And the idea, like Noel said, is that if you need these things, you can go cash them out and you can get money.

557
01:07:57,140 --> 01:08:03,770
So. Well, tends to be. How is that different from income?

558
01:08:04,190 --> 01:08:11,060
It's not providing like a regular source of money to you, but it can be used to get money.

559
01:08:13,850 --> 01:08:19,490
It also tends to be more stable than income. It doesn't fluctuate as much.

560
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:27,970
You know, you can have a very high income and if you suddenly lose your job, you have no income.

561
01:08:28,780 --> 01:08:30,880
But wealth tends to be more stable.

562
01:08:34,230 --> 01:08:42,000
So how might how might well influence your health aside from income and occupation and education and these other things,

563
01:08:42,010 --> 01:08:45,210
does it have its own independent effects on health?

564
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:58,330
Yeah. No, I think stress probably if you have a safety net, that's a really different situation.

565
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:08,610
Yeah. Yeah. If you know you have resources you can draw on in times of financial distress that can really reduce your sense of stress more.

566
01:09:11,540 --> 01:09:25,489
Over time. Yeah. Yeah.

567
01:09:25,490 --> 01:09:30,799
And you can even think about it as having intergenerational health benefits,

568
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:35,740
not just intergenerational benefits in terms of the amount of resources that you have.

569
01:09:35,950 --> 01:09:41,770
Right. But if we think about from a life course perspective and how health is transmitted across generations,

570
01:09:42,170 --> 01:09:52,520
but having that history of wealth can influence health in this way that gets at that cumulative advantage even across generations, not just with.

571
01:09:56,380 --> 01:10:06,800
Yeah. I mean, I think the biggest thing about well is that it provides this buffer for you that if you have a loss of income,

572
01:10:06,820 --> 01:10:17,410
you have access to this thing that can help provide economic stability in case of a job loss or an illness or some other disruption to your income.

573
01:10:17,950 --> 01:10:23,290
And you can also use it to pay for health, promoting things like education.

574
01:10:23,740 --> 01:10:32,110
Right. So if your family has wealth either through home ownership or through an inheritance or something like that,

575
01:10:32,380 --> 01:10:35,530
and that can be used to pay for your education.

576
01:10:35,530 --> 01:10:42,250
And you don't like making a living if you don't have to take out loans for that because your family had well, you're getting this huge,

577
01:10:42,730 --> 01:10:53,350
um, health promoting resource without that associated cost of having to borrow or work to pay for it while you're in school.

578
01:10:53,980 --> 01:10:58,240
So wealth can, can really help you buy these health promoting things.

579
01:11:02,110 --> 01:11:08,830
We already talked about this a little bit at the beginning of class, but there's really huge racial disparities in wealth.

580
01:11:09,010 --> 01:11:13,900
The disparities in wealth are greater than the disparities in income or education, for sure.

581
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:31,180
And why would that be? We already touched on this a little bit when talking about intergenerational transmission of.

582
01:11:31,180 --> 01:11:37,060
Well. Yeah.

583
01:11:37,890 --> 01:11:46,470
No, I'll think of that. Oh, yeah.

584
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:51,570
Oh, known. And how I've heard something about a performance.

585
01:11:54,810 --> 01:12:01,810
Yeah, I know it's a lot of money, but every time I think of our time, that's.

586
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:09,450
That's I mean, like, the people that defend it became the original, and now I'm not alone.

587
01:12:09,690 --> 01:12:13,410
Well, yeah, that's a tone from them.

588
01:12:13,730 --> 01:12:16,780
And also, I think there's stuff going on in as well.

589
01:12:19,180 --> 01:12:23,720
Thank you for your time. And it was confiscated by the government.

590
01:12:24,430 --> 01:12:29,260
Yeah. So, like, historically in the US, black people couldn't own property.

591
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:32,830
In the beginning of the US, black people were property.

592
01:12:32,830 --> 01:12:38,530
Right. And then after slavery ended, they were not compensated for that.

593
01:12:39,310 --> 01:12:47,830
And then later after slavery, there were other things that prevented home ownership or the acquisition of land.

594
01:12:48,250 --> 01:12:56,620
And that is the main source of intergenerational wealth in our country, is owning land, owning property.

595
01:12:57,580 --> 01:13:08,080
And even if you think about there's sort of current discrimination to that undervalues property

596
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:15,120
and areas where black people live and so that also perpetuates these inequalities and wealth.

597
01:13:15,130 --> 01:13:16,300
I don't know if you guys saw this.

598
01:13:16,630 --> 01:13:25,209
There was an article in The New York Times maybe a month or two ago about a couple who lived in suburban D.C. They were both professors.

599
01:13:25,210 --> 01:13:28,630
Did you see this, Cynthia? Do you want do you want to explain it?

600
01:13:33,430 --> 01:13:44,150
And. So they they had I mean, they wanted to refinance their house, right?

601
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:48,500
So, like, if you own a house, you can do this thing where you refinance it,

602
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:52,969
where you can you can either get a lower interest rate or you can take money out.

603
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:55,990
That's equity and you can use it to pay for college or fees or something like that.

604
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:04,309
So there's a lot of reasons why you would refinance out. So this black couple had a bank coming in to do an appraisal of their house.

605
01:14:04,310 --> 01:14:07,459
Right? And then they didn't like the appraisal.

606
01:14:07,460 --> 01:14:11,660
They thought that it was too low. And so then they.

607
01:14:17,780 --> 01:14:21,930
Yeah. So they they took everything out and they took family pictures out.

608
01:14:21,950 --> 01:14:26,750
They took art out. Anything that indicated that a black family lived in that house, they took it out.

609
01:14:27,230 --> 01:14:37,470
They had some white friends come to the house to be there when the inspector came and it was something like almost $200,000 difference in the house.

610
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:41,390
And the appraisal, I mean, it was like it was it was nuts, right?

611
01:14:41,780 --> 01:14:51,560
And so it was such a powerful example of how even in the absence of any laws that are discriminatory,

612
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:57,709
that you can still experience this kind of discrimination from the banking system and from

613
01:14:57,710 --> 01:15:02,420
individuals within the banking system that have huge implications for you financially.

614
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:07,130
Um, and so that's just like a very recent example.

615
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:14,390
So there's all of these things that contribute to these big racial disparities in wealth.

616
01:15:16,790 --> 01:15:19,129
And I think we know, as we've already talked about,

617
01:15:19,130 --> 01:15:27,170
this will have implications for health because we know that wealth is really important for health for all these reasons that we've been talking about.

618
01:15:32,390 --> 01:15:35,870
So let's talk about area based measures a little bit.

619
01:15:38,250 --> 01:15:46,290
So we can think of communities as also having a socio economic status beyond individuals having those communities can have it.

620
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:51,690
So what does it mean to say that a community has socio economic status?

621
01:15:59,610 --> 01:16:07,860
Sorry. I can't. Okay. I felt like your hand was going up. Going like.

622
01:16:09,930 --> 01:16:23,380
Whatever is in that area I like. Yeah.

623
01:16:23,410 --> 01:16:32,350
So people tend to cluster in communities based on their own socio economic resources, which then means that there's differences in those communities,

624
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:41,350
in the resources that are available to the community in terms of things like grocery stores or parks and recreation.

625
01:16:44,060 --> 01:16:48,840
Oh, okay. Yeah. So for sure.

626
01:16:48,860 --> 01:17:00,350
So communities also have this kind of socioeconomic status that even beyond, like who is represented in that neighborhood or in that community.

627
01:17:00,650 --> 01:17:06,110
So we can look at area based measures like per capita income in an area,

628
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:11,479
the percent in poverty, the unemployment rate, the extent of income inequality.

629
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:15,560
There's a lot of different area based measures that we can use.

630
01:17:18,580 --> 01:17:24,580
And we know from prior research that a community's socio economic status influences

631
01:17:24,580 --> 01:17:30,310
health above and beyond individual socioeconomic status characteristics.

632
01:17:30,340 --> 01:17:36,250
So if we look at these area based measures and we also control for individual income and individual education,

633
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:46,770
there's still an effect of the size of the area. And we'll we're going to have a unit on neighborhoods later in the semester.

634
01:17:46,770 --> 01:17:56,820
So we'll talk more about this idea. But can you think of any limitations to trying to include area based measures in your study?

635
01:18:04,860 --> 01:18:11,920
I should have given. Like it doesn't have to.

636
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:16,540
You know, it's like. Yeah.

637
01:18:19,850 --> 01:18:22,930
Yeah. It's hard to define this. Like, what is a community?

638
01:18:23,650 --> 01:18:27,670
You just gave some examples. Is it the county? Is the city.

639
01:18:28,210 --> 01:18:33,910
Um, we might even look at? Is that the census tract or a smaller area?

640
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:42,400
And people within a city might identify neighborhoods based on the the elementary school that kids go to.

641
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:46,120
That's a common way in Ann Arbor that people talk about neighborhoods, oh,

642
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:54,910
is it Burns Park or is a bar or Chene or these other elementary schools kind of how they're defined?

643
01:18:55,420 --> 01:19:02,110
So it can be tricky to to measure this because you have to figure out what's but what is the area unit you're interested.

644
01:19:02,470 --> 01:19:08,220
Yeah. It's harder to find. Yeah.

645
01:19:11,230 --> 01:19:13,740
Sure. Yeah.

646
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:21,639
So you can have things like gentrification and like a process that's happening over time, that's changing the area in ways that can influence health.

647
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:27,640
And so you'd have to also be thinking about it as like something that's not static across time.

648
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:30,830
And how would you how would you capture that in your models?

649
01:19:37,830 --> 01:19:46,290
Okay. So another way that we could potentially measure socio economic status is through this idea of subjective social status.

650
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:56,340
Olivia I feel like when you defined us at the beginning, it felt like you were kind of thinking about it in this context of subjective social status.

651
01:19:58,680 --> 01:20:02,459
So you probably can't see those words, but I'll, I'll explain it to you.

652
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:09,240
So if we want to measure this is basically asking someone where do you think

653
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:16,170
you fall in terms of the socioeconomic hierarchy in the place where you live,

654
01:20:16,590 --> 01:20:20,640
either within the country that you live or your more local community?

655
01:20:20,650 --> 01:20:24,750
There's different versions of this. So what do you do in a survey?

656
01:20:24,750 --> 01:20:32,040
If you want to get at someone's subjective social status, you show them a picture of a ladder that has ten runs,

657
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:42,630
and then you ask them to imagine that the ladder represents where people stand in society with those at the top being the best off,

658
01:20:43,410 --> 01:20:49,860
having the most money, the most education and the most respected jobs, and those at the bottom being worse off.

659
01:20:50,430 --> 01:20:56,190
And then they're instructed to point to the wrong indicating their position in this hierarchy.

660
01:20:56,730 --> 01:21:03,690
So you're just telling them, think about where you live, think about how people are kind of organized.

661
01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:07,620
These are the people that have the most. These are the people that have the least.

662
01:21:07,710 --> 01:21:15,870
Where do you fall? So what do you think about that as a measure?

663
01:21:20,590 --> 01:21:25,930
Yeah. Olivia, I like it if you're not trying to maybe tie it to an objective health outcome.

664
01:21:26,350 --> 01:21:29,340
If it's more of something of if you're looking at someone's, like,

665
01:21:29,350 --> 01:21:34,149
mental status in how they perceive themselves in their family, maybe this would be really beneficial.

666
01:21:34,150 --> 01:21:37,690
But if you're looking at how that influences an objective health outcome,

667
01:21:37,690 --> 01:21:42,990
maybe something that they perceive as like really high status does not actually associate with really hypothesize.

668
01:21:43,210 --> 01:21:50,080
Okay, so maybe you like it if you're thinking about it in terms of mental health or psychological outcomes,

669
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:58,510
but maybe less so for others have actually seen and inflated in their own.

670
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:09,400
We to know what doing? So yeah, people could have very different references here.

671
01:22:09,820 --> 01:22:18,190
Um, so kind of who, you know, could in good shape, like where you put, where you place yourself.

672
01:22:18,190 --> 01:22:22,089
And it is true that when you look at different versions of this,

673
01:22:22,090 --> 01:22:29,709
when you ask people to think about the country versus their local community, there are differences in where they place themselves.

674
01:22:29,710 --> 01:22:35,230
It's their reference point is the entire user and the reference point is your own local community.

675
01:22:36,340 --> 01:22:41,220
Yeah, that can be a little bit of a challenge. Yeah.

676
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:53,719
Okay. So. Yeah.

677
01:22:53,720 --> 01:23:02,660
So. So. Sort of. But I guess I can see how that could be both a positive and negative in this measure,

678
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:07,580
because you're sort of saying that people are inherently taking other dimensions of social

679
01:23:07,580 --> 01:23:13,160
status into account for themselves rather than just thinking about income as well.

680
01:23:14,690 --> 01:23:23,670
And so some people might argue that good because that is maybe a more accurate reflection of true social values,

681
01:23:23,740 --> 01:23:26,180
because it's incorporating these other dimensions,

682
01:23:26,180 --> 01:23:34,320
whereas others might say that's a limitation because it's not really telling us just socio economic data, perhaps other.

683
01:23:35,700 --> 01:23:46,880
Kathleen. Yeah.

684
01:23:47,130 --> 01:23:50,500
The. So.

685
01:24:07,540 --> 01:24:19,689
Yeah. So your own individual, either personality characteristics or even mental health circumstances, could influence where you rank yourself.

686
01:24:19,690 --> 01:24:22,860
And it may not really be accurate. Yeah.

687
01:24:22,870 --> 01:24:25,970
No. Yeah. I was like, I think it was something on the same line.

688
01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:33,250
Just like completely anecdotally, based on my own experiences, I feel like like 80 to 90% people would say there are five or six.

689
01:24:33,350 --> 01:24:38,300
Yeah, like, you know what I mean? Just thinking about the people. I went to college, my friend was like, Yeah, I'm upper middle class.

690
01:24:39,330 --> 01:24:43,000
And you're like, Then you're not. Yeah, yeah.

691
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:51,700
And I do think, like to be self-referential and there could be cultural ten to these two of like, you know,

692
01:24:51,700 --> 01:25:01,209
it's socially unacceptable to place yourself at the top or something and then you can have a lot of clumping around the middle or on the bottom,

693
01:25:01,210 --> 01:25:04,300
depending on what is sort of expected.

694
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:09,070
Yeah, these subjective measures can really vary across culture.

695
01:25:09,070 --> 01:25:10,690
Same thing with Self-Rated hope.

696
01:25:10,690 --> 01:25:18,099
I don't think we've talked that much about Self-Rated health in this class before, but I think this is very similar to Self-Treat in health.

697
01:25:18,100 --> 01:25:27,249
It actually does an amazing job at predicting whether somebody is going to die during a follow up period even better than a physician examination.

698
01:25:27,250 --> 01:25:35,229
Like there's something about people's own rankings of their health, their own rankings of their social status that are important for health,

699
01:25:35,230 --> 01:25:39,130
but they may not reflect what we would think of as objective reality.

700
01:25:39,490 --> 01:25:47,420
So in at least one study, subjective social status was more strongly associated with health outcomes than objective measures of ethics.

701
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:56,260
And in a bunch of other studies, subjective social status remained a significant predictor, even after adjusting for objective indicators.

702
01:25:56,530 --> 01:26:02,440
So this is sort of what I was getting at, is that it might be reflecting something that's really important for health,

703
01:26:02,950 --> 01:26:07,120
but not what we think it's measuring necessarily.

704
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:15,760
And so we might we might see it as in some way a biased measure, but it does appear to be very important for health.

705
01:26:16,900 --> 01:26:29,350
And so this gets into that this idea of where we perceive ourselves within the social hierarchy, um, in itself can have impacts on health.

706
01:26:31,900 --> 01:26:39,610
And so there's there's a lot of interesting research in primates in where they can manipulate status hierarchies,

707
01:26:39,610 --> 01:26:42,730
like dominance hierarchies, and see how that impacts health.

708
01:26:43,150 --> 01:26:46,900
And there's really big impacts, especially in like cardiovascular health,

709
01:26:47,860 --> 01:26:56,980
that being in like being lower status within a social group just in itself, even if, like the researchers are giving you food.

710
01:26:57,700 --> 01:26:59,979
Right. Like you don't have to worry about that kind of stuff.

711
01:26:59,980 --> 01:27:05,140
But just being lower in the hierarchy has these like health impacts probably through stress.

712
01:27:18,100 --> 01:27:21,710
So there were a lot of questions in the discussion about this article.

713
01:27:21,730 --> 01:27:29,139
On the areas of research and ethics and health. And I thought you guys had some really some great questions about that and kind of observations.

714
01:27:29,140 --> 01:27:36,790
And we've already talked about this a little bit, but in this kind of first area of research on socioeconomic status and how people were

715
01:27:36,790 --> 01:27:44,890
thinking about the effects of poverty and thinking about it as a dichotomous exposure,

716
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:51,490
you know, you are in poverty or you're not. And how is that related to morbidity and mortality?

717
01:27:53,050 --> 01:28:02,890
And so they were really focused on this idea of material deprivation and that that's why socioeconomic status would be associated with health,

718
01:28:02,890 --> 01:28:08,980
because you don't have enough food to eat. You don't have access to adequate housing.

719
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:14,899
And so somebody and I forgot to write names,

720
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:23,630
but somebody had this really great comment about the threshold model and sort of realizing like, Oh, how we code our variables.

721
01:28:24,280 --> 01:28:29,520
It's really important for our understanding that we get after doing an analysis.

722
01:28:29,540 --> 01:28:33,100
Ali, was that you? I think you said something about it.

723
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:38,950
Oh, okay. Sarah, was that your thing? You're sitting right.

724
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:43,870
This is like. Yeah, I saw that. I, I know.

725
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:48,469
Like, I don't know what I did 10 minutes ago. I have no idea what I said, but so yeah.

726
01:28:48,470 --> 01:28:51,920
So I'll, I'll tell you what the comment was and you'd be like, Oh yeah, that was mine.

727
01:28:51,930 --> 01:29:01,040
Or maybe it wasn't. But so somebody was noting this idea that like oftentimes in epidemiology we dichotomous exposures.

728
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:06,890
Okay, so that one's you. Ali Yeah, I did. I just think when I read that whole thing, I was like, So what?

729
01:29:06,950 --> 01:29:11,629
You know what I mean? Yeah, like, you know, like, what's the big deal?

730
01:29:11,630 --> 01:29:17,160
Yeah. But I didn't realize that that was like where?

731
01:29:19,610 --> 01:29:24,720
Yeah, I understand. Oh, great.

732
01:29:24,740 --> 01:29:28,100
If you don't cut of my something, you don't know if there's a gradient.

733
01:29:28,220 --> 01:29:32,360
Like you can't actually see that in your analysis or in your data.

734
01:29:32,360 --> 01:29:39,110
So it really affects your interpretation of the evidence.

735
01:29:39,110 --> 01:29:44,120
And so you might say we found evidence for poverty as a threshold.

736
01:29:44,660 --> 01:29:52,280
Therefore the implication is, um, that to improve health we would need to move people out of poverty.

737
01:29:52,280 --> 01:29:59,780
Now, that might not be wrong, but it might not be a complete understanding of how socioeconomic status impacts

738
01:29:59,780 --> 01:30:03,590
health because you're really just thinking about it from this material perspective.

739
01:30:03,980 --> 01:30:11,750
Whereas when we move into thinking about the social gradient, it can no longer only be about material circumstances, right?

740
01:30:11,750 --> 01:30:15,170
Because everybody above a certain point has enough to live.

741
01:30:15,650 --> 01:30:19,100
But then we still see that there's these impacts on health.

742
01:30:19,100 --> 01:30:24,290
So that's when we get to that sort of second era where we're thinking about gradients and

743
01:30:24,290 --> 01:30:29,390
seeing that there's disparities that exist across the entire socioeconomic hierarchy.

744
01:30:29,810 --> 01:30:32,750
And once we move to these gradient models,

745
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:42,950
that's when we start focusing on psychosocial explanations related to the health impacts of inequality itself, not just material deprivation.

746
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:52,790
And then in the third era, people get interested in mechanisms like, okay,

747
01:30:52,790 --> 01:30:57,950
so we've established that there's really this relationship, we've established that it's in the form of a gradient.

748
01:30:58,490 --> 01:31:07,069
So why what are the like what are the causal factors that are underlying this association?

749
01:31:07,070 --> 01:31:15,139
So you get research on differential access to health care differences and environmental exposures,

750
01:31:15,140 --> 01:31:19,460
differences in health behaviors and differences in exposure to stress.

751
01:31:27,020 --> 01:31:34,850
Then after we're kind of establishing mechanisms, people are moving on thinking about multiple levels of influence.

752
01:31:35,270 --> 01:31:41,329
So this is where researchers in social epidemiology are moving beyond just thinking about an individual's

753
01:31:41,330 --> 01:31:47,990
socioeconomic status and also thinking about where they live and what sort of communities socio economic status.

754
01:31:48,350 --> 01:31:52,310
So how do neighborhoods affect health? How do communities affect how?

755
01:31:54,650 --> 01:32:00,680
And then in the fifth era. And of course, all of these types of studies are all going on at the same time.

756
01:32:00,680 --> 01:32:04,999
It's not it's not that people don't still do research on mechanisms.

757
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:14,300
They certainly do. But just in general, what's new in this first era is thinking about interactions, systems and causality.

758
01:32:14,570 --> 01:32:20,240
So people are thinking about life, course, socio economic status from a life course perspective.

759
01:32:20,810 --> 01:32:26,210
So timing, pathways, accumulation change.

760
01:32:26,540 --> 01:32:32,710
Sarah I think it was you said how do we account for upward mobility, right?

761
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:40,990
And so that is important. Like there are people like your socioeconomic status is not fixed across the life course.

762
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:49,879
It can change, right? You can be better off than than your family of origin or you can be worse off in terms of socioeconomic status.

763
01:32:49,880 --> 01:32:54,530
And how does that influence health? So that gets into these life course models,

764
01:32:54,980 --> 01:33:00,740
people doing research on gene environment interactions are some people are

765
01:33:00,740 --> 01:33:06,740
more sensitive to the social environment in a way that's related to genetics.

766
01:33:06,740 --> 01:33:19,700
And how do we understand that complex systems approach is using things like causal inference, text techniques, like instrumental variables.

767
01:33:21,960 --> 01:33:24,060
Thinking about randomized trials.

768
01:33:24,060 --> 01:33:36,660
I was reading this morning in the in the news about universal basic income programs and then and the policy that we had last year that expired now.

769
01:33:36,660 --> 01:33:45,590
But the child tax credits where families were getting checks each month or money deposited into their account from the government for having kids.

770
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:50,580
Right. And how much that reduced child poverty and thinking about the impacts of that on health.

771
01:33:56,010 --> 01:34:07,950
One of the other things that came up in here was a question about whether only the fifth era was really about causality.

772
01:34:07,980 --> 01:34:11,460
That was your question there. Do you want to say more about that?

773
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:18,910
Yeah. Oh. We did this over.

774
01:34:22,630 --> 01:34:26,310
The starting. Yeah.

775
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:39,620
Or was it more than, like, your. Yeah.

776
01:34:40,680 --> 01:34:46,030
So I was. I was. No, no, it's it's absolutely true.

777
01:34:46,030 --> 01:34:49,870
And it relates to what we were talking about last time when we talked about methods.

778
01:34:50,500 --> 01:34:55,000
Right. We were like, no, we always care about causal questions unless we're really,

779
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:59,290
really just trying to do something descriptive, which sometimes we do in epidemiology.

780
01:34:59,680 --> 01:35:03,850
But for the most part, we are trying to understand something from a causal perspective.

781
01:35:03,850 --> 01:35:05,710
Maybe we don't have the right data,

782
01:35:06,070 --> 01:35:13,299
maybe we don't have the right models in order to be confident that we can make causal inferences from what we're seeing.

783
01:35:13,300 --> 01:35:20,770
But we really are coming at it from trying to promote, trying to understand, cause I mean, even if you think about ERA three, right?

784
01:35:20,770 --> 01:35:27,010
Like what are what are mechanisms about mechanisms are all about trying to understand, is this a causal relationship?

785
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:32,680
If so, we want to understand why. What is it doing that's that's impacting how.

786
01:35:37,910 --> 01:35:41,870
I'm just looking through my notes to make sure there's nothing else that I want to kind of bring up.

787
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:56,200
So I'm just going to I'm going to end with this one question about so somebody asked, can we disrupt status hierarchies?

788
01:36:00,190 --> 01:36:12,620
What do you think? Kind of goes back to our discussion that we had about fundamental causes of health,

789
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:17,840
and we talked about how social inequality produces health inequality.

790
01:36:18,710 --> 01:36:23,990
And so then a question is, can we reduce or eliminate social inequality?

791
01:36:25,320 --> 01:36:33,760
What are you saying? See how optimistic you're feeling today or pessimistic?

792
01:36:36,210 --> 01:36:42,910
Yeah, Ali, I definitely do. Rhetorical question.

793
01:36:45,120 --> 01:36:49,530
Yeah. That's very popular with the answer being no.

794
01:36:49,830 --> 01:36:57,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

795
01:36:57,150 --> 01:37:02,730
Patricia, this is just my personal opinion, but I feel like in the U.S.

796
01:37:07,680 --> 01:37:14,930
To produce. Yeah.

797
01:37:14,940 --> 01:37:19,040
And remember that some people think inequality is good, right?

798
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:22,640
It's not everybody thinks that inequality is bad.

799
01:37:23,060 --> 01:37:28,820
People who study health tend to think that it is because it's you know, it's associated with negative health outcomes.

800
01:37:29,330 --> 01:37:36,889
But like you're saying, if you're coming from it from a perspective, an economic perspective or the perspective of capitalism,

801
01:37:36,890 --> 01:37:41,090
you might say inequality is good because it breeds competition and that's good.

802
01:37:42,350 --> 01:37:47,850
Right. So I think there's there's that, too.

803
01:37:47,870 --> 01:37:51,190
So you could imagine, like inequality.

804
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:55,380
So one perspective might be, well, inequality is entrenched and it's hard to wait.

805
01:37:55,400 --> 01:37:58,640
It's hard to change a system once it's already in place.

806
01:37:59,030 --> 01:38:06,769
Another perspective might be that inequality is valued, which also makes it even harder to change.

807
01:38:06,770 --> 01:38:10,280
So not only is it entrenched, but it's valued in some ways.

808
01:38:10,280 --> 01:38:18,430
And so that makes it challenging. So those are the pessimistic perspectives.

809
01:38:18,440 --> 01:38:23,030
Anybody feel like there is room for a change in their.

810
01:38:26,580 --> 01:38:37,280
I mean, what do you think about the child tax credits? Yeah.

811
01:38:37,550 --> 01:38:42,180
You're. Yeah.

812
01:38:44,010 --> 01:38:51,550
Yeah. Like on the pessimistic side, are we going to change the characters?

813
01:38:51,560 --> 01:38:55,760
And maybe not, but there are. Yeah.

814
01:38:57,260 --> 01:39:01,620
Yeah. Yeah. So maybe we don't fundamentally change the system.

815
01:39:01,640 --> 01:39:09,830
There's there's entrenched inequality or even the promotion of inequality, but there can be ways to reduce the harmful impacts for particular.

816
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:38,260
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, because we can think about it from it from an incremental perspective and we can think about it from the perspective of like,

817
01:39:38,260 --> 01:39:44,430
okay, maybe there's maybe this much inequality is inevitable in all systems.

818
01:39:44,440 --> 01:39:54,909
I mean, that's like a philosophical question, right? Um, but like, you can have different systems, can produce this much or this much or this much.

819
01:39:54,910 --> 01:39:59,250
And so it's kind of like it's not an all or nothing proposition.

820
01:39:59,260 --> 01:40:04,899
It's not that we have to have complete equality or complete and equality like there is kind of variation in

821
01:40:04,900 --> 01:40:12,210
there and that variation can impact the population health outcomes or maybe at sort of an individual level,

822
01:40:12,220 --> 01:40:18,070
it doesn't have much of an impact, but across an entire population that can really like shift distributions and things.

823
01:40:19,790 --> 01:40:27,619
So I think there's I think the optimistic and the pessimistic take or are both perfectly reasonable takes on this.

824
01:40:27,620 --> 01:40:34,460
I mean, I would say that probably some degree of inequality is baked in to human systems.

825
01:40:34,850 --> 01:40:43,640
I would say in the US with capitalism, like you say, Patricia, that there's more of that built in and even and valued and promoted.

826
01:40:44,840 --> 01:40:48,230
But there are also ways to sort of to counteract that.

827
01:40:48,620 --> 01:40:52,970
And it doesn't mean that our system is permanent or inevitable.

828
01:40:55,700 --> 01:41:00,019
Okay. Let's take a break and then come back and get in your groups.

829
01:41:00,020 --> 01:41:04,670
And I left the tents up here for the groups so you can find each other.

830
01:41:05,240 --> 01:41:08,980
Let's start at 1127.

831
01:41:25,240 --> 01:41:40,270
Yeah. Yeah.

832
01:41:44,990 --> 01:41:51,410
Oh, no, no. I didn't say it.

833
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:31,580
With you. Yeah.

834
01:42:31,700 --> 01:42:35,090
I don't know, I.

835
01:42:55,940 --> 01:43:07,470
Good luck. So.

836
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:34,680
Oh. Well.

837
01:43:41,860 --> 01:43:48,170
Oh, yeah.

838
01:43:54,560 --> 01:44:01,450
But I think we've been working.

839
01:44:09,860 --> 01:44:23,470
What I found that, you know, it doesn't matter.

840
01:44:30,310 --> 01:44:41,460
I don't think they're trying to do. Oh, no.

841
01:44:42,570 --> 01:44:56,610
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

842
01:45:03,580 --> 01:45:14,360
Yeah. Now. I want to talk to you about that.

843
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:24,590
I realize that. Shoot for the team.

844
01:45:37,990 --> 01:45:52,800
90. I feel like it's.

845
01:45:58,020 --> 01:46:07,160
But I will tell you that I know.

846
01:46:07,670 --> 01:46:10,990
You know. I know that.

847
01:46:11,400 --> 01:46:23,760
Over. Oh one.

848
01:46:49,800 --> 01:47:13,120
But it wasn't enough said that Young was doing everything right.

849
01:47:21,780 --> 01:47:29,600
Sure. Yeah. I'm sorry. I think you have employees.

850
01:47:40,690 --> 01:48:14,390
Yeah. Relatively. Yes.

851
01:48:18,920 --> 01:48:32,610
I. Everybody we're meeting today.

852
01:48:32,620 --> 01:48:41,060
Did you know that? Look, weekly papers are like their own.

853
01:48:41,450 --> 01:48:46,190
I did not expect this. I thought it would just keep going for a while.

854
01:48:46,370 --> 01:48:56,710
Good. Thank you very much.

855
01:48:59,710 --> 01:49:03,880
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. They work for you? Yeah.

856
01:49:07,820 --> 01:49:26,209
Even the wastewater data looks good. If you look at the wastewater data on here, sunny over here and your group numbers are down here.

857
01:49:26,210 --> 01:49:31,310
So I'll just let you grab somebody, grab your number and find a spot.

858
01:49:32,060 --> 01:49:43,940
You want it all right? Yeah, I know.

859
01:49:44,970 --> 01:49:52,500
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

860
01:49:59,890 --> 01:50:15,780
I could have done better this week, as you may be able to.

861
01:50:16,410 --> 01:50:29,880
Good. I know how people live together.

862
01:50:35,490 --> 01:50:39,940
Oh, yeah.

863
01:50:40,790 --> 01:50:50,100
I mean, that's what. Oh.

864
01:50:51,500 --> 01:51:01,560
I think this.

865
01:51:05,310 --> 01:51:22,800
Yeah. I like why he didn't, but.

866
01:51:30,920 --> 01:51:42,799
You know, every morning, just like being around, you know, you have to do something.

867
01:51:42,800 --> 01:51:48,080
And there are so many, you know, keyboard is different.

868
01:51:50,600 --> 01:51:55,220
Yeah. Oh, I'm trying to.

869
01:52:02,960 --> 01:52:10,730
I don't know. You know, I have no idea what's going on.

870
01:52:12,040 --> 01:52:19,810
I mean, nobody.

871
01:52:47,610 --> 01:53:04,110
But. Yeah.

872
01:53:04,150 --> 01:53:17,510
Know. I thought that might be easier than trying to figure out what it is that.

873
01:53:21,150 --> 01:53:24,730
Oh, yeah.

874
01:53:27,030 --> 01:53:31,530
I don't make that assumption based on the question I feel like of you.

875
01:53:43,580 --> 01:54:02,430
Yeah, that. Do I forget the paper?

876
01:54:04,130 --> 01:54:18,960
Come on. We'll work with you on that.

877
01:54:26,960 --> 01:54:30,760
Mr. President, Republicans talk about. Yes.

878
01:54:36,300 --> 01:54:40,370
I know that because there's a lot of.

879
01:54:46,670 --> 01:54:54,680
I'm not 100% committed to this particular doctor.

880
01:54:55,580 --> 01:55:22,990
I mean, if anyone doesn't care. I don't if realize I don't anything.

881
01:55:34,390 --> 01:55:42,170
I just. This.

882
01:55:51,410 --> 01:55:56,620
And I think there's a bunch of stuff that.

883
01:55:57,350 --> 01:56:12,520
Yeah. I opened. We all know.

884
01:56:26,640 --> 01:56:32,980
Mr. Emile? Yes. But it seems like.

885
01:56:58,230 --> 01:57:11,890
So. So. During the time I had to go back to the.

886
01:57:20,920 --> 01:57:26,470
Oh. Here.

887
01:57:35,410 --> 01:57:50,170
You mean from South? So this is a different story.

888
01:57:52,720 --> 01:57:55,890
Yeah, I don't. I don't think, you know.

889
01:58:03,660 --> 01:58:07,390
I'm sorry. They addressed all.

890
01:58:12,170 --> 01:58:17,950
I was the same person that started there.

891
01:58:18,090 --> 01:58:24,700
I don't know how they're doing over here.

892
01:58:24,700 --> 01:58:31,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

893
01:58:32,770 --> 01:58:49,270
Um, I just a good idea to make some kind of another thing.

894
01:58:51,400 --> 01:58:57,459
Okay. Okay, yeah. Yeah, I think so.

895
01:58:57,460 --> 01:59:00,720
Yeah. I don't know.

896
01:59:04,150 --> 01:59:08,650
Maybe they're trying to figure out. Are you drawing or trying to draw something right now?

897
01:59:09,640 --> 01:59:17,530
Okay, I haven't gotten to the drawing. Yeah, I think I'll give you a hint.

898
01:59:18,700 --> 01:59:28,590
There's a part of an introduction where they say our conceptual model is o o for him.

899
01:59:36,040 --> 01:59:39,080
I saw. Her name is.

900
01:59:44,490 --> 01:59:52,280
Oh, no, no, no. Do that, I think.

901
01:59:59,380 --> 02:00:03,790
Last. I wanted your age to be started doing.

902
02:00:08,810 --> 02:00:17,250
So he's going. They just.

903
02:00:21,410 --> 02:00:25,040
No idea at all.

904
02:00:33,960 --> 02:00:48,750
What would you like to. If you're not here, I don't care.

905
02:00:55,140 --> 02:01:12,730
I think it's going to be. And I point.

906
02:01:15,140 --> 02:01:22,850
What is it? Yeah, that's why I'm, like, running the show, doing something else.

907
02:01:23,530 --> 02:01:39,180
Well. You know, like even when I went to work out here once a week.

908
02:01:40,630 --> 02:01:52,850
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Right.

909
02:01:56,390 --> 02:02:09,770
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's true.

910
02:02:11,390 --> 02:02:23,360
I think one thing that's I guess that's material.

911
02:02:24,090 --> 02:02:31,090
We should cultivate. Okay.

912
02:02:35,640 --> 02:02:39,590
I remember how they phrased everything. Let's.

913
02:02:49,550 --> 02:02:54,650
I think I think that the variable that you know.

914
02:02:55,550 --> 02:02:59,740
Oh yeah.

915
02:03:00,630 --> 02:03:17,580
I guess it would be okay. Yeah. If you're into something just because we had something to deal with that would be very important to me.

916
02:03:17,580 --> 02:03:22,700
And I don't know, I might not be into that. You're going to see that they talk about their consumption.

917
02:03:22,780 --> 02:03:34,220
And I was like and then I was like, I don't know what I'm going to.

918
02:03:34,250 --> 02:03:46,640
You're so and everyone's like, I the I, you know.

919
02:03:49,260 --> 02:03:54,590
Yeah, I'm just trying to. Well, you know.

920
02:03:55,650 --> 02:04:00,330
I don't know. I don't know. Oh, yeah.

921
02:04:01,430 --> 02:04:10,300
I think maybe there may be somebody who ordered them.

922
02:04:14,850 --> 02:04:30,290
It hurts. I don't know.

923
02:04:30,820 --> 02:04:59,760
Guess. Oh, yeah, they're trying to.

924
02:05:12,780 --> 02:05:21,490
Could you? It's a different era.

925
02:05:22,570 --> 02:05:25,930
And we. Yeah.

926
02:05:26,710 --> 02:05:31,570
Three. Yeah, I didn't know that. I know what it's like.

927
02:05:34,150 --> 02:05:37,250
I know. I like. I know it's nothing.

928
02:05:37,640 --> 02:05:42,280
I know exactly.

929
02:05:42,410 --> 02:05:58,550
But I think it's really the idea that, you know, they're like, what you have to do.

930
02:06:00,480 --> 02:06:04,600
Oh, I don't know.

931
02:06:05,410 --> 02:06:09,850
I don't even know. Like, I feel like I have a.

932
02:06:13,150 --> 02:06:23,100
All right. Yeah.

933
02:06:35,590 --> 02:06:54,750
Yeah. Yeah, right.

934
02:07:20,130 --> 02:07:29,640
Thanks. The first two.

935
02:07:34,820 --> 02:07:42,440
Thank God I. Mr. I mean, not really a paragraph.

936
02:07:49,680 --> 02:07:55,480
We're talking about.

937
02:08:09,960 --> 02:08:28,930
Yeah. I got it. But you said regardless.

938
02:08:38,710 --> 02:08:45,760
I think you're trying to be sure that I'm. So.

939
02:08:50,520 --> 02:09:00,170
Multiple factors. Not more.

940
02:09:05,580 --> 02:09:18,980
That. I think three times.

941
02:09:24,090 --> 02:09:33,400
Yeah. Use my name.

942
02:09:43,340 --> 02:09:46,460
Thank you. Okay.

943
02:09:56,180 --> 02:10:03,550
We're talking. Yeah, that's right.

944
02:10:03,850 --> 02:10:12,880
I mean, I think there's there's a few more.

945
02:10:14,410 --> 02:10:30,070
But yeah, the actual jobs that I think I'm trying to show you certain things as well.

946
02:10:32,830 --> 02:10:41,049
Yeah. Yeah. You know, you're kind of honestly.

947
02:10:41,050 --> 02:10:44,980
I don't know.

948
02:10:44,980 --> 02:10:49,570
I've never heard of that one. Is it in your.

949
02:11:03,370 --> 02:11:08,820
And they're hoping that policemen are going to be the cells of them and.

950
02:11:13,610 --> 02:11:23,890
Now. That's what this is about. Environment.

951
02:11:27,310 --> 02:11:40,230
Keeping the. Since. Yeah, but.

952
02:11:42,930 --> 02:11:50,080
Yeah, but like, at what point do you do that?

953
02:12:11,110 --> 02:12:15,590
Yeah. Yeah. More than once a day.

954
02:12:21,580 --> 02:12:29,950
Over seven times a day. Yeah.

955
02:12:38,880 --> 02:12:44,550
Just. I probably.

956
02:12:49,010 --> 02:12:53,690
So you're talking about their caffeine.

957
02:12:53,990 --> 02:12:57,560
Seven cups? I don't know. Maybe in Norway, they drink a lot of caffeine.

958
02:12:58,160 --> 02:13:09,469
That seems like a lot easier to do when I have one cup of hot tea in the morning.

959
02:13:09,470 --> 02:13:12,650
And even that's like kind of pushing that caffeine, you know?

960
02:13:15,260 --> 02:13:18,280
I don't really do that. But okay. I know most people do not.

961
02:13:18,290 --> 02:13:24,110
I have a very I'm very sensitive to caffeine and super sensitive to caffeine.

962
02:13:26,450 --> 02:13:33,890
And my like my head was hurting so bad the other day that I was like, oh, I'm going to take a decongestant like a Sudafed.

963
02:13:34,070 --> 02:13:37,680
But oh, boy. I mean, my heart just got exploded.

964
02:13:37,700 --> 02:13:42,980
Like, I can't I can't do stuff like that. So I just have to live with this.

965
02:13:51,950 --> 02:14:19,050
I think I mean, you know, I think I think there's a negative.

966
02:14:24,280 --> 02:14:27,360
But I people.

967
02:14:29,180 --> 02:14:48,930
I feel like you're going to have to go to college so that.

968
02:14:52,710 --> 02:15:02,150
Status if you want to. Are you on intervention?

969
02:15:02,390 --> 02:15:18,400
Yes. Okay. But it would be open so that I could do it differently.

970
02:15:22,890 --> 02:15:27,540
Yeah, I know what I was.

971
02:15:30,160 --> 02:15:37,570
I'd love to have you write.

972
02:16:13,030 --> 02:16:18,360
You know they're on.

973
02:16:39,160 --> 02:16:55,150
Most. He said, Look, this is my home.

974
02:16:57,330 --> 02:17:01,110
And my family's like, wow.

975
02:17:01,610 --> 02:17:06,370
So. Different things like that.

976
02:17:09,780 --> 02:17:18,700
It was like. Oh, yeah.

977
02:17:24,280 --> 02:17:27,960
Okay. Okay. Okay.

978
02:17:27,980 --> 02:17:32,650
It looks like most groups are done. If anybody need a little more time.

979
02:17:33,790 --> 02:17:41,930
Yeah. Okay. All right. So let's start with the first question.

980
02:17:41,950 --> 02:17:49,330
How about group five and you identified exposure as mediators, outcomes and covariance.

981
02:17:49,360 --> 02:17:53,570
First of all, what are the exposures? This.

982
02:17:56,380 --> 02:17:59,860
Yeah. The exposure is for education. Yeah.

983
02:18:01,170 --> 02:18:04,560
Uh huh. Oh, come on.

984
02:18:06,400 --> 02:18:11,650
Yes. All right. Well, we're the mediators. We have the material side.

985
02:18:15,070 --> 02:18:22,000
Yeah. Right. So material factors include employment status, public benefit receipt, financial difficulties,

986
02:18:22,540 --> 02:18:27,790
psychosocial marital status, number of close friends, participation in self esteem, anxiety, depression.

987
02:18:28,160 --> 02:18:35,080
We're worried about leaving anything out with nothing. Behavioral smoking, alcohol, caffeine, physical activity.

988
02:18:35,080 --> 02:18:42,200
And a disagreement over here noticed their definition of high caffeine consumption was very interesting.

989
02:18:42,220 --> 02:18:46,870
And you notice that in there, we don't know if people in Norway drink a lot of caffeine,

990
02:18:46,870 --> 02:18:54,189
but we assume so probably back home, um, with physical activity and biomedical,

991
02:18:54,190 --> 02:19:05,990
they look at BMI because waist circumference ratio, triglycerides, cholesterol, HDL and anything I might have the right outcome.

992
02:19:08,420 --> 02:19:15,180
I thought of mortality. Yeah. And from various age.

993
02:19:15,870 --> 02:19:21,510
Yeah. And you know, the one I didn't ask you to do is fact modifiers begin they at an effect modifier.

994
02:19:23,320 --> 02:19:32,050
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Um, I'm going to ask for a volunteer for the next question.

995
02:19:33,910 --> 02:19:38,830
Does anybody want to volunteer to draw the conceptual model?

996
02:19:43,680 --> 02:19:49,930
Anybody you heard from Yonatan?

997
02:19:50,680 --> 02:19:56,840
No. No. Yes. You don't have to call it.

998
02:19:57,570 --> 02:20:03,680
Somebody wants to. Okay.

999
02:20:04,350 --> 02:20:07,470
You got someone? You know what we can do, too?

1000
02:20:07,500 --> 02:20:12,360
We have to board a flight. All right, but do you want to do yours?

1001
02:20:12,360 --> 02:20:16,530
And then you want to do yours? We got markers and plenty of markers.

1002
02:20:16,860 --> 02:20:21,690
Come on, be brave.

1003
02:20:22,650 --> 02:20:25,850
Okay. Try that one. I can't remember if the green one works. I think the red one.

1004
02:20:28,920 --> 02:20:34,860
We also have orange and another green in case. It's gone.

1005
02:20:36,870 --> 02:20:42,510
It's gone. Oh, this one word. I think it's okay.

1006
02:21:00,740 --> 02:21:07,639
When I was in grade school, more than anything in the world, I wanted to be called on to write on the board with anyone else, like Desire.

1007
02:21:07,640 --> 02:21:12,230
This was it a white board or. No, it was like a chalkboard.

1008
02:21:12,260 --> 02:21:22,060
And no, I don't desire to be like, Oh, I also wanted to be picked to race the boards.

1009
02:21:22,070 --> 02:21:23,660
This was like a big thing.

1010
02:21:23,660 --> 02:21:31,100
Like if you erase the board and then once a week the teacher would pick somebody to go outside and like clap theory theories together.

1011
02:21:31,500 --> 02:21:35,660
Like, just like the chalk would get all in your face.

1012
02:21:37,580 --> 02:21:43,450
You need to. Yeah.

1013
02:21:47,190 --> 02:21:51,070
This is great.

1014
02:21:53,830 --> 02:22:00,670
I should've been a teacher, so I used to have good handwriting.

1015
02:22:07,360 --> 02:22:12,760
Yeah, I know. Yeah.

1016
02:22:12,930 --> 02:22:17,290
Beautiful. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But make yourself comfortable.

1017
02:22:17,410 --> 02:22:28,500
Yeah, perfectly fine. I don't know if that really makes you.

1018
02:22:42,940 --> 02:22:48,660
This. Okay.

1019
02:22:48,960 --> 02:22:52,680
So, yeah. Okay.

1020
02:22:53,250 --> 02:23:04,200
And if you want to explain your groups. Okay. You really modeled our right after what you just talked about, the exposure in utero.

1021
02:23:05,010 --> 02:23:23,370
So the exposure we have of being active in the kitchen and being in the house and then agents being invariant and interacting with the outcome.

1022
02:23:23,700 --> 02:23:33,089
And then the study group sort of interesting thing with gender by grouping up the analysis into Yeah, you know, for females and males.

1023
02:23:33,090 --> 02:23:38,970
And so we sort of tried to. Yeah.

1024
02:23:39,030 --> 02:23:44,069
So it's kind of it's a little hard to do in this case because there's so much going on.

1025
02:23:44,070 --> 02:23:54,870
But the typical way that you would show, um, a fact modification, which there was a quote somebody asked a question about can you show it on a dag?

1026
02:23:54,870 --> 02:23:58,290
There is no way really to show it on a dag. You have to do separate decks.

1027
02:23:59,340 --> 02:24:04,499
But like this is the Theron and Kenny kind of way of showing that.

1028
02:24:04,500 --> 02:24:09,660
Showing it is that you draw an arrow into the main effect.

1029
02:24:09,930 --> 02:24:16,079
But this is it's a little hard to do here, right? Like which case do you draw it?

1030
02:24:16,080 --> 02:24:19,800
And so, yeah. Okay. Do you want to describe your Drew?

1031
02:24:21,780 --> 02:24:31,570
Okay. So we have to understand their day to day,

1032
02:24:31,590 --> 02:24:40,739
which is their conceptual framework for material factors that affect health inequities directly or indirectly through psychosocial,

1033
02:24:40,740 --> 02:24:45,030
behavioral or no biomedical factors. So that's kind of the first part of it.

1034
02:24:45,510 --> 02:24:53,480
And then maybe noting that psychosocial factors might work directly or indirectly through behavioral,

1035
02:24:57,030 --> 02:25:05,250
and then behavioral factors may either direct or indirect may be either direct or indirect.

1036
02:25:05,520 --> 02:25:13,740
And to play with environmental factors like that, I've heard they mention that biomedical factors, material factor.

1037
02:25:15,240 --> 02:25:27,149
And then so I think what they said is that without getting into the specifics of these, it's complicated, right?

1038
02:25:27,150 --> 02:25:33,660
Like and I bet every single group I think it's fun to do too, because I bet every single group do something slightly different.

1039
02:25:34,110 --> 02:25:38,219
Um, and when I like my drawing is slightly different than this.

1040
02:25:38,220 --> 02:25:42,420
So like when I read it I thought they were saying.

1041
02:25:45,780 --> 02:25:53,070
I hate to erase that beautiful handwriting, but. So I have to have both boards for mine.

1042
02:25:57,820 --> 02:26:08,350
I understand. They're good, so I have to in time and excavation.

1043
02:26:10,110 --> 02:26:29,910
I will ask the material factors and then those causally in the psychosocial factor, which then impacts the behavioral factors.

1044
02:26:32,420 --> 02:26:35,540
And then I'm going to run out of room.

1045
02:26:35,840 --> 02:26:47,270
Biomedical. And then which they didn't analyze, but morbidity and then mortality.

1046
02:26:49,730 --> 02:26:53,230
And then. Oh, okay.

1047
02:26:53,240 --> 02:27:10,610
Hold on. So they said that this could also have a direct effect on your and this could have a drug and this could happen,

1048
02:27:11,360 --> 02:27:20,630
but and that was already accounted for. And then they also said potentially there could be feedback, right?

1049
02:27:23,680 --> 02:27:31,310
So the error could actually go that way. And then I had here's how I showed.

1050
02:27:34,090 --> 02:27:38,980
It's urgent. And then I had.

1051
02:27:46,210 --> 02:27:49,930
Life or death that anybody would like that?

1052
02:27:52,240 --> 02:27:53,770
I hope not, because that's really nothing.

1053
02:27:54,160 --> 02:28:02,649
But like, it's like the whole point is that we can interpret the way that they did it and all of these different ways.

1054
02:28:02,650 --> 02:28:06,430
So it's really helpful if you have a conceptual model,

1055
02:28:06,760 --> 02:28:15,310
draw it in your paper for your readers so they understand because we can interpret that those words kind of differently.

1056
02:28:15,670 --> 02:28:18,990
But I think all, all of our models that we drew up here,

1057
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:25,420
we're kind of expressing the same idea of the kind of the mediation of sort of the

1058
02:28:25,420 --> 02:28:29,980
impact of socioeconomic status on mortality through all of these different pathways.

1059
02:28:31,150 --> 02:28:36,670
Okay. Summarize the results and conclusions.

1060
02:28:36,670 --> 02:28:41,430
How about group four? Can you guys do that? Yes.

1061
02:28:43,900 --> 02:28:49,000
So we said that material factors with the most important and extreme income inequality

1062
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:56,740
for mortality for men and and psychosocial factors were more important for education.

1063
02:28:59,050 --> 02:29:07,680
And I think that. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1064
02:29:08,380 --> 02:29:08,980
Exactly.

1065
02:29:08,980 --> 02:29:20,290
So they found that among men, but not women, there was an association between education and mortality and an association between income and mortality,

1066
02:29:21,040 --> 02:29:28,299
and that the psychosocial and behavioral factors explained the education results and

1067
02:29:28,300 --> 02:29:32,140
the material variables have the greatest explanatory power in the income model.

1068
02:29:32,680 --> 02:29:37,690
Um, the biomedical variables were the least important in both models,

1069
02:29:37,690 --> 02:29:44,260
but that's surprising to people that the biomedical factors were the least important in predicting mortality.

1070
02:29:46,360 --> 02:29:52,410
Why do you think that might have been? Yeah, it's the most promising.

1071
02:29:54,690 --> 02:30:05,700
It is. Yeah, it's the most proximate, which is why I think we would expect it to be the biggest, or I would expect that to explain a lot of mortality.

1072
02:30:05,850 --> 02:30:10,409
But Noel, did you want to add. I was thinking maybe it's because of the.

1073
02:30:10,410 --> 02:30:15,090
The excluded. Yeah. Yeah. They excluded people who are sick.

1074
02:30:15,330 --> 02:30:19,260
Right. But like any possible chronic condition under the sun.

1075
02:30:20,130 --> 02:30:27,000
Yeah. So like these things that they're measuring, like BMI and all these things are so strongly associated with,

1076
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:30,060
like, morbidity, and that they cut those people out.

1077
02:30:30,390 --> 02:30:39,370
And so the people who are dying in the sample are not dying because they were already sick like or we couldn't tell that they were sick.

1078
02:30:39,420 --> 02:30:42,809
So there's like there's an issue there with who they excluded.

1079
02:30:42,810 --> 02:30:50,550
And that's why. And there's also remember, they bring this up in the discussion about how this also affects the results for gender.

1080
02:30:51,330 --> 02:30:55,770
Right. Because particularly because they're excluding people that have arthritis.

1081
02:30:55,770 --> 02:31:00,600
And arthritis is such a common condition among women in mid-to-late life.

1082
02:31:00,960 --> 02:31:03,990
And so you've excluded all the people who are at risk of dying.

1083
02:31:05,250 --> 02:31:07,229
And so you're like, you're going to get weird results.

1084
02:31:07,230 --> 02:31:11,880
If you exclude everybody who's at risk of dying, you're probably going to have this all cause mortality.

1085
02:31:12,540 --> 02:31:19,050
You might have people overrepresented from causes of death, like accidents or something in here, which would not.

1086
02:31:19,080 --> 02:31:23,670
They may be related to income and education, but wouldn't be related to like biomedical arrest.

1087
02:31:26,610 --> 02:31:33,419
Also, I just want to point out that their education or their results for gender are a little fishy, right?

1088
02:31:33,420 --> 02:31:38,700
Because they tell you in there, they don't show you, but they tell you that they tested an interaction.

1089
02:31:39,420 --> 02:31:43,110
Right. And the interaction was only significant for income.

1090
02:31:43,320 --> 02:31:44,970
Right. But not education.

1091
02:31:46,500 --> 02:31:53,610
But then they still stratify their results by gender when they show them to you and they tell you that there's no effect for women.

1092
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:59,129
But the coefficients for women and men are actually not significantly different.

1093
02:31:59,130 --> 02:32:05,400
And that interaction wasn't significant. And so there's like there's a problem with the way they did that.

1094
02:32:05,400 --> 02:32:13,560
So they really should have shown, like women and men together in the analysis where there wasn't a significant interaction.

1095
02:32:14,370 --> 02:32:18,870
Just because when you stratify, there's not a significant effect for women.

1096
02:32:19,200 --> 02:32:25,290
Does that mean that the coefficients for women and men are significantly different, so that makes them okay?

1097
02:32:25,300 --> 02:32:28,910
It's just a little thing that bugs me about this. All right.

1098
02:32:28,920 --> 02:32:34,720
Strength and limitations for 330 when you guys.

1099
02:32:37,140 --> 02:32:45,490
Do you want to tell us some strengths and limitations? Oh, you guys true?

1100
02:32:46,030 --> 02:32:55,540
Never mind. Okay. Tell us. So you're like, why do I have to go all the way?

1101
02:33:01,130 --> 02:33:04,830
And be to kind of go.

1102
02:33:08,250 --> 02:33:16,890
Yeah. Both of these elements were confirmed.

1103
02:33:33,440 --> 02:33:41,120
Absolutely. So big in terms of strength. Some of the other things that I wrote in here in addition to your list was that they had a large sample.

1104
02:33:41,210 --> 02:33:48,230
They have a lot of power. Right. Like you said, lots of measures of hypothesized mediators that's created.

1105
02:33:48,230 --> 02:33:51,650
They have objective and some data which would be harder to get.

1106
02:33:51,650 --> 02:33:57,290
And like the US context for that was really great. In terms of limitations, we talked about this a little bit.

1107
02:33:57,290 --> 02:34:01,250
Excluding people who were sick at baseline produces a biased sample.

1108
02:34:02,360 --> 02:34:05,450
They did it because they were worried about reverse causation. Right.

1109
02:34:05,450 --> 02:34:09,890
So there was a there was a rationale for it, but it does introduce bias.

1110
02:34:10,490 --> 02:34:14,270
Um, they had a really large age range with short follow up.

1111
02:34:14,270 --> 02:34:21,640
So you don't get a lot of deaths when you have a shortfall. Um, um, another one I wrote was multiple tests, right?

1112
02:34:21,650 --> 02:34:25,969
They're doing a lot of analysis here and they're not adjusting for multiple testing.

1113
02:34:25,970 --> 02:34:29,750
So some of these findings could be due to chance. Yeah.

1114
02:34:30,080 --> 02:34:38,570
Okay. Group one Do you guys want to tell us a possible intervention based on study results?

1115
02:34:44,300 --> 02:34:47,980
You know, I guess that's a reasonable.

1116
02:34:55,580 --> 02:35:24,020
And. That's possible.

1117
02:35:24,020 --> 02:35:31,750
But just like changing the. Yeah.

1118
02:35:31,760 --> 02:35:36,090
So you can have something that's like a really big intervention around changing gender in your hair.

1119
02:35:36,590 --> 02:35:41,120
You can also try to target like some of these specific intermediate things,

1120
02:35:41,120 --> 02:35:45,740
especially the ones that they found to be really important in explaining the association.

1121
02:35:46,100 --> 02:35:53,330
So like some of these, you could try to intervene on these psychosocial factors or the material factors, right?

1122
02:35:53,420 --> 02:35:57,830
But any other groups come up with an intervention that they might.

1123
02:36:01,300 --> 02:36:08,610
Good for you guys. I just reiterated her conclusions.

1124
02:36:08,960 --> 02:36:11,990
Yeah, which is very similar to what Martin said. Okay.

1125
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:15,200
So, yeah, just promoting social networks. Yeah.

1126
02:36:17,180 --> 02:36:18,150
Yeah, absolutely.

1127
02:36:18,170 --> 02:36:28,210
So increasing social participation, employment opportunities, modifying behaviors like all of these could be potential interventions here.

1128
02:36:29,210 --> 02:36:36,510
If it's if it's really cool. Any other questions on this paper?

1129
02:36:39,530 --> 02:36:44,060
Okay. Did everybody remember to turn in your research question today?

1130
02:36:44,750 --> 02:36:49,970
Okay. If you forgot to hurry, go do it. I'm going to finish reading this this afternoon.

1131
02:36:50,600 --> 02:36:56,329
Um, and just remember, if you have questions about the comments that I put on there,

1132
02:36:56,330 --> 02:36:59,840
or you want to come talk about your paper, you can sign up for office hours.

1133
02:36:59,840 --> 02:37:05,480
The link is in the syllabus on the campus site. Otherwise, have a good weekend.
