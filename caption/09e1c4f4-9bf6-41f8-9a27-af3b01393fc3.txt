1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:08,950
Okay. We're going to go ahead and get started. The day before my birthday.

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:19,390
So I'm running everything efficiently so I can start birthday tonight, which probably means working a little bit and getting pizza.

3
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,170
So am I.

4
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,080
It is my pleasure to introduce Dr. Miles J.

5
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:31,710
And I forgot to bring her bio, but she is going to tell you a lot about her bio.

6
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,710
I actually first met Arianna because her mentor,

7
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:47,530
as I think is after Masters with Steve and Steve during her master's degree, was a colleague of mine and introduced us.

8
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:55,780
And then she did her Ph.D. training in a group with with sort of similar mentors that I interact in,

9
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:03,070
interacted with in Seattle, and then convinced her to come out here and keep training.

10
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:09,190
So she's an alum of the program and is going to watch program.

11
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:12,640
Are you an alum of. Well, I did my my my bachelor's. Oh, you did your.

12
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:17,950
That's right. So she was she was related to the program as a bachelors.

13
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,960
And so we're going to we're going to still claim her.

14
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:31,780
So with that now she has a very impressive role with the state health department doing bioinformatics that I'm looking forward to hearing more about.

15
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:39,260
All right. Thank you. Okay.

16
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:46,940
How much is three person? Do I need to turn as well?

17
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:57,060
That. There.

18
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:03,170
Victim. All right. Hi, everyone.

19
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,740
Thanks for coming. Thanks for inviting me. So.

20
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,299
I don't really have that many slides.

21
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:20,170
I would like this to be fairly and formal for you to kind of be able to learn about and ask questions about this kind of whole world of public health,

22
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:27,129
pathogen genomics. So you guys are all in HIV. So I know you have some, you know, molecular IP interests.

23
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:33,670
Obviously, you're also you wouldn't be in this program, but my focus today will be on.

24
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:39,820
What it looks like at a city public health level, which is where I'm currently based,

25
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,900
as well as I'll give you some of my background and how I got here.

26
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:53,490
But it's going to be more focused on what this like kind of real world application of genomics, genomic epidemiology looks like these days.

27
00:02:53,500 --> 00:03:01,480
It's changed really rapidly during the pandemic, as many of you are probably aware of, owing to some of the kind of.

28
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,050
A little nitty gritty kind of a structure of where it all sits.

29
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:11,720
And then talk a little bit about some like applications and just challenges in the field.

30
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:15,620
But please feel free to like raise your hand interrupt at any time.

31
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,110
Because my goal here is just for you to leave,

32
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:25,940
knowing a little bit more about this kind of particular application of genomic epidemiology then when you came today.

33
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:31,160
So let's start with how I got here.

34
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:38,530
As Emily said, I did my bachelor's degree here U of M in microbiology.

35
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,850
There was no public health major at that time.

36
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:50,479
So little statistics to make sure I didn't hate it before I became an epidemiologist and I worked in up it actually.

37
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,890
So that was my lab based, kind of focused phase of things.

38
00:03:55,610 --> 00:04:05,450
And I got exposed to epidemiology through molecular epi really, and kind of decided that I want to move in that direction from that experience.

39
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:10,360
So even though I didn't end up being a major me program for grad school, I always corrected.

40
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:17,180
I mean, it had a big influence on my kind of career and trajectory based off my experience here as an undergraduate.

41
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:26,400
Then I went to Seattle and to the University of Washington to do my MPH and do my masters.

42
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:36,390
I was more focused in clinical research. You might realize that not every school of public health has a whole molecular epidemiology track.

43
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:46,739
And so I kind of really focused on, you know, just my core classes, my epidemiologic methods or the statistics.

44
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:50,520
This data is first year students. They're probably all spending a lot of time doing now.

45
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,800
And my research was not, you know, molecular in nature during that experience.

46
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:02,700
I did stick around for my Ph.D. and kind of went back to the genomic app.

47
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:10,409
At that time, I kind of mystery basically from from my undergrad experience.

48
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:15,320
And, you know, during that time this was like 2014.

49
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:23,459
I start my Ph.D. Like things had changed really dramatically as to what molecular epidemiology looked like because of sequencing technology,

50
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,010
really kind of taking off and becoming more accessible.

51
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:34,950
And that tool in 12 ish time, you had those sort of breaking like, here's what real time genomic public health practice epidemiology could look like.

52
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,970
And I kind of got my hands on some of those papers and I was like, Okay, this is really cool.

53
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:43,859
This is the direction I want to move. And I didn't know if I wanted to be in research or in practice.

54
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:49,080
So at that time it was mostly in research was like where most of this was still happening.

55
00:05:49,740 --> 00:06:01,140
But I use my Ph.D. as a time to really delve into full genome sequencing, into bioinformatics, a lot of things that were not traditional.

56
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,350
AP to complete this research project.

57
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:14,250
And my goal was to develop some of these kind of other interdisciplinary skills so that I could be useful in this field going forward.

58
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:18,300
Which was. Panned out?

59
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:29,250
Well, it was really challenging because it was like a really independent experience and I often felt like not epic enough for what you know,

60
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:35,040
for the program or what I was doing. I think that happens when you tend to engage in these really interdisciplinary spaces.

61
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:40,140
Sometimes you can feel like a little out of place, but that was that PC experience.

62
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:45,209
And then like Emily's, I came back here to Michigan, did a postdoc with Evanston Akin.

63
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:51,690
Some of you might know him over in the micro department, and he's a real expert in bioinformatics and genomic epi.

64
00:06:51,690 --> 00:07:00,349
And so I wanted to kind of. Make sure the stuff I had sort of self taught myself during grad school was like not wrong and kind of solidify.

65
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:03,360
I have a mentor that was really an expert in that area,

66
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:12,180
so I was with him for a couple of years and then I decided to make the transition to public health practice.

67
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:19,589
So last year I started at M.D. HHS in the Bureau of Laboratories.

68
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:28,590
So that's our state public health lab. And as a genomic epidemiologist, I think I was the first epidemiologist that they hired in the lab.

69
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:37,350
It's kind of it was kind of unusual, but it's sort of the nature of this field, again, just being like really interdisciplinary.

70
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:43,590
And the next little section I'm going to kind of explain to you like how the lab is set up and how it relates to that,

71
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:47,040
because a little bit you have some idea of that big picture.

72
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:57,870
But basically they had been there had been and we currently are continuing to really grow the kind of genomic epi applications at

73
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:06,360
the state public health level in large part due to the funding and attention received in this area from the COVID 19 pandemic.

74
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:12,210
And then a few months ago, I transition to a supervisory role, management role,

75
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:19,260
where I oversee a unit of individuals doing bioinformatics and genomic epidemiology.

76
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:32,340
So have any resentment here like thought about going into working in public health or applied public health after grad school or not?

77
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,330
Not so much. Emily Young. When she decides what she wants to be when she grows up.

78
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,840
Maybe. No. No. Okay. Well, maybe you'll change your mind after this.

79
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,440
Going to pull out its like before. Okay. That's good. I'm glad.

80
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,980
I am glad. I gather that datum point. Okay. Well.

81
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:57,930
May I explain to you where pathogen genomics sort of sits in state public health right now?

82
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:03,570
So our public health is kind of overseen by this, something called the Public Health Administration.

83
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,230
And then there's a bunch of bureaus. That's like the next level down.

84
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:14,920
So the Bureau of Laboratories is one of those bureaus that is just our public health lab located in Lansing.

85
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:19,809
And then you can see here there's a bunch of other ones, several epidemiology bureaus.

86
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:24,760
They kind of keep adding more and more. So there's an infectious disease.

87
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:30,490
They've recently just had a specific HIV Australian bureau of EPI.

88
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:36,550
And so we're kind of parallel to those epidemiologists in the Bureau of Labs.

89
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:43,030
There's the Infectious Disease Division overseen by Marty Sumlin. So all your I.D. stuff and then your sort of chemistry and toxicology.

90
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:47,230
So I don't actually know anything about that. But it's also in the House and in the Bureau of Laboratories.

91
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:53,730
So the kind of big thing I want to get across here is like there is the theory.

92
00:09:54,040 --> 00:10:00,970
We're not in the same exact place. And back when everybody worked in person, they were different buildings that bees are downtown.

93
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:06,340
The lab is north of town. So but there is this collaboration.

94
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,940
And historically, the laboratory is generating data.

95
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:15,940
A lot of what they do is clinical testing. That's much of their responsibility.

96
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:24,190
But they also have surveillance responsibilities as well. And particularly that information gets reported to the epidemiologists.

97
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:28,930
That's kind of traditionally sort of that relationship as it relates to epidemiology.

98
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:38,100
So within now we're just looking at the infectious disease division we have under a division.

99
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:47,520
We have three sections. This one on the left is this new one that had just formed, I think, end of 2020.

100
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:55,650
It's now called the genomics section. And that's my manager, Heather Blankenship is the section manager there.

101
00:10:56,130 --> 00:11:00,390
And then we now have two units within it. Wyatt called the dry lab.

102
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:00,930
In the wet lab.

103
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:07,560
Basically you have your sequencing unit where they actually have the pathogens come in, go through sequencing to that raw sequencing data.

104
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,959
And then the one that I latest,

105
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:20,090
bioinformatics and genomic IP is the dry lab where we actually take the raw data and try to turn it into something useful from, you know,

106
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,690
assembling genomes, things like that too, for the generic copy, for some pathogen,

107
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:30,600
some level of interpretation, and then communication of those results to epidemiologists.

108
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:35,190
This is different than what happens in these other sections.

109
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,690
It's a laboratory. It's focused on clinical testing.

110
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:43,560
So the microbiology section is your bacteriology and your mycology,

111
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:52,500
your reference bacteria bacteriology area, and then virology has serology and molecular testing.

112
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:59,820
So it used to be that any sequencing activities would kind of be embedded in these two microbiology sections.

113
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:03,990
They would mostly do clinical testing, but might do a little bit of surveillance to its activities.

114
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:07,320
And now with sequencing growing and growing.

115
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:15,510
A lot of states are doing the same thing where they're kind of pulling out the sequencing into its own kind of core type thing,

116
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:23,850
where all types of pathogens can come through for whole genome sequencing, particularly for surveillance and like epidemiologic.

117
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:40,339
So. We're very pathogen agnostic in our group, which is unusual in public health,

118
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:45,830
both really in the laboratory and the epi side from the federal level to the state level.

119
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:50,870
Groups are very often very pathogen specific, focused in their programs.

120
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:59,270
And in our group, we're kind of sequencing what they ask us to sequence and analyzing it to the best of our ability.

121
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:04,159
So different things are at different stages. But here's some of the things that we routinely sequence right now.

122
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:11,000
If you allow for those that might be interested in hospital epidemiology and health care associated infections,

123
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:15,320
we sequence routinely certain carbapenem resistant interactions always.

124
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:22,339
We're of course sequencing SARS-CoV-2 too and we sequence interrogate pathogens

125
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:25,459
as part of foodborne illness surveillance as part of the postal program,

126
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:28,760
which I'll talk about later. Legionella.

127
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:35,420
Certain types of just suddenly we got a couple infections. This is kind of a little bit of a weird one, but it's like an example of a,

128
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:41,810
like a weird clinical manifestation that kind of initiated sequencing for further investigation.

129
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:48,829
Tuberculosis, although the data there is currently this CDC hepatitis is similar.

130
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:54,110
It's more of a CDC oriented program. And most recently, we've been doing some sequencing of monkeypox.

131
00:13:54,110 --> 00:14:03,799
And so we're constantly. Kind of talking about like what's going to be next to that were going to be sequencing or like in the case of monkeypox,

132
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:09,320
if there was like a new emerging threat. Inevitably someone is going to come and be like, can we sequence this?

133
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,960
I mean, usually the answer is yes.

134
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:17,960
But of course, you know how difficult that's going to be, how hard the analysis is going to be, what it's actually going to be used for.

135
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:28,550
It's going to vary. So one thing that's nice about this area is that it's not boring because there's a lot of diversity and you know,

136
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:32,790
the type of stuff you see in the type of stuff you do. I think that's really true in public health.

137
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:38,530
Like for people that work in public health practice in general, I feel like that's a common thing out here, if you like.

138
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:42,430
Like kind of that change and that diversity of work.

139
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,169
I mean, in public health practice,

140
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:51,310
you're fundamentally you're working on various like prevention based activities and programs that might be kind of ongoing funded activities.

141
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:56,059
And then you have your response based efforts. When something comes up, what are you going to do?

142
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,719
You know, how are you going to respond in the labs case?

143
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,100
Like, how are you going to test how you surveillance, how you support the epidemiologists, how you going to provide this data?

144
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:11,590
So, you know, you never know really what's going to come your way, which I think is kind of fun.

145
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,450
Any questions so far about. Sequencing in Michigan.

146
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:23,370
Think about me. I have I've been saying bunch of, like I say, pathogen genomics.

147
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:26,880
Do you do you like to follow what I'm saying?

148
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:32,520
Yeah. I figure you got some background given your molecular interest, but.

149
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,729
Yeah. What? So.

150
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:39,270
So when it comes to science, can you sequence. Something.

151
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:44,050
Mm hmm. What? Like how does that decision get made?

152
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:51,610
Yeah. How much does your team have control over that decision versus like.

153
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:55,510
Higher up in the state government, sort of where where does it.

154
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:56,630
Yeah.

155
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:07,760
So I would say the decision would probably start like that question would probably get posed first to Heather as she oversees all the sequencing.

156
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:13,780
And so there's this aspect of we'd like to sequence this, you know, can you sequence it?

157
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:17,560
Do you have the capacity to do it? You have the capacity to analyze it. What are the challenges?

158
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:23,110
And she's going to be probably the first one to weigh in. And now in this new structure, she may, you know,

159
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:28,270
go to Becky at the sequencing to kind of hear more about the workload staff and come to me about like,

160
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:31,990
can we start looking into analysis pipelines and see how hard this is going to be?

161
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:36,460
And then I think she would give that to Marty.

162
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,790
And Marty is probably going to be your one. Who.

163
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:48,500
If we can't do something or yes, we can do something, it's probably going to come from her or stand up who's got bad director,

164
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:53,090
but he's like a little just more high level kind of bureaucracy, honestly.

165
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:58,100
So it's probably going to be like whoever that ask, it's coming from.

166
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:03,860
It oftentimes flows through Marty. Heather is the one that's weighing in with gathering information from our team.

167
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:11,240
And then it'll likely either go directly from Heather, directly from Marty, probably, if the answer's no, through Marty, sitting through Heather.

168
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:15,080
So it's always a comment. So I'll talk about this later.

169
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:22,590
But one thing, one big factor that goes into that, depending on the ask is, well, some volumes are always an issue with the laboratory, right?

170
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:33,610
Like they're always like they can only test so many things a day and diagnostic activities in public health take priority over surveillance.

171
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:38,059
So the laboratory is primarily focused on testing.

172
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:42,530
So at the beginning of monkeypox, they run not like how do we sequence monkey pox though?

173
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:48,499
Like how do we test all these monkey pox cases, particularly because that's a beginning of a new threat.

174
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:53,800
A lot of times public health is like the only ones that can test they have.

175
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,940
They're part of something called the Laboratory Response Network, kind of CDC oversees it.

176
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:06,020
So they have special access to certain tests because of all these kind of accreditation and regulation they've gone through.

177
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:15,170
So that always comes first. So historically, when the sequencing for surveillance was embedded in these diagnostic areas,

178
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:20,690
the answer would be more likely to be no because they'd be more overwhelmed with diagnostic responsibilities.

179
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:29,750
Part of wanting to form this group that's more focused has specific capacity for surveillance, and so that we can say yes more to those,

180
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:37,700
even when it's like an emerging threat, where there's a lot of diagnostic responsibilities that would take precedence, you still have.

181
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:42,960
Space issues in the laboratory are a constant issue.

182
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:49,440
But those are that's the kind of decision makers that will usually be making those decisions.

183
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:56,880
And at our level, Mbeki, it's like if we if someone says, let's figure out how to do this, then, you know, we should figure out how we do it.

184
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:07,490
Anything else? Did you know that we sequenced things at the same public health lab.

185
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:12,840
Did. Did you know you have a public health plan? Yeah.

186
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:17,940
I mean, when I applied for this job, they asked me and the interview was fabulous.

187
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:21,419
And like, I was like, um, you know, you're supposed to learn that.

188
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:24,780
And I come here, I really wasn't sure. I don't think it was really.

189
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:29,510
I don't know. I didn't feel like it was super widespread knowledge, though,

190
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:36,060
like state public health has a lot of things in the testing and surveillance and outreach and,

191
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:43,590
you know, research partnerships and just a whole like variety of things and how they support sort of the local public health network.

192
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:49,079
It's a very I mean, at the University of Michigan, you have like a great health system, right?

193
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:54,060
They have a great clinical laboratory. Can test for a lot of stuff.

194
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:59,009
Most places can't handle that big of a variety of stuff you can think of.

195
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:06,740
Usually the state public health can handle like the most things because they're not a laboratory trying to make money off their testing.

196
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,670
They're trying to support public health.

197
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:18,600
So they support a lot of stuff that is not profitable to be able to maintain that capacity support to respond to public health needs.

198
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,470
It's kind of like what's unique about it when it comes to other laboratories,

199
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:28,530
whereas like your commercial laboratories are not going to we're not going to carry the capacity to do stuff if it's not going to make them money.

200
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:37,440
Right? So it's like this whole different model of being a lab that comes with a lot of responsibility,

201
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:47,400
a lot of really specialized expertize that, you know, only comes into play at certain critical moments and.

202
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:52,710
Yeah. I mean, it's like it's it's really cool. And it was something that I had no idea.

203
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:57,530
So, yeah, you have a, say, a public health, um, and we do whole genome sequencing a bunch of stuff.

204
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:01,190
And that's part of what I want you to take away from today.

205
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:08,650
Okay. Southfield, Michigan. Specific.

206
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,810
Little me specific.

207
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:21,600
Losing a step back just to do little like little bigger picture, like where we've been in this field with whole genome sequencing and public health.

208
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,950
So there's this office in the season called the Office of Advanced Blocker Detection.

209
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:29,439
They were established back in 2013,

210
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:38,740
basically with like the mission to facilitate expanding whole genome sequencing capacity at the public like state public health levels.

211
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:45,370
Basically, like back then, people had been sequencing and research labs for like a really long time,

212
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:53,530
but it really hadn't integrated its way into public health. And people were realizing by then that it had a lot of public health utility and the

213
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:57,790
ability to replace other technologies that were currently being used for surveillance.

214
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:02,350
So this office got funded specifically for this mission,

215
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:10,930
and we were the United States was like really behind as far as Western countries go in their sort of capacity to do sequencing at that time.

216
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:18,900
And so flu is one of the main things that CDC started using whole genome sequencing for early on.

217
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:24,690
By 2017, they had like gotten sequencers and all the state public health labs.

218
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:29,580
So there was sequencing capacity happening and state public health.

219
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:38,190
And a big shift was in 2018 when whole genome sequencing became the exclusive tool used for foodborne illness surveillance.

220
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,830
So that's one area in public health that is like this big national program, which I'll talk about a little bit more.

221
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:48,540
It's called Pulse and the next slide or two, but it was one.

222
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,610
It's an example of Pulse Postnet,

223
00:22:50,880 --> 00:23:01,200
which is like kind of see us are CDC organized and like mandated because foodborne illness like obviously crossing state lines consistently.

224
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:06,690
And so you need to have surveillance in place that doesn't just stay in, you know, one jurisdiction.

225
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:12,210
You're never going to solve outbreaks that way. And so when this happened, when this transmission happened in 2018,

226
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:22,020
it was like a big question of like any labs that were not previously sequencing to have that sequencing ability kind of had that by that time.

227
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:27,090
But after that, it sort of plateaued for a couple of years.

228
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:33,990
Michigan started sequencing. Tuberculosis is the National Molecular Center for Tuberculosis also at that time.

229
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:38,940
But it was a couple of years until things really started to grow again.

230
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:46,470
And that was in 2020 when suddenly people wanted public health to sequence SARS-CoV-2.

231
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:55,500
And this was a really different thing because until this time they were pretty much sequencing bacterial isolates.

232
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:02,090
For the foodborne illness, which is different than SARS-CoV-2 to a different approach.

233
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:10,040
Does anyone know why? Why can't you sequence SARS-CoV-2 like the same way you do with bacteria like you?

234
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:24,900
Get used to it. Telling me I'm sitting in.

235
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:31,180
So you don't really want to like.

236
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:40,870
Generally, it's a lot harder to like isolate and grow viruses and all the time you like kind of would prefer to not do that from a safety perspective.

237
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:49,030
So it's just a much bigger lift. So instead we use approaches that are metagenomics based,

238
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:56,530
which means you are sequencing all the genomic material in a sample, potentially by amplifying some of it first.

239
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:00,790
So it's just a different approach that you have to take on the sequencing side.

240
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:07,420
And SARS-CoV-2 really kind of opened up that type of sequencing and that type of analysis.

241
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:17,260
Public health, when they previously were not doing that, which kind of raises the amount of organisms you can sequence generally.

242
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:29,880
And then, yeah, basically it's like there's a whole lot of money available for this work.

243
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:35,100
I mean. You know, politicians were getting pressure.

244
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:42,320
To respond in this particular way. And there are other countries that were sequencing a lot really quickly.

245
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,950
And then it was all of a sudden like, why are we sequencing all the COVID like they are in England?

246
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:53,599
You know, here's like a ton of money so that you could do that, which is unusual in public health, right?

247
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:59,660
Like they don't normally deal with big boxes of money and definitely not to this level.

248
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:03,500
So that funding, you know, is still going basically.

249
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:09,980
And it's increasing this ability to to do sequencing and to do analysis.

250
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:19,090
And that last piece is definitely. Probably the biggest areas of growth is doing like analysis within the state level

251
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:23,590
rather than sequencing things and just sending them to the CDC to be analyzed.

252
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:30,760
And if you do that, you can wait a long time for results, basically, like it's just extends that process.

253
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:37,690
So having that in-house ability for analysis is definitely more conducive to using this stuff for a response.

254
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:45,340
So like I mentioned, impulse net. Had anyone ever hurt Impulse before this?

255
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:49,390
No. So it's a CDC surveillance program.

256
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:56,020
It's been around since the nineties. They used to use a technology called the pulse feel gel electrophoresis.

257
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:59,940
Have you ever heard of that? Yes, baby.

258
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:08,140
Big gel. You had to do it in your lab?

259
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:16,839
Yeah, we don't really do it anymore. But you might add like a class, but it's like a gel based technology.

260
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,720
We have like a bunch of bands that you're looking at to try to match things up.

261
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:29,260
So they did that some mid-nineties till 2018 when they switched over our whole genome sequencing and that transition.

262
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:34,510
And, you know, they did a lot of studies of being like, we can get better resolution,

263
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:38,580
we can identify more outbreaks, we can have this much more success.

264
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:44,410
They started with listeria and then eventually just transition that whole program.

265
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:51,969
And because CDC was like it's like, how is another and they're also responsible for providing software for analysis

266
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:56,060
and maintaining databases since it was a choice that they wanted to purchase.

267
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:00,670
Then they had to switch over to this new technology. So that was a big push.

268
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:04,510
And then like I mentioned, then there's like coded.

269
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:15,640
So like I feel like I started to see articles I still poster in like late 2020 about like this new powerful tool for, you know, Photoshop.

270
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:24,879
And you start to see like popular media articles about genomic epidemiology and then like the criticism articles of like Y America,

271
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:33,550
Stuxnet, sequencing and responding with this particular technology and why we're all flying blind to coronavirus mutations.

272
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:41,040
Um, this was, this was about the alpha time when there was variants of concern.

273
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:46,959
Remember, early in the pandemic, there was just COVID, and then they started the whole variants of concern thing.

274
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:53,110
And there was this first variant that they really like identified as being advantageous.

275
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:59,290
And then at that moment it was like, we all need to be able to identify what variants are circulating.

276
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:04,540
You know, prior to that, people didn't really necessarily care with COVID, right?

277
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:10,180
And then they dedicate a lot of money, more money to it.

278
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:18,600
And in the American Rescue Act that President Palin pastors $1.7 billion specifically for advanced micro detection,

279
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:25,420
no funding, all goes to CDC and then kind of gets funneled out to that state and local level.

280
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:33,010
So a really rapid change. And I started working on MDH just a few months after this in August.

281
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:42,230
And you've seen a similar rise in the number of sequences the United States generated of SARS-CoV-2.

282
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:48,980
So you can see, like in the beginning of the pandemic, it was like sort of sad and we didn't really have very many genomes.

283
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:55,390
And then by 2021, when that variant stuff hit, that was the fuel for the fire at that.

284
00:29:55,460 --> 00:30:00,440
Before that, there were some people that were doing sequencing, but not at high levels, and it really started to grow.

285
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:06,530
So this this is looking at putting genomes in these public databases like just state and NCI.

286
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:15,020
And now it's just like this exponential rise in the amount of genomes that we are generating and depositing.

287
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:21,530
It's the first time we've really seen something of this scale happening in public health from a genomic surveillance perspective.

288
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:26,750
Historically other than postmen. Much more spotty.

289
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:37,490
What really happened in kind of academic research type settings and will be much less public health driven with the exception of flu,

290
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:43,640
is one big exception to that. They've been doing worse events for a while for vaccine development and other kind of public health needs.

291
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:48,590
A little bit less of the massive genomic epidemiology that was happening.

292
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:58,280
Any questions or thoughts on the big picture evolution of things?

293
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:08,150
Well, did anybody when did you become aware of.

294
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:16,050
Molecular epidemiology, like why don't you apply to hospital, molecular epidemiology and some general immunology?

295
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:28,100
Did you say biology or micro as under that's where you had like your exposure to or work in a laboratory.

296
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:38,140
Everybody's looking at me to see. I also I can sit pretty long period of time in silence.

297
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:47,180
Mm hmm. So I still. Okay.

298
00:31:49,790 --> 00:32:01,820
Do I? And I realized, like, that's a real life thing, and I would like to see more of this.

299
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:07,140
Yeah. That.

300
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:13,829
Okay. Siri able to get some of that like exposure during your undergrad, like with your domains,

301
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:23,040
you're in like certain classes and maybe they talked about applications of molecular biology to public health or to epidemiology.

302
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:27,240
And it's like, oh, that's a thing. Yeah, that's how I was too.

303
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:34,170
I mean, I, I stumbled into this lab here, like, I knew I was like, interesting in public health,

304
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:40,259
but I kind of stumbled into the molecular epidemiology thing from starting to work and back up it.

305
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:47,990
And then I was like, Oh, like, that's a cool. Perspective and application of these technologies.

306
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:54,380
And I ultimately felt like I identified with that more than like that really zoomed in approach.

307
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:58,850
If you were to have a career as a molecular biology researcher or something that.

308
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:58,410
Others are. Mm hmm.

309
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:02,129
Did you it that did you have that infectious disease exposure as well?

310
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:10,080
Or is more human and animal genetics and then you kind of. Yeah.

311
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:15,290
Like genomics is a huge field like pathogen or molecular.

312
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:18,990
Sorry, microbial genomics is kind of, you know, there's definitely a subset,

313
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:23,840
but there are applications of human genomics, obviously, to public health as well.

314
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:27,880
That's like a whole. Whole other area.

315
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:37,229
Right. So talk a little bit about some applications.

316
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:44,310
I tried to just pull actually a couple of like screenshots this morning from stuff like actively occurring in my job.

317
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:50,640
To give you some flavor of the different ways you would use this in this applied setting.

318
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:58,530
So I'll have to explain this a little bit. But this is this kind of was an unusual application in a way, because.

319
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:03,980
For monkey part sequencing. The reason we're doing monkeypox sequencing actually was not driven by like

320
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:08,390
epidemiology perspective from like what's fine transmission networks kind of thing.

321
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:14,960
There has been a scenario where the apps have sort of been able to do that pretty well and then never hit on the pandemic.

322
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:22,040
Yeah, the epidemic is sort of going down. But but there is actually a concern from the laboratory side of things.

323
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:32,020
So there's like only certain approved tests to test for monkeypox and the ones that they're using in the laboratory for basically not very specific.

324
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:35,720
It was like it calls it non very orthodox.

325
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:45,470
And you might know that monkeypox itself has multiple lineages or clades, and some of them are much more deadly than others.

326
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:51,320
So depending on the lineage, you would treat it differently in the laboratory.

327
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:59,330
It would go for myself. Three If you're familiar that to be a cell to depending on the lineage and the select and status to not so there's this huge.

328
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,600
Where you would handle things differently in the laboratory.

329
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:11,970
But because this outbreak was happening with that lower risk clade, there's kind of just been this like, yeah, like the other higher risk one.

330
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:18,120
It's not like it's typically from the United States. It's only kind of crops up in certain regions in Africa.

331
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:23,820
So like, it's really highly unlikely that when you test somebody in Michigan for and they get this result,

332
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:27,510
that it's something more dangerous rather than the current strain of monkeypox.

333
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:34,470
But basically, our virology people were like but like it would be nice to have some data to support that.

334
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:44,040
So this is an example of doing sequencing what we call a second metagenomic sequencing, where you just at very,

335
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:49,680
very high depth sequence, you know, the entire amount of genetic material that's in the specimen.

336
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:54,270
And then most of that's going to be human or microbiome or all these other things.

337
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:58,889
But if these are people with monkeypox, a very small amount of it is going to be monkeypox.

338
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:03,690
And you pull that out of the genetic data. So, Jared, in our lab, who's that fellow?

339
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:08,600
Which. There's, um. There are some fellowships if you ever do get.

340
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:17,550
We're interested in genomic happy band dramatics. CDC has a joint fellowship with the Association for Public Health Laboratories.

341
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:26,310
That's like a post masters degree or degree fellowship where you get placed either you see,

342
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:31,440
or at a state public health lab somewhere and, you know, to do bioinformatics.

343
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,230
And I know they're kind of trying to experiment more in genomic epi.

344
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:39,660
So Jared is our fellow right now in that program and he led this project where he did the sequencing

345
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:47,040
and he used this is a plot of basically the bottom is the different potential clades of monkey pox.

346
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:52,980
And then this Y-axis is this kind of distance, genetic distance metric.

347
00:37:53,310 --> 00:38:00,840
So this has to be is this outbreak. So you can see that the sample this particular sample is like dramatically,

348
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:06,960
much more closely related to this outbreak than it is to some of these higher risk clades.

349
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:10,830
So just kind of doing this matching process of your genomic data,

350
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:20,070
how closely related is it to this this spring we expect it to be versus this this thing that would be really bad if it were that.

351
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:24,720
Can you how confident can we be that this is truly this outbreak kind of monkey pox?

352
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:30,450
And they weren't able to get this resolution with the test that they were using the lab because it just wasn't specific enough.

353
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:34,620
So that's the thing. The sequencing is you can be specific as you want to be, essentially.

354
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:38,400
So this is just like we're using this in public health.

355
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:40,890
You can use this data for other things.

356
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:46,230
And depending on the sample, the quality of the data varies and you might not be able to use it for everything.

357
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:51,870
But you can use sequencing in public health for things that are AP and things that are other things.

358
00:38:54,760 --> 00:39:02,470
A big one that kind of, again, spurred on this is just this idea of tracking strain, emergence and prevalence.

359
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:11,800
So have you. I'm I'm guessing that we some of you have seen the plots that look like this of like the different variants of COVID over time.

360
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:22,960
And how do you see this replacement of strains? And people are still looking at this data every day to make public health decisions.

361
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:33,850
So this is a recent one. These are sequences from just seed, but, you know, the latest variant on if you're up on the latest variants,

362
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:44,290
but the Q one and bq1 point one or sort of these concerning ones are growing and people are wanting to see how common they are in Michigan and,

363
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:54,220
you know, what's going on. And so this strain surveillance just gives that more high resolution picture of the pandemic and what is circulating.

364
00:39:55,710 --> 00:40:02,780
And you know, these aren't. Just to generate like pictures and colors and things like that,

365
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:10,160
because the prevalence of particular strains differentiating between different strains can have real world implications.

366
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:16,580
So this is back from when we were transitioning from Delta to Armstrong.

367
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:24,980
And in addition to being much more contagious and much more like spreading much more widely and more immune invasive

368
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:31,700
and the certain monoclonal antibodies were not effective against our crown that were effective against Delta.

369
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,730
So when it first came on the scene,

370
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:42,020
people are making decisions about allocating these drugs and these resources and they want to know how common, how many.

371
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:47,720
What is the likelihood my patient has? I'm a cumbersome self doubt when I'm trying to make this decision.

372
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,719
Well, it depends somewhat on where they live,

373
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:55,820
likely because we know that these variants kind of get introduced and spread throughout the state and they

374
00:40:55,820 --> 00:41:01,970
often get introduced for first more into these denser urban areas and then spread over to more rural areas.

375
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:08,220
And so. It's an example of I feel like in this field, a lot of times people are like.

376
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:16,059
So yeah whatever it's just covered and like until it's not right and how they want that information and I feel like we're always

377
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:22,590
kind of trying to like anticipate that next thing that somebody might want to go and call up Marti or call up Heather and be like,

378
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:24,180
Hey, tell me about this.

379
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:31,570
I'm like, If we can have that data, at least a situational awareness about it, then we can help support response, which is what we want to do.

380
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:37,269
And this is happening right now with the Q one and Q I'm fine because there's like

381
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:41,079
one monoclonal I feel like that's left and it doesn't work against these variants.

382
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,719
And so these hospitals and the sea level,

383
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:50,980
they're deciding how long are we going to keep administering this to patients versus that not being worthwhile.

384
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:59,230
And in the molecular epidemiology, just that descriptive epidemiology is what kind of influences those decisions.

385
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:09,710
And then there's like the transmission me stuff. So this is outbreak investigations.

386
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:17,270
This is also happening right now. There's a massive outbreak at a facility in Michigan.

387
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:24,719
And the facility, what usually happens is. The way public health will often work is, you know, it starts at this local level.

388
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:30,780
So the facility might work with their local health department, the local health department or the facility directly.

389
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:35,370
Then might reach out to the state for assistance with response to different things.

390
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:42,330
So there's a whole health care associated infection unit in the epidemiology side of things.

391
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:51,000
And then you're contacted, Hey, we have this ongoing outbreak of Mercer and this unit, and we'd like your support.

392
00:42:52,950 --> 00:43:00,870
And then they might contact us at the lab and say, if we send these for sequencing, can you type and can you do a transmission based analysis?

393
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:06,299
Can you, you know, see what's going on? So that's something that we do.

394
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:08,550
It doesn't you know, there's kind of the routine surveillance.

395
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:20,370
And then there's like these are queue response situations and we try to make pictures to try to recalculate single nucleotide differences.

396
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:31,439
We to the best of our ability, you can describe clusters just based on it alone and sort of oftentimes, you know, they're already doing the epi.

397
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:40,290
The sequencing comes with delayed. So it's kind of seeing like how much the sequencing does or does not support sort of their

398
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:46,380
hypothesis about what might be going on with transmission within a particular outbreak.

399
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:50,220
And it can add a lot of really valuable information.

400
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:56,820
So this is sort of like a classical use of genomic epidemiology in action.

401
00:43:57,390 --> 00:44:03,450
And for me, it's been cool because I've worked on stuff like this historically, but like in a research setting.

402
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:08,760
So it's like these isolates were collected like several years ago, maybe many years ago.

403
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:16,380
And then we're like, All right, what can we learn about this situation to inform future public health stuff,

404
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:20,400
which is important and it's valuable and it does important things,

405
00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:26,880
but it's also fun to be doing it like a little bit more in real time, to the best of your ability.

406
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:32,850
But it's also a little bit crazy because I was like, I would have written an entire thesis about this like before,

407
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:37,560
and now I'm just trying to do something in like a day or two because people want this data.

408
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:42,419
So, so yeah, that's another. Another classic use of this,

409
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:48,180
and often the one that people think about the most when it comes to genomic epidemiology

410
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:52,170
and public health and the one that epidemiologists are often most interested in,

411
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:56,280
like, how do you support our like, outbreak response?

412
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:09,230
Questions. And applications that wasn't comprehensive but hopefully give you.

413
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:13,510
Some flavor of how it can vary.

414
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:17,640
And like I said, it's. There's a lot of different pathogens.

415
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:22,690
So the questions and the you says can vary depending on the pathogen.

416
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:26,740
Not every group that works in public health at the state level.

417
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:33,389
Is doing the same thing. Their programs start to look the same for each pathogen.

418
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:36,870
They have different levels of funding. They have different collaborations.

419
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:42,509
They have different priorities. So it's not like a one size fits all kind of thing.

420
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:45,780
You have to start to learn about each of those programs.

421
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:54,390
And then I go like, How could genomics fit in or support these activities in this particular area?

422
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:09,410
Three questions about my sapphire for the better. For.

423
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:18,590
I see the next part because I talk about like challenges and then that might fit in with some really none

424
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:22,430
of that where I like the way that Sapphire's supposed to kind of assist with some of the challenges.

425
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:27,780
So we should hopefully have plenty of time. Yeah.

426
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:29,830
Yeah. Okay, well, do this.

427
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:46,830
Making all this stuff happen is this like kind of complex picture and it starts with the isolate or the patient sample and some epidemiology.

428
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:52,170
And then in between there you have the kind of sequencing technology and laboratory side of it,

429
00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:56,970
and then you have the part, informatics and computing side of it and.

430
00:46:58,230 --> 00:47:01,080
There's like public health, I think always requires collaboration.

431
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:06,059
But this particular area is, I feel like a little bit unique in how much collaboration,

432
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:10,110
communication has to happen between all these different areas to make this happen.

433
00:47:10,890 --> 00:47:14,060
So first of all, like, how do you get the right samples to where they need to go?

434
00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:14,549
Honestly,

435
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:22,380
epidemiologists and public health spend a lot of time trying to figure out how to get people to send samples to this place and the logistics of it.

436
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:29,670
It's not trivial. So if only certain places are doing sequencing, if we're only sequencing the public, how far?

437
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:38,549
How do you get the samples to the public health lab? Can we increase the number of sites that can do sequencing so potentially we can send

438
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:42,120
them to more diverse places because the public health lab can only sequence so much.

439
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:50,100
And that's where I was brought up Saffire, which is an academic collaboration, part of that kind of goal.

440
00:47:50,730 --> 00:47:59,790
So out of my lab here in Michigan sequences a lot of COVID, and they are kind of early on sort of joins public health in that effort.

441
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:03,270
So that's that's one aspect of capacity.

442
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:07,710
I already mentioned fitting sequencing and with critical diagnostic activities.

443
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:13,840
It's probably like one of the biggest pressures that like leadership faces in this area.

444
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:19,120
There's just only so many. There's always so much space, literally so many people.

445
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:23,920
These are really time intensive processes and the diagnostics.

446
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:28,550
Is the most important to get people testing results to inform treatment.

447
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:31,070
So you can imagine.

448
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:39,500
And I can only imagine I wasn't there in the beginning of COVID and really just overall a lot of early COVID the challenges because.

449
00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:46,639
These labs are doing a ton of testing volumes and fitting sequencing and with that is challenging, not just doing the sequencing,

450
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:53,900
but like developing the protocol for how you're going to do the sequencing if you've not done it before.

451
00:48:54,500 --> 00:49:01,400
That doesn't just happen instantaneously. So that's another area where academic collaborators can kind of help.

452
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:08,400
Facilitate. Do you know, quality and standards is a big challenge in this area.

453
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:17,670
Especially being in a laboratory setting, I feel like they're sort of like horrified a lot of times by the idea of buying fanatics and how.

454
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:29,409
Much. There aren't like very strict set standards on some aspects of data quality like there are in the lab.

455
00:49:29,410 --> 00:49:39,640
Because remember, these labs operate under these like strict accrediting bodies to do this diagnostic testing that has to fit all of these boxes.

456
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:45,790
So this is a new type of activity and public health data quality is important all the time.

457
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:50,810
It's important if you're a researcher as well. You don't want to publish things that are wrong.

458
00:49:51,970 --> 00:50:00,910
But it's there's just this extra level of scrutiny when you're using the data to impact like actual public health action.

459
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:08,800
And there's a lot more chances for lawsuits. Many of you might be like Flint water crisis type situation.

460
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:17,930
You know, sequencing gets involved and questions like that of like linking particular facilities to particular outbreaks.

461
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:21,910
So you kind of you really have to make sure you have your ducks in a row in

462
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:26,920
like a different level and then all that information can be like for you and,

463
00:50:27,490 --> 00:50:30,880
you know, gathered by the public. So it's kind of a different.

464
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:38,750
Stakes there. This one is really huge of computing and infrastructure.

465
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:46,520
I think I really took for granted, you know, the resources in a university setting when I worked there.

466
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:56,270
But public health infrastructure is not built to do large scale sequencing to do a bunch of metrics.

467
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:04,880
Every computer in the state of Michigan is managed by this one agency called the Department of Technology Management and Budget.

468
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:10,520
They literally see, like oversee every building and every computer that is in all of state government.

469
00:51:11,330 --> 00:51:16,580
And it's really just restrictive and it's not scalable.

470
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:20,479
And it's so it's really hard to get the resources that you need often in public health.

471
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:25,910
And that's not something you experience to the same degree in a research like place like here,

472
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:29,480
because they're built for these like huge research programs, just like what they do.

473
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:36,290
So that's a big challenge, getting all these different stakeholders on board to help get us what we need to do our jobs.

474
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:47,460
Recruiting and training the workforce. These skills are somewhat specialized and, you know, really start up like a program.

475
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:55,320
You need to have some people with some experience in it already. And, you know, they can make a lot more money if they work in industry, basically.

476
00:51:55,320 --> 00:52:01,350
So it can be hard. You have to find people that are motivated to work in public health for kind of a mission in the service.

477
00:52:02,310 --> 00:52:04,770
And there's going to be more turnover because there's just going to be a lot of

478
00:52:04,770 --> 00:52:09,990
opportunities in this area in more diverse settings than there are in some others.

479
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:18,650
And then the epidemiology of it of actually linking not just generating sequencing data,

480
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:24,110
but linking sequencing data to the actual epidemiologic data that you know exists in

481
00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:30,530
my totally different systems and databases on the AP side is very much not trivial.

482
00:52:31,070 --> 00:52:38,960
So that's a huge challenge I'm doing in a timely manner, doing it in a sustainable way, finding systems that.

483
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:48,959
Can help make the linkages between the civil challenge that impacts, you know, how practical it is to do this stuff.

484
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:54,010
And all of this requires this cross silo communication, collaboration.

485
00:52:54,030 --> 00:52:58,650
Public health can be very siloed. It's very true at the federal level.

486
00:52:59,830 --> 00:53:04,299
Very true the Federal Reserve the state level to like people just get like they're

487
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:08,770
doing their thing with their pathogen or their mission and it's not that they're not,

488
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:10,750
you know, they don't care. They're not dedicated,

489
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:19,300
but they're not used to having to have these cross disciplinary conversations to the same extent this has to happen in this area.

490
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:28,030
So that is like I just a huge part of what I do is trying to talk to a big variety of people about this stuff and.

491
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:35,090
My training spanning epidemiology and bi dramatics and microbiology during bachelors.

492
00:53:35,090 --> 00:53:40,459
Like I kind of got enough like jargon from these different areas to kind of be able to

493
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:44,810
understand the jargon in all these areas and how you can have that level of communication.

494
00:53:44,810 --> 00:53:48,230
But it's challenging. It's really challenging.

495
00:53:51,970 --> 00:54:03,720
So let's see these last couple, these kind of like existential challenges to grapple with, like the ethics and privacy of things.

496
00:54:03,850 --> 00:54:12,090
Not only when you're talking about genomes, you could have, depending on the sample type of human genomic data and how you handle and deal with that.

497
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:16,570
That's a huge issue. And anytime you're using a technology to like.

498
00:54:17,810 --> 00:54:23,120
Potentially implicate transmission or implicate a facility in something.

499
00:54:24,110 --> 00:54:28,580
There's other concerns there, definitely, depending on the kind of sensitivity of the infectious diseases.

500
00:54:28,610 --> 00:54:34,549
The stuff is treated differently. You know, like HIV, for instance, has been doing versions of sequencing for a long time.

501
00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:42,320
But it's a very different kind of locked down world because of the stigma that has historically been associated with it.

502
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:44,910
Education.

503
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:56,570
So there's so many people that you have to educate at some level about this stuff in order to make that previous line of communication work.

504
00:54:56,580 --> 00:55:05,160
Like to have like a basic understanding. So, you know, the labs ideas cannot that be that be studies to be educated about the lab.

505
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:10,590
The local health departments have people that have, you know, no exposure to any of the stuff.

506
00:55:10,590 --> 00:55:15,350
And they're the ones on the ground that would actually be getting samples and seeing cases.

507
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:21,840
And so there's a huge variety of people that need to be educated and also the community, like if you want people to.

508
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:27,390
Buy into this and participate in systems of genomic surveillance.

509
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:33,360
They have to have some idea of why it would be good for them, which is, you know,

510
00:55:33,390 --> 00:55:38,790
it's really challenging, especially these days with this kind of trust in public health.

511
00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:47,219
And then you can't forget about equity because this particular technology and intervention in public health has just as

512
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:54,120
much of a chance to basically only affect the people that need at least as a lot of other public health interventions.

513
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:58,720
So, you know, we typically get samples from clinical clinical samples.

514
00:55:59,550 --> 00:56:03,960
So if you're getting, you know, high volumes of samples from Michigan medicine,

515
00:56:04,470 --> 00:56:08,370
this is like a very specific population of people that are seeking this really high level

516
00:56:08,370 --> 00:56:16,800
tertiary care as opposed to other populations that may not seek health care at that same rate.

517
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:24,629
And, you know, to have reasonable reasons to distrust health care and public health, then those are going to be like surveillance, like blind spots.

518
00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:29,220
You know, those are often like the the places that would be most in need of an intervention.

519
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:32,400
So definitely like very nascent in this field.

520
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:36,090
But something I think is important to not forget about.

521
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:40,430
So that's where I ended, which is some of these big picture.

522
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:47,190
Challenges and questions, but we have plenty of time, so I'm happy to take.

523
00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:53,630
Any other questions that come up about any of this? Yeah.

524
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:02,850
Yeah. So. My team right now.

525
00:57:03,150 --> 00:57:10,820
Um. I have. Three with one job offer, two job offers extended in another position.

526
00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:15,910
But I need to post. So hopefully in the near future I'll be like five or six under me.

527
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:30,490
The sequencing side has. Closer to ten ish people at this point that are more focused on the laboratory sequencing side of things.

528
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:38,340
But when I met. However, my boss I first talked to her in December of 2020.

529
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:43,400
It had just been her and she just hired her first person.

530
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:51,080
So there is a lot of places where a couple years ago it was like a person that like there was people

531
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:54,980
in the other areas that were doing aspects of sequencing and she was the only one doing the analysis.

532
00:57:55,370 --> 00:57:58,759
So now as they're pulling the sequencing in, it's growing.

533
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:02,120
But I'm yeah, whatever. That's right. Right now.

534
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:06,660
But it's definitely growing. In the background and expertize.

535
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:11,510
Do you see or do you kind of look for candidates that.

536
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:19,190
Getting pulled into that sequence like the others. So.

537
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:24,420
On our end. No.

538
00:58:25,590 --> 00:58:34,530
For more of these senior level specialists, bioinformatics specialists or genomic IP specialists,

539
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:42,940
we are looking for at least some exposure to programing of some kind like I do.

540
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:53,460
You look like an R python, so you're not completely new to programing because just analyzing these data just requires using some of those programs.

541
00:58:54,570 --> 00:59:02,430
Ideally, people would have some exposure to infectious disease, but not everybody does, and some people have some exposure to genomics.

542
00:59:02,910 --> 00:59:06,420
But like maybe it's genomics but not infectious. There's kind of these overlapping.

543
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:10,860
So there's kind of a bucket of like genomics, something infectious disease,

544
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:17,040
something programing, something, you know, binary mutations that are more senior.

545
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:21,419
We like to see some experience of like I've had to build some sort of pipeline at some

546
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:24,450
point to do some analysis because a lot of times that's what they're doing in the job.

547
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:30,930
But but we also have like a person entered in by informatics really entry level after her bachelors

548
00:59:30,930 --> 00:59:36,690
and working a little bit in public health after that but had never coded anything before and.

549
00:59:38,610 --> 00:59:42,129
Has worked here for about a year and is really learning just how on the job and just

550
00:59:42,130 --> 00:59:46,420
kind of is like the person that can like run the stuff that's already been built.

551
00:59:47,770 --> 00:59:52,900
And she was just really interested in it and she was a quick learner and she's been phenomenal.

552
00:59:53,350 --> 00:59:59,350
So it depends at what level we're hiring people, but the bioinformatics more senior, you're looking at some combination of those things.

553
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:03,880
Usually none of those people have exposure to public health like they're coming from one.

554
01:00:04,090 --> 01:00:06,400
If it great, if they also had exposure in public health.

555
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:13,719
But you're never really going to see like genomics and programing and public health and like that doesn't typically exist in a person.

556
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:19,420
So you take you're going to train them, you know some aspects for genomic epi that I'm working on.

557
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:27,219
I want somebody that has experience and I feel like that has that perspective even like I think

558
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:32,710
ideally having like an MPH would be great to have knowing that kind of gone through that coursework.

559
01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:37,960
But if they have like an illness or something, but I've kind of had some other experience I think that can work.

560
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:46,120
And you know, having seen genomic data in some fashion, even if it's more processed, is ideal.

561
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:50,790
But I think there's also there's going to be a spectrum there as far as more entry level more.

562
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:55,060
You know, realizing that people can learn a lot on the job.

563
01:00:55,990 --> 01:01:05,560
So it's a little different than most public health postings from the kind of like programing aspect of things for sequencing.

564
01:01:06,430 --> 01:01:12,490
Honestly, pretty similar to like microbiologists and stuff that they hire in the lab these days.

565
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:23,919
So people can get, you know, bachelors in micro and then some people pursue more like master's degrees in like medical technology.

566
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:28,570
A lot of people can go work in public health fields or maybe worked in a clinical lab first.

567
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:34,120
Typically, those hours are a little bit more crazy. So then sometimes public health is more appealing.

568
01:01:34,630 --> 01:01:43,420
So. The profile varied for like hiring a laboratory and then sequencing versus other laboratory stuff is not quite as different.

569
01:01:45,310 --> 01:01:51,820
But I think, you know, if they don't even know what PCR is, they know what some of the basic molecular techniques are.

570
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:55,900
You feel like you can train people pretty well to do the sequencing at this point.

571
01:01:58,210 --> 01:02:01,390
So I think to me.

572
01:02:03,430 --> 01:02:07,030
My. You know, having some of the technical background,

573
01:02:07,030 --> 01:02:14,440
but like really having that interest in applying into public health is really important because that's kind of like what we're all about.

574
01:02:15,010 --> 01:02:19,030
So having even if you're not fully knowledgeable about it,

575
01:02:19,030 --> 01:02:25,450
but see this like connection of like the things that made you want to go into it to me, like, oh,

576
01:02:25,810 --> 01:02:31,959
this connection between the microbiology and the applications and having that like technology to application

577
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:40,750
sort of line drawn for them I think is something that I would look for in people rather than just being like.

578
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:47,860
Yeah, I code a lot in paper. I'm like, okay, but like, why do you want to write and why do you want to work in public health?

579
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:53,600
So, but. It's very new.

580
01:02:53,770 --> 01:03:00,050
So it's not like there's. Tons of candidates out there to check all of these boxes.

581
01:03:01,030 --> 01:03:05,020
So we're always kind of like looking for these, like, qualities and people.

582
01:03:05,590 --> 01:03:10,090
And then it's like, okay, how much are we going to have to train them in? Like, which aspects?

583
01:03:17,020 --> 01:03:21,220
I use your site for your question. First, tell me about how do you work with.

584
01:03:23,570 --> 01:03:25,310
Yeah. So.

585
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:40,110
This was my first year and this past summer working with interns, how their hard work was done before and will happen again next summer, I'm certain.

586
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:42,059
We have a habit.

587
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:50,640
We have an internship program through this funding of this academic collaboration we do for expanding sequencing capacity called Sapphire.

588
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:56,190
And this past summer, we had three interns that were based MDT tests,

589
01:03:56,820 --> 01:04:05,760
and two of them were worked more with everybody in permutation at the time and they learned a lot more about.

590
01:04:06,770 --> 01:04:10,580
Building kind of a module or a component of a informatics pipeline.

591
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:21,620
So they did kind of a lot of like hands on work with like programing and like what a pipeline is and like how it fits

592
01:04:21,620 --> 01:04:29,240
into everything and the nitty gritty of troubleshooting and installing and a lot of that really bioinformatics stuff.

593
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:41,210
I also worked with one more on the genomic IP side, and with her she was less interested in like becoming a better implementation, which I understand.

594
01:04:42,410 --> 01:04:50,209
So with her, I worked more kind of on some downstream aspects, like we do all this surveillance and antimicrobial resistance.

595
01:04:50,210 --> 01:04:56,660
We sequenced all these carbapenem resistant and beta vector eyes, but we tried these reports,

596
01:04:56,660 --> 01:05:02,899
but we haven't really like collated this information together and looked at like bigger picture trends in the different genes

597
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:12,320
and just this like standard sort of descriptive visualizations and like metrics that you might be interested in in an IP sense.

598
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:20,780
So I kind of with her work tomorrow, I'm like, here's this existing design and explain these different things and where they came from.

599
01:05:21,470 --> 01:05:29,750
And she works to kind of draft up like a potential report we might send quarterly to epidemiologists to share share with them.

600
01:05:30,170 --> 01:05:33,440
So there's a spectrum, depending on the interests of the individual,

601
01:05:33,830 --> 01:05:40,940
of how nitty gritty you want to get into about informatics and versus how much you might want to do.

602
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:48,140
Like genomics is cool, but I want to work with like a little bit more of a process form of data.

603
01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:54,480
And how do people find out about it? So.

604
01:05:56,080 --> 01:06:05,200
Last year. We definitely did a lot of circulation through our Sapphire partners to try to get the word out that way.

605
01:06:05,970 --> 01:06:11,320
Um, I think I spoke in his class and we spoke to Evans class last year and we were able to talk to people then.

606
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:18,610
Um, and that has been like the main, main way, so for sure.

607
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:26,980
And each of me will be moved in when the next kind of round of applications would open up.

608
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:32,950
Because historically, yeah, we've gotten great candidates from here.

609
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:40,950
So the timing, I would say, would be. Probably like March.

610
01:06:42,770 --> 01:06:46,160
Maybe we can do it a little bit earlier this year. We'll see. Like how on top of things we are.

611
01:06:46,730 --> 01:06:51,500
But yeah, I keep your keep your ears on if it's something that you're interested in.

612
01:06:52,070 --> 01:06:54,770
Um, they're paid internships.

613
01:06:55,250 --> 01:07:05,810
They, um, this past year we had the hands on it, so we had people out the state and then we had people based at some of our academic partners.

614
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:16,460
So if there was a P.I. that we worked with, um, they had sapphire funding from us and they could find interns that way as well.

615
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:23,989
So as long as it was like in some way connected to building enhancing capacity for whole

616
01:07:23,990 --> 01:07:31,129
genome sequencing and analysis related to public health issues that kind of fit the bill.

617
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:32,870
So we sort of had a cohort,

618
01:07:32,870 --> 01:07:39,170
we had people around us and we had people based at the universities that were supervised directly by people at the university.

619
01:07:39,740 --> 01:07:46,670
And then we did like a weekly seminar series where we mixed in like some speakers were public health.

620
01:07:46,670 --> 01:07:55,510
Like you had Marty talk, you had someone from I mean, Joe Coyle talk from the Bureau of Infection Prevention, someone from local public health.

621
01:07:55,520 --> 01:08:01,880
I just try to get this exposure to like the public health system, which, again, something I really wasn't aware of before.

622
01:08:02,330 --> 01:08:10,190
And then we also had academic speakers that were doing research that was associated with sequencing and public health.

623
01:08:10,190 --> 01:08:18,350
And so we kind of exciting. So we had a seminar series, we did all virtually and we did a journal cover that we did virtually.

624
01:08:18,770 --> 01:08:23,780
And then at the end of the summer, everybody came to Lansing and toured the lab.

625
01:08:24,290 --> 01:08:27,679
We also tried the veterinary diagnostic lab at Michigan State,

626
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:33,680
which was really cool and kind of just have like a little Saints Day and presenting what you're doing.

627
01:08:34,310 --> 01:08:37,400
And so, yeah, I think people enjoyed it.

628
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:45,910
If a goal would be. Just to like my goal was here and coming today just to expose you like this exists as a thing.

629
01:08:45,910 --> 01:08:52,690
And, you know, we want to recruit talented people and interested people in it to pursue it.

630
01:08:53,830 --> 01:08:57,640
That's the goal of the internship to kind of spread the word that way.

631
01:08:57,910 --> 01:09:05,110
And yeah, there were like hybrid. There was opportunity for hybrid internships for at least for us.

632
01:09:05,260 --> 01:09:10,300
So we had people that would come really sing sometimes, but could also have some remote work.

633
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:15,200
So the balance that if they're living elsewhere. Mm hmm.

634
01:09:20,550 --> 01:09:26,240
Also. So those were just in our section.

635
01:09:26,390 --> 01:09:34,120
Then what would be now the genomics section? I don't know if something similar in the other sections.

636
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:37,900
I'm trying to think. They have like.

637
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:47,050
I feel like the other sections have like aloes come through through more like formal CDC fellowship programs where people get place.

638
01:09:47,380 --> 01:09:53,620
But I don't think that there has been anything of somebody like just originating directly from your sections.

639
01:09:53,620 --> 01:10:03,100
The other sections are a little. They're a little less plugged into, I guess, like the academic world than we are, so.

640
01:10:03,220 --> 01:10:08,020
Not that I'm aware of it. Yeah. I could get back to you if I heard of something.

641
01:10:08,020 --> 01:10:15,909
But everybody, if you are interested in one of the other areas in the lab, you can feel free to reach out.

642
01:10:15,910 --> 01:10:17,860
And I could connect you with the right person.

643
01:10:18,430 --> 01:10:27,960
I mean, there are always opportunities for, you know, visits or meetings of people that are more senior than me to help you learn more about it more.

644
01:10:27,980 --> 01:10:32,850
It is really, really wonderful and a great kind of spokesperson for public health labs.

645
01:10:32,870 --> 01:10:40,000
So, um, yeah, and that's just the lab hobby is like a whole, that's a whole other thing.

646
01:10:40,540 --> 01:10:49,420
Um, so I think they, they have internships and like, interns sometimes rotate through, not as recently because people are so busy.

647
01:10:49,470 --> 01:10:55,780
Yeah. I also see this internship program and each of these.

648
01:10:55,780 --> 01:11:01,420
Do they have a lot of. Yeah.

649
01:11:01,430 --> 01:11:09,630
Those are good. Definitely a good route. I'm. To kind of go through that to get into some of the public house stuff.

650
01:11:13,150 --> 01:11:18,210
So I have to get my. In its short answer.

651
01:11:18,390 --> 01:11:21,750
The big question is, can you talk a little bit about myself?

652
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:26,840
I like what the objective is. And the theory briefly, I mean,

653
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:37,790
just sort of it's been interesting to me over the last year to kind of watch the challenge of it all come together and do some incredible work.

654
01:11:38,010 --> 01:11:41,600
So I just wanted to talk about that a little bit.

655
01:11:41,660 --> 01:11:49,210
So yeah. Well, time that I haven't talked to you haven't until for 20 but.

656
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:53,830
Okay. Going my sapphire stems.

657
01:11:53,840 --> 01:12:02,299
It really stems from this principle that like if we want to do a whole lot of sequencing in public health, we can't an analysis.

658
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:05,130
We can't just do it at just our public health labs.

659
01:12:05,510 --> 01:12:15,569
Like we need to have more of a networked approach to tackle all these different challenges from just the volumes of sequencing to how

660
01:12:15,570 --> 01:12:23,450
do we sample sampling strategies for sequencing to the development of new protocols and optimization of protocols for sequencing.

661
01:12:23,750 --> 01:12:29,330
It's just like it's it's too much of an ask to to do that just specifically in that public setting.

662
01:12:29,750 --> 01:12:34,070
So academic collaboration is like a really great way to expand that.

663
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:42,560
And it can span from the laboratory, just these laboratory sets of things like we've started with my sapphire with expanding the number

664
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:49,820
of labs are doing COVID sequencing in Michigan and just trying to mix literally buying instruments,

665
01:12:49,820 --> 01:12:54,200
buying kits, talking about protocols, trying to stand up this program.

666
01:12:54,560 --> 01:13:02,240
And then it can go through like the more advanced analytics, like working with Evan's group in the Medicare department.

667
01:13:02,660 --> 01:13:08,090
You know, he does this all the stuff with like regional transfer for networks and health care system infections and, you know,

668
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:15,709
these advanced analysis that we don't have time for capacity at this time to do necessarily routinely in-house,

669
01:13:15,710 --> 01:13:20,690
but could generate information that can then be fed back to public health and happy and be useful.

670
01:13:21,260 --> 01:13:26,690
So it's all about this just kind of expanding capacity and finding overlap between my research

671
01:13:26,690 --> 01:13:33,470
interests and public health needs so that data can be generated for public health primarily,

672
01:13:33,860 --> 01:13:40,640
but can be used, you know, in research and use in all these other ways they can eventually be back.

673
01:13:41,060 --> 01:13:49,730
So that's the idea. And it comes, you know, we have all this money, like something CDC is very interested in.

674
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:54,800
And so it's like, let's expand our networks. So this happens collaboration.

675
01:13:58,010 --> 01:14:05,660
It's challenging from. It gets back to that just like cross area, like communicating exciting things.

676
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:15,340
By people who are squarely in academia have like varying levels of understanding of how public health works and what the priorities might be.

677
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:21,820
And people in public health have varying understanding of what it's like to be a professor and what they care about.

678
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:29,830
And so there's that kind of there can be challenges with communication and kind of setting all of that stuff up.

679
01:14:31,750 --> 01:14:38,320
Just any time you're dealing with diverse groups of people in professions like, it's going to get a little bit interesting.

680
01:14:39,130 --> 01:14:45,180
And so that's part of it. I think there's like you.

681
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:52,040
Yeah. There's a lot of things that you don't think that you necessarily need to make explicit, but then you're like,

682
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:58,550
Oh, they really, you know, we are really not on the same page here, so we need to be more explicit about this.

683
01:14:58,940 --> 01:15:02,150
And so that's been definitely a big part of it.

684
01:15:02,860 --> 01:15:06,380
Um, what were some of the schools. Mhm.

685
01:15:06,410 --> 01:15:09,520
What were they. They were coming at it from like let's.

686
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:14,190
Planet you said. Oh, and zoonotic. Yeah.

687
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:20,790
So, yeah. So there's like the capacity, um, when you're talking about the Upper Peninsula,

688
01:15:21,660 --> 01:15:26,900
basically this principle that like rural areas face different public health challenges than urban areas.

689
01:15:26,910 --> 01:15:35,580
Right? And so in Detroit, they're going to have different challenges and different priorities and concerns than they are up in Houghton,

690
01:15:35,580 --> 01:15:39,780
for example, where Michigan Tech is. And so there's a couple of challenges up there.

691
01:15:39,870 --> 01:15:45,110
One. But if they don't have a student health clinic at Michigan Tech, they don't.

692
01:15:45,620 --> 01:15:49,870
And so there is like less opportunity for testing and then therefore surveillance.

693
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:52,280
And we kind of like set up a whole genomic sequencing course.

694
01:15:52,330 --> 01:16:02,330
But also people in rural populations have more contact oftentimes with wildlife or with farm animals.

695
01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:10,490
And so that whole like one health perspective of thinking about spillover and transmission and reservoirs and you might have heard about,

696
01:16:10,490 --> 01:16:15,560
you know, COVID and deer and all of that kind of thing really comes into play in those communities.

697
01:16:15,950 --> 01:16:20,450
And they tend to be the least kind of surveilled and covered of all of them.

698
01:16:20,450 --> 01:16:33,560
Right. So having local capacity to do sequencing and or doing zoonotic sampling for COVID, for avian influenza, for various viruses,

699
01:16:34,460 --> 01:16:42,050
trying to reduce those blindspots in those areas, in people and in wildlife is sort of the principle that underlies underlies that.

700
01:16:42,410 --> 01:16:46,280
And some people at Michigan State in the diagnostic lab have that perspective as well,

701
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:53,780
which is just something we wouldn't get as much if we didn't collaborate with diverse groups of people.

702
01:16:54,920 --> 01:17:01,550
So we have a partner kind of brings their own perspective and their own strengths and their own populations.

703
01:17:01,940 --> 01:17:05,929
And it's about kind of like honing in on what those are and what those challenges are.

704
01:17:05,930 --> 01:17:12,770
And then we're trying to connect those pieces back in public health to way that would be more useful.

705
01:17:12,770 --> 01:17:20,090
So it's been a it's a big learning process, but I think it has a potential to kind of continue on even,

706
01:17:20,780 --> 01:17:24,679
you know, post COVID because I think it's hard to yeah,

707
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:29,330
it's hard to go back to being insular and isolated once you've expanded out and

708
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:35,270
realized how much more benefit you can get from these sorts of collaborations.

709
01:17:40,210 --> 01:17:51,520
Great stuff. Thank you very much. You're welcome. So next week, your boss just put this up.

710
01:17:52,540 --> 01:17:58,989
Next week we're off. November 10th, we're going to the meeting is probably going to be shorter.

711
01:17:58,990 --> 01:18:06,010
Just some advising, housekeeping, start talking about internships for those of you that are interested in,

712
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:11,740
you know, just sort of like getting ducks in a row for next semester and then for.

713
01:18:12,740 --> 01:18:15,740
So we'll talk about that on the tape. Probably a shorter session.

714
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:22,480
And I think. Can you believe you're almost done with this?

715
01:18:23,990 --> 01:18:27,410
It's out of credit. All right. Excellent.

716
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:32,050
So I'll send out a reminder about the plans for the 10th that.
