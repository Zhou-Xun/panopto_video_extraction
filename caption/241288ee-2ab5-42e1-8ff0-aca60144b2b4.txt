00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,550
After watching this video,

2
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:12,945
you will be able to explain

3
00:00:12,945 --> 00:00:16,080
basic concepts about
Poisson regression.

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,060
Remember, we left the last
video with a table that shows

5
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,040
four of the generalized
linear models

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,870
that we will learn
in this course.

7
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:26,675
Two we already know,
linear and logistic.

8
00:00:26,675 --> 00:00:29,410
Now it's time to learn Poisson.

9
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:32,090
The main things that
you need to know about

10
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:36,110
Poisson regression is that we
use it to model count data,

11
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:38,269
that is positive integers,

12
00:00:38,269 --> 00:00:41,615
and count data usually follows
a Poisson distribution.

13
00:00:41,615 --> 00:00:43,610
The Poisson distribution
was named by

14
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,490
the French mathematician
SimÃ©on Denis Poisson.

15
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:49,235
This distribution
has the peculiarity

16
00:00:49,235 --> 00:00:52,370
that their mean is
equal to the variance.

17
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:56,030
Note that the Poisson
distribution model counts

18
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:59,045
positive integers only
as mentioned before,

19
00:00:59,045 --> 00:01:01,670
while the normal
distribution allows for

20
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:05,020
any real value,
positive and negative.

21
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,310
Even if for a mean of two,

22
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:10,095
the blue distribution
seems semi-normal.

23
00:01:10,095 --> 00:01:12,844
It's not, it's a
Poisson distribution

24
00:01:12,844 --> 00:01:14,765
because we are modeling counts.

25
00:01:14,765 --> 00:01:18,095
The Poisson distribution can
help to ask the question,

26
00:01:18,095 --> 00:01:20,555
what is the probability
of having zero events,

27
00:01:20,555 --> 00:01:23,630
one event, two events, and so on.

28
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:26,720
The Poisson regression
model is also called a

29
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,555
log-linear model
because it's link,

30
00:01:29,555 --> 00:01:32,665
as shown here, is
the log function.

31
00:01:32,665 --> 00:01:36,410
So far so good. Now,
this slide shows

32
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:38,150
the most important part

33
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,980
of learning what a
Poisson model is,

34
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,710
so please pay attention.

35
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,965
Think about what a rate is.

36
00:01:43,965 --> 00:01:45,690
Basically, a rate is

37
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:48,680
just a count per
unit of time, right?

38
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,900
So when you think of
the incidence rate

39
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,310
of myocardial infarction,

40
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,935
you're just counting
myocardial infarction events

41
00:01:54,935 --> 00:01:57,070
in relation to some person-time.

42
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,540
So you can use
Poisson regression to

43
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:03,080
model events per person-years
or any other time,

44
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,700
which are just rates.

45
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,395
Now, in order to do that,

46
00:02:06,395 --> 00:02:09,460
you have to do some
arrangements to the equation.

47
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:13,100
The original equation has
just a count or a Mu.

48
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:18,115
Now we want to model rates
which will be Mu over time.

49
00:02:18,115 --> 00:02:20,120
It happens that the log of

50
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,325
a ratio is the
difference of the logs.

51
00:02:22,325 --> 00:02:24,490
That's a property
of the logarithms.

52
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:30,135
That can be rearranged as log
of Mu minus log of t. Now,

53
00:02:30,135 --> 00:02:33,285
we move log of t to the
right side of the equation.

54
00:02:33,285 --> 00:02:36,910
So we will go back to our
original Poisson model.

55
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:39,525
But now we have that
extra variable,

56
00:02:39,525 --> 00:02:42,035
which is called the
offset variable,

57
00:02:42,035 --> 00:02:44,625
and it's the natural log of time.

58
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:47,180
Now you can understand
the meaning of

59
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,195
the Beta in the
Poisson regression.

60
00:02:49,195 --> 00:02:51,090
If we'll be modeling rates

61
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,310
then by exponentiating the Beta,

62
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:56,255
we will get incidence
rate ratios,

63
00:02:56,255 --> 00:02:57,710
which is another measure of

64
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,370
association that
we're familiar with.

65
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:04,100
So bottom line, Poisson
regression is used to

66
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:07,310
model counts that follow
a Poisson distribution,

67
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,545
where the mean is
equal to the variance,

68
00:03:09,545 --> 00:03:11,675
and the link is the log function.

69
00:03:11,675 --> 00:03:13,700
Because rates are counts per

70
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,265
time by creating an
offset variable,

71
00:03:16,265 --> 00:03:17,735
that is the log of time,

72
00:03:17,735 --> 00:03:20,060
we will be modeling
rates and therefore

73
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:23,320
getting incidence rate
ratios from all Betas.

74
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,150
Just knowing those few
things is more than you

75
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:29,560
need to interpret reasonably
well a Poisson model.

76
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,845
In summary, in this video,

77
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:33,770
we learned the most
basic concepts

78
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,225
about Poisson regression.

79
00:03:35,225 --> 00:03:37,370
In the next video, we
will continue with

80
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:40,864
our Poisson regression
example in SAS.
