1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
I had to dress like a grownup anyway because it won't work. So he just moved to get it today.

2
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:28,290
So we said, okay, so today is our in our last day of lecture to finish up talking about interventions on Monday,

3
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:40,079
to talk about an early life intervention with first and second graders to prevent drug abuse and suicidal behavior and criminal involvement,

4
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:48,600
criminal justice system, etc. The good behavior game. Today we're going to talk about a second one, which is on the other end of the life span.

5
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,910
So this is the experience for a project which I'll tell you about and another universal intervention strategy.

6
00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:01,410
This is now for preventing cognitive decline and frailty and kind of cognitive impairment as people get older.

7
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:07,590
And then we'll switch gears and talk about the legal system, which we've talked a little bit about.

8
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,680
And certainly the readings last week really focused on on that.

9
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,489
But this one you can write for the mental health court just before I do that.

10
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:20,190
As a reminder, Monday at 1130 is when checkpoint number six is due.

11
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:22,680
I know we've already started working on that, which is great.

12
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:31,139
Again, I will try not be aware that you might accidentally like change the format of the thing.

13
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:37,140
Don't do that. I will not like that until we're actually in this room together that I will hit lock

14
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,290
and then that's it doesn't matter whether you're presenting on Monday or Wednesday,

15
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:44,460
you might be able to make changes because that's fair for everybody else.

16
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,880
Any questions about that? Next week, presentations.

17
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:58,620
And then your final paper is due on Friday at midnight next week.

18
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:04,400
And just as a reminder, these real time. Okay.

19
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:10,140
All right. Questions about something that. We were here already.

20
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:14,290
So whether it's been reminds us that it's almost is results.

21
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:20,770
All right. So let's talk about another. So I told you about an ineffective ways to intervene.

22
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:27,040
Like we don't like screening the evidence that screening does anything for mental health problems.

23
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,180
The things we talk about, this class is weak at best.

24
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:39,940
Some of this is because we don't actually know the pathology of most psychiatric and substance use disorders.

25
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,229
So that is we don't know when in the process to screen.

26
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:51,520
Right. It's different than like, you know, a mammogram or a pap smear or even like cholesterol screening.

27
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:51,720
Right.

28
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:58,360
You kind of like those are we have an understanding of like even if it's imperfect, an understanding of how high cholesterol relates to heart disease.

29
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:06,970
Right. We don't really have an understanding of sort of how sleeping problems directly relate to depression, for example.

30
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:12,249
The second is that we don't have a system that's really focused on prevention.

31
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:16,420
We don't have an even. And not only that, we don't have a system that's really focused on intervention.

32
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:20,290
Right. It takes a long time for people to get into care if they do get care.

33
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:25,059
So they get most of the recommendations of the American Task Force.

34
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,330
The American Preventive Services Task Force is put out. Are these broken?

35
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:35,830
All of them are either B or AIS. I means don't do it if there's there's insufficient evidence.

36
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:42,890
B means do it. If you can close the loop on care which you've learned in this class does not happen.

37
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:50,390
So it's it's a little bit of a. Imaginary world where where any of those things are true.

38
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:54,510
So anyway, so we have different ways to hope is not all lost.

39
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,720
There are things that we can do. So I told you about that.

40
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:00,460
We played the good behavior game on Monday and now we're going to talk about experience four.

41
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:06,450
So Experience four is another intervention that was developed out of Johns Hopkins.

42
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:11,320
It was initially tested in large randomized controlled trials.

43
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:20,080
You can contrast that to dare, which was just an idea that somehow got caught on and then got put into 75% of schools in the United States.

44
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:27,790
So so this is this is something that actually started as a trial for target population.

45
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:37,389
Here is adults over age of 60. And the rationale for this this project is that, you know, and we talked about this in the very first day of class,

46
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:42,280
I asked you, what's the average life expectancy in the United States? And your answer was eight.

47
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:50,860
That's right. That's a good job. Remember that? So so, you know, but most people retire long before that 78.

48
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:54,150
And if you make it to age 60, your life expectancy is actually 88. Right.

49
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,650
So the longer you live, the more likely you are to live a long life.

50
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:02,170
And so they estimate that about a third of our life is going to be spent post-retirement.

51
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:10,600
But there's actually very few opportunities to have kind of meaningful social roles in this period of life.

52
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:19,149
But we know that kind of remaining engaged in activities is what is sort of like this really important idea

53
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:24,850
that seems to underlie both what with whatever we mean by successful age of defined that more specifically to

54
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:32,920
mean limited functional limiting functional impairment really like compressing the time of life that you have

55
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:38,350
severe disability to as short as possible of living as long as you can with as much functioning as you can.

56
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:45,730
So so they're developing this so that sort of that, that that's sort of the idea that like, you know,

57
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:50,620
you rob banks because that's where the money is and it's like your idea is like what you rob or you focus on this population cause there's a

58
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:58,870
whole lot of people who are in this group that don't have a lot of other alternatives that would actually give them meaningful social roles.

59
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:04,979
But the experience score is not not just an intervention, it is a volunteer intervention.

60
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:08,750
And older adults are volunteering in Baltimore City schools.

61
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:14,190
Why are they able to do this? Because Hopkins has this very, very close relationship with Baltimore City schools.

62
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:18,299
That's what they've been working on the experience for this is the exact same set of people.

63
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,280
Not the same, I guess. Not the exact same set of people,

64
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:31,080
but the same set of leadership relationships that's able to kind of continue to actually implement real world interventions in these settings.

65
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:37,860
And so most people think that children we should value children and that we should value their success.

66
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:43,620
And in low resource schools, which Baltimore City schools are low resource, there's a need for additional support,

67
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:47,520
and volunteers can provide that in a setting that doesn't provide without any cost.

68
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:53,909
So now this is if you a Google experience for today, you're going to get a website like this.

69
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:57,059
You'll notice that AARP is up in the upper left. They weren't there at the beginning.

70
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:05,380
But now this is a this is a program is a nationwide program that is in part sponsored by AARP and again,

71
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:14,910
provides these opportunities for older adults to be volunteering in schools to help help kids learn, essentially.

72
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:22,080
So the intervention is that people were randomized to either join a team of school

73
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,309
volunteers because there was a pretty intensive training period of 30 hours.

74
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:30,090
So this wasn't just to kind of show up at the food bank for an afternoon or something like this.

75
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:37,470
This is obviously like a much more of a commitment to volunteering. You're assigned to a team into these classrooms in kindergarten, first grade.

76
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:44,280
You are volunteering 15 hours a week. So again, that's a pretty intensive tier and you receive a stipend of $250 a month.

77
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,260
This is now currently paid through the same program that funds America.

78
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,839
Right. So that's where so this money there, people still get some money for this when they participate.

79
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,169
So it's not again, they're still volunteering.

80
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:01,499
But this is the notion that, like, would you still put gas in the car?

81
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,580
Are you still going to like have lunch when you go to volunteer and things like that?

82
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:09,810
So the idea is like this is going to help make it accessible to a much broader set of people.

83
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,220
And then people were randomized and is a randomized controlled trial.

84
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:19,110
The control arm was either a waitlist or some low intensity volunteer activity.

85
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:27,890
This is their kind of logic model as to what they were thinking, what they what what they thought was going to be happening.

86
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:34,340
So, again, the intervention is this generative role, a meaningful social role,

87
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:42,260
and that that was going to involve physical activity, have to go to the school, you have to run around with children,

88
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:48,139
cognitive activity, whether that's in terms of the training and the preparation,

89
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:51,560
but also the fact that you're reading the kids are helping them with homework.

90
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:56,300
Now it's homework for kindergarten, first and second graders. So it's not it's not we're not talking about calculus here.

91
00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:01,010
But the point is that still is cognitive activity and then in particular social roles.

92
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:06,499
Right. So they're they're they're going into the school not as themselves, but as part of a team of people who they have.

93
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,079
You know, again, these are other older adults that they're going in with.

94
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:15,770
So they both have within generation partnerships, but then they're developing cross-generational partnerships with the teachers,

95
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,430
the children of potentially the children's parents there.

96
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:26,420
Again, they think that there are three kind of mechanisms. So one is just balance and strength and cognition.

97
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,649
We talked about some of these, you know,

98
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:34,040
executive functioning and memory is these core elements of cognition and then social interaction where at the end of the day,

99
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:39,710
they think that they're going to be able to improve or at least protect slow improve.

100
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:45,080
It's the the way because I this happens in later life.

101
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:51,680
What we're really looking at is sort of a lessening like reducing the speed of decline in walking speed,

102
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:56,480
reducing the declines in reducing making the slope shallower.

103
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:59,030
So cognition is declining with age no matter what.

104
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:04,670
But if I can make that slope shallower, they're going to die of something else before you develop Alzheimer's, right?

105
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,560
That's the idea of delay.

106
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:16,260
And again, the idea is that what we mean by successful aging is having as limited disability as limiting disability as much as possible.

107
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:21,170
Now, this is there is for these older adults or with these kids.

108
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:24,739
Right. So there's also you can imagine this is kind of a dyadic relationship.

109
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:30,920
You could imagine that having that older adult in the room might help academics with the kids,

110
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,970
might help with their behavioral, it might help their kind of readiness to learn.

111
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:41,420
So you can see these potential mechanisms. And so here we might have outcomes even on the kid side.

112
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:45,800
Right. But this is this is sort of.

113
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:51,830
It's not an afterthought, but it's not the primary thing. So the older adult, this is what they care about.

114
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:57,320
But the researcher doesn't care about this. The researcher is caring about this.

115
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:02,550
So it's an it's an interesting model. So what do we observe?

116
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:05,990
So, again, these are these are randomized. So I know that these are causal effects.

117
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:11,870
So for people who are randomized to the intervention, so again, where everybody declines in walking speed,

118
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:17,630
but the decline in the intervention group is much, much smaller than the decline of the people who are on the wait list.

119
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:27,080
This is in number of TV hours per day. So we're going to increase in time rate sedentary behavior, a decline in intervention.

120
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:31,159
Plus, you see this is brains, which is really exciting.

121
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:35,629
So again, the intervention is the blue arm here. This is a randomized controlled trial.

122
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:41,900
So I'm looking at different parts of this is the prefrontal cortex and this is the anterior interior cingulate cortex.

123
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:48,500
These are all involved in executive functioning. And you can see again, these are random near causal effects.

124
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:54,510
People were randomized to either get a wait list and. So what does this mean?

125
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:58,440
It means I'm volunteering, having those sort of meaningful, generative roles.

126
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,480
Is this not dementia? Right. Because that can take decades to develop.

127
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,459
But short term,

128
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:15,810
that is over like a 12 to 24 month period to actually get changes in the amount of activation in the brains of people who are doing these meaningful.

129
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:22,770
Right. And so you can you know, that the jury is still out in the sense of the data is not yet in.

130
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,150
I don't mean that like it's controversial, but it's just the data is not yet.

131
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,160
And as to whether we can actually prevent dementia with this.

132
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:38,160
But this is very powerful evidence, not just of the the kind of physical aspects, but in this case, the mental aspects of this.

133
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,040
This is looking at the hippocampus. So this is males and females.

134
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,429
So we had no different again, this is just size. So this isn't functioning.

135
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:48,960
This is a different picture here. But again,

136
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:57,569
the notion that you can actually observe differences in people's brains and that if they were randomized to this intervention or not and again,

137
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:04,110
the outcome is primarily following the loss or mitigating the loss rather than producing.

138
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:11,330
And so it's a different kind of mindset to thinking about an intervention. So you might be saying, well, what about the kids?

139
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:23,420
The kids benefit? The answer is not really so. So what this is showing is these are like the kids who were randomized to get a experienced

140
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:27,739
core person in their classroom and those who did not get an experienced poor person.

141
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:31,720
And this is the number of letters of the alphabet of which there are 26.

142
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:40,520
They recognize at the rate and they recognize in the fall and the spring of kindergarten,

143
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:44,659
you can see that the kids who get the experience for it, they know a little bit.

144
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:51,050
They know more letters in the fall, in the spring, everybody was caught up by by the end here.

145
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:53,510
And this difference isn't statistically significant.

146
00:13:53,870 --> 00:14:00,650
There have been other findings since then that suggests that maybe some of the behavioral outcomes are different.

147
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:04,370
You know, certainly if you go back to the logic model for the kids,

148
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:10,129
there's a lot of different sort of part of it, just like having another adult in the room.

149
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:15,770
And so even if the sort of short term outcomes in terms of do you recognize the alphabet or, you know,

150
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:21,050
improving your math skills, you can see that some of these elements are out like behavioral.

151
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:24,680
That might still be the case. You might see improvements there.

152
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:32,720
And certainly the older adults report, you know, these being very meaningful relationships for them.

153
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,470
You know, they now that this you know, the study was started in the nineties.

154
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,270
These kids have graduated.

155
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:45,020
They you know, sometimes, you know, there's stories of the volunteers going to the high school graduations and just like really,

156
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:49,759
you know, really kind of powerful anecdotes,

157
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:58,190
but also but sort of that is illustrations of the broader theme that is this is a meaningful role that older adults are still are finding.

158
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:06,110
This is a very useful role. Um, so just to summarize, the, you know, we,

159
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:12,720
it looks like from the evidence from experience where there's lots of observational evidence that people use,

160
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:16,100
or I should say before they did this trial and even after they did this trial,

161
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,129
there have been lots of observational studies showing that people who volunteer,

162
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:23,990
who are involved in their church, etc., have better health outcomes as they age no matter what.

163
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:29,570
Right. So but that's not a randomized controlled trial, right? So people who volunteer are different than people who don't volunteer.

164
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:36,169
And so here to be able to do this within a randomized controlled trial is is quite powerful

165
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:39,980
to kind of illustrate that positive thing because volunteering really by definition is free.

166
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:47,060
You know, I in the sense of even though there's there's some monetary compensation here to help people account for their their time and expenses,

167
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:51,110
they might they might play that might come into this. So again, we see that.

168
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:58,490
So but the take home message from both the observational data and the clinical trial data, which is which are consistent with each other,

169
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:03,469
is that lack of social engagement likely plays a causal role in the onset and

170
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:11,640
prognosis and progression of cognitive and functional decline of life even you know,

171
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:19,340
you some, you know, we think about we think about prevention we often so especially in Alzheimer's disease where again,

172
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:22,850
as we talked about, most of the drug trials have just been abysmal.

173
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:28,010
Right. Like they just like there is no alternative. There is no effective treatment for Alzheimer's disease right now.

174
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:39,410
The so the idea that you can still drop something in in when people are 50 or 60 years old and still make a difference is pretty is pretty incredible,

175
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:43,429
right? Because most people are kind of think that we actually need to be decades earlier than that.

176
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:49,850
Right. Which is a very difficult thing to do. So it really does suggest that there's and again, I showed you the imaging data,

177
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:56,540
which is consistent with this these ideas around neuroplasticity in neuro generous neurogenesis.

178
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:01,219
And again, the idea this is this is really a universal strategy.

179
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:05,959
Like there are very few side effects to this. This is why this is now a nationwide program.

180
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:11,420
They just started in Detroit last year. So if you have family in the area, they want to volunteer to get them going to do it.

181
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:15,500
So yeah. Okay.

182
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:24,229
So the last thing I want to say to you then I'll stop for questions is that both the good behavior game and the experience,

183
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:29,959
for example, despite being in totally two different ends of the life force, have four things in common.

184
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,410
The first is that they examine multiple outcomes.

185
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:36,049
So again, I showed you data on the behavior.

186
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:45,470
Data was looking at drug use, suicidal behavior, antisocial behavior, etc. It was curious cause looking at walking speed, cognitive impairment, etc.

187
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,459
And so that's consistent with the idea of how we think about development.

188
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:54,830
That one, the exposure can be related to multiple different things over time.

189
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:58,159
It's not that there's a 1 to 1 relationship between exposure and outcome.

190
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:06,559
That's not how most things work. The second is that they all engaged non-medical community stakeholders, in this case schools.

191
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:11,340
And. And. Community members aren't looking for all schools.

192
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:18,720
There's other programs that have done work, whether it's workplace interventions, things like that that I'm not going to show you data on.

193
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:24,690
But the idea is that these are not these interventions are not occurring in any sort of health care setting.

194
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:29,820
The targets that they're trying to move are not psychiatric in nature.

195
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:37,080
So the target of the good behavior game is classroom management. The target of the experience score is successful aging.

196
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:42,550
These are not depression, anxiety, you know, drug use, cognition, dementia.

197
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:45,930
None of these words are part of the way these programs are sold.

198
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:53,010
None of these that is sold to the stakeholders, none of these are part of the language in terms of that.

199
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:56,010
So just you've got to kind of think about how.

200
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:05,000
Mental disorders are are one one thing that can be removed by these interventions, but they're not the only thing that matters here.

201
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,100
And I think just helping to understand how to helping to bridge the gap between what your stakeholder

202
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:14,479
cares about in this case for good behavior and classroom management and what you care about,

203
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,130
which in this case is for chronic drug use, is requires sort of understanding this within a broader process.

204
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:23,510
And then finally, that the focus on both of these is on implementation from the beginning,

205
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:30,550
because there is no sense in designing a perfect intervention that's either too expensive or too infeasible to implement long term, right?

206
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:36,440
So there's a lot of talk, there's a lot of interventions that you can develop that might have the same effect.

207
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:43,870
But if they're too damn expensive or they're not consistent with the workflow of the people that you want to implement them, it's not going to have.

208
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:51,420
Okay. Questions about. Intervention or prevention this which we talk about the legal system.

209
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:03,749
Yeah. Go ahead. Um, how is this program marketed to people?

210
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:06,900
I guess, like experience for. Yeah.

211
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:12,590
Like, do you tell people participating in volunteers, like, oh, this is going to help you cognitively and like,

212
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:17,550
there's no real effect on the kids that you're helping, but you'll get better.

213
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:23,370
Yeah. No, that's a great question. And the answer is, you can probably predict this is not that at all.

214
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:23,730
Right.

215
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:33,890
The the the way that it is, you know, empowers people over 50 to serve as tutors to help students become better readers by the end of third grade.

216
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:41,450
It is a proven 111, helping students succeed. Older adults thrive and communities grow stronger.

217
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:49,570
So this is, you know. You can see like this.

218
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:59,040
Hi. My name is Seth. I'm Carlos. My name's Henry.

219
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:03,900
My name is Alice. My name is Ed. I love reading with Lucille.

220
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,650
I'm Lucille. My name is Carol. To be frank with you.

221
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,040
It's my name. Frank. Frank is so funny.

222
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:22,340
They lift my spirits every time I see them. My dream is to be a scientist.

223
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:29,930
My my dream is to be a veterinarian. To be a zookeeper due to write a book.

224
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:35,590
I can't wait to read Sky's book someday. My dream is to help them reach theirs.

225
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:51,680
Experience Corps is a dream come true for me. Working with them is hands down the best part of my week whose kids crack me up.

226
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,100
When you show up every week, they see you won't give up on them.

227
00:21:55,310 --> 00:22:00,470
I just love kids. Wanted to help in any way I could. I want to be able to write a letter to my grandma.

228
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:04,070
I want to read science blogs, especially about tigers.

229
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:08,870
I wanted to feel important again. I want to read like my friends.

230
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,550
I've seen Seth grow by leaps and bounds since working with Clyde.

231
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:19,540
It's like he's a different kid. I'm not a teacher, but I love being there, and I'm a darn good listener.

232
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:25,030
I've never seen anything like this before, and I've been a principal for 12 years.

233
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:33,940
This program has really opened my eyes to how something so simple can change so many lives, not just the lives of the kids.

234
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:40,140
It's amazing to see the impact Dallas has had on my son. It's made a huge difference.

235
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:46,760
I'm glad that Alice doesn't get frustrated with me. It feels so good to help these kids.

236
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:51,440
But they have no idea how much they help me. I love Alice.

237
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:55,490
She believes in me. And she always tells me you can do it.

238
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:59,860
I love being a part of something great. I found a new sense of purpose.

239
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:05,010
They let me into their world a couple of times a week. It's amazing.

240
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:11,410
So what's my dream? It's a community of all kinds of people working together to lift each other up.

241
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:22,320
That dream may come true after all. He's very well produced.

242
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:28,590
Reactions are I mean, this can't be real people.

243
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:37,200
I mean, they're they're very good looking kids. I think they're probably real.

244
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:42,600
I think they've been rehearsed.

245
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,200
That frank joke had to be like, yeah, yeah.

246
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:53,040
I, you know. It's clear. They're they're not.

247
00:23:53,700 --> 00:24:03,470
But I mean, I think it's a it's it's not unimportant as to how when you I mean I mean, based on that, like,

248
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:07,920
what do you mean setting aside the kind of cheesiness if you if your grandmother or

249
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:13,620
grandfather was alone and sort of not necessarily getting out of the house a lot,

250
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:18,510
like I presume that, you know, you would find you would find it compelling that maybe you'd want us to talk to them about this.

251
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:24,570
And like, that's the purpose of this is the idea that, you know, they they talk about.

252
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:28,700
But, you know, again, the emphasis is on the children, the benefits the children get,

253
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:35,910
even though this is not going to end, it was never even designed to help that problem.

254
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:41,430
Intention. Right. Like so the training they get is not on necessarily literacy.

255
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:46,510
And how do you like how do you help children? But it's about like how do you deal with classroom management?

256
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:51,840
Like, how do you work with the teacher, right. And things like that. So it's it's it it really is.

257
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:56,850
You know, it was developed by Linda Freed, who is the now the dean at Columbia University's School of Public Health.

258
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:59,420
And she's a gerontologist. Like, that's her that's her focus.

259
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:04,110
It was not developed by child development, you know, by older people, the study, older adults.

260
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:09,840
So but again, this is a situation where there is no alternative,

261
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:14,610
like there is no prevention for Alzheimer's disease, there is no treatment for Alzheimer's disease.

262
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:23,850
There is a clear need for under-resourced kids or under-resourced schools to have more people working with kids in a classroom.

263
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:32,070
There is a clear population, target population that is interested in developing, having generative social roles.

264
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:38,910
And so I think the reason that this went from clinical trial to nationwide program,

265
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:44,070
you know, flagship program by a group is because there's one there.

266
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:53,430
It's kind of stepping into a vacuum a little bit. But there's also a situation where there's very little downside to this program.

267
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:58,260
The risk of harm is almost negligible. Yeah.

268
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:06,660
So like with prevention programs, especially, like. Okay.

269
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:15,700
So. Obviously like for with mental health issues and concerns for like any range of people,

270
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:21,520
there's like inherently like social determinants of health that are tied into it.

271
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:27,400
Right. So like ideally prevention programs should be focusing on those like.

272
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:33,700
Like food insecurity, homelessness. Would you say like especially like with mental health, like,

273
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:44,350
would you say that this is like something like this kind of prevention is something that is not is like very underutilized or like.

274
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:50,380
Like because it makes sense that prevention programs maybe shouldn't be targeting,

275
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:58,660
like in focusing very specifically on like the psychiatric nature of things, but like, you know, overall well-being because those are inherently tied.

276
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:04,570
I mean, I think that the challenge really is that the way that the way that funding works,

277
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:09,249
like research funding works, is like they are tied to specific outcomes.

278
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:13,930
And like when I write a grant to study suicide, I goes to the National Institute of Mental Health.

279
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:22,000
Even if I'm studying, you know, neighborhood context, there's no like there's no there's no institute of, like, social determinants of health.

280
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:28,930
Right. And and so what these are the way that and oftentimes, you know,

281
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:34,570
even just like medicine as a discipline, the kind of biomedical model is very discrete outcome thing.

282
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:39,910
So I think part of it is like different foundations, like the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Kaiser Family Foundation.

283
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:45,010
There are these different foundations that kind of have stepped in that are very focused on those types of interventions.

284
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:48,430
They don't have anywhere near the amount of money that the government has.

285
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:53,950
I mean, it's not even close. Right. So even if, like Robert Wood Johnson threw every dollar it had at the problem,

286
00:27:53,950 --> 00:28:00,819
like it still would be like less than the budget of like the National Cancer Institute, which probably spends most of its money not on prevention.

287
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:03,310
But again, it's a different problem. Right. But.

288
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:14,470
So but I do think it's also the challenge when, you know, how do you help someone understand I'm interested in depression.

289
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:20,360
And so to say, well, I'd like to talk to you about homelessness and like, no, no, no, but I'm interested in depression, right?

290
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:29,920
So I think part of it is like, what? There there are these situations where you have different stakeholders for, you know, and, but.

291
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:36,910
In a world where people where things are seen as like a zero sum game, where like if I invest here that I'm not investing here,

292
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:45,160
which is a is true in the situations of limited resource, which is the world we live in then, you know, without kind of.

293
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:49,959
Connections where people are like, okay, well, we're going to we're going to achieve your goal.

294
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:53,670
And my goal in the same way. And I think that's part of what these programs do.

295
00:28:53,680 --> 00:29:01,120
So they achieve the goal of researchers, which was figure out what prevents drug use and how do we develop it.

296
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:06,279
And the goal of the schools, which is help manage classrooms, help teachers manage their classrooms.

297
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:06,460
Right.

298
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:17,130
So that's the way they they did not talk to those those stakeholders as we have a drug prevention intervention that we want to launch in your schools.

299
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:21,070
It was tell us about what are your main problems?

300
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:29,260
What are some you know and then they they were able to because they had an understanding of sort of the developmental trajectory of drug problems,

301
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:34,450
which, again, the idea is around likes or self-regulation is one aspect of it.

302
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:42,070
And the context helps us shape that regulation. So remember that we talked about like the kind of learned behavior and then the underlying drive.

303
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:48,390
Well, that learned behavior is shaped by context, right to use. So and you can learn both addictive behaviors.

304
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:55,459
We can learn self-regulation behavior. So it's. I mean, that's a little bit random response to your question.

305
00:29:55,460 --> 00:30:01,400
But I think I think part of it is that many things are seen as zero sum.

306
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:07,760
And so they they have their camp and they just want to raise money for their camp or invest in their camp.

307
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:12,800
And prevention, by definition, is like a long game.

308
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:17,510
You know, I mean, like, it's it's literally decades until like, no, if you made a difference.

309
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:21,980
And that's a hard thing to ask someone to invest it when there's problems now.

310
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,719
Right. Because I think that's the other thing is like there are I mean,

311
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:30,680
this is part of why the community mental health centers in American psychosis was such a failure because they were focused on

312
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:39,380
prevention without the acknowledgment that they needed to address the need people being discharged from psychiatric hospitals,

313
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:45,830
where prevention was out of the question at this point, this was not about living like reintegrating and living independently.

314
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:53,760
Other questions. All right.

315
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:57,390
Stick with me a little bit more. All right. So let's talk about let's talk about the legal system.

316
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:09,660
So obviously, this is the editorial, but it's not totally wrong in terms of sort of how when a whole system services relate to the legal system.

317
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:13,320
So so how long have you been here in Traverse City State Hospital?

318
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:17,490
So can you tell us what is what was this place? What is this? What is it now?

319
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:20,640
Now it's kind of just like touristy shops, some restaurants.

320
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:28,250
And I think like in the upper levels they have like kind of Airbnb situations because we ask, Oh, okay.

321
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:32,880
And you say, well, it's not right. But yeah, I think it's kind of just like an old.

322
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:37,470
State Hospital closed down on Thursday. Yeah.

323
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:45,620
So this is a this is a one of our former state psychiatric hospitals that ceased operation in the mid-sixties, like many of them did.

324
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:57,140
And, you know, the the the process by which the institutionalization or the movement of the deinstitutionalization process,

325
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:59,960
which is in some ways not restrictions in some ways,

326
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:06,110
which given the year, you can probably guess that this is occurring in the context of the civil rights movement,

327
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:13,309
the women's and women's rights movement, right, etc. Right. So this is there's a broader effort and broader changes underway.

328
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:20,540
And this is one of the things that is in part that is being discussed in part about that.

329
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:24,330
So again, we have social movements that are happening at this time.

330
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:27,889
The second, though, as I told you when we talked about medications, is like the again,

331
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:37,250
we don't have until the 60 or guess the first antipsychotic medication was it was sort of the mid-fifties.

332
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:41,030
Prior to that time, there were no treatment.

333
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:44,640
There were no effective treatments for psychiatric disorders. Right.

334
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:49,309
Like there were there was no effective treatment for schizophrenia beyond something like therapy,

335
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:55,430
which is generally not going to work unless somebody hallucinations and delusions are under control, which is what an antipsychotic medication does.

336
00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:05,180
We also have the changes we get the advent of Medicaid, which comes online in 1965, I believe.

337
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:10,370
So again, prior to Medicaid, there is no national health insurance plan.

338
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:13,400
There is no way that these that this care is getting paid for.

339
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:19,219
We also are now getting these new government agencies that eventually will become SAMHSA.

340
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:22,940
But what at the beginning is called the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration.

341
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:31,709
And then we get a couple of very important laws. So we get the community mental health center, which is the focus of the American psychosis,

342
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:35,820
reading that you read, and then also the Americans with Disabilities Act, which happens in the 1990s.

343
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:42,030
So it is absolutely the case that this is the number.

344
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:46,800
So this is time on the x axis. So we go from 1934 to night to the year 2000.

345
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:55,530
And the Y axis is the rate of institutionalization in hospital and mental health in mental hospitals in the United States.

346
00:33:55,530 --> 00:34:03,929
And so you can see we have a pretty incredible precipitation decline and the number of people who are hospitalized.

347
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:06,900
So this is all mental hospitals. These are state, county and city.

348
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:12,930
So it also helps illustrate that the vast majority, which is this is what is covered in the American psychosis book,

349
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:20,160
the vast majority of psychiatric hospitals were owned and operated solely by the state.

350
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:33,290
That is, the federal government was not involved. This is why the advent of Medicaid ended up being so devastating, changing the way this works.

351
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:43,470
Because what is Medicaid? This is a federal law that provides 50% of the funding for Medicaid eligible participants.

352
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:43,680
Right.

353
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:52,830
So if you are lower income, suddenly the federal government will insure you and they will pay 50% of the bill and the state has to pay the other 50%.

354
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:59,310
And what does Medicaid say they will not pay for? Psychiatric hospital care.

355
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:05,580
Okay. So they basically say you want money to take care of people who are have behavioral health needs?

356
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:09,720
Fine. But we're not going to pay for hospitalization, which is very, very, very expensive.

357
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:18,810
And so the state literally, like this is this is a like I either take the 50% I have, I, I, you know,

358
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:26,430
take the federal money and then I have to get someone out of a hospital or I let leave the federal money on the table.

359
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:28,830
And I'm on the hook for 100% of the care of that person.

360
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:35,100
And this this is a this was not it was not rocket science to figure out, like, what was going to happen here.

361
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:39,600
So this is again, we get this change happening again.

362
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:46,620
This is covered in the American Psychosis Book. So, again, if you're interested in this, I really encourage you to read read this book.

363
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:54,090
It is really. Both shocking and so.

364
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:02,910
So. The other thing I want to kind of just remind you of is just some of these really important laws that happened that

365
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:09,280
that really shaped what why the status quo looks the way it does and what will close the kind of legal system.

366
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:15,490
So, again, in 1963, this is if you remember, this is before or after,

367
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:19,930
because these you know, I think it's right after we get the construction of these centers,

368
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:30,430
which tend to focus on 1966, we get Medicaid again, which provides psychiatric care for those who qualify, which are people who are lower income.

369
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:36,460
We get Medicare. We get the year before, which is for older adults.

370
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:45,130
We think it's a really important Supreme Court cases. So in 1970, we get Wyatt versus Stickney, which creates again,

371
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:51,879
this was talked about with the presentation of the readings this week around the issue of can

372
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:57,700
you involuntarily hold someone or hold someone without their permission for psychiatric care?

373
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:05,620
And it created the requirement that you have to provide care in a humane and physical, humane environment.

374
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:09,130
You have to provide individualized treatment, and you have to provide adequate staffing.

375
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:16,780
And so, again, this is the setting up the requirement to provide treatment in a hospital.

376
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:20,860
If you are going to hold someone against their will, you must provide treatment.

377
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:25,620
And therefore, if you're not providing treatment, you're not able to hold that person against their will.

378
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:32,110
1981. So this is Reagan. We get Beyonce, 82 years old and one year old.

379
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:34,980
So Beyonce was born. She celebrated her first birthday.

380
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:43,120
Reagan signs these Omnibus Mental Health Systems Act that converts all of essentially Medicaid into these block grants,

381
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:50,109
which is now you get this like 50, 50, 50 split and it allows states to kind of spend the money.

382
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:51,790
It gives them a lot of flexibility.

383
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:56,710
So in terms of how they actually spend the money, because now they're getting a big chunk of money from the government.

384
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:02,290
And the government is like as long as you're you're spending this money on approved services, you can spend it however you want.

385
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:07,779
So that's why the way that Medicaid works and Michigan is different than the way it works in Ohio,

386
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:10,989
the way different than Virginia, except you get a lot of variation.

387
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:16,690
The argument is that this allows states to handle their local populations better,

388
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:21,759
that the flip side of that is that it allows states to do whatever the [INAUDIBLE] they

389
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,840
want because there's no actual standard really in terms of what states need to be doing.

390
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:35,370
We in 1975, we get the threshold of dangerousness,

391
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:45,960
danger to self or others as a requirement to to that which must be a threshold that must be met in order to hold someone without their consent.

392
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:51,990
So this, again, the idea, the unintended consequence of this is that it can again be deferred,

393
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:56,250
difficult to get someone into psychiatric care unless they're immediate threat to themselves or others.

394
00:38:56,550 --> 00:39:00,240
Interesting that this is still being contested, literally. Yesterday,

395
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:05,220
the mayor of New York said they were suspending this rule to now say which I don't know

396
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:10,620
how this I don't I remain I think this is a good thing that like in two weeks from now,

397
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:14,310
you're going to find out this is unconstitutional, because I'm pretty sure there's no way this guy can do this.

398
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:23,729
With what the mayor of New York did is he said that they were going to relax this rule and now say that if you were unable to take care of yourself,

399
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:29,640
some threshold of self care. So not that you're a danger to yourself, but you're just sort of not able to take care of yourself,

400
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:34,260
that they can institutionalize you without your or that you're hospitalized.

401
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:38,790
Again, I want to be clear, it's kind of like how jail and prison are not the same thing.

402
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:45,030
They can hospitalized you. That's a short term sort of thing. And then you could have a longer term hospitalization.

403
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:49,530
But of course, none of that's going to help anything when there's not enough beds.

404
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:53,400
Because there's not enough beds because I don't know if you know that, but that's what that looks like.

405
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:59,940
So there again, this is this is very much being contested and advocates I've been to talks where

406
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:03,900
people really have and we talked about this with Patricia Doyle from Miami.

407
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:13,940
Advocates are really on. There is not consensus as to what what is the best thing here for you as family members

408
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:19,720
of somebody who has a psychiatric condition like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder,

409
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:24,190
they will tell you that the standard is too high. They need something that's lower.

410
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:30,170
They need to be able to get their 19 year old kids because that's when like psychosis is really peaking.

411
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:37,310
They need to be able to get them into care without them being at a risk of suicide, suicidal crisis or homicidal crazy.

412
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:46,639
But then you hear from people who have had very negative experiences within hospitalizations or within emergency departments,

413
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,730
and they will tell you, [INAUDIBLE] no, I will not engage in that.

414
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:55,390
So it is not clear where I should be.

415
00:40:55,640 --> 00:41:07,400
But this is what the status quo is. Now, what we talk about quite realistically, we talked about this when we talked about drugs.

416
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:14,120
We get in 1970, we get this first delineation of legal versus illegal,

417
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:18,260
where we get the first elimination of a schedule one versus a schedule two drug.

418
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:25,489
So schedule one drugs are things that have no medical use.

419
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:31,370
Schedule two drugs to tell you why cocaine was originally scheduled to is now is a good one.

420
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:37,940
But if the you know this we get this first delineation we talked about the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of America,

421
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:41,900
which establishes mandatory minimum sentencing for schedule one and schedule twos.

422
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:46,430
And again, our earlier conversation about how that related to mass incarceration.

423
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:56,629
The other thing I think that makes this challenging is that when that is another sort of

424
00:41:56,630 --> 00:42:03,200
place where mental health butts up against the legal system is when we talk about kind of.

425
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:17,810
The ways in which mental health either is or is not brought to bear as a mitigating circumstance for culpability, for harm.

426
00:42:18,330 --> 00:42:24,620
Okay. So the idea here is that just like forensic psychologist or forensic psychiatrist,

427
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:34,880
the idea that having a mental disorder or experiencing psychiatric symptoms may be a mitigating or even potentially exonerating factor in in the end,

428
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:40,010
if it is related to the perpetration of a crime.

429
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:43,040
So this is John Hinckley, as you may know, what he.

430
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:50,190
But you did my answer to your sorry. So the answer is five.

431
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:53,940
And he. He tried to assassinate Ronald Reagan.

432
00:42:54,890 --> 00:43:00,690
So he was found not guilty by reason of insanity, which I'm sure is not kind of a phrase you've all heard of.

433
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:09,920
Right. And so that again, that that is very that is a defense strategy that's very unlikely to be successful and was successful here.

434
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:17,719
And because it was successful, it was sort of really became very difficult to make this case in the future because this was

435
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:23,260
seen as such a travesty that this person was was found not guilty by reason of insanity.

436
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:29,940
They also they have now. But you can also think about things about whether someone is competent to stand trial.

437
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:35,670
There are Supreme Court cases where people are I mean, in a trial.

438
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:38,689
Such a downer lecture.

439
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:46,850
But like there are situations where people are essentially compelled to take psychiatric medication in order to make them competent to stand trial.

440
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:57,930
Or, you know, so there are there are these these really difficult situations where there's that again,

441
00:43:57,930 --> 00:44:02,250
this kind of the earlier comment about these things are kind of seen a zero sum.

442
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,920
Like either we punish crime or we get right.

443
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:12,510
It's like that's not really the case where these are kind of this is a very specific situation of what's happening.

444
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:22,570
It is also the case that, you know, the United States has the highest number of highest incarceration rate in the world.

445
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:27,290
Is the way it is showing you this per number of people incarcerated in the millions.

446
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:31,610
So in 2016 we had about 2 million people that were incarcerated.

447
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:36,080
And this is our rate per 100,000 adults.

448
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:36,850
Again,

449
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:46,610
coming on the heels in November 1986 is when we get the Anti Drug Abuse Act of America and we incarcerate more than anybody else really worried.

450
00:44:48,920 --> 00:45:02,059
And people have sort of argue that part of the reason why we are this incarceration rate increased at the same time that the psychiatric hospitals

451
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:10,870
were closing is that this is this there was essentially a trans institutionalization that people went from one institutional in this case,

452
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:15,890
psychiatric hospital into a different institution, in this case, the jails and prisons.

453
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:27,210
So but the evidence for this is nuanced and it's inconsistent, sort of depending on how things work.

454
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:38,180
But so what I'm showing you here is this is the rate of incarceration rates from 1934 to 2000.

455
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:44,830
This is the rate of people in hospitals, psychiatric hospitals.

456
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:49,530
Over that exact same time period. And the solid line is the aggregate number.

457
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:53,770
So how many people are in any institution, either psychiatric or prison?

458
00:45:53,770 --> 00:46:02,020
And you can see that the number is sort of at around 700 per 100,000 until about the early seventies.

459
00:46:02,290 --> 00:46:09,609
We get this dramatic decline where there's a period where it's not very few, relatively few people are in any type of institution.

460
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:14,229
And then we get this dramatic increase, except that increase is coming in entirely driven by prisons.

461
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:18,879
And so it's this is the argument of institutionalization or trans institutionalization.

462
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,550
That is it's it's the same issue, but it's a different location.

463
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:35,070
And in fact, people like Stephen Levitt, who's kind of if you're if you follow like economic hot takes, he's like the main guy have no need to.

464
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:37,270
I think he's one of the authors of Freakonomics.

465
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:47,200
I'm pretty sure he's one of the guys, but they kind of argue that that higher incarceration is what drove down violent crime in the 1980s.

466
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:54,250
Now, people don't really think this is a case. And but anyway, so this is part of the argument.

467
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:58,520
And then again. Yes.

468
00:46:58,530 --> 00:47:03,270
So new. Yes, sir.

469
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:12,629
So that again, the presumption the idea here is that that the reason that this number goes up is because the

470
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:17,220
people who are leaving the hospital to go and commit a crime and then they get arrested here.

471
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:20,880
Right. That's the argument that that people like Levitt are trying to make.

472
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:24,000
But that's not what's happening. And, in fact,

473
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:37,650
what we what we think is is happening is that it's not just that low crime is lower because perpetrators are more likely to be in prison,

474
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:41,090
so that victims are more likely to be incarcerated.

475
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:47,610
And so people who are dealing with, you know, if they have they're homeless or unhoused, etc.,

476
00:47:47,610 --> 00:47:51,690
they are much more likely to or they're living in an area that's under high surveillance,

477
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:55,020
police surveillance, because this is the area that's affordable to them.

478
00:47:55,530 --> 00:48:03,030
They're picked up for minor offenses. And so it's not just that people who might commit a violent crime are in an institution,

479
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:07,710
but people who might be the victims of a violent crime are also in those institutions.

480
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:10,919
And so this this is from this quote.

481
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:18,120
So the mental hospitalization and imprisonment rates have an effect through the potential victimization of the institutionalized population.

482
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:23,249
Research has consistently shown that people with mental disorders are far higher risk of violent victimization,

483
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:27,900
that it's being the victim of a mugging or homicide or assault,

484
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:34,410
and that the idea here that a quarter of people with serious mental illness are victims of a violent crime annually.

485
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:42,240
That's 11 times more common than the general population. And so, therefore, the institutionalized populations that is in this case,

486
00:48:42,570 --> 00:48:48,840
the present jail population and the rate of overlap between the current prison jail

487
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:53,670
population and the age where they would have been had the hospitals not closed,

488
00:48:54,150 --> 00:48:57,090
is that these are people who would have been the victims of violent crime.

489
00:48:57,510 --> 00:49:05,120
And so essentially you can drive down the crime rate if you have fewer victims or fewer perpetrators.

490
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:11,490
Right. So this is the argument they make here that it's not just around perpetration, that it's about victimization.

491
00:49:12,810 --> 00:49:23,850
In addition, psychiatric or jails and prisons are not the only types of institutions that people with psychiatric disorders end up going to.

492
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:33,500
So that historically orphanages in the foster care system were very, very common like this as places where people go to work, homes for mothers.

493
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:38,820
There's a very famous, really heartbreaking stories of people who essentially got,

494
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:43,079
you know, women who got pregnant at a younger or even if they were young,

495
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:50,130
just unmarried women who got pregnant and were essentially forced to go and live in these homes and their children were taken from them.

496
00:49:52,110 --> 00:49:57,450
You know, again, the the argument is that many of these women might have been experiencing more before they got there,

497
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:01,680
probably after when their children were taken, experiencing a mental distress.

498
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:11,490
Today in the United States, the stories around nursing homes. So when I was in Virginia, I attended a hearing of the Virginia General Assembly,

499
00:50:11,490 --> 00:50:17,430
where a nursing home was literally shut down during the hearing because it was found,

500
00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:27,389
I guess to be it was found that it was operating as a unlicensed psychiatric hospital to the degree that they could not demonstrate

501
00:50:27,390 --> 00:50:34,400
that the majority of the people who were in that nursing home were there for a reason that is approved for being in a nursing home.

502
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:42,510
Instead, the primary reason why people hear was because of things like depression or or psychosis or things like that.

503
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:48,599
So the they and and you see that sometimes, you know, you look at you think like, oh,

504
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:53,080
somebody's got to be in their fifties or in their seventies, eighties or 90 to get into a nursing home.

505
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:57,210
That's not true. Like that age is not a requirement to get into a nursing home.

506
00:50:57,570 --> 00:51:03,750
Also, nursing homes are not paid for by Medicare. Medicare doesn't pay any money except for short term nursing home stays.

507
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:09,440
30 or so nursing homes are in almost entirely funded on Medicaid dollars.

508
00:51:09,450 --> 00:51:12,800
Medicaid dollars are people who have lower incomes. Right.

509
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:17,850
So that's that is overlap with the population that also has serious mental illness.

510
00:51:18,430 --> 00:51:27,260
So if if you you know, so I guess what I would especially if you were to look at younger people in nursing homes,

511
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:32,370
that she would almost all of those people would have a serious mental illness should be the

512
00:51:32,370 --> 00:51:36,750
primary thing that was that had gone on they may also have some sort of functional impairment.

513
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:41,009
But that that's the that's the primary kind of thing.

514
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:46,970
That why they're being institutionalized. Okay.

515
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:51,229
Oh, and this is from that quote here from the same paper.

516
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:52,940
So it is this is indeed true society.

517
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:58,940
Choose this level of incapacitation and victimization at the very same time, at the very same movement, it chooses this level of freedom.

518
00:51:59,270 --> 00:52:07,100
So, again, the idea that this that institutionalization as a phenomenon is.

519
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:16,099
In the United States is expressed through incarceration, and it's also expressed through some of these other things,

520
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:19,760
which some of them should work more prevalent in other countries than here.

521
00:52:20,290 --> 00:52:27,130
But that sort of when you think about how this relates to what Bruce Lee talked about very first week around stigma.

522
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:31,700
Right. What is the function of stigma? Keeping people down. Keeping people away.

523
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:39,590
Keeping people in. All right. So this is an example of keeping people away of like literally physically away from the rest of the population.

524
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:51,310
So questions about that. First tell you about mental health thoughts. Yes.

525
00:52:51,830 --> 00:53:02,450
I mean, kind of curious, like with the nursing homes, like having like a functional disability and also mental illness,

526
00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:07,700
is there like a common set of conditions that are like co-morbid?

527
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:15,590
What's in this package? Yeah. So they so essentially, you know, in order to get into a nursing home, you have to have trouble functioning.

528
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:19,190
So that's that's broadly usually defined as like.

529
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:29,580
Being able to pay your bills, take your medications, etc., and so someone can have all of those things because their psychosis is not well managed.

530
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:39,510
And so the problem is, is that that person, if their psychosis was well managed, could probably be treated and live in the community.

531
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:44,540
Right. And so versus someone who has late stage dementia, there's there's nothing I can do, right?

532
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:46,610
There's no intervention that's going to reverse that.

533
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:54,959
And so the, the the the thing that so so again, so it's not that they are experiencing functional limitations,

534
00:53:54,960 --> 00:54:02,430
but the the kind of primary diagnosis that's actually underneath the hood of those functional limitations is often psychiatric in nature,

535
00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:06,330
which can is is a place of potential intervention.

536
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:15,330
Nursing homes in the United States are incredibly understaffed. The latest estimate is that 97% of nursing homes are not staffed appropriately.

537
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:19,500
You know, like there's no way that it's like, yes, that is like that's that's like critical.

538
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:26,100
And so it's even worse now. So like, these are these are not places of care.

539
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:32,880
They are not places of care. And so if someone has a condition that we can.

540
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:41,130
Try to care for versus trying to sort of keep people comfortable and try to maximize quality of life.

541
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:45,159
That's a different sort of. You know, I mean,

542
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:51,160
the part of like they're like part of why Medicare pays for short stay nursing homes because they pay for what is called rehabilitation.

543
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:57,610
So you've been hospitalized. You broke your hip. It's not safe for you to go home because you're not able to kind of live on your own right away.

544
00:54:57,610 --> 00:55:02,860
So you'll go to a nursing home or some sort of rehabilitation facility for two weeks,

545
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:07,450
three weeks to get insurance back to like maybe engage in occupational therapy, etc.

546
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:11,770
There is a real valid reason for having this type of institutional care.

547
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:20,080
The the problem is, is that there's so much money to be made in taking Medicaid patients.

548
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:24,920
I mean, this is like I wish I wish this was like not about money, but like this is about money.

549
00:55:24,970 --> 00:55:28,300
Like, most of these, like, nursing homes are for profit.

550
00:55:28,570 --> 00:55:31,870
They're owned by hedge funds. Like that's who owns nursing homes.

551
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:37,890
The United States. It's like Peter. That's like these are the types of people who are like, that's a good investment.

552
00:55:37,930 --> 00:55:41,409
I like what they're doing. That's a good product. So it doesn't have to be this way.

553
00:55:41,410 --> 00:55:44,950
There are other movements, I guess. I'm sorry I'm such a downer. There are like.

554
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:49,899
There's like these greenhouse movements where people have like individual like it's very person oriented,

555
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:55,300
respect oriented where like, you know, the nurse kind of has to knock and say, like, can I come and see you today?

556
00:55:55,350 --> 00:56:02,320
Right. And there's opportunities for actually like for the person having agency versus treating it like a hospital.

557
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:06,070
It's not a hospital where people live in nursing homes.

558
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:14,620
And so sorry, I'm not trying to be more positive, but it's harder.

559
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:21,159
This is this is a this is an area that's really it's really challenging because

560
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:25,380
people don't want to talk about it like nobody wants to go to a nursing home.

561
00:56:25,390 --> 00:56:25,870
We know that.

562
00:56:25,870 --> 00:56:33,730
But then nobody wants to sort of talk about, well, nobody like we don't fund things like home health care that allow people to stay in homes.

563
00:56:33,950 --> 00:56:42,430
Like it's very hard. Like the insurance companies are like notoriously cheap on especially Medicare is inherently cheap on here.

564
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:49,630
So. Another questions.

565
00:56:50,290 --> 00:56:54,340
So like, are you saying also that the people that are living in nursing homes,

566
00:56:54,490 --> 00:57:00,760
they're not there's a situation where they're not being treated for like their psychiatric psychiatric session.

567
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:04,270
And instead of just prolonging their stay because they're not.

568
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:10,180
Yes, of course. And but they are. Those days are being paid for by Medicaid again.

569
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:14,370
And that is that they send the check every month. It's out.

570
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:20,050
Yeah. Oh, do you know, like, I guess.

571
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:31,130
Culturally where so obviously like nursing homes are very prevalent in the US but I guess

572
00:57:31,130 --> 00:57:37,670
like across like different countries and stuff because I feel like part of it is also like,

573
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:44,540
you know, in different cultures there's more of a tendency to care for our elders, especially in families.

574
00:57:45,410 --> 00:57:53,210
Every country has older adults and other countries don't pay for each town like every country has aged homes.

575
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:57,830
They don't all they don't pay for them in the way that we do, which is that you have to.

576
00:57:58,130 --> 00:58:03,050
So it's it's either out of pocket which the average cost of of an assisted living,

577
00:58:03,050 --> 00:58:08,870
a private room in an assisted living facility is something on the order of 3500 to $4000 a month.

578
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:18,040
Okay. So like most older adults don't have that kind of money lying around or they're going to spend down their assets in order to have that.

579
00:58:18,430 --> 00:58:23,079
So it's paid for by Medicaid, which you only get if you are lower income.

580
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:26,410
So people will literally transfer their assets, they'll transfer their house to their kids.

581
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:37,690
So then they don't have a house, you know, and it's just it's so undignified, like how how we allow people to age in the United States.

582
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:44,909
And the and I think the other but I would also say, like, there's a lot of variation within the United States.

583
00:58:44,910 --> 00:58:53,000
So like one of the best predictors of entry of a nursing home is only having boys because women don't.

584
00:58:53,230 --> 00:59:01,660
Often female children are more likely to care for their parents, their aging parents than.

585
00:59:03,470 --> 00:59:07,350
So I have only have one son. So I've told him this and I'm going to be the outlier.

586
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:14,909
So but it's it's it's a really it's a really hard thing.

587
00:59:14,910 --> 00:59:21,180
And, you know, as the whole global population ages, I think it's it just kind of.

588
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:27,490
Becomes more and more of it. It's it's really it's hard because the system is so complex and most people have no idea.

589
00:59:27,770 --> 00:59:32,380
It's like, who's on first? Until they're engaged with the system.

590
00:59:32,990 --> 00:59:36,590
Like, probably everything I've told you about like how nursing homes are funded is like brand new today.

591
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:40,960
Right. Because why would you know, like, why would you why would this be part of your knowledge about this?

592
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:45,820
Certainly. I certainly had no idea when I was in my twenties, like how how nursing homes were paid for,

593
00:59:45,830 --> 00:59:55,010
like what was in nursing homes and what is the financial what is the incentive of a nursing home to, you know, take someone or not take someone, etc.

594
00:59:55,010 --> 01:00:03,379
But like these things there are different and I don't like it's not that every nursing home is this predatory place,

595
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:10,940
but there are predatory nursing homes like these places. They do exist and it is true that most of them are funded by private equity.

596
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:16,760
So I just have to believe that if it's a private equity firm involved in it, like there's probably going to be me.

597
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:20,510
And like I don't think they're really charitable organizations.

598
01:00:21,090 --> 01:00:26,450
You have to make the okay, so this is like switching gears, but I want to switch gears.

599
01:00:27,470 --> 01:00:37,140
I have a question on what what you're talking about related to like so like involuntary institutionalization.

600
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:43,610
Yeah. Because like the criteria for that is if you're an immediate threat to yourself or others

601
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:49,459
and you're talking about how like some of the kids are trying to like change that,

602
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:56,270
especially for people that have that are dealing with like schizophrenic episodes or manic episodes.

603
01:00:56,660 --> 01:01:01,910
So I, I don't know if you know anything about this, but I was just wondering,

604
01:01:01,910 --> 01:01:06,500
like, what is there a, what is an alternative that they're advocating for?

605
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:09,980
Because obviously it's like a very complex.

606
01:01:10,970 --> 01:01:20,400
Yeah. So like Patricia Doyle spoke about this a little bit, but I've heard people like in our state right now, many talk about the idea of, you know.

607
01:01:21,670 --> 01:01:26,890
Not not able to care for yourself, which just that phrase is very.

608
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:31,630
Can be taken by a lot of, you know, different people could interpret that phrase differently.

609
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:35,420
And that's why the threshold is so high, because, again, the idea is like there's a tradeoff, right?

610
01:01:35,450 --> 01:01:42,560
I would rather have someone. I would that's the last thing I want to do is restrict someone's liberty.

611
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:52,350
That's the value. Okay. And so then any you have to demonstrate to me that that value is worth that right, frankly, is worth impinging on.

612
01:01:52,390 --> 01:02:02,629
Right. So the reason I mentioned about so parents in particular, so most you know, most people who develop bipolar disorder or schizophrenia,

613
01:02:02,630 --> 01:02:10,010
etc., or even drug use problems, but even this this usually is not sort of evoked in that perspective.

614
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:18,500
And those things start when you're in your teens. And so at the beginning of an illness, the parents can force hospitalization,

615
01:02:18,630 --> 01:02:25,100
they can force treatment because that this this is net beneficial to the person that they're not, even if it is for sure.

616
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:29,090
She talked about if someone is in a psychotic episode, they do not think they are ill.

617
01:02:30,020 --> 01:02:37,910
They are not going to police nations. They are experiencing threats to themselves or they think those all of those things are real to them.

618
01:02:38,030 --> 01:02:39,710
People are after them. Right.

619
01:02:40,820 --> 01:02:51,830
And so this is why it's and so, you know, and and I think that so that is that's one threshold is like not able to care for yourself.

620
01:02:52,160 --> 01:03:00,080
I think another thing is you can sort of say and another way people have tried to kind of square the circle is to say,

621
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:04,620
okay, well, you can hold someone for a week or two,

622
01:03:04,690 --> 01:03:07,549
you know, because oftentimes the holds are like 24 hours or 48 hours,

623
01:03:07,550 --> 01:03:10,880
like a really short period of time where you would never see a therapeutic benefit.

624
01:03:10,890 --> 01:03:15,450
I mean, that's literally like take a gun away from someone and get them to a safe spot.

625
01:03:15,470 --> 01:03:17,650
Like that's the only thing you're going to do in 48 hours. Right.

626
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:24,620
But, you know, so you can imagine having a lower threshold for like a week and then maybe there's a hearing and an evaluation and like,

627
01:03:24,620 --> 01:03:28,370
is this person, you know, if they're stable enough, are they able to consent to care?

628
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:32,179
Right. But then again, they're in a hospital. Right.

629
01:03:32,180 --> 01:03:40,400
So are they. So I think this is the tension, right, where there's like these two kind of and we don't do this for anything else.

630
01:03:40,580 --> 01:03:44,720
If you have type one diabetes and you don't want to take your insulin, there's nothing nobody can do.

631
01:03:45,690 --> 01:03:49,800
To fix that. I cannot make you take it like you will die.

632
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:55,020
Okay. So like you can. So that's the challenge here, is that.

633
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:04,560
And it is true that someone who is can be in a state of mind where they do not know that they are at risk of imminent,

634
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:10,409
imminent, potentially permanent harm. They do not know that. And so if that were the case,

635
01:04:10,410 --> 01:04:19,260
you should not they should not be allowed to have the same level of influence as to like what they what should happen tomorrow.

636
01:04:20,310 --> 01:04:24,170
And that's where this idea where we get into the forensic, right,

637
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:30,110
the idea that like the person trying to make a decision and so we're going to make a decision choice.

638
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:41,140
There's not an easy answer. She's. There was some good news.

639
01:04:41,890 --> 01:04:51,850
So I started going to the mental health court. And these are these are kind of they're coming off of what we've had for we've had drug courts,

640
01:04:52,750 --> 01:04:57,280
which are another kind of version of this for a very long time.

641
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:02,590
Mental health courts are much more recent. Last like 20 to 30 years. They're much less prevalent than drug courts are.

642
01:05:03,130 --> 01:05:12,930
But things like drug courts and veterans, sports and elder courts, all of these you can think under the same umbrella as a jail diversion program.

643
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:19,750
So these are things where rather than go through the regular criminal justice system where you might be arrested and tried and convicted,

644
01:05:19,990 --> 01:05:24,070
you're going to opt into this alternative path,

645
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:28,670
which in this case for mental health is going to provide you sentence you to treatment,

646
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:36,760
not sentence you to jail or prison, but sentence you to treatment. But that is court ordered treatment, and you must do what the court asks you to do.

647
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:45,430
So that is that. And most of the time, we will encourage you to ask Judge Melville questions after we observe court next week.

648
01:05:46,810 --> 01:05:54,970
You are almost always sentenced to much longer. The Court So you're technically under probation while you're in this court.

649
01:05:55,450 --> 01:06:05,950
Okay. And that probation in the mental health court here is a year most people, if for the crime that they had been arrested for which.

650
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:14,070
Three months probation. So the sentence, the treatment sentence that you would get if you opted out the mental health course as much longer

651
01:06:14,310 --> 01:06:18,700
than the treatment sentence you would get if you just pled guilty to the crime that you got,

652
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:23,390
whatever you were arrested for. So that's that's the downside.

653
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:27,870
The upside is that the mental health court provides incredible wraparound services.

654
01:06:27,870 --> 01:06:35,300
What you're going to learn and you heard from Trish Cortez when she talked about, you know, this is they provide drug,

655
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:39,540
drug counseling, they provide medication management, they provide people with cell phones.

656
01:06:39,540 --> 01:06:43,349
They help people get jobs. They help people get food. They help to people get housing.

657
01:06:43,350 --> 01:06:49,380
Right. All of those social determinants of health they are set up to provide.

658
01:06:50,870 --> 01:06:59,370
And they're incredible. And I was talking to Lily on Monday, so she took this class a couple of years ago, as I mentioned, when she came to visit you.

659
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:04,669
But we weren't able to go because it's coed. And so I asked her if she wanted to come this this week.

660
01:07:04,670 --> 01:07:11,510
And so she said that she's going to join us. But she said it's going to be really hard to watch because it's actually this is that you're

661
01:07:11,510 --> 01:07:17,030
going to feel so good when you leave here because it's at least at the very beginning,

662
01:07:17,030 --> 01:07:18,590
it's possible that they're going to be difficult.

663
01:07:18,770 --> 01:07:24,560
So we don't know exactly what I'll be like, but I certainly that every time my faith in humanity is really renewed.

664
01:07:25,340 --> 01:07:31,650
And they do reduce recidivism, which we learned about again when the presentation of the readings last week when she was on.

665
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:36,440
This was a meeting. So I'll skip this just to kind of get to say.

666
01:07:36,890 --> 01:07:39,590
So this is, again, I guess I should say, like this is an outcome.

667
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:48,770
This is another example in a way of an intervention that is trying to address a problem that is a problem for police, which is recidivism.

668
01:07:49,250 --> 01:07:57,680
Right. And so police don't want to be arresting people for things that that cannot or that are not of the business of the criminal justice system.

669
01:07:59,570 --> 01:08:01,800
Jails don't want to be providing mental health services.

670
01:08:01,820 --> 01:08:09,379
So like, how do we develop an intervention that essentially addresses that need of that stakeholder, in this case, the state health system?

671
01:08:09,380 --> 01:08:12,020
And this is one point. And drug courts work very similarly.

672
01:08:12,020 --> 01:08:21,080
So people are sentenced to inpatient treatment, often, sometimes outpatient treatment for drugs, you know, drug testing, etc., or drug counseling.

673
01:08:21,090 --> 01:08:25,669
So that's another. And actually, most people, if they get access to inpatient treatment for drugs,

674
01:08:25,670 --> 01:08:29,080
it's because they went through a drug court and they were legally mandated to do.

675
01:08:33,460 --> 01:08:39,410
This and a cursory please read that. If you haven't read it already, please look at this before Wednesday if you're able to come.

676
01:08:40,910 --> 01:08:46,010
All right. So the last thing I'll say is, as I told you this earlier, in the class,

677
01:08:46,010 --> 01:08:49,459
Medicaid is the largest payer of behavioral health services in the United States.

678
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:55,790
And as they say, you've got to follow the money. It has a lot of it has a lot to do.

679
01:08:56,150 --> 01:09:00,920
That is who pays for what, has a lot to do with what is offered to whom, when and how.

680
01:09:02,990 --> 01:09:07,130
Even those who do get mental health services, the majority don't receive mental care.

681
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:08,780
We talked about that earlier in the course.

682
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:17,210
There have been substantial changes of since Beyonce's time that have really changed how mental health services are delivered.

683
01:09:17,780 --> 01:09:21,150
There are still state psychiatric hospitals, but there are very few.

684
01:09:21,170 --> 01:09:24,500
There's not enough beds. This is part of what the reading was this week.

685
01:09:25,550 --> 01:09:34,010
Part of the reason none of that is because the the pair of the paper on health care, Medicaid doesn't pay for those types of treatments.

686
01:09:35,330 --> 01:09:39,690
And so you're either going to have private pay or you're going to have them.

687
01:09:41,450 --> 01:09:44,239
We also talked about, though, even if you have private insurance,

688
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:48,590
that doesn't mean you've got it all figured out because of these phantom networks where you try to call the

689
01:09:48,590 --> 01:09:54,680
provider and not all those people on your list or even are accepting new patients or even the right phone call.

690
01:09:56,090 --> 01:10:00,150
Again, not all not all bad news. We did talk about that whilst I'm an attorney act,

691
01:10:00,170 --> 01:10:08,540
but this is something that is just actually now 12 year or 14 years later finally getting implemented into the cross or some of the past.

692
01:10:08,540 --> 01:10:15,499
But then you have to you basically have a decade of trying to figure out the specific rules as to what's actually going to happen with this law,

693
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:19,450
which means that insurance companies have to reimburse the same for mental health conditions,

694
01:10:19,730 --> 01:10:26,240
physical health conditions, and then the expansion of the mental health system, which is important.

695
01:10:29,030 --> 01:10:33,170
And that's why that's that's the end of class. So so hope you heard all of it.

696
01:10:34,460 --> 01:10:40,400
So the testimony. No, of course, I would never tell you. So the last question.

697
01:10:41,350 --> 01:10:45,920
This is not a question of the superintendent, but the.
