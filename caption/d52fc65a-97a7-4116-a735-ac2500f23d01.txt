1
00:00:00,717 --> 00:00:12,717
and welcome to part one of the session on matching, in which we will define the method of matching as used and observational epidemiologic studies.

2
00:00:12,717 --> 00:00:21,717
As a brief outline, first we'll define matching. And then we will talk about how matching is applied in case control studies and in cohort studies.

3
00:00:21,717 --> 00:00:27,717
And then we will briefly discuss the disadvantages and advantages of matching.

4
00:00:27,717 --> 00:00:33,717
Matching is a method that is used to control confounding at the study design stage.

5
00:00:33,717 --> 00:00:39,717
So up until this point, we've talked about confounding and how we control for it at the analysis stage.

6
00:00:39,717 --> 00:00:45,717
But now we're going to focus on methods to control for confounding at the design stage.

7
00:00:45,717 --> 00:00:52,717
So when we are planning and conducting our study and recruiting participants into our study.

8
00:00:52,717 --> 00:00:59,717
I'll quickly note that there are also matching methods that can be implemented to control for confounding at the analysis stage,

9
00:00:59,717 --> 00:01:05,717
primarily propensity score matching. But this is outside the scope of this class.

10
00:01:05,717 --> 00:01:11,717
I'm mentioning it now because you may hear about these types of matching methods that are conducted during analysis.

11
00:01:11,717 --> 00:01:15,717
So I want you to be aware of them so that it isn't confusing.

12
00:01:15,717 --> 00:01:24,717
But in this class, we are going to focus on matching as it is implemented at the study design stage.

13
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:35,717
All we do when we perform matching at the design stage is we select study participants so that the exposed and unexposed groups in a cohort study

14
00:01:35,717 --> 00:01:45,717
or the cases and controls in a case control study match each other with respect to important confounders of the exposure outcome relationship.

15
00:01:45,717 --> 00:01:53,717
We are trying to assess, for example, this simply means that we would match the groups based on age,

16
00:01:53,717 --> 00:01:59,717
sex or other important risk factors for the outcome.

17
00:01:59,717 --> 00:02:07,717
In a case control study, we match on the basis of the outcome so that the controls are matched to the cases

18
00:02:07,717 --> 00:02:12,717
I've depicted what that looks like here in the DAG at the bottom of this slide.

19
00:02:12,717 --> 00:02:17,717
You'll see that I've shown the classic DAG for confounding where we have the

20
00:02:17,717 --> 00:02:23,717
confounder in orange with arrows going in to the exposure and the outcome.

21
00:02:23,717 --> 00:02:30,717
All we do here in a case control study is when we are recruiting our cases and controls.

22
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:39,717
We carefully select the controls so that the values of the confounding variable match those of the cases,

23
00:02:39,717 --> 00:02:45,717
such that our goal is to break the link between the confounder and the outcome

24
00:02:45,717 --> 00:02:50,717
in order to remove confounding by those factors that we have matched on.

25
00:02:50,717 --> 00:02:55,717
You will typically hear about matching with reference to case control studies.

26
00:02:55,717 --> 00:03:00,717
It is more commonly conducted in a case control study than in a cohort study.

27
00:03:00,717 --> 00:03:07,717
And an important note here is that when we perform matching, when we sample for a case control study,

28
00:03:07,717 --> 00:03:12,717
the analysis that we conduct on the data must take this matching into account.

29
00:03:12,717 --> 00:03:22,717
And we'll talk about that in part to. In a cohort study, on the other hand, we match our study participants on the basis of exposure.

30
00:03:22,717 --> 00:03:32,717
What this means and as depicted in the DAG in the bottom, is that when we recruit our unexposed cohort members or my apologies,

31
00:03:32,717 --> 00:03:39,717
we recruit our exposed cohort members and then we carefully select the unexposed cohort members

32
00:03:39,717 --> 00:03:47,717
so that the value of their confounding variable matches those of the exposed cohort members,

33
00:03:47,717 --> 00:03:54,717
such that the link between the confounding variable and the exposure is broken.

34
00:03:54,717 --> 00:04:01,717
So this means the exposure and the confounding variable are no longer associated with each other because we have matched

35
00:04:01,717 --> 00:04:10,717
the distributions or values of the confounding variables to be equal between the exposed and the unexposed groups.

36
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:17,717
And again, this happens at the design stage when we are recruiting participants into our cohort study.

37
00:04:17,717 --> 00:04:23,717
Matching in a cohort study is not as commonly conducted as it is in case control studies.

38
00:04:23,717 --> 00:04:28,717
In fact, you will see it rarely done in cohort studies and we'll talk about why that is.

39
00:04:28,717 --> 00:04:33,717
And another key difference here with respect to matching in case control studies is that ignoring

40
00:04:33,717 --> 00:04:40,717
the match at these statistical analysis phase of a cohort study generally doesn't introduce bias.

41
00:04:40,717 --> 00:04:52,717
But it does result in a loss of precision. In both case control and cohort studies, there are two general ways to perform matching.

42
00:04:52,717 --> 00:04:57,717
The first is individual matching, where we simply match at the individual level.

43
00:04:57,717 --> 00:05:07,717
More specifically, this means that we match cases and controls or exposed and unexposed persons on a one to one basis.

44
00:05:07,717 --> 00:05:11,717
On the confounding factor that we wish to control for.

45
00:05:11,717 --> 00:05:24,717
Through matching. As an example, imagine a case control study where we want to account for confounding by age and by sex, we would recruit our cases.

46
00:05:24,717 --> 00:05:28,717
And then for each case who was recruited into the case control study,

47
00:05:28,717 --> 00:05:38,717
we would carefully select one control from the underlying source population who has the exact same age and sex as that case.

48
00:05:38,717 --> 00:05:42,717
We can also then include other confounding factors.

49
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:52,717
But as you can imagine, the more confounding factors that we wish to match on, the more difficult it may be to perform individual one to one matching.

50
00:05:52,717 --> 00:06:01,717
Because then we have to go out and find one control who matches a given case on a whole range of different factors.

51
00:06:01,717 --> 00:06:06,717
The other way to perform matching is called frequency or group matching.

52
00:06:06,717 --> 00:06:15,717
And what we do here is we match our groups, our cases and controls or exposed and unexposed groups, at the group level.

53
00:06:15,717 --> 00:06:23,717
The goal here is to make the frequencies or distributions of the confounding factors equal between groups.

54
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:28,717
I use the words frequencies and distributions interchangeably. Here.

55
00:06:28,717 --> 00:06:37,717
As an example, again, imagine a case control study where we would want to match the cases and controls based on age.

56
00:06:37,717 --> 00:06:42,717
We would recruit our cases and then we would select controls from the underlying

57
00:06:42,717 --> 00:06:51,717
source population such that their age distribution matches that of the cases.

58
00:06:51,717 --> 00:07:00,717
Let's talk about some disadvantages of matching. Usually it doesn't entirely eliminate the need to control for confounding.

59
00:07:00,717 --> 00:07:07,717
And this is because it's hard to match on all conceivable confounders, as you might imagine.

60
00:07:07,717 --> 00:07:17,717
The other thing is, if we categorize the matching variable inappropriately, there can be residual confounding by that matching variable.

61
00:07:17,717 --> 00:07:27,717
So it matters how we categorize the matching variable. If we for example, if we want to match on age, well, we match on continuous age by year.

62
00:07:27,717 --> 00:07:32,717
Well, will we match on five your age group? Will we match on 10 your age group.

63
00:07:32,717 --> 00:07:33,717
And does it matter?

64
00:07:33,717 --> 00:07:45,717
So it's very important to appropriately categorize the matching variable such that we do not leave any residual confounding by that variable.

65
00:07:45,717 --> 00:07:50,717
It is expensive and time consuming to perform matching at the design stage.

66
00:07:50,717 --> 00:07:55,717
As you can imagine, this means that we need to very carefully select our control group.

67
00:07:55,717 --> 00:08:01,717
In the case control study and unexposed group in a cohort study such that they match the cases and the exposed groups.

68
00:08:01,717 --> 00:08:07,717
So it may take more effort to identify these individuals in the source population.

69
00:08:07,717 --> 00:08:20,717
And so it's a tradeoff between the increased cost and time versus the degree of confounder control that we're able to achieve through matching.

70
00:08:20,717 --> 00:08:24,717
An important point with respect to cohort studies is that matching in a cohort

71
00:08:24,717 --> 00:08:30,717
study doesn't work if there is study dropout or mortality over the follow up,

72
00:08:30,717 --> 00:08:35,717
that differs based on the matching variable we perform matching at baseline

73
00:08:35,717 --> 00:08:45,717
when we recruit the cohort. So the matching only applies to the full cohort before people drop out of the study.

74
00:08:45,717 --> 00:08:55,717
Finally, matching in a case control study induces a selection bias that overrides the confounding bias that it corrects.

75
00:08:55,717 --> 00:09:00,717
We can correct for the selection bias at the analysis stage of a case control study.

76
00:09:00,717 --> 00:09:07,717
But what this essentially means is that matching is a form of indirect confounder control in case control studies.

77
00:09:07,717 --> 00:09:11,717
I'll come back to this and show you the structure that leads to this selection bias,

78
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:17,717
both later in this part of the lecture session as well as in part two.

79
00:09:17,717 --> 00:09:24,717
And importantly, the advantages of matching the primary advantage is that matching increases statistical efficiency.

80
00:09:24,717 --> 00:09:33,717
It balances the ratio of comparison to index individuals in a study across the strata of the matching variables.

81
00:09:33,717 --> 00:09:40,717
This means that our sample size or N is increased for uncommon values or straight out of the matching factor.

82
00:09:40,717 --> 00:09:48,717
This means we need a smaller total sample size in order to achieve precision of our study estimates.

83
00:09:48,717 --> 00:09:57,717
Another terminology or semantics note here is throughout this lecture session, I'm using the phrases straight-A values and categories interchangeably.

84
00:09:57,717 --> 00:10:07,717
All I mean is the way in which we categorize the levels of the matching factor.

85
00:10:07,717 --> 00:10:15,717
In a case control study, the main reason why we perform matching is that it ensures the controls have the same distribution of matching factors,

86
00:10:15,717 --> 00:10:19,717
which again, always should be confounders as the cases.

87
00:10:19,717 --> 00:10:27,717
And this is the primary reason why we conduct matching in a case control study, even though it induces a selection bias.

88
00:10:27,717 --> 00:10:35,717
Let's work through an example. Imagine an exposure confounder combination that has some rarely observed categories.

89
00:10:35,717 --> 00:10:43,717
We may get few cases or controls in that strata without conducting purposive matching.

90
00:10:43,717 --> 00:10:51,717
For example, imagine a case control study that we conduct to address the research question of whether working in tipped

91
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:58,717
the tipped service work industry versus untapped service work is associated with risk of depression.

92
00:10:58,717 --> 00:11:04,717
This is adapted from a real study performed by Sara Andrea and colleagues in the American Journal of Epidemiology.

93
00:11:04,717 --> 00:11:12,717
In the original study, they actually conducted a cohort study which, to be honest, would be the best study designed to address this research question.

94
00:11:12,717 --> 00:11:19,717
But for the purposes of this teaching example, let's imagine it's a case control study.

95
00:11:19,717 --> 00:11:29,717
So people who work in the tipped service work industry are often very different than those who work in the untapped service work industry.

96
00:11:29,717 --> 00:11:38,717
As you can imagine, there are a lot of social and socio economic forces that determine what type of job industry people go into.

97
00:11:38,717 --> 00:11:46,717
And often this starts in early childhood with respect to broader socio economic conditions, access to education,

98
00:11:46,717 --> 00:11:53,717
educational quality and opportunity and ongoing socio economic forces as they reach adulthood.

99
00:11:53,717 --> 00:12:06,717
And so we might consider childhood socioeconomic status or SES as a key confounder of the relationship between tipped service work and depression.

100
00:12:06,717 --> 00:12:19,717
However, we might find that there are very few adults who had a high SES in childhood who went into tipped service work and conversely,

101
00:12:19,717 --> 00:12:25,717
very few adults who had a low childhood, SES and went into untapped service work.

102
00:12:25,717 --> 00:12:30,717
So if we conducted our case control study with no matching.

103
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:38,717
And we recruit cases who have depression and and controls without depression.

104
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:44,717
And then we let the exposure and confounder distributions fall as they naturally would.

105
00:12:44,717 --> 00:12:52,717
We might end up with few cases and controls distributed across all possible combinations of the confounder,

106
00:12:52,717 --> 00:12:57,717
childhood SES, and the exposure, tipped service work.

107
00:12:57,717 --> 00:13:05,717
However, if we perform matching and we recruit our cases with depression and then we very carefully recruit

108
00:13:05,717 --> 00:13:13,717
controls so that they match the cases with respect to their distribution of values of childhood.

109
00:13:13,717 --> 00:13:23,717
Yes, we will then get a increased N or a better distribution of both childhood SES as

110
00:13:23,717 --> 00:13:30,717
well as for the exposure tipped service work between our case and control groups.

111
00:13:30,717 --> 00:13:32,717
So in fact, this achieves two things.

112
00:13:32,717 --> 00:13:41,717
We match the cases and controls on childhood SES, which break this link between the confounder and the outcome depression.

113
00:13:41,717 --> 00:13:50,717
It also increases the sample size across uncommon values of the matching factor, which here is childhood SES,

114
00:13:50,717 --> 00:13:57,717
if that matching factor is less common in the control group.

115
00:13:57,717 --> 00:14:04,717
And the reason why doing this induces a selection bias relates to the definition of confounding.

116
00:14:04,717 --> 00:14:12,717
By definition, a confounder has to be associated with both the exposure and the outcome in a case control study.

117
00:14:12,717 --> 00:14:18,717
Matching on the confounder also makes the cases and controls look more similar

118
00:14:18,717 --> 00:14:24,717
with respect to their exposure because the exposure is related to the confounder.

119
00:14:24,717 --> 00:14:30,717
So in this example, matching the depression cases and controls based on their values of childhood

120
00:14:30,717 --> 00:14:37,717
SES is also going to in turn match them on the basis of their tipped

121
00:14:37,717 --> 00:14:43,717
Service work history because of the relationship between childhood SES and tipped service

122
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:51,717
work as shown by the Orange Arrow going from childhood SES to tipped service work.

123
00:14:51,717 --> 00:14:58,717
And that is the selection bias that gets induced in case control studies during matching.

124
00:14:58,717 --> 00:15:05,717
What it means is that the effect estimate or odds ratio that we generate from the matched case control study.

125
00:15:05,717 --> 00:15:07,717
If we do not account for matching,

126
00:15:07,717 --> 00:15:16,717
we'll be biased towards the null because we have made the exposure distributions look more similar between the cases and controls,

127
00:15:16,717 --> 00:15:22,717
because we have matched on the confounder, which is associated with the exposure.

128
00:15:22,717 --> 00:15:29,717
So you might be asking yourself, why would we even perform matching in a case control study if it induces the selection bias

129
00:15:29,717 --> 00:15:34,717
that makes the exposure status of the cases and controls look more similar to one another?

130
00:15:34,717 --> 00:15:43,717
Well, we do it because, one, it does reduce confounding and it also provides a statistically efficient, stratified analysis.

131
00:15:43,717 --> 00:15:47,717
So we actually can account for this selection bias at the analysis stage.

132
00:15:47,717 --> 00:15:53,717
And I'll show you step by step what this looks like in part two. So in a case control study,

133
00:15:53,717 --> 00:16:04,717
we can consider matching as an indirect form of confounder control that we implement at the design stage when recruiting cases and controls.

134
00:16:04,717 --> 00:16:10,717
As I've alluded to throughout this session, we must account for matching at the analysis stage.

135
00:16:10,717 --> 00:16:14,717
There are two ways to do this that I just want to briefly introduce here.

136
00:16:14,717 --> 00:16:23,717
First is we can conduct a stratified analysis. Basically, what we do is we combine all of our matched sets, whether those are individual pairs,

137
00:16:23,717 --> 00:16:30,717
an individual one to one matching or our groups that we matched on a frequency basis.

138
00:16:30,717 --> 00:16:36,717
We then stratify our analysis by categories of the matching variable.

139
00:16:36,717 --> 00:16:41,717
So, for example, in the previous hypothetical study that I showed you,

140
00:16:41,717 --> 00:16:49,717
we would stratify out our two by two tables for the case control study according to levels or values of childhood SES

141
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:59,717
and estimate straight specific odds ratios for the association between tipped service work and depression within levels of childhood SES.

142
00:16:59,717 --> 00:17:03,717
This is the most efficient analytical approach to analyzing match data.

143
00:17:03,717 --> 00:17:10,717
The other way we can do it is what's called a matched analysis, where each matched pair or group forms its own strata.

144
00:17:10,717 --> 00:17:14,717
So we have lots of little strata here. And this preserves the matched sets.

145
00:17:14,717 --> 00:17:21,717
We will primarily focus on methods for stratified analysis. And that's the end of part one.

146
00:17:21,717 --> 00:17:24,648
The next is part two, analyzing matched data.
