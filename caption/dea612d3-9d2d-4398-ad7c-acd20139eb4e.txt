00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,745
Hey, this is Matt Zawistowski.

2
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:13,455
In this lecture we're
going to discuss

3
00:00:13,455 --> 00:00:16,500
interaction terms for our mixed
effect regression models,

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,570
a modeling technique
you're probably already

5
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,065
familiar with based on
previous regression courses.

6
00:00:22,065 --> 00:00:24,420
In the previous
lecture we introduced

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,440
the group effect to

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,655
the linear mixed effects
regression model.

9
00:00:27,655 --> 00:00:29,780
This allowed us to
model differences and

10
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,845
predicted outcomes between
two groups within the data.

11
00:00:32,845 --> 00:00:34,790
The beta 2 term quantify

12
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:37,685
the difference in intercept
between the two groups.

13
00:00:37,685 --> 00:00:40,115
When parameterized in this way,

14
00:00:40,115 --> 00:00:42,140
the model forces the
regression lines

15
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,090
for each group to
have the same slope,

16
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:46,760
beta 1, meaning that
they are parallel.

17
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,370
The interpretation then
is that the change in

18
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:52,640
outcome over time is
the same in each group.

19
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,240
In truth, the regression
lines for two groups might

20
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,680
not be parallel and we would

21
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,765
want to account for
that in our model.

22
00:00:59,765 --> 00:01:02,030
This situation is
called an interaction

23
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,935
model and the predicted outcome

24
00:01:03,935 --> 00:01:05,540
is determined by the time in

25
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,260
group variables in a
non additive manner.

26
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,910
Algebraically, the
group regression lines

27
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:12,050
are given the freedom to be

28
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:13,760
non parallel by the inclusion

29
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,085
of an interaction
term beta three.

30
00:01:16,085 --> 00:01:18,845
We interpret beta 3 as
the difference in slope

31
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:22,115
between the group 1 and
group 2 regression lines.

32
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:24,710
Let's walk through the
full set of parameters

33
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,380
in the interaction
mixed effect model.

34
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:30,980
As before, the fixed effect
terms beta 0 and beta

35
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:32,630
1 define the intercept and

36
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:35,290
slope of the group
one regression line.

37
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:38,600
The random effect terms
model the variability in

38
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,460
subject-specific lines about
the group 1 regression line.

39
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,720
The group 2 regression line has

40
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,310
an intercept the beta 0 plus

41
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:50,330
beta 2 and a slope of
beta 1 plus beta 3.

42
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:54,200
Again, the random effect
terms allow variability in

43
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,160
subject-specific regression
lines for group 2 members.

44
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,495
Here we can graphically
see how beta 2 and beta 3

45
00:02:01,495 --> 00:02:04,435
define differences between
the group regression lines.

46
00:02:04,435 --> 00:02:06,485
Beta 2 is the group effect term

47
00:02:06,485 --> 00:02:07,670
indicating the difference in

48
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,260
intercepts between the groups,

49
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,210
and beta 3 is the
interaction term

50
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:13,270
indicating the
difference in slopes.

51
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,890
A negative beta 3
value indicates that

52
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:19,070
the change in outcome over
time is greater in group 1,

53
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,800
while a positive value
in beta 3 indicates

54
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,000
that the change in outcome over

55
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,195
time is greater in group 2.

56
00:02:25,195 --> 00:02:27,260
Determining if an interaction

57
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,240
exists in your data can
be accomplished using

58
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,620
a hypothesis test of

59
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,450
the beta 3 interaction
regression parameter.

60
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,920
Note that if such
a hypothesis test

61
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,675
fails to reject the null,

62
00:02:37,675 --> 00:02:38,980
that is, we cannot reject

63
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:41,055
the notion that there
is no interaction,

64
00:02:41,055 --> 00:02:42,670
a mixed model without

65
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,890
the interaction term
should be refit before

66
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:47,110
attempting inference
or interpretation

67
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:49,615
on the group effect term beta 2.

68
00:02:49,615 --> 00:02:52,480
We've now built up
the mixed model

69
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,000
from a single time covariate to

70
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,300
a model with distinct
group regression lines

71
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,715
differing in slope and intercept.

72
00:03:00,715 --> 00:03:03,670
This model provides
much flexibility

73
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,530
when modeling real
data and provides

74
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,730
a framework for testing

75
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,830
various scientific
questions regarding

76
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:11,045
change over time
in group effects.

77
00:03:11,045 --> 00:03:13,150
The interaction term introduced

78
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,740
in this lecture is
similar to that of

79
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,640
the standard
regression and models

80
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,905
the difference in
slopes between groups.

81
00:03:18,905 --> 00:03:20,480
The random effect terms of

82
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,565
the mixed model continue
to be the piece

83
00:03:22,565 --> 00:03:24,230
that accounts for the correlation

84
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:27,829
in longitudinal
repeated measure data.
