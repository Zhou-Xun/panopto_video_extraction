00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:07,201
Hi, this is Peter Jacobson, and

2
00:00:07,201 --> 00:00:12,950
we're continuing with our discussion
of the US health care delivery system.

3
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:16,450
After looking at how
the system is structured,

4
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:19,160
let's turn to how it's financed.

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,720
Who pays for medical care?

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,890
As I suggested during the overview,
it's a multi-payer system.

7
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,445
We have commercial insurance companies,
we have employers,

8
00:00:33,445 --> 00:00:37,310
self-pay, and the federal and
state governments.

9
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:40,540
So let's break that down a little.

10
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,520
Commercial insurers,
Blue Cross Blue Shield,

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,760
Aetna, operate by selling
insurance directly to patients.

12
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,273
You pay a premium for
a specific coverage, and

13
00:00:52,273 --> 00:00:58,030
it's really the heart and
soul of the fee-for-service system.

14
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:03,099
As noted before, you buy your insurance
through a managed care company that

15
00:01:03,099 --> 00:01:08,920
combines the insurance, the financing,
with the health care delivery.

16
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,757
When you buy from an insurance company,
the insurance company will in turn

17
00:01:13,757 --> 00:01:19,380
contract with a network of providers,
physicians, and other specialists.

18
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,640
And you pay less if you stay
within the network, and

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,090
you pay a little more if you go
out of the network of physicians.

20
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:35,560
We are largely, though, an employer-based
system for historical reasons.

21
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:41,660
During and after World War II,
employers began to provide insurance

22
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:47,250
to provide a competitive advantage
in the marketplace for employees.

23
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,660
Right now, it's mostly large employers

24
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:56,460
who provide insurance for their employees.

25
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,922
Smaller employers will
provide some funding for

26
00:02:00,922 --> 00:02:05,285
individuals to purchase
their own insurance.

27
00:02:05,285 --> 00:02:11,578
Others will be on self-pay, that is,
they simply paying for themselves.

28
00:02:11,578 --> 00:02:17,016
And then both federal and
state governments provide insurance.

29
00:02:17,016 --> 00:02:21,217
The federal government provides,
as we've seen,

30
00:02:21,217 --> 00:02:25,512
Medicare and Medicaid,
Medicare for the elderly and

31
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:30,520
Medicaid for
certain categorically eligible people.

32
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:36,000
State governments provide
some funding as well.

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,290
While this chart is a bit outdated,
we still have about 50%

34
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:47,600
of patients covered by their large
employer-sponsored insurance coverage.

35
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,160
Medicaid is probably about 20% now,

36
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:57,530
Medicare about 15%,
with the largest decline,

37
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:02,930
as we noted earlier,
in the rate of the uninsured.

38
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:06,318
What types of policies can people buy?

39
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:12,720
Well, some insurance plans
only cover catastrophic care.

40
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,140
These are high deductible plans.

41
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,519
So in a high deductible plan,

42
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:23,799
the individual pays for
the monthly premium.

43
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:29,910
That's a fairly small amount, but
the insurance coverage doesn't

44
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:34,965
come in until the patient pays
a fairly high deductible,

45
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:38,247
could be as high as $10,000.

46
00:03:38,247 --> 00:03:43,138
The idea is to encourage
people to stay healthy,

47
00:03:43,138 --> 00:03:46,834
and to pay out of pocket, as a copay or

48
00:03:46,834 --> 00:03:51,780
as an out of pocket payment for
primary care.

49
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,370
Some types of preventative
care are provided now for

50
00:03:55,370 --> 00:04:00,550
free under the Affordable Care Act,
and only to receive

51
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:05,620
care if they're severely injured,
let's say, a heart problem.

52
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:10,490
Commercial insurance, as we've discussed,
provides a fee-for-service

53
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:15,140
coverage for a range of acute,
specialized, and non-acute care.

54
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:19,780
Managed care, we've already talked about,
and government plans,

55
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:24,561
we will cover in a few minutes.

56
00:04:24,561 --> 00:04:30,197
So when looking at this in a little
more detail, large employers,

57
00:04:30,197 --> 00:04:37,880
defined normally as those with more than
100 employees, often simply self-insure.

58
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:44,060
That is, they deduct a certain amount
per month from the employee's paycheck,

59
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:48,890
they match it and
apply that to pay for insurance.

60
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:53,890
What they usually do is they hire
a third-party administrator to handle

61
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:59,220
all of the logistics that the employees
have with regard to health care.

62
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:05,028
And then they purchase what
we call reinsurance to avoid

63
00:05:05,028 --> 00:05:11,750
large numbers of people with
really serious illnesses.

64
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:17,513
In this way, they offer group rates,
essentially community rating,

65
00:05:17,513 --> 00:05:21,933
because employees tend to be healthier,
on average,

66
00:05:21,933 --> 00:05:26,850
than people who aren't working,
they can get group rates.

67
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:32,264
And everybody pays the same rate
as function of how much coverage

68
00:05:32,264 --> 00:05:39,175
they want to pay for, and there are no
pre-existing coverage exclusions.

69
00:05:39,175 --> 00:05:43,710
Anyone who is in this large group must be

70
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:48,310
given insurance at the rate
that everyone else pays.

71
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:54,510
What we've seen over the last 20 years is
a movement away from a defined benefit.

72
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:59,492
That is, a benefit that you get
regardless of anything, in particular,

73
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:04,630
a pension, to what we call defined
contributions, which simply means,

74
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,490
you only get what you put in.

75
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,570
And that's particularly important for

76
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:14,120
pensions, because you only
get what you saved over time.

77
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:20,628
For small employers, often defined as
under ten, you don't get many benefits,

78
00:06:20,628 --> 00:06:26,330
and the individuals may get some money
to provide, as far as their salary and

79
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:32,750
benefits package, to purchase
individual commercial insurance.

80
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:37,730
People who aren't covered,
let's say, small businesses, or

81
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:43,760
people who are in three to five person
businesses, own their own business,

82
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:49,770
can buy insurance in the individual
insurance market, but pay a higher cost.

83
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:52,520
And for many,
that's simply unaffordable, although,

84
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,330
as we'll see in a second,
the health insurance

85
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:59,035
changes under the Affordable Care Act
mitigate that somewhat.

86
00:06:59,035 --> 00:07:03,806
Here, it's based on the individual's

87
00:07:03,806 --> 00:07:08,230
health status, so
prior to the Affordable Care Act,

88
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:13,750
there coud be exclusions for
pre-existing conditions.

89
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,840
You could also buy a medical or
a health or

90
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:21,865
savings account, or contribute to what
we call a health savings account.

91
00:07:21,865 --> 00:07:27,510
And it's tax free, so
it's off the top line of your salary,

92
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:33,450
and you put that into a health savings
account which you can use to pay for

93
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:36,116
any medical costs during the year.

94
00:07:36,116 --> 00:07:40,130
For a copay, for a deductible,

95
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:44,520
to meet the deductible, but
the deductible is very high.

96
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:51,110
The idea, again, is to encourage people
to pay for the small amounts of care,

97
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:57,720
the urgent care, the primary care,
and not spend money unnecessarily.

98
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,370
The big change over the last

99
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:04,700
On this decade because of the existence
of the health insurance exchanges

100
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:09,370
under the Affordable Care Act
where you have a menu of options.

101
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:16,150
Some states operate their own, while
others default to the federal government.

102
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:21,002
The importance of the health
insurance exchange

103
00:08:21,002 --> 00:08:25,151
is that insurance compete for business.

104
00:08:25,151 --> 00:08:30,103
One of the concerns initially had been
that large employers would simply

105
00:08:30,103 --> 00:08:35,055
shift their employees to the health
insurance exchanges and remember no

106
00:08:35,055 --> 00:08:40,438
pre-existing condition exclusions
under the health insurance exchanges.

107
00:08:40,438 --> 00:08:41,212
That hasn't happened.

108
00:08:41,212 --> 00:08:44,389
Large employers have not shifted.

109
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:49,508
Some small employers have,
but the real benefit is for

110
00:08:49,508 --> 00:08:57,135
individuals who can now purchase
better insurance at a lower price.

111
00:08:57,135 --> 00:09:02,075
Granted, over the last couple of years,
premiums have gone up considerably.

112
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:08,215
Mainly because young,
healthy people have not purchased

113
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:14,470
healthcare on the insurance exchanges in
the amounts that have been anticipated.

114
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:19,450
Which meant that the pool
must have higher risks,

115
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:23,880
older, less healthy, sicker pool, and

116
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:29,500
insurance had to raise premiums to pay for
their care.

117
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:34,770
As we've alluded to up to now,
the government is

118
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:41,240
an important provider and
payer of healthcare in the United States.

119
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,729
Medicare is an entitlement
program from the elderly,

120
00:09:45,729 --> 00:09:49,935
disabled and
end-stage renal disease patients.

121
00:09:49,935 --> 00:09:56,160
As an aside,
end-stage renal disease can be dialysis.

122
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,920
And it's the only identifiable
disease that's specifically

123
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,570
covered under Medicare.

124
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:07,800
Otherwise, if you're over 65,
you're automatically eligible,

125
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:13,620
if you're disabled at any age,
you can participate in Medicare.

126
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:18,350
Enrollees are responsible for
copayments and deductibles and

127
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:20,170
not all needs are covered.

128
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:27,140
For example, there's no vision care under
Medicare, which is kinda surprising.

129
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:31,200
Doesn't make much sense,
but that's the way it is.

130
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,691
Because Medicare doesn't cover
all the needs, many patients and

131
00:10:36,691 --> 00:10:42,084
most who can afford it,
purchase Medicare supplemental plans,

132
00:10:42,084 --> 00:10:45,740
also known as Medigap programs.

133
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:53,032
And they cover the intricacies where
Medicare doesn't cover a particular need.

134
00:10:53,032 --> 00:10:56,870
Medicare currently has four parts.

135
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:59,673
Part A is hospital insurance.

136
00:10:59,673 --> 00:11:05,219
Part B is outpatient physician services.

137
00:11:05,219 --> 00:11:12,090
Part C is Medicare Advantage, and part C
is really the growing part of Medicare.

138
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:18,219
It's essentially a private sector
alternative to Medicare parts A and B.

139
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:22,268
And the advantage is, not to be punny,

140
00:11:22,268 --> 00:11:29,790
that plans may provide additional
benefits beyond Medicare.

141
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:34,807
While those additional benefits
rarely cover what a Medigap or

142
00:11:34,807 --> 00:11:40,299
Medicare supplemental plan would cover,
some people, I'm sure,

143
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:45,241
could be quite satisfied with
a Medicare advantage program.

144
00:11:45,241 --> 00:11:51,082
The government has subsidized Medicare
advantage as an incentive for

145
00:11:51,082 --> 00:11:54,850
the private sector to
build on this program.

146
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:58,940
The idea being that the more
people who are in this

147
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:02,540
will essentially use less Medicare.

148
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:07,720
And that's important because
there's a concern that with

149
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:13,230
the aging Baby Boomer population,
Medicare won't be

150
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:18,550
stable, fiscally stable,
over the longterm.

151
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:24,050
Part D was enacted under
the George W Bush administration,

152
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:26,800
and it provides pharmaceutical benefits.

153
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,323
Initially, Medicare did not provide for
pharmaceutical care.

154
00:12:31,323 --> 00:12:35,683
It wasn't until about 2005
when part D was enacted

155
00:12:35,683 --> 00:12:40,490
to provide some level of
pharmaceutical benefits.

156
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:44,560
Part D is complicated,
because it covers up to a certain point,

157
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,640
then there's a gap, and
then it kicks in again.

158
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:52,228
So there's lots of attention
in Congress and in part,

159
00:12:52,228 --> 00:12:56,018
the Affordable Care Act
collapses that gap,

160
00:12:56,018 --> 00:12:59,925
the so-called donut hole
in Medicare part D.

161
00:12:59,925 --> 00:13:06,230
Medicare has been a highly successful and
effective program.

162
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:10,953
What's been forgotten is
that when Medicare and

163
00:13:10,953 --> 00:13:17,519
Medicaid were enacted in 1965,
many elderly were very poor and

164
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:22,030
just couldn't afford
any healthcare at all.

165
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:25,910
And Medicare was literally a lifesaver for

166
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:31,120
a generation of elderly,
low income people.

167
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,555
The second major program
the government funds is Medicaid.

168
00:13:36,555 --> 00:13:40,730
Medicare is strictly a federal
governmental program.

169
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:46,010
Medicaid, in contrast,
is a combined federal and state programs

170
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:54,150
where the federal government sets minimum
level of services in specifically,

171
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:58,690
there are certain benefits
that must be provided.

172
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:05,380
They are mandatory, but states can
provide additional optional benefits.

173
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:10,804
Given declining state budgets and
increasing Medicaid costs,

174
00:14:10,804 --> 00:14:15,727
only very wealthy states such
as New York and California,

175
00:14:15,727 --> 00:14:20,261
can really anymore provide
many optional benefits.

176
00:14:20,261 --> 00:14:23,239
The more optional benefits you provide,

177
00:14:23,239 --> 00:14:28,350
the less money is available for
the outstanding Medicaid population.

178
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:33,438
What's happened is that with
the Affordable Care Act one

179
00:14:33,438 --> 00:14:38,526
reason the uninsured have gone
down is that many have gone

180
00:14:38,526 --> 00:14:44,980
on to Medicaid that was expanded
under the Affordable Care Act.

181
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:48,270
And Medicaid operates on a formula

182
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:51,850
that determines how much
federal funding will match.

183
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,399
The minimum is 50%.

184
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,837
The government matches 50% of Medicaid.

185
00:14:56,837 --> 00:15:01,982
Under the Medicaid expansion,
the government pays 100% for

186
00:15:01,982 --> 00:15:05,173
the expanded population for two years.

187
00:15:05,173 --> 00:15:09,980
And then starting, I think,
next year will pay no

188
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:14,690
less than 90% for
the expansion population.

189
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:18,449
There are strict eligibility and
financial requirements.

190
00:15:18,449 --> 00:15:21,645
Not everyone is eligible for Medicaid,

191
00:15:21,645 --> 00:15:26,160
it's really a categorically
eligible program.

192
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:32,510
For example, healthy, non-working
men are generally not eligible,

193
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:36,683
but women with children
are usually eligible.

194
00:15:36,683 --> 00:15:41,780
Many states are now enacting work
requirements, that if you go

195
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:49,250
on Medicaid you have to at least spend a
certain number of hours looking for work.

196
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:57,722
And as I mentioned before Medicaid is
the largest funder of long-term care.

197
00:15:57,722 --> 00:16:03,240
It's really primarily for
lower, middle, and lower income

198
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:09,239
Families who then just spend down to meet
Medicaid eligibility requirements for

199
00:16:09,239 --> 00:16:12,950
long-term care as the largest
user of Medicaid.

200
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:17,280
About 50% of all Medicaid dollars

201
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:21,895
now are allocated to long-term care.

202
00:16:21,895 --> 00:16:26,210
One of the most successful federal and
state programs is the SCHIP, or

203
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:29,910
the State Children's
Health Insurance Program.

204
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:37,430
This provides care for all needy children,
and it has been very successful.

205
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:41,640
The major problem has
been in some urban areas

206
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:46,890
reaching low income families to
have them apply for the program.

207
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:49,760
There are some additional
federal government programs

208
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,230
that are very important,
two of which I mentioned before.

209
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:58,584
One the Veteran's Care, which in
recent years has been an incubator for

210
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:01,585
various quality improvement efforts.

211
00:17:01,585 --> 00:17:06,660
And it's really providing excellent
care to a large number of veterans.

212
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:11,846
Right now one of the problems that
the VA faces is an increasing

213
00:17:11,846 --> 00:17:16,637
number of psychiatric problems
from returning veterans

214
00:17:16,637 --> 00:17:20,244
from recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

215
00:17:20,244 --> 00:17:25,934
The government also provides care for
current service members and

216
00:17:25,934 --> 00:17:29,397
their families, the Tricare Program.

217
00:17:29,397 --> 00:17:34,773
One of the debates about Tricare is,
should the government now provide more

218
00:17:34,773 --> 00:17:40,491
care through the private sector rather
than through any governmental sources?

219
00:17:40,491 --> 00:17:44,905
And then there's
the Indian Health Service which

220
00:17:44,905 --> 00:17:49,860
was set up in 1955 to
provide care to reservations.

221
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,910
And it's been an important source
of care for Native Americans.

222
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:58,880
In addition to the care and insurance,

223
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:04,970
the government is the largest sponsor
of research, probably in the world.

224
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:10,125
The National Institutes of Health
fund some of the most important

225
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:15,947
breakthrough drugs, pharmaceuticals,
and medical device research.

226
00:18:15,947 --> 00:18:19,793
And it's also garnered bipartisan support.

227
00:18:19,793 --> 00:18:22,682
There are different institutes of health,

228
00:18:22,682 --> 00:18:27,602
there's the National Institute of
Mental Health, the National Heart and

229
00:18:27,602 --> 00:18:31,050
Blood Institute,
the National Cancer Institute.

230
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:34,776
They all fund different niches of care, so

231
00:18:34,776 --> 00:18:40,896
the most important research innovations
have come from NIH sources.

232
00:18:40,896 --> 00:18:46,744
The AHRQ funds research
on quality of care.

233
00:18:46,744 --> 00:18:51,806
It's one of the most endangered funding
sources among government agencies.

234
00:18:51,806 --> 00:18:56,231
It's repeatedly on the chopping block for
funding.

235
00:18:56,231 --> 00:19:02,370
But this year, while it took a bit
of a budget cut, it survived.

236
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:06,454
And then the Centers for
Disease Control and

237
00:19:06,454 --> 00:19:13,969
Prevention is really our largest public
health research and policy institute.

238
00:19:13,969 --> 00:19:21,568
And its importance lies in its
ability to build preparedness.

239
00:19:21,568 --> 00:19:26,370
To prevent public health disease,
it funds some vaccine research.

240
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:31,151
And works with state and
local health departments to prevent

241
00:19:31,151 --> 00:19:35,649
the spread of disease to deal
with dangerous epidemics,

242
00:19:35,649 --> 00:19:42,695
such as some of the serious flu varieties,
Ebola, SARS, and other disease epidemics.

243
00:19:42,695 --> 00:19:47,327
So in sum, the healthcare
enterprise incorporates all of

244
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:51,581
the structural elements
we've talked about so far,

245
00:19:51,581 --> 00:19:55,566
the structure, the workforce,
the financing.

246
00:19:55,566 --> 00:20:00,446
But also a lot of activity
in the private sector,

247
00:20:00,446 --> 00:20:04,859
you have startups, healthcare startups.

248
00:20:04,859 --> 00:20:09,609
For example,
One Medical is a new startup dealing with

249
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:14,781
primary care type of concierge
medicine for primary care.

250
00:20:14,781 --> 00:20:19,652
Then you have venture capital buying
up hospitals and managing them.

251
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:23,574
You have venture capital
going into the startups so

252
00:20:23,574 --> 00:20:27,950
that you can have new insurance
providers such as Oscar,

253
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:33,150
that's an online insurance
started with venture capital.

254
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:38,206
Joint ventures are private sector
arrangements, as we've defined them,

255
00:20:38,206 --> 00:20:43,940
combining for-profit positions in
the nonprofit healthcare enterprises.

256
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:48,150
Pharmaceutical manufacturers
are all for-profit

257
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:53,219
enterprises conducting research and
development to build and

258
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:58,480
distribute pharmaceutical products for
all sorts of diseases,

259
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,222
oncology drugs, drugs to combat arthritis.

260
00:21:02,222 --> 00:21:06,694
And then you have device
manufacturers building the stents,

261
00:21:06,694 --> 00:21:12,580
the durable medical equipment, and
again, all for-profit companies.

262
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:17,140
And then you have the entire
healthcare supply chain

263
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:21,710
through private sector vendors and
providers.

264
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:27,043
One other enterprise should be mentioned,
and you may have read about it.

265
00:21:27,043 --> 00:21:34,002
Amazon is now getting into the game in
a big way, sponsoring a new approach,

266
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:39,334
hiring Atul Gawande,
a famous healthcare researcher and

267
00:21:39,334 --> 00:21:43,708
commentator, to build
their new enterprise.

268
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:48,117
So you're getting more competition
from the private sector.

269
00:21:48,117 --> 00:21:54,147
With the idea being that the private
sector operating on a for-profit

270
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:59,869
basis will be able to attack
the weaknesses of the current system,

271
00:21:59,869 --> 00:22:05,691
particularly to provide higher
quality care at lower cost.
