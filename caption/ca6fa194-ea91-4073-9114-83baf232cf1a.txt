00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,601
Welcome to HMP 6 10.

2
00:00:01,601 --> 00:00:05,571
This is cost effectiveness analysis in health and in this video we'll just give

3
00:00:05,571 --> 00:00:09,680
you an overview of the course and some of the administrative details about it.

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,160
So first of all our objectives in this course or

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,166
to understand when cost effectiveness analysis that is inappropriate and

6
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:17,831
how to apply it specifically.

7
00:00:17,831 --> 00:00:21,450
You want to I want you to understand the strengths and limitations of cost

8
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:25,666
effectiveness analysis and other related decision making tools, understand what

9
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:29,840
context they might be appropriate and what they can and cannot answer.

10
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,925
By the end of the course will be able to conduct all stages of a basic cost

11
00:00:33,925 --> 00:00:38,842
effectiveness analysis and you should be able to understand these types of analyses

12
00:00:38,842 --> 00:00:44,040
and be able to communicate how to use them in a policy context.

13
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,340
He'll be developing several competencies in this course.

14
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,461
The first is related to measurement and analysis.

15
00:00:50,461 --> 00:00:55,748
These are a big part of it, measurement, you will be finding,

16
00:00:55,748 --> 00:01:01,540
learning how to find data and I praise the literature carefully.

17
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:05,500
You'll also be weren't building analysis skills,

18
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:10,340
policy analysis skills, how to identify the policy impact and

19
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:14,300
evaluate the policy impact of different policies and

20
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:19,581
then think about how you can make decisions with that information and

21
00:01:19,581 --> 00:01:24,510
with that analysis that you've done the final two competencies or

22
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:27,001
communication and Leadership.

23
00:01:27,001 --> 00:01:31,699
And you will be able to build those skills in this course, you'll have opportunities

24
00:01:31,699 --> 00:01:35,483
to build your written and oral communication in this class and also in

25
00:01:35,483 --> 00:01:39,725
the group project you will be building leadership skills just overall in this

26
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:44,451
course, the first half of the course will be learning cost effectiveness analysis.

27
00:01:44,451 --> 00:01:47,676
In the second half you'll be building on that knowledge and

28
00:01:47,676 --> 00:01:52,120
understanding how these tools are used in policy making contexts.

29
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,711
As I mentioned earlier, there's a term project,

30
00:01:54,711 --> 00:01:56,540
it's a very big part of the course.

31
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:01,186
You'll have groups about four individuals working on these cost effectiveness

32
00:02:01,186 --> 00:02:02,940
analyses, projects.

33
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,250
The first class, we will discuss top project topics and

34
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,539
then submit your preferences.

35
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:11,510
So this is a majority of your grade.

36
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:14,051
You're gonna, there are many different deliverables here.

37
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:16,840
The first is to present those topic ideas.

38
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,875
Then your team will put together a topic description and

39
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:22,480
project plan, put together an introduction.

40
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,852
You present your ideas for your methods,

41
00:02:24,852 --> 00:02:28,670
then you actually write up the method section of your your report.

42
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:33,032
You have an opportunity to review your model analysis with me and

43
00:02:33,032 --> 00:02:36,667
then at the end you'll do your final presentation and

44
00:02:36,667 --> 00:02:41,592
a paper at the very and you also put in a fictitious bonus allocation and

45
00:02:41,592 --> 00:02:45,387
tell me how well your team has worked together and what,

46
00:02:45,387 --> 00:02:51,270
how you would allocate a fictitious bonus to your team matter, Your team members.

47
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:55,104
And throughout the course, I'd like to have meetings with you and

48
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:58,531
your teams to discuss your project and your progress here.

49
00:02:58,531 --> 00:03:03,800
A few sample project topics on this slide here a lot of different ideas.

50
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:08,006
But really a key thing here is that these project topics should have

51
00:03:08,006 --> 00:03:11,237
a comparison between two or more interventions and

52
00:03:11,237 --> 00:03:14,940
one of those interventions could just be the status quo.

53
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:20,091
A good project will have some level of uncertainty about what the net costs are.

54
00:03:20,091 --> 00:03:23,436
So, like the long term costs of this intervention, maybe it's expensive up

55
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:26,522
front, but it might be saving some costs on the line and you're not sure

56
00:03:26,522 --> 00:03:29,781
what the total net costs are also might have uncertain net health effects.

57
00:03:29,781 --> 00:03:35,881
So maybe there's some risk some risks that will reduce some risks that are increased.

58
00:03:35,881 --> 00:03:38,880
And we're not sure what the net impact is over the long term.

59
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,695
Or maybe you're certain about the costs are certain about the effects but

60
00:03:43,695 --> 00:03:49,150
you're not you're uncertain about what the ratio of cost to benefits might be.

61
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,120
So a good project,

62
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,261
we're trying to answer a new question that we don't already know the answer to.

63
00:03:54,261 --> 00:03:58,625
So it's good to have a project where you're not sure what the ratio of cost to

64
00:03:58,625 --> 00:03:59,840
benefits is.

65
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,720
And then finally a good project has at least some level of data.

66
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,718
Could be maybe one or two publish reports,

67
00:04:05,718 --> 00:04:11,070
peer reviewed reports on how effective some sort of intervention might be.

68
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:16,670
That's that's nice to have You don't have to have data for everything.

69
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:20,819
We will be learning how to deal with that uncertainty and

70
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:24,801
explore sensitivity analysis to to deal with cases.

71
00:04:24,801 --> 00:04:27,351
We don't have all the data we'd like to have, but

72
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:31,640
you should have at least a little bit of data to build upon to do the analysis.

73
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,770
And with that, I'll stop with this video.

74
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:34,303
Thank you.
