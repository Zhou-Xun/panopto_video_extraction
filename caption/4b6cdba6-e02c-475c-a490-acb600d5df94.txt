1
00:00:09,447 --> 00:00:10,079
In this module,

2
00:00:10,079 --> 00:00:13,520
I'll be providing you with an introduction
to what we'll cover in Public Health 514.

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,930
So the course is divided into four units.

4
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:22,160
And in this first unit, we have four
different sections or subtopics.

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,442
The first one we'll cover will just
be an introduction to environmental

6
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:26,357
health sciences and

7
00:00:26,357 --> 00:00:30,303
to the exposure-disease model, which is a
topic we're going to return to frequently.

8
00:00:30,303 --> 00:00:34,089
The second section is key topics in
environmental health sciences and

9
00:00:34,089 --> 00:00:36,095
also environmental health policy.

10
00:00:36,095 --> 00:00:40,088
The third section is systems thinking and
environmental health.

11
00:00:40,088 --> 00:00:41,415
And then in the fourth section,

12
00:00:41,415 --> 00:00:44,624
we're going to talk about key environments
that I've mentioned previously.

13
00:00:44,624 --> 00:00:49,190
And we're going to focus in
specifically on the workplace.

14
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:52,100
So in this first section,
introduction to EHS and

15
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,110
the exposure-disease model, we're going to
talk about a number of different things.

16
00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:00,162
I'll introduce you to some of the basic
terminology that we use in EHS.

17
00:01:00,162 --> 00:01:04,272
We're going to sort of return repeatedly
to the exposure-disease model.

18
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:07,230
I'm going to introduce you
to some seminal events,

19
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:09,564
sort of defining moments
in environmental health.

20
00:01:09,564 --> 00:01:13,863
We'll talk about certain types of
hazards that are out there around us and

21
00:01:13,863 --> 00:01:18,180
also pathways and routes of exposure for
environmental health hazards.

22
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,580
So that's what talk about.

23
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:23,303
What you're actually going to do are
answer some questions that hopefully will

24
00:01:23,303 --> 00:01:27,152
make this exposure-disease model a little
more personal and apparent to you.

25
00:01:27,152 --> 00:01:29,048
You're going to map out pathways and

26
00:01:29,048 --> 00:01:33,370
routes of exposure to an example hazard
that you could come into contact with.

27
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:37,966
And finally, you'll use something called
The Toxic Release Inventory to identify

28
00:01:37,966 --> 00:01:40,300
hazards in your own hometown.

29
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:44,307
Now in the second section, we're going to
talk about environmental policy,

30
00:01:44,307 --> 00:01:48,198
how we can evaluate the impact of
environmental policy on public health.

31
00:01:48,198 --> 00:01:52,467
And we'll focus in specifically on
a single environmental policy just to get

32
00:01:52,467 --> 00:01:55,450
more depth about a particular topic.

33
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:56,340
That's what we'll talk about.

34
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,870
What you're going to do are describe the
impacts of different policy approaches to

35
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:05,279
two major environmental health issues,
air pollution and water pollution.

36
00:02:05,279 --> 00:02:09,760
In section three, we're going to
learn about what systems thinking is.

37
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,490
You may be uncertain at this point.

38
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,250
Don't worry, we'll get you there.

39
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,150
We're also going to talk about
how systems thinking tools can

40
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,423
be applied to environmental
health hazards.

41
00:02:18,423 --> 00:02:22,253
And you're actually going to do that
application for an example hazard.

42
00:02:22,253 --> 00:02:26,777
And we're also going to sort of stretch
you and press you to identify types of EHS

43
00:02:26,777 --> 00:02:32,880
information you need to properly go about
employing these systems thinking tools.

44
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,150
And finally in section four,

45
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,848
we're going to delve into the first of
our key environments, the workplace.

46
00:02:37,848 --> 00:02:39,975
So I'm going to give you
an introduction to occupational health.

47
00:02:39,975 --> 00:02:43,908
We'll talk about hazards that
workers face in their workplaces and

48
00:02:43,908 --> 00:02:47,595
some of the outcomes that
unfortunately they may experience.

49
00:02:47,595 --> 00:02:49,881
We'll talk about the agencies
who are responsible for

50
00:02:49,881 --> 00:02:51,130
keeping those workers safe.

51
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:54,287
And finally,
we'll talk about how to control or

52
00:02:54,287 --> 00:02:56,528
reduce hazards in the workplace.

53
00:02:56,528 --> 00:03:00,013
You're actually going to spend some
time identifying possible ways that we

54
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:03,447
could control occupational hazards
using the knowledge that you have.

55
00:03:03,447 --> 00:03:06,259
And I'm going to have you look
at a series of photographs and

56
00:03:06,259 --> 00:03:11,920
ask you to identify hazards that you might
see in different types of workplaces.

57
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,940
So by the end of unit 1,

58
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:15,810
you're going to have an understanding
of the basic concepts of EHS.

59
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:20,427
You're going to be able to describe
some of the policy approaches that

60
00:03:20,427 --> 00:03:25,370
we've tried to use to handle,
manage, or reduce EHS issues.

61
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:29,830
You'll understand how systems thinking
approaches can be applied to specific

62
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:30,700
EHS problems.

63
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:34,905
And you'll understand the vital importance
of occupational health within the broader

64
00:03:34,905 --> 00:03:37,771
context of public health.
