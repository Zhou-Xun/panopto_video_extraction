1
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:07,380
All right. So first thing I want to talk about was office hours.

2
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:11,220
So I had said that we were still working on the potential times for doing office hours.

3
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,660
So what do what do people think about these office hours?

4
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:20,790
So I will tell you that getting space in space is very difficult right now.

5
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,310
I was able to get I wanted to do 2 hours.

6
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,110
I was only able to get an hour and a half of time on Wednesday.

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,370
It sounded like that would work. Well, 1:00 to 230 for most people.

8
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,090
This is a room with a whiteboard, plenty of space.

9
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:42,450
It's like a classroom, essentially. So, you know, I can I can do some things in there that I can't do up here.

10
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:49,340
The other things we were we were suggesting was this evening zoom office hours.

11
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,770
So that way you don't have to like physically be at space to get help.

12
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,700
If you've got a five minute question, you pop on Zoom for 5 minutes and get your question answered.

13
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:08,960
So Rachel was suggesting doing that on Monday evenings, 5 to 7 in Morgan, doing after essentially after this class on Tuesdays, 115 to 315.

14
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:14,200
So we're working on finding a room there. Do do you have a class like right after this one?

15
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,120
Most people. So would that be doable? Okay.

16
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:25,680
So homeworks are usually going to be do on Thursdays or you know, if I have to give like a day extension to Friday or something usually.

17
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,399
And then you have labs on Thursday and Friday. So that's why we're avoiding Thursday and Friday.

18
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,590
We're trying to give you Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday to talk to us about homework and then it's due on Thursday first.

19
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:41,280
And that sounds good. If any any issues speak now if if you want to come talk to me after.

20
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:46,800
That's totally fine as well. But, you know, unless I hear any major objections, this is what we'll go with.

21
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:54,060
Sounds like it works for most people at least one time. And then, as I said, just finding room and speech can be difficult right now.

22
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:04,720
All right. So here's here's our our actual content that we're going to finally start for this class.

23
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,469
And it's about reading and understanding research articles.

24
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:20,170
And so I'm sure you have seen something you've been presented something about research articles before, so you've read some research articles.

25
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:25,479
So I've sort of modified this class over the last several years based on like feedback of what

26
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,450
people have already seen and things that people weren't aware of when it came to research articles.

27
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:34,350
So there might be a little bit of overlap with things you've seen before.

28
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,200
So I apologize in advance, but I will try to present some things that are that are also new.

29
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:48,940
You know, again, I use this word demystified because I feel like when I was an undergraduate, when I was starting out as a graduate student,

30
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:55,330
I did feel like a lot of research and the whole publication process was quite mysterious, didn't quite understand what was going on.

31
00:02:55,630 --> 00:03:01,660
And you learn a lot by going through it yourself. And so I'll bring up some of these things here, things I want to focus on today,

32
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:07,620
like the basic structure of research articles, why they exist in that structure, how they are pretty important.

33
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:13,360
I'm going to show you some examples of where myself where I got dinged for them for not being adhering to that structure.

34
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:20,440
You know, important questions you should be asking when you talk about a journal and article metrics, right.

35
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:26,740
So that when you look at an article, right. Just because it's published doesn't mean, you know, that that these things are all equal, right?

36
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:31,180
That they're all fantastic, great pieces of work that are that are getting people's attention.

37
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:37,870
I talk a little bit about the article submission process, focusing on some things that maybe you weren't aware of.

38
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:43,710
Also do some comparison of content in research articles, the mass media articles.

39
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,030
That's what I had you read a couple of papers for.

40
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:53,080
And so at the end of this, what I'd like you to be able to do is have a little bit better ability to do critical evaluation of research articles.

41
00:03:54,310 --> 00:04:00,280
Please remember that this one class is never going to have you prepared to be an expert at things like research,

42
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:05,140
like understanding research articles, the research process, the publication process.

43
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:11,680
Right. It's just a glimpse into it. Right. But I do think and I hope that this lecture can be a bit of a guide,

44
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:18,730
specifically the parts of the research paper that can help you with that article critique at the end of the semester.

45
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,750
So I'll include this picture right here,

46
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:30,190
which I came across a while ago that I think is it's kind of funny and it talks about this science news cycle, right?

47
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:37,239
And it starts with a researcher up here having a a conclusion that they found by doing work.

48
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:42,300
And it's, you know, it's it's it's complicated, right? There's there's some correlation here.

49
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:49,959
It's like if you remember correlations from stats to 50, you know, a correlation of 0.56, that's not like a perfect correlation or anything.

50
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:56,650
Right? And then there's also given C, assuming the under E conditions where there's a lot of like caveats that go towards this results.

51
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:04,409
Right. And so, you know. Universities will often try to take credit for all the research that's done at their university.

52
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:08,370
Right. They want to advertise. It makes them look good, so they announce it.

53
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:12,150
Maybe those announcements get picked up by some kind of news wire.

54
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:16,380
Some like mass media goes on the Internet.

55
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:20,230
Right. And who knows what kind of interest stories get taken here.

56
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:24,420
And scientists out to kill us again. Shows up on the news.

57
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:31,710
So even the local you know, the national news, the local news, and then this one of your grandma, I'm wearing this to ward off something.

58
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,330
Right. So the idea here is that somewhere in this process, right, the message has been lost, right?

59
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:40,110
What the actual results was. And it's been it's been lost somewhere.

60
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:47,550
So just a start. But like, for better or worse, mass media distributes the scientific information to the general public.

61
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:56,360
And often those things are focusing on the results. The media focuses on the results and, you know, potentially misstating or misinterpreting them.

62
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:01,859
Right. It, you know, especially depending on and on biases that might exist within those entities,

63
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:07,200
you know, they might be misusing them for purposes they were not originally intended for.

64
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,530
So we'll look and get lost in translation. Right. And then in part, you know, sometimes it's on purpose, but sometimes it's just,

65
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:16,769
you know, inadvertent, it's honest mistakes because this stuff is complicated.

66
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:26,850
Science is complicated. But what we want to do is understand why the things that show up in research articles allow for a more critical evaluation.

67
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:34,170
Right. So things like study design, the strength of the evidence, the measurements of the effect, what the limitations of the study are.

68
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,889
Those are some of the things that show up in primary scientific publications.

69
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:42,120
Right. That that often don't get reflected in these media articles.

70
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:53,120
So, you know, before we, you know, trash all mass media articles, you know, what might be a reason to jump to the second bullet point first,

71
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:58,879
you know what might be a reason or a value of having research reported in mass media articles?

72
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,630
What you think? Yeah, right.

73
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:07,670
What are what are they good at? Right. They're good at broadly disseminating information.

74
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,900
Right. That's not what researchers are often good at.

75
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:15,959
Right. Although they're getting better at it. Right. With things like Twitter and the Internet.

76
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,230
Right. Researchers can actually reach broader audiences than they ever could before.

77
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:26,670
Right. So what else? Yeah, right.

78
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:29,690
I mean, it's pretty complicated. I go look at a journal article. It's very complicated.

79
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:38,560
Right. And so we're kind of relying on the, the the the writers of those articles to sort of synthesize some of that information for us.

80
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:46,130
Right. I mean, how often so again, how often do you when the things you learn about science, do you go immediately to a journal article?

81
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,860
I don't. Right. I got I got to read something. Right.

82
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:54,739
I mean, you know, advances in physics and medicine and stuff like I it's a very difficult time going and reading that.

83
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,960
Right. So that's one of the benefits. Right.

84
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:05,870
And so, you know, why might we want to read the primary research paper in addition to in addition to or instead of the mass media article?

85
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:13,100
That's what we'll get into now, right? It's this ability to do a critical evaluation by focusing on details that are not just the results,

86
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:17,479
not just the main story of what the authors are saying, but how did they get there?

87
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:27,230
Right. What data did they get and be able to get there? And so in preparation for today's class, I asked you to read two short articles.

88
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:35,300
One was an article from from CNN with the headline was Just one dose of the HPV vaccine may protect against infection.

89
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:43,520
And then the other was the actual primary paper research paper that came from JAMA Network open as a short form paper.

90
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:47,690
So let's do a this is this is our test run with the minute paper.

91
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:54,320
Okay. So what I need you to do here is go to this link right here so you can either have it in the slides.

92
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:59,570
If you're on the canvas site, you can go directly to it under assignments.

93
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:06,020
If you're on the the page for this lecture for canvas site, there should be a link to it.

94
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:11,660
But you should be able to open this up. And all I'm asking you to do is based on your reading, you know.

95
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:19,260
I told you to think about comparing them, right? What's one piece of information not provided in the.

96
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:24,230
CNN article that you would want to evaluate the study.

97
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,590
Okay. Yeah. I'm assuming you've read this.

98
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:40,610
And then, you know what's one extraneous piece of information included in the CNN article that does not support the headline rights there,

99
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:45,830
but doesn't really have anything to do with the specific headline. So just take a minute.

100
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:50,360
Right. These are remember, these are just to get you thinking.

101
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:55,110
They are participation measurements, right.

102
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:58,700
Just to make sure you're you're following along with the course bullet points.

103
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:04,870
Totally fine on this kind of thing. Just jot down some ideas.

104
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,470
Anybody having a problem accessing the minute paper that's working.

105
00:10:12,590 --> 00:11:05,770
Okay. Good. Start.

106
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:09,819
Finish up. Now. Unfortunately, people everywhere.

107
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:16,530
It's not working for me. What I would have done was I would have primed you with this and I would have asked you then to send up a response.

108
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,600
What's one piece of information not provided in the CNN article?

109
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:26,770
So what I would ask you to do is maybe just jot down somewhere, you know, on a piece of paper, write a note on your computer,

110
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:33,580
or if you are, have a good memory, it just stowed away in your memory because we'll come back to this.

111
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:41,450
I was going to capture these here and then come back to them later. All right.

112
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:46,570
So take another 30 seconds or so to finish this. Remember, not looking for anything to like.

113
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:51,889
They just want to know that you've you've done the readings that you're paying attention to the lecture,

114
00:11:51,890 --> 00:12:14,950
and that you're keeping yourself on track with the course. All right, 10 seconds.

115
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:25,579
Finish up, hit submit and then please eyes back up here so we can carry back on with the lecture.

116
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:31,900
Right. Yes.

117
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,820
Give me some eyes. It's my eyes. Mostly ice.

118
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:43,440
So carrying on. All right. So this this idea of critical evaluation, what we can do with it, right?

119
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,899
So, you know, there's lots of different ways to to think about critical evaluation, I would say,

120
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:52,440
goes back to what the guy back there said when we were talking about the media articles.

121
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:58,740
You know, when you read one of those media articles about some kind of scientific finding, you're kind of taking the author's word for it, right?

122
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:04,860
It's like, hey, this person's interpreting what they're seeing and they're explaining it to me and I'm sort of taking their word for it.

123
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:11,819
I think when we do a critical evaluation, the idea is that we are actively involved in trying to determine if what's been

124
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:16,590
done is is good and proper right instead of just taking the author's word for it.

125
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:22,379
Now we have more information and this idea of act being actively involved in reading it, right?

126
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:25,680
So understanding and questioning, I think that's important.

127
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,870
Questioning how the researchers perform.

128
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:35,909
The study that how researchers perform the study is very important because we can't necessarily believe the results or the impact of the results

129
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:43,500
unless we know how the researchers perform the study and then being able to see the results ourself and then being able to interpret them ourselves.

130
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,770
Right. So as you said, media reports will typically just focus on the results, the potential applications,

131
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:54,929
those potential applications or what are often, you know, trumped up and maybe not as grand.

132
00:13:54,930 --> 00:14:02,040
Right. I noticed this when I got into genetics and I read these like media articles on genetic findings and it's like, oh, my gosh,

133
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:08,610
there's such a such a long way from what they're saying, this results could actually be used for from what the result actually is.

134
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:17,910
And so research articles, because they provide so much detail on how the actual study was performed, we can do this a critical evaluation.

135
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:25,740
And so it's key is that there's a specific format, right, that most research papers follow that allow us to aid in that critical evaluation.

136
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,690
So I was going to briefly walk through.

137
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:32,399
So again, this is something that in my experience teaching this class, a lot of people are already familiar with.

138
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:39,810
So I'm like, I spend too much time on it, but please ask questions, you know, if, if, if anything doesn't make sense, need clarification.

139
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:48,509
So the first part of the of scientific papers here is, you know, a sort of beginning part that has the title of the paper.

140
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:57,989
The author is the abstract and the keywords. And so what's important here is that specifically things like the keywords are

141
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:01,650
important for how your paper is going to get indexed when people search for it,

142
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,290
how it will be found by readers. Okay.

143
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:13,769
So the keywords are pretty important for if people go searching for your paper and then in even in the abstract and in the title,

144
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:17,610
there's always this trade off of technical details versus broad appeal, right?

145
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:23,040
You want to make your paper so that, you know, this initial look at it, many people can understand what it is,

146
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:29,190
but there's got to be some technical details that experts will be like, okay, this is a paper that's worth paying attention to.

147
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,310
I mean, I've written a paper here involved in writing a paper.

148
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:41,680
Quite a few people. It's brutal. Process can take a long time, I assure you.

149
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:46,190
Some of my travails up here and it's constantly changing.

150
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:48,650
And that's one of the things I'll point out here as well.

151
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:54,290
So so something that's like, you know, often understated how important it is, I think is an abstract, right?

152
00:15:54,290 --> 00:16:01,939
So an abstract is approximately 250 words summary of the research article, although these are starting to get a little bit shorter in some cases.

153
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:05,030
The most recent one I just wrote was only allowed to be 150 words.

154
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:10,940
150 words is actually not a lot of text. Or describe something that you've spent potentially years working on, right?

155
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:14,809
Medical journals often break up the abstract into subsections.

156
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:18,590
I'll show you an example of that. I don't know. Maybe these have too much.

157
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:21,890
Not enough time writes the needed chunk for them, but it actually is.

158
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:31,430
I find it quite helpful the way they do it, and it should provide quite a bit of information to help the reader understand what they're getting into.

159
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:31,790
Right.

160
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:40,130
And so I would say, you know, as the reader of a paper, your hope is that the abstract provides enough information to know if that paper's relevant.

161
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:47,540
Right. So as you do this yourself in your own career, you know, it's not just like you search for something in Google or PubMed,

162
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:52,250
and then every paper that comes up, you're going to give that a full look through, right?

163
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:56,990
It's usually like a quick flyby. You're like, okay, is this to going to be useful, right?

164
00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:01,370
And so you want to know that abstract is your key to knowing whether that paper is something,

165
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:04,790
you know, you should click on to get the full version, maybe download the PDF.

166
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:08,840
And so again, think about it that if you're the writer of the paper,

167
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:13,610
that's like the first impression of your paper and your research to the readers, right?

168
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:20,750
So doing a crummy job on the abstract means that you're not drawing people in to look at your paper and potentially use it.

169
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:25,610
And somebody mentioned this to me when I was a student, and it did kind of blow my mind, right?

170
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:30,740
Like most readers are never actually going to get beyond your abstract. The read your abstract to go, I don't need this.

171
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:36,680
Right? So if you want to get them beyond that, you'd better make your abstract count so that it can it can really draw attention.

172
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:43,250
So as I said, you know, the world of journals and journal articles is constantly changing.

173
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:47,300
So I just added this slide yesterday because this was something that was new to me.

174
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:52,430
I have a paper that was accepted last week after a long, grueling process,

175
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:59,720
and they asked me if I wanted to make a graphical abstract, a video abstract, if I wanted to record a podcast for it.

176
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:05,320
And I was like, Oh, my gosh, where did all these come from? Right. So these are newer forms of abstracts, right?

177
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:11,120
And so, you know, this is the explanation that came from Cell Genomics, which is the journal where it's at.

178
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:18,140
You can read it about this graphical abstract. It said it should describe the context and significance of the work for a broad readership.

179
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:23,029
The goal is to highlight the major advances in the paper without without in order

180
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:27,200
to attract the attention of the non-specialist without including extensive detail.

181
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:32,569
So I passed on the video abstract in the podcast, but I did create a graphical abstract.

182
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:38,590
Okay, so this is the graphical abstract that I created. So yeah, I mean, this was something new for me, right?

183
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,700
And so, you know,

184
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:48,650
this is about the Michigan Genomics Initiative Biobank that I mentioned here at U of M and we're just trying to get across this idea of,

185
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:53,480
again, quickly without having people read it, using this combination of short text and and pictures.

186
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:57,440
Right. Who is the size of the Biobank right now?

187
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,380
How people are recruited, what this storage,

188
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:07,880
what what kind of bio samples are stored and what kind of genetic data we have where the clinical information comes from

189
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:14,630
some key facts that we have sort of an enrichment of cases for for many diseases and in our Michigan Genomics initiative.

190
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,570
And then what kind of statistical analysis we've done so far.

191
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:23,060
So this is just new ideas that are being put out there on how to be able to disseminate research.

192
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:31,549
Right. And so I said, you know, I think that research is getting better at that broad dissemination than it used to be, right where you were.

193
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,950
Basically, like your only option was to go to a paper.

194
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:39,140
Now you've got something again, like these podcasts and stuff that might be a little bit better at helping spread the message.

195
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:48,180
And I want you to emphasize how much information can actually show up in the abstract and the things that you know,

196
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:52,200
what I say when you look at it and you're trying to decide, is this paper useful for me?

197
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:57,120
Is it helping me for what I'm trying to do? You know, what kind of things should you be looking for?

198
00:19:57,150 --> 00:20:00,240
Well, obviously, whatever the general problem or research question is,

199
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:07,200
but that's probably how you landed on that paper because you Google that or something very important and something

200
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,900
that I want you all to start thinking about and we're going to spend a couple of weeks talking about is study design.

201
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:21,540
Study design is very important because it helps to play into how believable are the results, how much evidence is actually being presented.

202
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:27,570
And so we'll talk about this hierarchy of evidence that's going to be coming up when we talk about study design.

203
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:32,160
So particular, is this study experimental? Is it observational?

204
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:35,910
Know what was the data that was actually used? Was it primary data?

205
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:39,420
Was the data collected just for this study? Is it secondary data?

206
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:43,800
Was this data that was being sort of recycled or reused for the purposes of this study?

207
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,820
Is it appropriate? Is it the ideal study design?

208
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:54,030
Okay. So that's something that I think, again, especially when I was an undergrad, I would have skipped right over.

209
00:20:54,360 --> 00:21:01,019
But I think this is something I want you to start paying more attention to. What about the primary exposures and outcomes being studied?

210
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:06,569
You know, what specifically did they did the researchers measure what population is being studied?

211
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:11,880
Right. Any kind of demographic information you can get? Of course, major results are highlights.

212
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,050
And then also, you know, depending on your specific field or what you work in,

213
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:22,620
you might be looking for very specific things that help you understand, you know, is this in the area you're interested in?

214
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:28,290
So, for example, like I do a lot of molecular biology, so I'm always interested like, okay, what's the technology they're using here?

215
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:34,079
Are they using some like cutting edge technology? And so, you know, that is what adds value to the papers.

216
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,390
This maybe an older technology but in a larger sample or something to.

217
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:49,079
So as a as I said, I think I would I would like to see you start thinking about study design potentially a little bit more than you've done in the

218
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:56,550
past and really doing it making a habit when you look at a research paper of quickly identifying what the study design was.

219
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,059
Now, of course,

220
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:03,210
we'll have to talk more about study designs in a couple of weeks to hopefully get you to a point where you can make this sort of assessment.

221
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:09,810
Right. But understanding the strength of evidence is important. And as I said, you know, is this the ideal study design?

222
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,710
Is this did did the did the authors make do with what they could?

223
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:19,920
I'm going to give you an example later on in this course of a great case study that I have where initially it's like,

224
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,229
boy, I don't know if this is the best study design.

225
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:26,520
When you start to think about some of the challenges that can arise with the specific question they were looking at.

226
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:30,750
You know, they did quite well just thinking about, you know,

227
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:36,570
did the authors collect data on things that could have confounded or distorted the results?

228
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,830
All this information should be quickly found in the abstract.

229
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:50,030
All right. So here's some paper that I found at some point.

230
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:59,540
This is nothing that I work on. Right. But I stumbled across this paper when I was preparing for for this class.

231
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:05,059
And just just by chance, actually, the first author happens to be University of Michigan.

232
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:14,630
I didn't do that intentionally, but it's called Childhood Self-control Forecasts The Pace of midlife, aging and Preparedness for old age.

233
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:20,210
Okay. So, like, I don't do anything with, you know, childhood.

234
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:25,970
Behavior. Childhood psychology. But I kind of get what the main title is, right?

235
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:30,030
You know what somebody does when they're young? Their self-control. Right.

236
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:39,170
That can affect their midlife aging. Well, I can kind of guesstimate what I think they mean by midlife aging and then preparedness for old age.

237
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:44,570
Maybe kind of get what that is. But I don't know. I don't know exactly. Right. And who is this in right?

238
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:48,030
Who is this who what kind of what population is being studied?

239
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,610
Right. So there's a variety of questions. Just when I read the title that she popped into my head.

240
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:55,850
Right. So what's the general problem or research question?

241
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:00,769
What is the study design or strategy? You know, what's the primary population being studied?

242
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:04,940
What are the primary exposures and outcomes? Right. What are the major results and highlights?

243
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,720
Because, again, I can kind of get the gist of what the authors are talking about from the title.

244
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:14,960
But there's a lot of things that aren't clear. Like, for example, how do you even measure childhood self-control?

245
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:19,280
How do you measure preparedness for old age? Right. What do these things mean?

246
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,479
So here's the abstract. I just. I just copy and paste it. Excuse me?

247
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,080
The abstract. And I listed these questions over here.

248
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,430
Right. So I don't you know, I don't I don't need you to go through and read all of this right now.

249
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:38,280
But, you know, what I want you to see is that a lot of these initial questions that you should have popping into your head,

250
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:43,160
you know, are all answered right within the abstract, right.

251
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:46,470
A good well written abstract will have these kinds of questions answered.

252
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:50,400
Right. So what is the study? The study design or the strategy?

253
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,900
You know, this is this this red line there. You're right here. So it's a.

254
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:03,470
Eight. Eight are population representative, cohort of children followed from birth to age 45.

255
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:09,680
Are that done? A gene study? So for one, it tells me that this is a named study.

256
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:14,210
So if I want to go learn more about it, I can go look up this specific study right here.

257
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:20,780
It also tells me that this is a longitudinal study. Right. Meaning that I have measurements collected on children.

258
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:26,659
Right. Followed through age 45. Right. So we'll contrast that with a cross-sectional study later.

259
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:32,090
So it tells me something about how the measurement was or how the the the follow

260
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:36,290
up was done on participants tells me it's a population representative cohort.

261
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:44,180
Okay, so it means that this is not targeted towards some specific subpopulation or oversampling of some population, right?

262
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:47,870
It was presumably something fairly random within the population that's meaningful.

263
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:54,590
What about these these outcomes? Because like I said, what does it mean to have childhood self-control?

264
00:25:55,070 --> 00:26:04,070
Right. Well, we measure children's self control across the first decade of life using a multi occasion, multi informant strategy.

265
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:08,780
Yeah, that doesn't really help me too much. I'll have to go look more in the paper for that.

266
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:18,320
What about pace of aging and aging preparedness? These are measured using biological and physiological assessments, structural brain imaging scans,

267
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:22,549
observer rating self-report, informant reports and administrative records.

268
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:26,780
Right. So it's actually pre you know, they don't have just like one measurement.

269
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:29,810
Right. They actually have quite a few measurements that they're using to address this. Yep.

270
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:40,840
Yeah. No question.

271
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:45,180
So so I think, you know, I don't think that's a deal. That detail would have made it in here.

272
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:49,239
I think that would have been nice. But I think it's the fact that it's this study.

273
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:53,300
And I think if you are. In this field.

274
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:59,659
This might be a study that you actually know fairly well. If you go read the paper itself, I'm assuming there's much more detail on it.

275
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:07,460
The right to question. So so we've got quite a bit of information on how.

276
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:15,660
Pace of aging is measured. And then in terms of the initial results, we see, like this green sentence, you know,

277
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:20,880
children with better self-control, age more slowly in their bodies and showed fewer signs of aging in their brains.

278
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:26,790
And then down here, you know, another thing that they bring up that I thought was worth highlighting is that,

279
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:29,920
you know, what are the implications of this research? Right.

280
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:38,129
So they don't actually show this. Right. But their results suggest the possibility that self-control is a malleable target for intervention.

281
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:41,460
Right. So, you know, they're getting at what are the sort of implications of their work.

282
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:45,710
So quite a bit is contained within an abstract and you can learn quite a bit.

283
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,360
And so if you have some of these questions in mind,

284
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:54,810
you can really figure out quite a bit about how useful and how good a study is just based on the abstract.

285
00:27:56,210 --> 00:28:00,650
This one is an example from a medical journal, sources from JAMA surgery.

286
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:05,900
These are some U of M folks here, some people in anesthesiology that I collaborate with.

287
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:11,630
But just to give you an idea about how the abstract looks differ instead of being one flowing block of text.

288
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:17,959
You know, you can see here they break up some of the key elements of the of the abstract.

289
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:22,220
So here they have important objective design setting and participants.

290
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:29,000
Again, the title is New Persistent Opioid Use After Minor and Major Surgical Procedures in US Adults.

291
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:36,110
So this group tries to look at what kind of events bring about opioid persistent opioid use.

292
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:36,349
Right.

293
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:45,200
And so, you know, I know from working with them, one of the things they're very interested in are people who have no opioid use in their history,

294
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:53,090
go in for surgery, have the surgery done, are prescribed opioids, do exactly what the doctor tells them.

295
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:57,770
You know, take this many this many times a day at this dosage and as a result,

296
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:03,589
become not necessarily addicted, but develop some sort of persistent use of opioids.

297
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:06,979
Right. So this is part of what drove the opioid crisis, right.

298
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:10,820
Is that doctors overprescribing opioids. Right. So this is what they were looking into.

299
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:15,290
But again, just within this, a little bit of information here, you can see, right?

300
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:17,659
So what's the target population? Right.

301
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:25,100
So you could see right here, we identified us adults aged 18 to 64 without opioid use in the prior year to surgery.

302
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:32,540
So they're finding surgical patients within this 18 to 64 age range and without opioid use in the prior year to surgery.

303
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:35,959
Now, how did they do this? What kind of data did they use? Right.

304
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:44,250
Well, you could see where it. Using nationwide insurance claims data sets, right?

305
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:48,030
So what they're using is a retrospective cohort, a retrospective design.

306
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:52,590
So retrospective meaning the data is already being collected in the past. This is based on insurance data.

307
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:59,100
They're just going into this existing pile of data figuring out who was opioid naive, as they call it,

308
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:04,980
people who have no prior history with opioids, finding when they have surgeries based on that insurance claims data.

309
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:11,280
Right. And then being able to develop outcomes. And so their primary outcome is this persistent opioid dependance.

310
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:14,649
And then the exposures are different surgical procedures.

311
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:19,800
So you can see all the different kind of surgical, both minor and major surgical procedures listed here.

312
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:29,370
So again, you get a lot of questions answered, not just about the results, but how the research actually did the research by digging into abstracts.

313
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:35,939
Right. And abstracts. Again, they're not they're not real big 250 words or you even have some kind of picture like

314
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:39,690
that graphical abstract that can help you answer some of these important questions.

315
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:47,790
Presents questions. All right.

316
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:58,570
So the meat of the the the of a paper sort of we call the main text typically will consist of an introduction of methods or results in a discussion.

317
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:02,950
Every journal can be slightly different, but usually these four are the four key components.

318
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:09,140
So the introduction provides a more substantial description of the research question.

319
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:11,990
Okay. So beyond what was in the abstract?

320
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:18,950
So one of the keys here is that this is the place where the author should be able to establish their authority on the subject matter,

321
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:23,390
both by telling you, the reader, Hey, here's what's known about this area.

322
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,870
They'll provide you a literature review on previously related research.

323
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:32,120
You know, put the work that they're about to do in context. Right. How does it advance what's already known?

324
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:41,480
And what this does is show that the authors are aware of the big picture and where their research is relevant in that big picture.

325
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:49,580
And often you'll get additional details on things like study design, where the data came from, and then a glimpse into the results.

326
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:55,670
Or to get here, if you're the reader, you've read the abstract and you said, okay, this one might be worth looking into.

327
00:31:56,030 --> 00:32:00,049
Now the goal of the introduction is really to say, yes,

328
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:07,040
this is something you want to look into because I've fleshed it out and you want to look specifically at my at my results that I'm going to get.

329
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:13,879
The ordering is changing in paper sometimes now. It used to be that methods almost always followed.

330
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:19,370
Introduction. But now sometimes methods are dropping down to the bottom and it goes from introduction to results.

331
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:25,070
Just depends on the journal, but methods are a clear description of what was done by the researchers.

332
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:33,499
Often they'll be separated in the areas that I work into, you know, like data collection and analysis methods, you know, so more and more of the like,

333
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:42,320
how do we generate a dataset, be it collecting samples, humans, or how do we process data in a lab like biological samples?

334
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:45,430
And then the actual statistical analysis part, you know,

335
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:51,110
I heard this described to me once and it's always stuck with me thinking about the method section is kind of like a cookbook, right?

336
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:56,930
It's giving you here's the ingredients that we needed to do this and here's the steps that we needed to do to create this work.

337
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:01,940
You don't it should be a clear description of the choices that were made.

338
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,570
Sometimes there are arbitrary decisions that are made in research.

339
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:12,230
You'll see in one of your labs arbitrary choices that were made right, making sure that those are clearly documented.

340
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:19,670
No real need to justify or defend these choices here. All you're doing is, again, it's like a cookbook just saying, this is exactly what we did.

341
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:24,230
You'll often reference existing protocol studies or statistical methods, again,

342
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:29,720
to reinforce that you know what you're doing and that you're following up with things that have been tried and done before.

343
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:34,370
And so one of the things we'll talk about next week is reproducibility.

344
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:42,350
And so the idea here is that a well written method section should allow a qualified reader to be able to take those starting ingredients,

345
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:49,760
be that a dataset or some kind of biological reagents, and get back at the same results that the authors did.

346
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:54,800
And that sounds easy, but it's actually pretty difficult.

347
00:33:55,220 --> 00:34:00,740
And again, we're going to have a lab where you try to reproduce something without the benefit of having directions,

348
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:06,630
and you'll see how difficult that can be. The next section is the results.

349
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:15,000
Okay, so here we are just a presentation of the outcomes of the analysis performed and this is usually a combination of text and tables and figures.

350
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:19,559
I usually have descriptive statistics to describe the demographics of your study

351
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:24,480
participants evaluating the relationship between exposures and outcomes of interest,

352
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:29,249
and then certainly considering potential confounding variables.

353
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:34,770
And this is variables that are related to both the exposure and the outcome and have the ability to distort your results.

354
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:40,730
And the last piece in the main text would be the discussion. Right? So this is a what does it all mean?

355
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:43,650
So what? It's not what a discussion section shouldn't be.

356
00:34:43,890 --> 00:34:49,020
And again, just because I say it, just because I'm standing here saying, you know, this is what it should be, doesn't mean that everybody does that.

357
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:55,650
But what you don't want to have and what what researchers are discouraged from doing is just giving a rehash or a summary of the results,

358
00:34:55,890 --> 00:35:02,129
just stating stuff that you've already done or a discussion section should really be the place where an author

359
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:07,020
sort of takes a step back from the nitty gritty details that they've showed you in the results and said,

360
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:10,710
Here's how I interpret this. Here's what it means, right?

361
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:17,610
What kind of input, what are the implications of the results? For example, how can they be used to in practice or to drive policy?

362
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:26,150
The other important thing that should show up in in in a discussion section of a research paper is an honest assessment of the study.

363
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,490
Right? So what were the strengths of your study design and your data collection?

364
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:34,139
And most importantly, what are the weaknesses or limitations of your study design?

365
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:37,620
Right. If you read, every study has limitations or weaknesses.

366
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:42,420
If you read a paper, right? And in the discussion they don't mention limitations or weaknesses.

367
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:47,000
That should be a red flag. Right. Because they're just not being honest in addressing what they were.

368
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:50,400
Right. Most journals, if they are peer reviewed well,

369
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:57,389
will expect that there are weaknesses or limitations of the study design and also alternate explanations for the results.

370
00:35:57,390 --> 00:36:02,850
Right. So maybe this is how we interpret it. But here's another way that this data could be interpreted,

371
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:09,030
and maybe that's different than what we're saying that and then often you'll have something about natural next steps or open questions.

372
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:19,400
Any questions on this? Because I've seen this before. Right. Yeah.

373
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:23,160
More or less. Yeah. The board faces are telling me you've seen this look.

374
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:31,669
So I want you, though, you know, you can understand all these sections, but, you know, understanding why this format's important, right?

375
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:38,420
And then understanding that because the papers are broken up like this, it really helps with this ability to do critical evaluation.

376
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:43,340
Right? People aren't just given free rein to sort of like write this novel about what they've done.

377
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:49,100
Right. So it's it's very clear so that everybody else can go look even across disciplines and figure it out.

378
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:56,750
So if I go back to this same paper right here, this childhood self-control forecast, the pace of midlife, aging and preparedness for old age.

379
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:59,590
I've just listed four questions here. Right.

380
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:05,510
And what I think you can start to think about when you look at research papers and you're dealing with research papers are

381
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:13,100
what kind of question to my asking am I asking a question that should be answered in the introduction and the methods,

382
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:18,920
in the results or in the discussion, and that can start to point you to the right direction.

383
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:25,910
All right. So I've got four questions listed here. First one, how did the authors measure childhood self control or preparedness for old age?

384
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:32,750
What is the existing evidence for impact of early life behaviors on later life outcomes?

385
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:41,180
I have a typo there. Does the relationship between childhood self-control and financial preparedness differ by childhood social class,

386
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:46,310
and what are the implications for interventions aimed at self-control in children?

387
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,259
Right. So what I would argue,

388
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:55,150
and this is what the skill I'd like you to see here develop is understanding that I don't need to have the answers to these right.

389
00:37:55,160 --> 00:38:03,410
These are my questions. But the answers to these questions should be contained in a very specific location in the paper.

390
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:08,040
So my pole everywhere is not working, but if it was working, this is what I would've done, right?

391
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:14,270
So the first one is think about in what section would you expect to find the answer to?

392
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,830
How did the authors measure childhood self-control and preparedness for old age?

393
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:27,650
So what do you think here we think this would be. The methods.

394
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:32,250
Most people are in agreement with that. Yeah.

395
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:38,760
Yeah, I would say methods, right. Because as we said, this idea of childhood self-control, I can have a fuzzy idea of what that means.

396
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,700
Right. But I want to know, how did you get a number?

397
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:47,580
How did you have a kid and how did you get a number for that kid that that quantified their self-control.

398
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:54,479
Right. And that's going to be a detail, like we said, like in that recipe book that how did they actually do that?

399
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,530
Good. What section would you expect to find the answer to?

400
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:03,690
What is the existing evidence for impact of early life behaviors in later life outcomes?

401
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:10,440
What effect did your introduction? Well, I'm going to argue that.

402
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:18,130
Yeah. I think introduction, right. This is telling you what's been done before, sort of laying the groundwork for where their research is picking up.

403
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:22,570
Now, is this a completely new idea or have others looked into this already?

404
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,380
And how would my research sort of take the next step in that good?

405
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:35,780
What about does the relationship between childhood self-control and financial preparedness differ by childhood social class?

406
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:42,430
We think. Yeah. It results, right? Anybody else want to do something different?

407
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:51,970
Go for it. Okay.

408
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:55,500
So if you want to actually see if there's a quantifiable difference.

409
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,600
Right, I think you would do that in the results. Right.

410
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:04,439
You can actually take here's my data show if you want to discuss the implications or maybe why this exists.

411
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:08,970
Right? Because that's an interpretation, why that exists. That's a discussion thing for sure.

412
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:15,240
But if all I want to show is here's my data, you know, is there is there some difference based on social class?

413
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:20,430
That's a results thing. If I then want to say explain it and evaluate little bit more discussion.

414
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:27,810
What are the implications for interventions aimed at self-control in children this one day?

415
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:35,489
Discussion. Right. And so this paper. Right. Didn't talk about the focus of the research in this paper is not about implications.

416
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:38,520
Right? It's not about interventions. It's not about policy.

417
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:44,370
It's actually observing. You know, what the the association between childhood self-control and.

418
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:52,100
Different properties of of of later life. Right. But it's still fair to talk about the interventions, even though they didn't research it.

419
00:40:52,100 --> 00:41:00,540
But that has to go in discussion. They have no evidence to back it up. So again, I didn't ask you to read this paper in advance on purpose,

420
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:05,790
because I wanted you to just think about even without knowing anything about the paper before you showed up here.

421
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:11,010
You know, just this this format that exists across scientific papers, you know,

422
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:16,970
is going to allow us to figure out where things where the different pieces of information would be found in this paper.

423
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:21,690
Right. So, you know, up here is is the first piece that that we said was an introduction question.

424
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,600
You know, we don't need to read it right now, but you can convince yourself that,

425
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:29,010
you know, this this paragraph that I think this actually opens the paper.

426
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:32,400
Right. Is laying the groundwork for what existing evidence exists.

427
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:37,320
You know, how did how did the investigators measure childhood self-control?

428
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,580
You can go ahead and read this. But, you know, there's quite a bit. Right.

429
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:48,420
You know, things like parent teacher report self-reports of hyperactivity, each child participant, a testing session, cognitive and motor tasks.

430
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:52,650
Right. So there are quite a bit of ways that that those things were measured.

431
00:41:55,460 --> 00:42:03,500
This idea of how a childhood social class might impact the relationship between childhood self-control and financial preparedness.

432
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:08,060
Yet we're not going to dig into the actual results here, but it's contained within this table.

433
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:12,740
So you can see, like, here's how we're going to learn how to read this table when we get into the stats part.

434
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:16,670
But we've got this adjusted for childhood social class part right here.

435
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:23,209
Right. We're making a comparison with and without accounting for childhood social class.

436
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:27,260
And we can look to see, you know, make a comparison here. You know, are things changing?

437
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:30,890
Is there some sort of difference in the results? You can actually quantify it.

438
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:36,109
And then finally, this idea about implications for interventions, right.

439
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:42,680
Get this was not what they actually did research on. They did not study the effect of an intervention on childhood, in self-control.

440
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:46,399
Right. So it can go in the discussion and talk about how this can actually happen.

441
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:54,170
But they don't have any data to actually say whether the intervention or an intervention would be successful or if they can just posit the idea.

442
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:58,580
Correct. Okay.

443
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:01,270
So that is the research article format.

444
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:08,530
So again, my hope there was to show you that there's this fairly standard format that exists and that there's a point in it.

445
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:14,010
The point is that, one, it allows for the critical evaluation of the science that's presented therein.

446
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:20,310
Right. And that by putting each concept in its own place, it allows the reader to understand sort of that logical flow.

447
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:24,590
Once you get used to it, you know where to look to find the information you want.

448
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:30,070
So we're going to take a little bit of a turn now. And I want to talk about the process that it takes to get a paper published,

449
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:32,850
because we talked about we're just assuming, okay, I've got a published paper.

450
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:36,400
Now, let's talk a little bit about the process that takes to get a paper published.

451
00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:41,500
So some people have said they've been involved in papers. Anybody been like a first author?

452
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:51,150
Okay. So you really are another one. Okay. But, you know, so you're really pushing that, that, that process through the publication.

453
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:55,440
And it's a little bit different if you're a coauthor and you could just watch it happen, right?

454
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:59,880
If you're pushing it right. It's it's it's quite it quite can be quite an experience.

455
00:44:00,330 --> 00:44:04,320
So I like this diagram that I found at some point on the publication process.

456
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:08,790
So I'm assuming most people have some rough idea about what the publication process looks like.

457
00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:13,440
Right. But you as the author, you submit the manuscript to a journal.

458
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:20,720
How do you choose which journal you're going to submit to? Floor journals out there.

459
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:28,720
What do you just say? Now you tell me. Okay. Okay.

460
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:42,160
Okay. Okay. Sort of topical.

461
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:45,940
That's important, right? You know, I do genetics work.

462
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:50,319
There's lots of genetics journals. Right. I'll tell you in a minute. You know, some of the things that go into it.

463
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:56,979
So it certainly does the journal have interesting you your work and also we'll think

464
00:44:56,980 --> 00:45:00,490
about how do you how do you pick which journal you might want to aim for but okay.

465
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:05,440
So you pick a journal, you submit it. The journal goes to an editor, right?

466
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:12,810
There are usually multiple is like head editor and then multiple editors below that that maybe are content specific and they assess the manuscript.

467
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:17,890
Everybody's heard about the peer review process, of course. Right. Is a paper guarantee to get peer reviewed.

468
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:26,500
Absolutely is not right. One person, one editor can look at it and say, no, we don't want this.

469
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:29,680
It's called the Desperate Jack, and it can actually happen pretty quickly.

470
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:36,970
One time I submitted a paper to a journal, went out to lunch, and I had my desk projection back by the time I got back from lunch.

471
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:42,130
So it can happen pretty quickly. But people are sometimes surprised that this one editor.

472
00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:46,750
Right. Has the ability to reject a paper without anybody else even looking at it.

473
00:45:47,470 --> 00:45:53,750
If they decide that it should go out for for peer review, the manuscript will get sent to reviewers.

474
00:45:53,800 --> 00:46:02,600
Right. How did the reviewers get picked? That based on what?

475
00:46:05,090 --> 00:46:08,840
We certainly want some people that can that have the ability to evaluate it.

476
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:14,390
Right. You think the author can say, hey, I want I would like that person to be a reviewer.

477
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:21,070
Yes, they can. And the journal will say, we demand you give us five reviewers.

478
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:29,110
Crazy, isn't it? Yeah. The journals will actually say, give us a name of some people that you think would be good to referee or review this paper.

479
00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:32,470
Totally blew my mind, right, that this actually happened.

480
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:37,120
Right now there are you know, you can't have, you know, your BFF from graduate school.

481
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:42,460
Right. Be your your peer reviewer. Right. But basically, you're trying to save the journal some time, right?

482
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:48,250
They're looking at lots of papers. They don't always know who the best people in the field would be to review it.

483
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:56,980
But yeah, authors do are required to give a certain number of potential people to be peer reviewers.

484
00:46:57,310 --> 00:47:05,170
Are they going to be all of them? No. Do you think that an author can say this is a person I absolutely do not want reviewing my paper.

485
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:11,050
He says. You're nodding your head. Yeah. Why not?

486
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:15,420
Yes. Some journals do. Some journals will say, you know, is there anybody that you don't want?

487
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:23,480
Why might you not want somebody reviewing your paper? Really mean.

488
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:28,550
But but what? I mean, I mean, maybe they're working on something similar, right? And you prefer like not to get to get known.

489
00:47:29,390 --> 00:47:33,080
You know, sometimes scientists don't always get along. It happens, right?

490
00:47:33,830 --> 00:47:39,200
Yeah, but it's actually so when it comes to this review process. Right, there are actually some things that could be surprising.

491
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:44,780
Right? Actually giving suggestions or people that you'd prefer that they don't get to review your paper.

492
00:47:45,770 --> 00:47:50,120
There's no single format for how it's done. Single blinded, double blinded, open peer review.

493
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:55,909
We'll talk about those in a second. But once the reviewers take a look at the paper, they will come back.

494
00:47:55,910 --> 00:48:00,170
They will send their comments again to the journal editor.

495
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:10,309
The editor will look at them and decide, okay, does this paper look like it's it's, you know, good enough, but it needs some fixes.

496
00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:12,710
Will we allow the author to do revisions?

497
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:20,600
Right, or will we just say, now, this is not a good fit for our paper either because of the material or the the sort of level of results?

498
00:48:21,350 --> 00:48:31,669
Okay. So it could be that the journal decides that, nope, even after review, you're rejected, or it could be that you are sent revisions.

499
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:38,840
The author gets a chance to make revisions. Those can go back to the again, go back to the journal editor, often to the reviewers themselves as well.

500
00:48:39,170 --> 00:48:42,260
And then even here the manuscript can be rejected or accepted.

501
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:47,120
So even after doing revisions, there's no guarantee that your paper would be accepted.

502
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:53,089
Right? So this is a lot of work. This takes a lot of time to think about how this goes through and now it's way quicker.

503
00:48:53,090 --> 00:49:00,650
Go talk to people who, you know, I remember talking to a guy in my department who said, like when he wrote papers, you would you would print it out.

504
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:04,040
Then you would put it in an envelope, a big manila envelope, you'd stamp it,

505
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:07,340
you'd send it off to the journal, and you would have no idea what was going on.

506
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:11,540
Now, at least you can go online and you could check on the status and everything and stuff.

507
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:17,840
But it's still a lengthy process, right, that you can go through. And even if you submit it, even if it goes through a peer review,

508
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:21,290
even if you make revisions, there's still no guarantee that it's going to be accepted.

509
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:27,570
So as I mentioned, you know, lots of things in the publication process changing over time.

510
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:28,620
So, you know,

511
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:37,130
something that is not in this picture because it's maybe several years old that I think would be added now is this idea of preprint server.

512
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:40,910
So people who are a preprint servers. Some people are a preprint server.

513
00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:45,430
No. And he knows. That's okay. That's okay.

514
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:51,220
So a preprint server. So this is, for example, bio archive or med archive.

515
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:56,230
These are basically places where researchers can post the paper.

516
00:49:56,950 --> 00:50:02,740
They sort of like their the version that they're going to submit to a journal before they actually submitted to the journal.

517
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:10,240
Right. It just goes up there. It gets their name up there with all the paper and everything, and then it'll get sent to a journal for the peer review.

518
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:14,850
Why do you think people do this? We think.

519
00:50:19,290 --> 00:50:22,560
For what? It's free access.

520
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:27,580
This idea of getting the information out sooner. Absolutely.

521
00:50:28,450 --> 00:50:35,019
I mean, this was this happened a ton. You notice this a ton during the early parts of the pandemic.

522
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:38,810
Right. Like the peer review process was like broken during the pandemic.

523
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:43,720
Good luck finding anyone to peer review, you know, during the high part of the pandemic.

524
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:48,520
Right. I mean, people are not looking to take on extra work. We'll talk a little bit about that in a second, too.

525
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:54,399
But at least it gets that information out there and also allows researchers to sort of like put a put a stamp down and say,

526
00:50:54,400 --> 00:51:00,130
hey, look, this is this is my result. I've got it right here. And they can they can ask they they can show it off.

527
00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:06,820
If you're if you become like a faculty member, you know, you get evaluated on the on your productivity.

528
00:51:07,210 --> 00:51:11,470
Right. And so that the the gold standard of productivity is publications.

529
00:51:11,890 --> 00:51:15,969
Right. Well, if I can't quite get it published, but I want to show that I've been productive or hey,

530
00:51:15,970 --> 00:51:20,680
maybe I can post it on a preprint server and then I can list that on my my yearly evaluation.

531
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:26,200
Right. So there's some good things there. What are some concerns about papers going up on preprint servers?

532
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:43,880
They do something to. Mm hmm.

533
00:51:45,570 --> 00:51:48,830
Exactly right. So it's caveats on there.

534
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:56,760
Look, this hasn't been peer reviewed. Notice when you read media articles, sometimes pay attention to if the article has been peer reviewed,

535
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:00,660
the results of a peer reviewed and published or if it's just posted on a preprint server.

536
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:09,180
You're seeing much more now where media articles are picking up on scientific results that have been posted on like bio archive or med archive.

537
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:17,759
Haven't been peer reviewed yet got. So it's like a minute about the peer review process.

538
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:21,200
We might run out of time. Who can be reviewers.

539
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:28,030
Who can peer review. It's got to be like the greatest experts in the field ever.

540
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:32,190
Right. Because we want to have any kind of potential mistake pulled out.

541
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:35,630
Right. So no way a graduate student could be a peer review.

542
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:42,520
Right. Absolutely. Graduate students can be peer reviewers are some of the easiest people to get to peer review.

543
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:46,370
Graduate students will be so excited to do anything. Oh, I get to review a paper.

544
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:49,210
I'll do it right. Yeah. So it's kind of crazy, right?

545
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:55,320
So graduate students, post-docs, professors, you know, these are the people that do peer reviews.

546
00:52:55,330 --> 00:52:59,380
Right? And your thought might be, well, they they must be an expert in what they're doing.

547
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:04,509
Often they're not. Right. Often they're just using their training, which is broadly applicable, you know,

548
00:53:04,510 --> 00:53:08,920
understanding the scientific process and being able to critically evaluate a paper.

549
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,489
Right. To do that peer review, you know,

550
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:20,260
the goals of what the reviewers are supposed to be doing are filtering out manuscripts for the journal both on content and on impact, right?

551
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:24,780
So content meaning, you know, is this the actual work that's being done?

552
00:53:24,790 --> 00:53:30,260
Is it a good fit? Right. Is this what people who look at this journal will expect to see and then impact?

553
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:33,280
I'll talk a little bit more about impact, but how important is this research?

554
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:34,750
How much will people care about it?

555
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:42,379
And the other thing is and, you know, I think this gets lost in the peer review process is that part of what their job is,

556
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:46,370
is to provide constructive criticism to improve the manuscript.

557
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:52,580
We often think of the peer review process as like these judges write that have your your your fate in the balance.

558
00:53:53,040 --> 00:54:01,520
They can accept or reject it. But really, what a good peer review will do is look at your paper and say, hey, did you consider this?

559
00:54:01,910 --> 00:54:06,700
You know, maybe if you tried this analysis, they're trying to give you ways to strengthen or improve your manuscript.

560
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:11,150
Right. And often, you know, you are so deep into that project yourself.

561
00:54:11,150 --> 00:54:15,680
Sometimes you miss some obvious things that that you could add onto it to make it better.

562
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:21,350
So I you know, I just want people to recognize that part of the peer review process is trying to improve the manuscript.

563
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:28,630
So the way that the actual peer review gets done is, is single blind, double blind or open peer review?

564
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:31,170
I think single blind is what people are most familiar with.

565
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:36,090
This is the place where the reviewers know the identity of the authors during the peer review,

566
00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:40,800
but the author never finds out who the reviewers actually are.

567
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:48,000
I think that's the most common a double blind is both reviewers and authors are blinded to each other's identity.

568
00:54:49,350 --> 00:54:55,079
And then this open peer review, which is catching on now, it's complete opposite of the double blind here.

569
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:58,020
It's the reviewers know the identity of the authors during the review.

570
00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:04,829
So you get the paper and you see who the authors are, and then the authors learn the identity of the reviewers after the publication decision.

571
00:55:04,830 --> 00:55:08,430
And actually the reviewers names are listed and posted on the publication.

572
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:13,200
Okay. Somebody heard of this peer review, this open peer review before?

573
00:55:13,830 --> 00:55:17,370
It's kind of. So this is just like briefly I would talk about, you know, ideas.

574
00:55:17,370 --> 00:55:19,109
You might have, um, pros and cons of each strategy.

575
00:55:19,110 --> 00:55:24,689
So I think, you know, I think we'd agree that like this, this double blind peer review, it's kind of the best, right?

576
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:30,329
It protects you. Protects, like any biases against the authors.

577
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:33,690
Right. That you might see. Right. Is this is this somebody you've heard of?

578
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:41,660
You would be surprised how often, you know, once somebody becomes established in a field which just take their work for.

579
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:43,559
Right. I mean, they know what they're doing. Right.

580
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:49,770
And, you know, are they going to get pushed quite as much in their review if somebody knows who it is?

581
00:55:49,770 --> 00:55:56,050
Right. Oh. So what's the any any concerns on the single blind side?

582
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:00,350
Either from the reviewer end or the the author end.

583
00:56:05,810 --> 00:56:10,280
Why do you think it's important? Or what's one argument for why the reviewers should know who the author is?

584
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:30,759
Yeah. Yeah, right. And that's that's pros and cons with that.

585
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:33,639
Right. One of the, one of the arguments against ah one of the,

586
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:38,470
the logistical challenges of this double blind is I was actually looking at a paper at this earlier,

587
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:42,549
I didn't include it here, but they actually find that a lot of times,

588
00:56:42,550 --> 00:56:48,400
even when you try to double blind, the reviewers are able to figure out who the authors are just based on the the papers that they're

589
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:52,270
citing and stuff because people tend to cite their own work that builds up to this next thing.

590
00:56:52,570 --> 00:56:55,510
So even though this is nice, it doesn't even get achieved all the time, right?

591
00:56:56,920 --> 00:57:01,479
It's good to know like, hey, I mean, most, most it hope most researchers,

592
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:10,780
most scientists would remove themself if they were asked to peer review for somebody that they know, somebody that that they worked with in the past.

593
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:15,099
Some of them might be a friend. I've gotten asked a peer review something and it was like a friend of mine.

594
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:20,409
Right. So you have to you have to say, no, can't do that. If you do a double blinded, you know, I wouldn't be able to do that now, would it?

595
00:57:20,410 --> 00:57:24,760
Would it matter? I don't know. Right. What about this open peer review?

596
00:57:25,390 --> 00:57:39,950
We you think of this this idea you had a question or. Do you think they're going to be more critical of your name?

597
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:47,840
Okay. I could come up with a reason for the opposite.

598
00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:52,160
So I got asked to review something in the soap opera I've done at one time.

599
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:57,440
The people that were the authors were much more senior than me in the field.

600
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:03,410
One of them was definitely like a name commodity. I could not believe one of the analysis they did.

601
00:58:03,770 --> 00:58:10,820
I thought it was terrible. I told the editor I was like, I don't I don't know how to say this in my my my peer review.

602
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:15,830
And I'm nervous because my name's going to get put on it. This person's going to know who I mean.

603
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:20,410
They don't know who I am now because I'm not important. But they're going to know, you know, my last name.

604
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:26,450
You know, you see it once. You know it sticks with you. I was nervous riot and the editor was like, okay, yeah, I can see what you mean, right?

605
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:32,150
Like, I was a little bit nervous that my name was going to get put out, even though I stand behind the fact that what I think they did was wrong.

606
00:58:33,830 --> 00:58:38,569
But yeah, like it opens up this problem of Can you really say the things you want to say

607
00:58:38,570 --> 00:58:42,820
as a reviewer if you know that your your identity is going to be revealed?

608
00:58:42,830 --> 00:58:48,380
Right. Especially if you're a junior person. Right. And you're trying to be review for somebody that's got more clout than you.

609
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:52,249
But there's pros and cons to each strategy, I think. I think that's the point.

610
00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:56,300
Right. The peer review process is critical, but there's there's pros and cons.

611
00:58:56,660 --> 00:59:02,600
How many reviewers do you think you get for a paper? Guess guesstimate.

612
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:08,550
Five. Wow. Good luck.

613
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:18,720
I mean, I'd say most papers get two or three. A high level, maybe a very high level paper that a journal knows is going to get a lot of attention.

614
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:23,340
Maybe they get more peer more peer reviewers because they want to make sure that something doesn't get through there.

615
00:59:23,550 --> 00:59:44,390
Yep. Yeah.

616
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:50,139
Yeah, I think it depends. It depends what your hurdle. It depends what the field is.

617
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:58,020
Right. So you need you know, one of the things about disability ability to critically evaluate is you do need some of that jargon, right.

618
00:59:58,030 --> 01:00:04,090
That that is unique to the field so that people in the field can definitely understand what you're doing, that level of detail.

619
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:07,389
The paper this this one that I've talked about, this cell genomics paper,

620
01:00:07,390 --> 01:00:13,570
actually the primary review back that I got on it was, can you make this more readable to a general audience?

621
01:00:13,930 --> 01:00:17,799
So yeah, that, that it does show up. All right.

622
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:20,830
So I already kind of talked about conflicts of interest for reviewers.

623
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:29,130
So we might want to do that. You know, I talked about professors and graduate students being the people that do this.

624
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:37,570
Are they compensated? Like if I accept the journal article review so I get paid to do it.

625
01:00:38,790 --> 01:00:45,180
Who would pay me raise you that I'm going to pay me. Now, does my department expect me to do those kind of things?

626
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:48,810
Yeah, they do. That's called service to the field. They expect you to do them.

627
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:54,690
I don't do enough of them, I'll tell you that much. But, yeah, your department expects you to do them.

628
01:00:54,730 --> 01:01:01,330
You don't get actually paid for them. I will tell you, though, some journals actually do compensate reviewers, right?

629
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:05,420
Not massive amounts of money, but some of the bigger journals,

630
01:01:05,430 --> 01:01:13,740
understanding the amount of time that it will take to review an article actually will compensate reviewers for it.

631
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:17,160
You know, so that leads to a question should article reviewers be compensated?

632
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:25,080
We think. What's an argument against it?

633
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:37,760
Well, that's okay. So that we can't have pharmaceutical companies paying people that are reviewing their articles.

634
01:01:38,110 --> 01:01:42,010
So this is more like should and should the journal themselves be able to compensate a reviewer.

635
01:01:42,250 --> 01:01:51,910
So what's an argument against it? Maybe not, right?

636
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:59,670
Maybe depending on who you know, you know, you can coerce people into being a reviewer.

637
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:04,440
What's an argument for it then? Because journals do it.

638
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:17,009
So it hasn't been outlawed. Yeah. Yeah.

639
01:02:17,010 --> 01:02:22,640
I mean, it's a lot of work to review an article, especially like a dense technical article.

640
01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:28,139
It's a lot of work. Right. And so you're saying should you just take on that work with people?

641
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:30,240
Should people just take on that work without any reward?

642
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:35,370
You know, so so there are some journals that do it's it's not a typical thing, but it does happen.

643
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:42,880
So just briefly, like what is what does the cycle look like for doing a paper submission?

644
01:02:42,890 --> 01:02:46,110
So this was a paper that I that I did a couple of years ago.

645
01:02:46,110 --> 01:02:53,170
It was about genetic analysis of clinical labs, both here at Michigan and also some collaborators at Vanderbilt.

646
01:02:53,740 --> 01:02:57,400
So we wrote the paper, we submitted it to Med Archive.

647
01:02:57,580 --> 01:03:05,590
Right. And, you know, a tweet went out from Med Archive that sort of announced it on there so that people who track it could go and see it.

648
01:03:07,210 --> 01:03:12,610
So we said, hey, let's, let's, let's send it to the best place we think that it'll get into.

649
01:03:12,610 --> 01:03:15,730
And I'll talk a little bit about metrics in a second later.

650
01:03:16,390 --> 01:03:22,630
So we sent it to the American Journal of Human Genetics. So the editor looked at it and said, Yes, I'll send this out for peer review.

651
01:03:23,020 --> 01:03:26,170
Peer review went out. And so these are the responses we got back.

652
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:31,389
You know, roughly the findings have value mainly for evaluating aspects of study design.

653
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:37,630
Fair enough. That was the point of the paper. Many of the paragraphs seemed misplaced.

654
01:03:37,990 --> 01:03:44,890
There are multiple examples of paragraphs in the results section that belong in the introduction and methods section respectively.

655
01:03:45,220 --> 01:03:48,700
Then I just spent all that time telling you about it and look what I got things for.

656
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:53,049
It's my favorite of all. Please check for the need for commas throughout the manuscript.

657
01:03:53,050 --> 01:04:03,310
Too many to document. Okay. So is this what you expect to hear back when you get peer evaluations at the American Journal of Human Genetics?

658
01:04:03,850 --> 01:04:08,680
There's there's almost no scientific content. I got almost nothing back rejected.

659
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:13,450
Nope. So we said, all right, well, what's the next place we can send it to?

660
01:04:13,450 --> 01:04:17,290
So we sent it to two genetics. That's public library science.

661
01:04:17,290 --> 01:04:22,030
Genetics, you know, another, another quite good genetics journal.

662
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:31,690
Again, it went out. So I edited the dates for this. So April 20, April 21st, 2021 is when I sent it, submitted it went out for peer review.

663
01:04:31,690 --> 01:04:37,209
I received reviews on June 18th notice on the other one, I never even got a chance to do revisions.

664
01:04:37,210 --> 01:04:43,030
They never gave me a chance. They just said, Nope, be on your way. So I got a chance to make revisions here on June 18th.

665
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:51,310
So several more months by the time I got those revisions resubmitted and then the editor looked at my revisions, luckily it was accepted.

666
01:04:51,310 --> 01:04:56,620
Okay, so one of the things you should remember when you read a paper is that paper,

667
01:04:56,620 --> 01:05:03,310
unless it's in like one of the very high tier journals, has almost, almost certainly been rejected somewhere else.

668
01:05:03,820 --> 01:05:10,389
Right. So it's kind of interesting to think about that. Almost every paper you look at got rejected at some journals somewhere along the way,

669
01:05:10,390 --> 01:05:14,950
unless it's in like science or nature, nature, you know, those kinds of kinds of journals.

670
01:05:14,950 --> 01:05:22,300
Okay. An interesting thing to think about. But again, I got some some evaluations that were able to help me make the paper better.

671
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:27,840
Any questions on that? Yeah. Is there a limit on how many times you gets?

672
01:05:29,570 --> 01:05:33,790
To different journals. No, they won't take it back again.

673
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:42,310
Yeah. You know, the editor will usually say this is we will not accept another form of this paper or they invite you.

674
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:46,910
They'll say, you know, you here's the feedback from the reviewers.

675
01:05:47,810 --> 01:05:53,959
We would be willing to look at a revised version of this paper in which you address these these concerns, but they always stick in that sentence.

676
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:57,590
There is no guarantee that that that your paper will be accepted. Question up there.

677
01:06:04,930 --> 01:06:09,440
You got to pick a new journal. Yeah. You know, the trouble for me is that, like I there was.

678
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:14,170
I mean, okay, I can do a little bit of writing fix up, but, like, scientifically, I got nothing to go off of.

679
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:17,650
Sometimes, at least when you get at it, you can be like, okay, you know what?

680
01:06:17,650 --> 01:06:22,360
I was missing something key. Let me let me implement that and let me send it somewhere new.

681
01:06:24,070 --> 01:06:33,150
You know, that's why. You know. It's if you're going to get rejected, which if you're going go into the scientific world, be prepared for rejection.

682
01:06:34,650 --> 01:06:41,760
It is it is great if you can at least get reviewers that give you actionable feedback to

683
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:45,030
improve the paper so that it has a better chance of being accepted at the next place.

684
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:51,030
This is a slide that I edited for this year. I'm definitely gonna run out of time.

685
01:06:51,030 --> 01:06:56,190
So this is a slide that I added this year because I made this, like, offhanded comment last year, and people's minds are blown.

686
01:06:56,730 --> 01:07:00,000
So this is from this cell genomics paper just got accepted.

687
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:03,809
Ah, you know, this surprised me when I was a graduate student.

688
01:07:03,810 --> 01:07:07,680
I learned about this. Yeah. Good. That, you know, your paper, your papers were accepted.

689
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:12,180
You acknowledge that either I or my institution have to pay an article publishing charge.

690
01:07:13,460 --> 01:07:17,650
You guys know that? It's going to play. You guys know the price is right.

691
01:07:18,590 --> 01:07:25,010
All right. Three, three volunteers pick out a price for what it costs to get a paper published in Cell Genomics.

692
01:07:25,730 --> 01:07:28,740
Somebody over here. $2,000.

693
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:32,880
Somebody in the middle here, 76. 76 bucks.

694
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:38,790
How much? 5000. Actual retail price.

695
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:58,470
Oh. So so you could see they're making a look at this deal they're giving me right here.

696
01:07:58,910 --> 01:08:03,030
Yeah, they're cutting it in half. I have to. I wrote this paper.

697
01:08:03,030 --> 01:08:06,219
I have to come up with $4,450.

698
01:08:06,220 --> 01:08:12,690
So you just went a little bit over. I'm sorry. I've got to come up with that money in order to get my paper published.

699
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:17,390
You know, it's easy to say, why the [INAUDIBLE] does that exist?

700
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:19,930
Right. Well, there's people that need to be paid at the Journal. Right.

701
01:08:20,230 --> 01:08:24,210
There's all sorts of people that go into the process of making a journal happen.

702
01:08:24,220 --> 01:08:28,960
Right. They've got editors, right? They've got people doing the typesetting.

703
01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:33,640
Right. There's a lot of people that go into to making that. You got Web managers to make these websites work.

704
01:08:34,030 --> 01:08:36,250
So it's surprising that this actually happens.

705
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:41,800
You know, I think what's important here is thinking about, you know, because these publishing charges exist.

706
01:08:42,010 --> 01:08:44,140
You know, who and what gets published. Right.

707
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:51,580
Certain areas of research definitely have more money pumped into them right then than other areas of research.

708
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,420
Different schools. Right. Think about, you know, University of Michigan.

709
01:08:55,420 --> 01:08:59,440
Look, this is not a big deal. I can handle that. Right. That's because I'm here.

710
01:08:59,740 --> 01:09:06,130
Right. People at smaller schools. Right. People at at universities that don't have as much research money.

711
01:09:06,370 --> 01:09:11,530
You could have a great result there. But imagine getting looking at this and being like, where am I going to come up with that?

712
01:09:12,010 --> 01:09:16,750
Now it does happen that journals will often work with people to get things published.

713
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:25,030
But yeah, I mean, these are there's there is this real incentive or financial cost that goes into actually publishing publishing papers.

714
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:32,370
All right. So the last thing I want to do here is evaluating articles post-publication.

715
01:09:33,390 --> 01:09:37,350
So how do I know if there was impact to a research paper?

716
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:42,790
You know, did the research matter? Did anybody notice? And what we're not going to talk about, but I want you to think about this.

717
01:09:42,810 --> 01:09:47,190
Hold on to it for next time is how do I know what's in that paper is still correct?

718
01:09:47,370 --> 01:09:50,400
How do I know that somebody hasn't spotted mistakes in it? Right.

719
01:09:51,030 --> 01:09:57,540
We're going to talk about retractions later in this class. So not all journals and articles are created equal, right?

720
01:09:57,540 --> 01:10:01,530
So numerous metrics exist that help you determine, you know,

721
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:09,810
the influence or importance of a specific paper or a journal so that the citation is the sort of basic unit of measurement here.

722
01:10:09,810 --> 01:10:14,520
The citation is when another person mentions your research in their paper.

723
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:20,430
That's a citation, right? So in terms of the quality of a journal, we have something called the impact factor.

724
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:26,460
Right. This is a measure of the frequency with which the average article in a journal cited in a particular year.

725
01:10:26,790 --> 01:10:33,480
Right. You take all the papers that a journal publishes, you take all the citations to all their articles, and you compute an average.

726
01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:35,040
That's an impact factor.

727
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:43,020
Typically, journals that have higher impact factors have higher expectations for what the level of research needs to be, right?

728
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:47,880
How how important the results are, what the impact of those results will be.

729
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:52,410
And it is more difficult to get a paper accepted at a high impact journal.

730
01:10:52,710 --> 01:10:55,950
Right. So when I go back to that decision, of which journal do I send it to?

731
01:10:55,950 --> 01:11:02,850
Why did I go to American Journal of Human Genetics first? Because it had a higher impact factor, more people looking at that journal.

732
01:11:03,150 --> 01:11:08,640
If it gets published in there, makes me look better when it comes to specific articles, right?

733
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:12,390
For one, you're going to look at the journal that it was actually published in.

734
01:11:12,630 --> 01:11:18,690
Right. So when you're looking now just because something's published doesn't mean it's this like incredible piece of research.

735
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:24,480
Look at what journal it's in, right? Another thing you can do is look at the number of citations that exist for that paper.

736
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:28,080
Do other people look at this paper and think it's also important?

737
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:31,430
Has anyone ever noticed that this paper was published?

738
01:11:31,470 --> 01:11:37,890
Okay, you know, it's tough to come up with a precise number of citations because there's different software and methods used.

739
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:44,720
But but but usually journals will give you something important to consider the year in which an article was published.

740
01:11:44,730 --> 01:11:49,350
Right. Has it had time to accumulate citations or if it's brand new, can't get cited right away.

741
01:11:49,950 --> 01:11:53,820
Right? Have newer papers been published on the topic so it's no longer the go to thing?

742
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:58,920
Or have there been changes in the in the field since that publication that would affect its citations?

743
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:04,590
So just as an example, the paper I've been using that childhood self control one was in a journal called

744
01:12:04,590 --> 01:12:07,650
Proceedings of the National Academy of Science of the United States of America.

745
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:13,270
PNAS Right. So I just clicked on this link about metrics here, and you can see they have a whole bunch of things pop up, right?

746
01:12:13,290 --> 01:12:16,739
So they tell you like, what's their impact factor? Their impact factors.

747
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:22,830
11 So on average papers that showed up in that journal got cited 11 times.

748
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:28,500
Can they give you a whole bunch of other metrics, sort of like where they are in other multidisciplinary sciences?

749
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:34,800
So they're the eighth highest, eighth highest impact among 73 in that area.

750
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:41,430
Here's just a picture that I found that a paper that's showing you journal impact factor.

751
01:12:41,430 --> 01:12:49,920
So some of the papers that you've certainly heard of, the big ones, New England Journal of Medicine, Lancet, a lot of the nature JAMA is right here.

752
01:12:50,190 --> 01:12:55,530
Right. Those ones are showing up here. Look how high they are compared to like where most journals are sitting at down here.

753
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:59,429
And notice that the actual discipline is quite important.

754
01:12:59,430 --> 01:13:07,440
Right. You know, these are colored by discipline. Many more people looking at things like medical journals than pure math journals, for example.

755
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:10,890
Right. So when you're making comparisons, you got to sort of compare within fields.

756
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:17,290
Other things is, you know, again, always changing in the area publications.

757
01:13:17,290 --> 01:13:22,270
People should look at other metrics that are important. So here's that paper I was just showing you.

758
01:13:23,110 --> 01:13:26,740
There is this little this little tab right here that I clicked on and metrics pop down.

759
01:13:26,980 --> 01:13:31,090
So it told me the total number of times that paper was viewed in the last 12 months,

760
01:13:31,090 --> 01:13:34,930
it's been cited three times, but hasn't been cited at all in the last 12 months.

761
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:38,710
When I click on this view all metrics, this thing pops up right here.

762
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:41,800
So this is called old metrics for alternative metrics.

763
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:47,769
And you can see right there are other ways that people are trying to capture the impact of studies like.

764
01:13:47,770 --> 01:13:54,360
So, for example, how many times was it mentioned on a news outlet, blogged about, tweeted about, showed up on a Facebook page or a video.

765
01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:59,500
So there are many ways that people are trying to look at how impactful scientific papers are.

766
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:05,800
All right. So I didn't get a chance to finish. I will do better in the future, I promise.

767
01:14:05,820 --> 01:14:09,750
What I'm going to ask you to do is simply go back and look at these last couple of slides.

768
01:14:10,110 --> 01:14:12,480
This is about that JAMA network open paper.

769
01:14:12,750 --> 01:14:20,570
And I'm just trying to connect the dots here of the different sections and the questions that could be answered by each one of those sections.

770
01:14:20,820 --> 01:14:24,060
And just making a quick comparison, I think the CNN article was quite good.

771
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:29,130
Just so you know, I think it does a really nice job of fairly demonstrating the research.

772
01:14:30,540 --> 01:14:36,270
I'm going to post the homework on canvas. Be on the lookout for it. I'll send an announcement when it goes up to next Thursday.
