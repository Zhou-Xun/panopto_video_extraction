00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:04,741
Hello, today I'm going to talk about Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:10,170
The learning objectives for today are to define Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

3
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,940
To calculate whether or not a SNP is in a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:17,793
And to describe the Hardy-Weinberg principle.

5
00:00:17,793 --> 00:00:23,642
In a stable population with people mating randomly together, allele frequencies

6
00:00:23,642 --> 00:00:28,760
typically predict genotype frequencies under the law of segregation.

7
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:33,267
So when you have allele frequencies that can accurately be used to predict

8
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:37,555
genotype frequencies at some SNP, for example, in the population,

9
00:00:37,555 --> 00:00:42,530
then that population is considered to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

10
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:44,944
But when that relation doesn't exist, so

11
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:49,572
when genotype frequencies differ from what would be predicted based on the allele

12
00:00:49,572 --> 00:00:53,690
frequencies, the population is out of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

13
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:56,741
And we say that it's in Hardy-Weinberg diequilibrium.

14
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:03,126
You may recall learning at some point about Gregor Mendel,

15
00:01:03,126 --> 00:01:08,530
the monk who was interested in looking at inheritance patterns in pea plants.

16
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:13,200
So one thing that Mendel studied was the inheritance of seed shape.

17
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,314
At one point, Mendel crossed pure-breeding or true-breeding

18
00:01:17,314 --> 00:01:22,350
smooth-seeded plants with a variety of plants that produced wrinkled seeds.

19
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:27,640
And what he found was that all the resulting seeds were smooth.

20
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:33,577
When he bred those smooth-seeded plants with each other,

21
00:01:33,577 --> 00:01:38,562
the offspring of the next generation were in a 3 to

22
00:01:38,562 --> 00:01:42,731
1 ratio smooth seeds to wrinkled seeds.

23
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,250
So what was going on?

24
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:50,628
Well, we know that organisms carry two copies of each genetic factor and

25
00:01:50,628 --> 00:01:54,890
there's segregation of parental factors during gamete formation.

26
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:58,896
So in humans, for example, the gametes will make our egg and sperm.

27
00:01:58,896 --> 00:02:03,733
And so the two copies that we carry of the alleles at each SNP will

28
00:02:03,733 --> 00:02:07,124
separate from each other during that time.

29
00:02:07,124 --> 00:02:13,478
So up here, we have in the in the pea plant example, the parental generation,

30
00:02:13,478 --> 00:02:19,452
which has two copies of big S for a true-breeding smooth-seeded plant,

31
00:02:19,452 --> 00:02:25,150
and two copies of the small S allele for the wrinkled plant.

32
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:30,371
Each of these smooth and wrinkled plants can only produce one kind of gametes.

33
00:02:30,371 --> 00:02:35,325
So the smooth, true breeding plants will always produce biggest gamete,

34
00:02:35,325 --> 00:02:39,900
and the wrinkled will always produce a small S gamete.

35
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,732
When those two gametes combine in the next generation,

36
00:02:43,732 --> 00:02:47,491
all of the resulting offspring will be big S, small S.

37
00:02:47,491 --> 00:02:52,302
Because they receive a big S from one parent and a small s from the other.

38
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:57,228
When you have the offspring generation that are heterosexuals,

39
00:02:57,228 --> 00:03:01,520
big S, small S, and they cross-breed with each other.

40
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:07,224
Both parents will be able to contribute either a big S allele or a small S allele.

41
00:03:07,224 --> 00:03:11,564
If you get two big S' coming together in the next generation,

42
00:03:11,564 --> 00:03:17,008
then you have the genotype big S, big S, and that will produce smooth seeds.

43
00:03:17,008 --> 00:03:21,472
Both of the heterozygous big S small S and big S, small S,

44
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:27,780
one inheriting the big S from mom, one inheriting the big S from dad.

45
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,641
These will also produce smooth seeds.

46
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:36,228
Only the plants that inherit the small S allele from both mom and

47
00:03:36,228 --> 00:03:38,321
dad will produce the wrinkled seeds.

48
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:42,590
That illustrates Mendel's law of segregation,

49
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:46,137
where each gamete receives one genetic factor from each parent and

50
00:03:46,137 --> 00:03:49,321
they're independently passed on to the next generation.

51
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:54,394
Under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium,

52
00:03:54,394 --> 00:03:59,012
the frequency of the genotype in the population is the probability of the two

53
00:03:59,012 --> 00:04:02,000
alleles coming together in a given individual.

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,808
So if we have for example a SNP, let's say that you can either have an A allele or

55
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:12,824
a C allele at that SNP, we're going to use the multiplication law of

56
00:04:12,824 --> 00:04:17,940
probability to illustrate the probability of having two A alleles.

57
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,676
And remember we talked about before,

58
00:04:20,676 --> 00:04:24,961
a way that we could annotate that probability is like this.

59
00:04:24,961 --> 00:04:27,256
The probability of big A.

60
00:04:27,256 --> 00:04:32,202
And if we multiply the probability of getting a big A from one parent

61
00:04:32,202 --> 00:04:36,884
times the probability of getting a big A from the other parent,

62
00:04:36,884 --> 00:04:42,130
that probability is just the probability of the big A allele squared.

63
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:47,175
So for example, the probability of getting the big A big

64
00:04:47,175 --> 00:04:53,700
A genotype is just going to be PA times PA, which is p squared.

65
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:57,760
The probability of the AC genotype is going to be the probability of

66
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,875
getting an A allele from mom and a C allele from dad,

67
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:05,690
plus the probability of getting the C allele from mom and the A allele from dad.

68
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:09,270
So you have two ways that you could have an AC genotype.

69
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:12,812
So that probability is annotated as 2pq.

70
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:17,761
And the probability of the CC genotype is just the probability of

71
00:05:17,761 --> 00:05:21,344
getting a C allele twice, which is q squared.

72
00:05:23,205 --> 00:05:24,456
So conceptually,

73
00:05:24,456 --> 00:05:29,400
the relationship between probabilities we can look at in Punnett square.

74
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:34,743
So here, the mother and father in the population represent the probability

75
00:05:34,743 --> 00:05:40,250
of any mother or father in the population passing on a particular allele.

76
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:44,736
And the probabilities that are inside the squares here represent the outcome

77
00:05:44,736 --> 00:05:48,550
of any child in the population having that particular genotype.

78
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:53,696
So, the probability of the AA genotype is the probability that the father

79
00:05:53,696 --> 00:05:58,925
contributes an A allele times the probability that the mother contributes

80
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:03,837
an A allele, which is PA squared like we illustrated on the last page.

81
00:06:03,837 --> 00:06:09,618
Here's the Punnett square that's showing the probability of being heterozygous,

82
00:06:09,618 --> 00:06:12,035
one way here and the other way here.

83
00:06:12,035 --> 00:06:18,095
So that's probability is 2 times PA times PC.

84
00:06:18,095 --> 00:06:24,511
If we have genotype, if we have allele probabilities here of 0.45 for

85
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:29,682
the A allele and 0.55 for the C allele, we can calculate

86
00:06:29,682 --> 00:06:36,840
genotype frequencies that we would expect under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

87
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:41,690
So if the father has a 0.45 probability of passing on A and

88
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:47,500
the mother has a 0.45, then 0.45 squared is 0.2025.

89
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:52,105
And that's the probability in the offspring generation of

90
00:06:52,105 --> 00:06:54,968
getting a child with an AA genotype.

91
00:06:54,968 --> 00:06:59,410
2 times the probability of 0.2475 is

92
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:04,577
the probability of the AC genotype child and so on.

93
00:07:04,577 --> 00:07:09,855
This is the relationship that illustrates Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, where we have

94
00:07:09,855 --> 00:07:14,938
allele frequencies predicting genotype frequencies in the following generation.

95
00:07:14,938 --> 00:07:18,717
If we have a deviation from this relationship,

96
00:07:18,717 --> 00:07:24,107
it's considered evidence for Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium.

97
00:07:24,107 --> 00:07:28,678
So in any population, the expected genotype frequencies based on

98
00:07:28,678 --> 00:07:33,831
the allele frequencies are gonna follow this quadratic theorem, right?

99
00:07:33,831 --> 00:07:38,684
So for two alleles, p and q, we're gonna square that quantity and we know it's

100
00:07:38,684 --> 00:07:43,490
equal to 1 because there's no other option for genotypes in the population.

101
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:48,713
So the genotype probabilities are gonna be p squared + 2pq + q squared,

102
00:07:48,713 --> 00:07:51,590
and it's always going to be equal to 1.

103
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:55,092
For three alleles, we can do a similar thing.

104
00:07:55,092 --> 00:07:59,105
If we have three alleles in the population,

105
00:07:59,105 --> 00:08:06,599
the theorem says that we'll have p squared + 2pq + q squared like we had before.

106
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:10,853
Then you have two different kinds of heterozygotes, pr and qr.

107
00:08:10,853 --> 00:08:15,206
And then the homozygote for the third allele, which is r squared.

108
00:08:15,206 --> 00:08:19,669
And all of that is going to equal to 1 as well.

109
00:08:19,669 --> 00:08:26,424
In this class, we'll be focusing on SNPs that have generally two alleles.

110
00:08:26,424 --> 00:08:29,593
But I wanted to show you the three little case,

111
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:32,282
in case you ever need to deal with that.

112
00:08:32,282 --> 00:08:37,480
So here we go, thinking through an example about Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

113
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:41,738
So here, we've got the frequency of the A allele,

114
00:08:41,738 --> 00:08:46,999
p is 0.45 and the q allele is 0.55 here in this example.

115
00:08:46,999 --> 00:08:52,137
And we've shown you how to calculate the genotype frequencies here.

116
00:08:52,137 --> 00:08:59,521
Okay, so how do we test whether something's in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium?

117
00:08:59,521 --> 00:09:04,500
What we're really doing again is comparing the expected number of people in

118
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:09,402
the population with a particular genotype to the observed number of people

119
00:09:09,402 --> 00:09:11,129
that have that genotype.

120
00:09:11,129 --> 00:09:14,040
First, we're gonna estimate allele frequencies.

121
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,869
Second, we're gonna calculate the expected relative genotype frequencies under

122
00:09:18,869 --> 00:09:20,033
Hardy-Weinberg.

123
00:09:20,033 --> 00:09:24,390
Third, calculate the expected number of people with each genotype.

124
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:28,236
Fourth, we're gonna look at the difference between the observed and

125
00:09:28,236 --> 00:09:31,520
expected number of people using the chi-square formula.

126
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:35,833
And then fifth, we're gonna sum up the chi-square components and

127
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:40,375
see if there's a statistically significant relationship to indicate

128
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:44,628
whether there's deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

129
00:09:44,628 --> 00:09:44,959
One example that we can talk about is testing for Hardy-Weinberg

130
00:09:49,731 --> 00:09:55,314
with the CCR5 deletion, which is associated with resistance to HIV.

131
00:09:55,314 --> 00:09:58,304
In the first step, we'll need to estimate the allele frequencies.

132
00:09:58,304 --> 00:10:03,482
And in a previous lecture, when we talked about allele frequencies,

133
00:10:03,482 --> 00:10:06,750
we used the gene counting method to do that.

134
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,840
So now we have allele frequencies.

135
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:14,240
Remember that the allele frequency of big A was 0.89 and

136
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,680
the allele frequency of small A was 0.11.

137
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:17,879
In the second step, we're going to calculate the expected

138
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:26,410
relative genotype frequencies under Hardy-Weinberg.

139
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:30,229
So, remember to calculate the genotype frequencies,

140
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:34,230
we're just going to use p squared, 2pq, and q squared.

141
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:37,766
So in this case, p squared is 0.89,

142
00:10:37,766 --> 00:10:43,286
the allele frequency of big A squared, and its 0.7921.

143
00:10:43,286 --> 00:10:46,549
[COUGH] And you do that for each of the genotype groups.

144
00:10:49,933 --> 00:10:51,056
In the third step,

145
00:10:51,056 --> 00:10:55,080
we can calculate the expected number of people with each genotype.

146
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,726
So this will be the relative genotype frequency for

147
00:10:58,726 --> 00:11:04,090
each of the genotype groups times the total number of people in the sample.

148
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:09,661
So if you have 1000 people in the population, your total N is 1000, right?

149
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:14,620
So how many people would you expect to have the big A big A genotype?

150
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:18,972
Well, you would take the relative frequency of big A big A,

151
00:11:18,972 --> 00:11:24,740
which is 0.7921, multiply it by 1000 and you'll get 792.1.

152
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:30,361
So we would expect on average or approximately 792.1

153
00:11:30,361 --> 00:11:35,878
people in the population to have the big A big A genotype.

154
00:11:35,878 --> 00:11:39,205
You would do the same thing for each of the other genotype groups.

155
00:11:39,205 --> 00:11:43,678
And you would notice that the number of people with each of the expected genotypes

156
00:11:43,678 --> 00:11:46,981
always sums up to your total number of people in the sample.

157
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:53,362
Now that we know the expected number of people that we would expect

158
00:11:53,362 --> 00:11:58,204
with each particular genotype based on allele frequencies.

159
00:11:58,204 --> 00:12:02,661
We can compare that to the number of people that we actually observe

160
00:12:02,661 --> 00:12:06,561
with that genotype in the population in order to determine

161
00:12:06,561 --> 00:12:10,712
whether the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

162
00:12:10,712 --> 00:12:15,641
So after calculating the expected number of people with each genotype,

163
00:12:15,641 --> 00:12:20,086
we're going to use this formula observed minus expected squared

164
00:12:20,086 --> 00:12:23,739
over the expected value, or O minus E squared over E.

165
00:12:23,739 --> 00:12:27,610
So we're going to calculate that for each genotype group.

166
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:32,480
For the big A big A genotype, for example, we're gonna take the observed number

167
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,151
of people with the big A big A genotype minus the expected number, square it.

168
00:12:37,151 --> 00:12:42,697
And then divided by the expected number of people with that genotype.

169
00:12:42,697 --> 00:12:47,569
Each of these three components are going to make up the next step where

170
00:12:47,569 --> 00:12:52,441
we're going to sum all of them from each of the individual genotype to

171
00:12:52,441 --> 00:12:56,311
get the overall chi-squared statistic for the test.

172
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,690
So here, the chi-square test, we can actually set it up in a table.

173
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,651
This will make it easier for you to calculate.

174
00:13:06,651 --> 00:13:12,083
So you can take your genotype groups, your observed ends in the population.

175
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:16,048
So this is the number of people who actually have the big A big A genotype in

176
00:13:16,048 --> 00:13:17,024
the population.

177
00:13:17,024 --> 00:13:21,494
What we would expect, remember, we calculated as p squared times the total N,

178
00:13:21,494 --> 00:13:23,720
and then the chi-squared component.

179
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,550
So you can kind of set up this nice table.

180
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:31,825
And at the end, we're gonna sum these up to get the overall chi-squared statistic.

181
00:13:32,861 --> 00:13:38,180
Now that we have a chi-squared statistic, what does it actually mean?

182
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:42,090
So we're testing the hypothesis that the population is in

183
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:46,760
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium at this particular SNP.

184
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,397
If we are able to find evidence to reject that hypothesis,

185
00:13:50,397 --> 00:13:54,185
that means that the population is not in Hardy-Weinberg and

186
00:13:54,185 --> 00:13:59,250
could be in Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium at that particular SNP.

187
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:04,521
So what we're doing is we're looking at the chi-squared statistic that we got.

188
00:14:04,521 --> 00:14:09,938
And if there's close alignment in equilibrium between what you would observe

189
00:14:09,938 --> 00:14:15,600
and what you expect and the population is truly in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium,

190
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,130
you would expect the chi-squared statistic to be really small.

191
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:22,732
And if the population is in disequilibrium,

192
00:14:22,732 --> 00:14:26,161
you would expect the chi-squared statistic to be bigger.

193
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:33,236
We are testing the hypothesis that the population is in Hardy-Weinberg

194
00:14:33,236 --> 00:14:37,231
equilibrium at one particular SNP that has two alleles.

195
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:44,196
The critical value in the chi-square distribution shown here for

196
00:14:44,196 --> 00:14:47,920
a SNP with two alleles is 3.84.

197
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,666
What that means is if you were to look at a population in

198
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:58,366
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium with those allele frequencies.

199
00:14:58,366 --> 00:15:02,405
And you were sampling randomly from that population,

200
00:15:02,405 --> 00:15:07,953
you would get a chi-square value less than 3.84, 95% of the time.

201
00:15:07,953 --> 00:15:14,402
And you would get a chi-square value bigger than 3.84 only 5% of the time.

202
00:15:14,402 --> 00:15:19,668
That means that if we see in our sample a chi-squared value that's

203
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:24,934
less than 3.84, then we don't reject the null hypothesis and

204
00:15:24,934 --> 00:15:31,444
we conclude that the population is likely to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

205
00:15:31,444 --> 00:15:35,297
If we get a chi-squared value greater than 3.84,

206
00:15:35,297 --> 00:15:40,680
that means that we have a significant p value or a p value less than 0.05.

207
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:44,930
We can reject the hypothesis that the population is in Hardy-Weinberg and

208
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:49,591
we can have evidence that the population is in Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium.

209
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:55,133
If you're testing a SNP with three or more allele,

210
00:15:55,133 --> 00:16:01,081
consult the chi-square statistic tables to find the critical value for

211
00:16:01,081 --> 00:16:04,704
what you would use to test your hypothesis.

212
00:16:04,704 --> 00:16:06,178
The degrees of freedom for

213
00:16:06,178 --> 00:16:10,738
the chi-squared statistic is the number of genotypes that you're looking at.

214
00:16:10,738 --> 00:16:14,202
So in a SNP with two alleles, you have three genotypes,

215
00:16:14,202 --> 00:16:17,470
the number of parameters that you have to estimate.

216
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:23,389
So you only have to estimate p, the allele frequency for one of the alleles

217
00:16:23,389 --> 00:16:29,330
because when you estimate that you automatically know q, and then -1.

218
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:33,991
So for a SNP with two alleles, the degrees of freedom is 1 cuz it's

219
00:16:33,991 --> 00:16:37,830
three genotypes minus one parameter estimated -1.

220
00:16:42,397 --> 00:16:47,886
Here, we're just illustrating how we're gonna calculate the observed and expected

221
00:16:47,886 --> 00:16:53,018
differences for the people with each genotype using the chi-squared formula.

222
00:16:53,018 --> 00:16:58,108
So here is the actual numbers, you've got observed number of people with

223
00:16:58,108 --> 00:17:04,284
big A big A genotype, the expected, here's your chi-squared component calculated.

224
00:17:04,284 --> 00:17:06,448
And here's your chi-squared component sum.

225
00:17:06,448 --> 00:17:09,766
So it's each of the three individual chi-squared components.

226
00:17:09,766 --> 00:17:16,714
It summed up, your chi-squared statistic is 0.8774.

227
00:17:16,714 --> 00:17:20,685
There's 1 degree of freedom, like I talked about before.

228
00:17:20,685 --> 00:17:25,977
And so in this case, the chi-squared value is less than 3.84 and

229
00:17:25,977 --> 00:17:29,090
the p-value is greater than 0.05.

230
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,766
So we do not reject the null hypothesis and

231
00:17:31,766 --> 00:17:35,907
we say that the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

232
00:17:38,368 --> 00:17:41,615
If the chi-square value is greater than 3.84,

233
00:17:41,615 --> 00:17:46,929
we're going to reject that hypothesis because the p-value is less than 0.05 and

234
00:17:46,929 --> 00:17:50,500
the population is not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

235
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:56,931
So why would you find that a SNP is in Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium?

236
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:01,050
Well, one thing could be genotyping error.

237
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:04,425
So it's possible that when your genotyping the SNP,

238
00:18:04,425 --> 00:18:09,300
there was a laboratory area incorrectly identifying people's genotypes.

239
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,213
And if there's some kind of systematic bias,

240
00:18:12,213 --> 00:18:17,524
that can cause the population to look like it's out of Hardy-Weinberg at that SNP.

241
00:18:17,524 --> 00:18:21,488
It could be due in reality to population stratification.

242
00:18:21,488 --> 00:18:26,825
So that means there's a non-random pattern of mating among ethnic or

243
00:18:26,825 --> 00:18:30,267
other kinds of genetically similar groups.

244
00:18:30,267 --> 00:18:35,906
This could reflect migration, or it could reflect just assorted of mating,

245
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:38,606
where people don't mate randomly.

246
00:18:38,606 --> 00:18:43,247
So that's a real reason the SNP could be out of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

247
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,415
There could be a selection event occurring.

248
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,698
So we kind of talked about this in another lecture.

249
00:18:47,698 --> 00:18:51,649
So for example, there's a dynamic change in allele frequency.

250
00:18:51,649 --> 00:18:53,827
So people who are heterozygous for

251
00:18:53,827 --> 00:18:58,783
the sickle cell mutation that we talked about are selected for, for example,

252
00:18:58,783 --> 00:19:03,537
while people who are homozygous are selected against at different rates.

253
00:19:03,537 --> 00:19:06,783
This will push a SNP out of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

254
00:19:06,783 --> 00:19:11,250
And finally, if you're looking at a case-control study,

255
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:16,679
if you see a true association between a disease and some gene of interest,

256
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:20,796
it could cause the case group to have different genotype

257
00:19:20,796 --> 00:19:25,560
frequencies than expected, given their allele frequencies.

258
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:29,281
So we'll talk more about this when we walk through the problem set.

259
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:35,370
Last thing is the Hardy-Weinberg principle.

260
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:38,705
So this principle says that if you have random mating,

261
00:19:38,705 --> 00:19:43,418
then Mendel's laws will result in an offspring population in one generation

262
00:19:43,418 --> 00:19:46,270
that's in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

263
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:50,922
So the Hardy-Weinberg looks across generations and it says, even if you have

264
00:19:50,922 --> 00:19:55,234
a population that's completely out of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

265
00:19:55,234 --> 00:19:59,016
It will only take one generation to get back to equilibrium and

266
00:19:59,016 --> 00:20:04,170
remain there if the Hardy-Weinberg population assumptions hold.

267
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:08,634
So the assumptions that we're going to make are that there's no migration,

268
00:20:08,634 --> 00:20:13,591
no natural selection acting on our SNP of interest, and that there is random mating.

269
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:19,552
So the random mating assumption is really getting at this point,

270
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:22,503
that if the population is mating randomly.

271
00:20:22,503 --> 00:20:27,225
The probability of a person with one genotype mating with the with the person

272
00:20:27,225 --> 00:20:32,392
of another genotype depends only on the genotype frequencies of the population and

273
00:20:32,392 --> 00:20:33,372
nothing else.

274
00:20:33,372 --> 00:20:38,968
So if we go back to our CCR5 example, what's the probability of a person

275
00:20:38,968 --> 00:20:44,104
with a big A big A genotype mating with someone who has a small A small

276
00:20:44,104 --> 00:20:46,334
A genotype would just be the product of those two probabilities.

277
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:54,387
And you would have to consider the fact that that could happen two ways.

278
00:20:54,387 --> 00:20:58,871
So the mother could be big A big A and the dad could be big A small A, or

279
00:20:58,871 --> 00:21:03,214
the mother could be small A small a and the dad could be big A big A.

280
00:21:03,214 --> 00:21:06,477
So the total probability of this type of meeting

281
00:21:08,564 --> 00:21:14,060
is 2 times 0.0096 or 0.0192.

282
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:18,506
And remember that the probabilities of all of the possible mating types in

283
00:21:18,506 --> 00:21:20,811
the population will always sum to 1.

284
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,251
So here, we're going to look at all possible meeting types when two alleles

285
00:21:27,251 --> 00:21:28,350
are considered.

286
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:33,361
So here's all the different mating types that could happen in the population.

287
00:21:33,361 --> 00:21:35,524
Here's the probability that they would happen.

288
00:21:35,524 --> 00:21:39,459
So you've got for example big A big A times big A big A.

289
00:21:39,459 --> 00:21:44,631
Well, you know that the probability of a person being big A big A is p squared.

290
00:21:44,631 --> 00:21:48,905
And the probability of them mating with someone who's big A big

291
00:21:48,905 --> 00:21:54,160
A themselves is going to be p squared times p squared or p to the 4th.

292
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:57,989
The probability of a big A small A person is 2pq times

293
00:21:57,989 --> 00:22:02,530
the probability of a big A big A person is going to be p squared.

294
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:07,481
So the probability of that mating type is 2 times p to the 3rd times q.

295
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:13,484
We can also look at the probability of each type of offspring that is

296
00:22:13,484 --> 00:22:15,780
a product of these mating types.

297
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:19,292
So if you have a mating type big A big A times big A big A,

298
00:22:19,292 --> 00:22:23,991
the only kind of offspring you can get from that is big A big A offspring.

299
00:22:23,991 --> 00:22:26,149
And they have probability 1,

300
00:22:26,149 --> 00:22:30,383
while the other two types of offspring have probability 0.

301
00:22:30,383 --> 00:22:35,535
Big A small A times big A big A has the probability of having

302
00:22:35,535 --> 00:22:41,403
a big A big A offspring of 0.5, and a big A small A offspring of 0.5.

303
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,644
You can do this for the entire table.

304
00:22:45,644 --> 00:22:50,475
And what you eventually find is that if you multiply a cross, so

305
00:22:50,475 --> 00:22:55,120
for example, for the mating type big A big A times big A big A,

306
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,883
you've got that probability of the mating type p to the 4th.

307
00:22:59,883 --> 00:23:04,365
If you multiply that by the probability that this mating type will

308
00:23:04,365 --> 00:23:08,683
produce the big A big A offspring, the probability over here,

309
00:23:08,683 --> 00:23:13,921
the probability of the offspring times the probability of the mating type.

310
00:23:13,921 --> 00:23:20,127
You get p to the 4th under big A big A and 0 for the other two genotype groups here.

311
00:23:20,127 --> 00:23:23,381
Here, the probability is 2 times p to the 3rd q.

312
00:23:23,381 --> 00:23:27,650
Each of these two offspring have a 0.5 probability of happening.

313
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:31,949
So they each get p to the 3rd q as their probability of happening,

314
00:23:31,949 --> 00:23:35,399
if we choose just a random person in the population.

315
00:23:35,399 --> 00:23:40,074
If you actually work through the math, you can actually sum all of

316
00:23:40,074 --> 00:23:45,358
the probabilities for big A big A, and you will get eventually p squared.

317
00:23:45,358 --> 00:23:51,191
For big A small A, you'll get 2pq, and for small A small A, you'll get q squared.

318
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,290
You have to do a little math to work that out.

319
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:58,930
So you can see the math below for someone who's big A big A.

320
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:03,434
So you've got the probabilities p to the 4th plus p to

321
00:24:03,434 --> 00:24:07,952
the 3rd q plus p to the 3rd q plus p squared q squared.

322
00:24:07,952 --> 00:24:10,357
You do a substitution of 1-p for q,

323
00:24:10,357 --> 00:24:13,935
because you know p plus q is always gonna be equal to 1.

324
00:24:13,935 --> 00:24:15,441
You solve through that, and

325
00:24:15,441 --> 00:24:18,790
p squared ends up being the only term that doesn't cancel out.

326
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,110
So what does that mean?

327
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:24,953
That means that if you have random mating,

328
00:24:24,953 --> 00:24:31,060
all this meeting type is based on probability of allele frequency.

329
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:35,706
All of the offspring are based on probabilities of transmitting alleles

330
00:24:35,706 --> 00:24:38,010
given the genotype of the parents.

331
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:43,665
So even if you have a population that's completely out of Hardy-Weinberg

332
00:24:43,665 --> 00:24:48,691
equilibrium, it will only take one generation of random mating to

333
00:24:48,691 --> 00:24:53,741
restore the genotype frequencies as p squared + 2pq + q square.
