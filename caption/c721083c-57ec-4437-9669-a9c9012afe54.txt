1
00:00:05,272 --> 00:00:08,827
Now that we've had a chance to
really think about the structure and

2
00:00:08,827 --> 00:00:12,510
function of public health and
craft a definition of public health and

3
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:16,636
its role in our society, I want to take
a deeper dive into the history of public

4
00:00:16,636 --> 00:00:19,876
health through a brief documentary
history narrated by Dr.

5
00:00:19,876 --> 00:00:24,194
Ken Warner, former Dean of the University
of Michigan School of Public Health,

6
00:00:24,194 --> 00:00:29,230
and Professor Emeritus in the Department
of Health Management and Policy.

7
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:32,100
As you learn more about
the history of public health,

8
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:36,290
think about some of the important
questions that we've discussed.

9
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:40,750
How was public health playing
a role in improving societal health

10
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,260
at different moments in history?

11
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,110
What are some of the challenges that
you think public health professionals

12
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:51,080
might have faced when they
were designing interventions?

13
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,780
What core values of public
health were being forged

14
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,640
as public health developed over time?

15
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,960
And finally, what would you have
done differently as a public health

16
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,733
professional if you had been a stakeholder
involved in making decisions?
