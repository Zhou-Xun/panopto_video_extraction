00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:12,780
Joshua Bosman: hi.

2
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,120
Laura Power: how's it going.

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,460
Joshua Bosman: Okay, I don't know if you saw my email but.

4
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,650
Laura Power: i'm feeling now.

5
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,560
I didn't.

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:31,590
Laura Power: i'm sorry to hear that let's see do you need anything i'm sorry I didn't see your email, yet no worries.

7
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:37,230
Joshua Bosman: um no i'm just letting you know that I think my cameras should be off today.

8
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:41,700
Laura Power: Okay, fair enough yeah.

9
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,180
Laura Power: Sorry, I didn't see that I was.

10
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:51,840
Laura Power: Around but good Okay, well, I hope, you're all right and i'm bet some sounds fair, so you just let me know if you need anything okay.

11
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,680
Joshua Bosman: Thank you yeah I think i'll be fine she said.

12
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:53,790
yeah.

13
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:56,640
Laura Power: Everybody.

14
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:30,810
Laura Power: Good day.

15
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:48,090
Laura Power: Close out all the screens on my computer right now open.

16
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:54,990
Laura Power: how's the weather in Texas today for my Texas people.

17
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:57,420
Aliyah Abdul-Wakil: It is hot.

18
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:01,830
Aliyah Abdul-Wakil: As usual.

19
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:04,290
Aliyah Abdul-Wakil: So yeah.

20
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:06,030
Laura Power: yeah.

21
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,920
Laura Power: Today, to super hot.

22
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:15,420
yeah.

23
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:23,490
Laura Power: yeah thanks for the note josh josh is still there he's there behind the scenes, making everything go so josh will help us.

24
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:28,560
Laura Power: As leaders today.

25
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:40,890
Laura Power: let's wait a minute or two before we get started.

26
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:51,390
Laura Power: Just two more days of the summer session I feel like it's a must be a long three weeks for those of you during the whole session the long week, even if you're just doing the one.

27
00:03:51,390 --> 00:04:02,730
Laura Power: The one week or the one class but it's fine kind of all packed in there, so two more days ago are flying through them are covering a lot of material, this really is.

28
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:12,270
Laura Power: it's really is one credit worth of material crammed into one week, so you guys should feel proud of yourselves are making it through i'm sticking with it.

29
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:20,070
Laura Power: and keeping your energy up and we got through hump Day yesterday and I felt it was tough we had systems, thinking it was kind of a.

30
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:34,710
Laura Power: You know, deep I don't know if you guys felt like a rabbit hole, but I feel that, and I think you came with me, I know if I lost you too much, I hope I hope you're good you're still here so i'll take that as a good sign.

31
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:45,630
Laura Power: So I know a couple people, let me know they'd be running a little bit late today, so I think I will just go ahead and get started, and first maybe just.

32
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:59,880
Laura Power: Just to check in I know the teams you all ended your Day yesterday with thinking through your different visualizations yesterday, in fact, one team, I actually left the zoom session before team one was even done so I don't know what time you guys finished that.

33
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,720
Laura Power: You guys are working hard and I think.

34
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:11,100
Laura Power: So very dedicated I had to go out to go get my dog and doggie daycare so I just love to zoom session and you guys kept working so.

35
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,860
Laura Power: good for you.

36
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:33,570
Laura Power: Any reflections about the process of you had brainstorm yourself and then you came together as a group, as any reflections the helpful, did you get different perspectives, it was a like.

37
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:36,750
Laura Power: And list was totally.

38
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:51,000
Laura Power: There really are yes in fact actually let's see who see me it was your team right with and what Andy you guys you and i'd like you, if you don't mind, could you talk about the tool that you use because I didn't.

39
00:05:51,000 --> 00:06:01,320
Laura Power: advertise that one to the class and you actually show I didn't realize it was a shared working tool, I wonder if you could tell the class about it.

40
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,200
Anne Victoria Lee: Okay i'll pull it up in a second.

41
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,820
Good.

42
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:14,370
Laura Power: yeah I popped into their breakout room and they had a great tool that was like a shared but they were all in there kind of like a Google Doc.

43
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:23,310
Laura Power: And I hadn't I hadn't I have a link on the canvas page, but I wasn't ahead and do that one as much myself, so I was happy to see them using it.

44
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:39,300
Anne Victoria Lee: And the tool is called online dot visual slash paradigm.com and at least one person has to pay for a subscription in order to.

45
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:44,910
Anne Victoria Lee: Get the document that you're working on to save.

46
00:06:44,910 --> 00:07:00,540
Anne Victoria Lee: And that i'm at least one person was able to work on it at the same time, I was on it and everybody else could see it, but it was um I think if more of us had had a paper.

47
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:03,720
Anne Victoria Lee: saying we can have all worked on it at the same time.

48
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,790
Anne Victoria Lee: It was only $5.

49
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:08,790
Laura Power: to pay for it, though I.

50
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:12,060
Laura Power: didn't advertise with any classes, I tend to pick the free one.

51
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:23,580
Laura Power: yeah I know it's $5 So if you really wanted there it is, and they did use it, but that's probably why I didn't advertise it in the past one or this time was because.

52
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:32,850
Laura Power: I tend to sort through and find the free ones, to bring up to class and movies free so that's why i've chosen that one and other ones like that bubble.us.

53
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:42,240
Laura Power: There is even what is the you know jam board now on Google, I think your classes, people like to use the jam boards and things like that so there's other tools, you can use it.

54
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,530
Yolaine A Civil: Do you find it user friendly.

55
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:54,420
Anne Victoria Lee: yeah like it is and we could have a little bit more control over the shapes and colors and.

56
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,780
Anne Victoria Lee: The text you can change all that.

57
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,430
Okay.

58
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:03,090
Yolaine A Civil: tutorial video or something and how to use it.

59
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:04,440
Anne Victoria Lee: i'm.

60
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,170
Yolaine A Civil: Just kind of figured out.

61
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:11,190
Anne Victoria Lee: kind of figure it out it's cutting catches.

62
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:11,640
Anne Victoria Lee: Okay.

63
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:15,690
Yolaine A Civil: cuz I had trouble with the loop.

64
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:30,810
Laura Power: yeah yeah we got to tinker around with and play with so it's You know, as this is finding a tool that makes sense for you and it's a bit you like you can you know, obviously, you could do manually as well to start it depends on the setting what you're trying to do, but.

65
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:36,540
Laura Power: For that activity yesterday, the point of what was really the process of it.

66
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:48,630
Laura Power: And I think if I talked to a couple different groups, I mean, I think you all notice that they get pretty messy you know that was definitely something that stood out but it actually I don't think.

67
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:57,000
Laura Power: Oh, I don't case just joining in Kate you had mentioned that really long I think visualization tool, you mentioned that to me.

68
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:09,840
Laura Power: Like 20 pages, or something like clearly it's more about the process it's not about like you're making something that's useful as a visualization tool for us it's really more about the activity together okay.

69
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,550
Laura Power: yeah I mean like yeah.

70
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:25,650
Kate E Schedel: You can go down a rabbit hole with anyone's thing if you think you know you're just talking about insulin and you put in insurance can be its own thing or people can be its own thing and I just can expand and expand keep getting bigger.

71
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:28,470
Laura Power: Exactly yeah can get pretty massive.

72
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:38,190
Laura Power: So I think you know my theory for using it, and you know in from what i've also just read about and learn about you know, out of it really is about the process itself with this is.

73
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:45,300
Laura Power: This is a tool for collaboration is trying to get people on the same page and so that's that's where it's helpful for.

74
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:56,130
Laura Power: And yeah exactly like it's just nice build a brainstorm sometimes and i'm in some different I work in some different projects and there's a certain group that loves to use the for us.

75
00:09:56,130 --> 00:10:04,860
Laura Power: Things like this, or this one, we were using damn or in a lot, and now I think mural which is kind of like jam board, but I think that one has a paid subscription that.

76
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:17,310
Laura Power: This group has, but they like to use mural a lot now so, but it is helpful and it really is it helps you see the bigger system and see like who is connected and.

77
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:25,050
Laura Power: Who, you should be thinking about, so I think you know you'll be sharing your your pictures with the class tomorrow.

78
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:40,260
Laura Power: don't worry if your if your visualizations are like feels like Messier ally, and I think what when you do presented like talking about the process of maybe highlighting how you did it or what directions, it took you in some big points you could you could point out, but.

79
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:51,270
Laura Power: The map itself is not meant to be like a beautiful figure that you're going to you know publish to to try to get a message across it's really about the brainstorming process so.

80
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:58,740
Laura Power: Alright, so share real quick i'm going to do a little bit of a recap, is a very brief recap.

81
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:05,100
Laura Power: And then i'm actually going to give you all braces check in with your teams real quick on a couple items.

82
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:12,570
Laura Power: So let's see where i'm Dave for so we're doing systems thinking and we're linking it to policy evaluation, so.

83
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:22,980
Laura Power: we're taking a little bit of turn to start thinking about policy policies, a bit more a bit more concrete and some of the stuff we've been talking about but i'm trying to link it all together and how.

84
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:33,750
Laura Power: Leadership public health, you know how we shape health is often through policy and how a systems thinking approach can be applied to policy.

85
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:39,360
Laura Power: So that's kind of where we're trying to go today so it's a little bit of a different direction than yesterday but i'll be trying to bring in.

86
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:47,220
Laura Power: Some of the concepts that we've talked about so we'll do i'm gonna do a little recap and i'll do just some very basic introduction to health policy.

87
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:53,730
Laura Power: I am not a health policy expert, this is sort of like a very general health policy overview if others have.

88
00:11:53,730 --> 00:12:06,690
Laura Power: More than one to add in while we're talking about it, but I think just giving the broad picture of health policy and how it ties in I think it's helpful and then we'll work on a logic model so.

89
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:12,330
Laura Power: kind of in the spirit of systems thinking and that this is another visualization tool to think through.

90
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:27,390
Laura Power: A policy, it can be used for programs to and we'll talk about that, but that's something that you'll work on together, and I do get a policy, you might have found for your topic that you chose and that's i'm going to have you all check in together on in a few minutes here.

91
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:31,620
Laura Power: we'll do a break, as usual we'll come back and talk about health and all policies.

92
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:46,380
Laura Power: concept so just remember broader concept that kind of aligns with the public health 3.0 ideas and then do it another brief activity, but a health lens analysis for the policy and then give you some time to gather just to work on the presentation.

93
00:12:46,380 --> 00:13:03,480
Laura Power: slides are linked, here they were just leaned against a refresher canvas page if it's not there and then just a list of resources here that I want to point out kind of along with here, some of them are more about the idea of policy and impact evaluation and impact assessments.

94
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:08,610
Laura Power: Some ideas about health equity, especially health and all policies.

95
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:20,070
Laura Power: Health analysis tool that will use later and I didn't want to point out there's another podcast this is from the region five public health training Center which were in Michigan is in region five.

96
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:34,140
Laura Power: And they sponsor or they sort of organize a podcast so one of them was about policy surveillance and we go out the genealogy so that might be interesting, you can check out the other podcast episodes there.

97
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:47,040
Laura Power: Right so for first so just really briefly i'm just trying to recap right now and and then make sort of a connection into the policy idea.

98
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:54,060
Laura Power: And just a reminder that we were really in this class focusing more on those strategic skills, but.

99
00:13:54,060 --> 00:14:00,330
Laura Power: What did we call them the high performance skills, not the soft skills, the high performance strategic skills.

100
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:05,820
Laura Power: And you know systems thinking is one of them spent a bit of time on that yesterday.

101
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:12,840
Laura Power: Something we've kind of touched on a few others like how you approach problems with linking that to a systems thinking approach.

102
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:28,230
Laura Power: And we're going to just touch on the policy aspect of things a little bit, but you know that's important regardless of what your specialized skill, is where we're trying to focus on so just kind of a reminder of where we are in things.

103
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:31,800
Laura Power: And then very.

104
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:37,230
Oh let's see.

105
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:48,480
Laura Power: hold on a SEC so you're not seeing the regular presentation view it looks like maybe I selected the wrong screen hold on, let me re share.

106
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,130
Laura Power: Maybe I also forgot to click that.

107
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:53,880
Laura Power: again.

108
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,920
Samantha Lyons: i'm just needs big font.

109
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:02,700
Laura Power: Thank you, no, thank you, you know I thought I didn't pay attention to the screen and I put it into share mode so thanks for pointing out.

110
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,050
Laura Power: Okay, good good so yeah.

111
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:16,740
Laura Power: We are just looking at, so you actually see it, thank you for that, so we were looking at the public lt and reminding ourselves where systems thinking falls into that and our high performance strategic skills.

112
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:26,820
Laura Power: And then I saw just done just very brief recap, so we could I know i've to me, I feel like the systems thinking is my favorite part of the class actually.

113
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:33,180
Laura Power: is thinking about thinking and the systems, but I know it is a bit more abstract so that's why I want to do a little bit of a recap.

114
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:48,570
Laura Power: So systems, the different parts of the system we know it has elements interconnections and purpose was all come together how you know something a bunch of things together our system is because they have a purpose and they will function and they they affect each other.

115
00:15:48,570 --> 00:16:01,710
Laura Power: We talked about complexity complex problems complex systems, we talked about those complex adaptive systems, we know there's different behaviors and systems and that can be from the.

116
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:14,010
Laura Power: feedback and reinforcing and balancing feedback loops there's adaptation to the behavior of a large system because of things that are happening within a system.

117
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:21,660
Laura Power: And why we do systems thinking again is you're trying to understand the big picture it's really and that's really a lot of what it is, is big picture.

118
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:32,250
Laura Power: Understanding what's going on and benefits the really big benefit why this is helpful, is it helps to find points of leverage so when you're trying to have impact on something you want to know.

119
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:47,340
Laura Power: Where might you have leveraged by and by understanding that all the bigger picture, you can see that better and, hopefully, you can look out for unintended consequences and we'll get into that a little bit today.

120
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:57,420
Laura Power: So you can kind of think about you know how you address that this idea of unintended consequences and the change in behavior so kind of a hierarchy of.

121
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:12,990
Laura Power: impact that you can have so sometimes you want changes that you have say you're going to implement something you don't want to have a lot of unintended consequences, especially if they're negative one sometimes they're positive but you want to have very.

122
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:23,790
Laura Power: big change in behavior often you're trying to make an impact and trying to do something so you want to have high leverage and you're trying to find this area where you're really making a lot of.

123
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:38,460
Laura Power: Impact change in behavior but you're really having low unintended consequence and so ideally by thinking through the big picture, you can try to avoid on the intended consequence because they kind of be negative, but they might be positive.

124
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:46,590
Laura Power: And then you can actually have more change so that's really where you want to be.

125
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:56,100
Laura Power: And both of these figures are taken from one of those I I showed you yesterday I didn't play the video, but the CDC has a couple videos about systems thinking.

126
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:02,550
Laura Power: And these the last slide and this slide was actually a few slides are taken those fingers are from there.

127
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:13,380
Laura Power: And they that's where I got these from, so this is my favorite one because it talks about you know where where it's really helpful to do systems thinking and I we said yesterday, how it can be.

128
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:18,720
Laura Power: overwhelming there's so many models like what is it and you first start learning about it.

129
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:26,610
Laura Power: You might be focused on the nitty gritty of each of the little graphs and the right process and how to do it.

130
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:37,170
Laura Power: And you can kind of get more complex like you can do just kind of plain simple brainstorming kind of a conversational like we talked about yesterday, like the tips and tricks like.

131
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:39,690
Laura Power: Maybe it's just how you asked a question, instead of.

132
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:50,910
Laura Power: You know this didn't work out because of that it's asking a broader question is like well why you know why is this happening, where what's the underlying mental model so that can be more of a conversational approach to systems thinking.

133
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:59,010
Laura Power: But then you can start to get a little more sophisticated you can draw those trend over time graphs like we saw in that example from Calvin county about.

134
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:10,140
Laura Power: Trying to address the homeless population and he showed a trend time graph or you could draw back and flow maps, so you can kind of make these models.

135
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:17,880
Laura Power: And then it can get more and more complex as to what he calls in his video, the mother of all models, where you just get like super complicated, but really.

136
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:22,470
Laura Power: What you're seeing here on this is like the value of doing that, so you can spend a lot of time.

137
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:32,700
Laura Power: Making these perfect models and really, really intricate models, but the value that you start to lose that over time, so the point is like don't get too overwhelmed.

138
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:41,670
Laura Power: See how they're helpful their service sweet spot that you can be really easy to was when when you need them, but don't get caught up in the.

139
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:49,620
Laura Power: Too much intricacy and details of trying to divine something is really about having an expanded field of vision.

140
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:59,520
Laura Power: And having a shared picture, with people that are collaborating on so I thought, especially when I was first entering into the space and thinking about it, I definitely felt.

141
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:05,490
Laura Power: I guess I didn't have much guidance to come along I was trying to figure it out, myself and I definitely remember feeling.

142
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:16,590
Laura Power: Like there was a right way to do it, or you know different equations or different steps I needed to follow, and I was a bit overwhelmed and I was looking at all those catalogs of the different systems thinking.

143
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:27,390
Laura Power: tools and it just it just be a little overwhelming, but as I got to understand it better, I thought Okay, you know really it's not that complicated and the end.

144
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:36,030
Laura Power: So just some summary kind of what you know what is it, why are you doing it you're trying to find some leverage and trying to understand potential consequences.

145
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:42,570
Laura Power: What do you do and how do you do it, you just try to step back get on the balcony, as they say in adaptive leadership.

146
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:50,130
Laura Power: Words or expand your field of vision, see the bigger picture, so you can do that by thinking through time and space.

147
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:56,220
Laura Power: Thinking about the connections drawing it out visualizing it so that's through building a shared picture, making sure.

148
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:05,100
Laura Power: you're all the people that you're bringing together see the same thing so you're using visualization tools and by sometimes doing that in an iterative process.

149
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:15,990
Laura Power: You start to build confidence around a certain idea or a certain plan or certain approach that you're taking so they're never perfect but, as you work on the more they become less and less wrong, as he says.

150
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:27,630
Laura Power: And then you know, to make it useful, as you fine tune things you really try to make it as simple as possible, so you're capturing the essential important pieces that are important for what you're doing.

151
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:36,630
Laura Power: So, over time, if you really do work on them like if you were to if I was to ask you to to keep reworking your maps that you made.

152
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:48,750
Laura Power: You might eventually actually simplify them, you would remove some of the unnecessary things that aren't really helping you answer a specific question I want to have you do that, during this class but that's how that's how you make progress in that.

153
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:55,110
Laura Power: All right, questions at all some of that was recap.

154
00:21:55,110 --> 00:22:06,690
Laura Power: Okay, so what i'm going to do first, before I launch into the summary of the policy evaluation and policy stuff I want, I want to just do a quick check in with your teams.

155
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:14,220
Laura Power: Because just to remind you, I was hoping that you might try to find some policy related to your topic that you chose.

156
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:19,470
Laura Power: Maybe some you know about what I want you to do is just maybe take a few minutes, with the team.

157
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:26,880
Laura Power: And just talk to each other and see who found water, if you found anything yet so that way you'll know if you should maybe you could you know.

158
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:35,520
Laura Power: You can be googling or searching or you know, making sure you're feeling good about having a policy so i'll let you all talk together for a few minutes and then.

159
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:47,700
Laura Power: bring you back as a group and don't worry don't panic if you're all together, and you haven't found one will still figure it out together, but I want you all to check in right now, so you can have a just a sense of where your team is.

160
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:54,180
Laura Power: All right, okay so josh go ahead and put everybody in the breakout rooms and i'll just be for maybe.

161
00:22:54,180 --> 00:23:02,160
Laura Power: Like a few just a few minutes.

162
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:09,210
Joshua Bosman: looks like there's a few people not here right now, but everyone has at least a partner.

163
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:10,860
Laura Power: that's good.

164
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:20,520
Laura Power: With somebody talk to see.

165
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:50,760
what's here.

166
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:54,150
Laura Power: A few minutes check in so they can touch base.

167
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:58,410
Laura Power: If anyone actually found one they can start googling and they don't have one.

168
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:05,220
Nice.

169
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:14,310
Joshua Bosman: I was thinking during my thesis work I just can't I literally can't imagine doing research with how Google it's so nice.

170
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:18,390
Laura Power: No right.

171
00:24:18,390 --> 00:26:50,310
Laura Power: Google everything.

172
00:26:50,310 --> 00:28:16,680
Joshua Bosman: sounds good.

173
00:28:16,680 --> 00:29:09,690
Joshua Bosman: ready.

174
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:14,490
Laura Power: how's your team doing were you guys able to find a policy or any.

175
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:16,500
Anthony Mack: Oh we're missing quintin.

176
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,550
Anthony Mack: Today, so.

177
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,050
Laura Power: He said he'd be a little bit late.

178
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:23,850
Anthony Mack: yeah so we have three pretty good topics.

179
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:29,670
Anthony Mack: So we're going to meet again after that group or timing.

180
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:31,620
Anthony Mack: Can hash out which one to go.

181
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:43,890
Laura Power: Good okay that's great so you got you got material to work with okay just checking good oh look it's nice to see you all, with your videos on and makes me happy there you are so.

182
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:49,440
Laura Power: What about the other teams let's see I was just talking to team to.

183
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:57,840
Laura Power: Howard, how are the other groups doing any concerns you have policies in mind.

184
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:03,420
Laura Power: Okay, good I see some nodding heads Okay, nobody looks.

185
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:05,460
Laura Power: Okay, I just wanted you.

186
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:08,040
Laura Power: To check in.

187
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,290
Laura Power: and make sure.

188
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:13,950
Laura Power: All right, very good Okay, so what i'm getting.

189
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,930
Laura Power: Like.

190
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:20,010
Laura Power: me with my.

191
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:26,280
Laura Power: Okay, all right i'm gonna feel here with some trouble with the sound, but it feels better, I think.

192
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:33,090
Laura Power: All right, i'm gonna share the slides yeah there is some feedback, so I don't know.

193
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:38,310
Laura Power: I don't know if that's me or if maybe need to unmute.

194
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:40,620
Laura Power: Their.

195
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:43,440
computers.

196
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,220
Laura Power: yeah go ahead and mute if you are not.

197
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:50,940
Laura Power: muted, just in case there was some feedback so that seems better okay that's good.

198
00:30:50,940 --> 00:31:03,420
Laura Power: Thank you guys alright getting back to this slide so alright so sounds like you all have found some policies to think about that relate to the topic you chose.

199
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:13,020
Laura Power: So and i'm going to do is just do a very kind of basic introduction to the idea of health policy and then touch a little bit on.

200
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:22,980
Laura Power: impact evaluation and where that kind of fits in and how trying to relate that to systems thinking so i'm trying to connect all these ideas here.

201
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:36,120
Laura Power: And then we'll move into the logic model which is sort of sort of a way of doing systems thinking, and that is a visualization tool, so I think that that's kind of why i'm bringing that in here.

202
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:48,870
Laura Power: And I want to just link things back in that you know we're again talking about policy which might feel a little bit of a turn from what we were talking about the last few days, but I do want to connect it to those.

203
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:58,500
Laura Power: The core functions of public health assessment policy development and assurance and how that kind of links in with the.

204
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:10,560
Laura Power: 10 essential services of public health, so just remember, we talked about those on the first days i'm trying to connect those with you today.

205
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:18,750
Laura Power: And really through policy, this is really how we impact health how things get done how we're.

206
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:27,210
Laura Power: really trying to make a difference in health, in our society, and we talked about our definition of health and we talked about.

207
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:38,730
Laura Power: The definition of public health, and then you know how all those great achievements that we made in public albums were all really through public health laws which, in essence, is public health policy.

208
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:45,270
Laura Power: and political policies working in very complex system, so you find about complexity.

209
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:50,640
Laura Power: And when you're trying to do policy and get things done, that sending can be very messy.

210
00:32:50,640 --> 00:33:05,670
Laura Power: And it probably won't surprise you, and I think it's interesting to talk about this in the summer session for epidemiology, where you know we're very focused on data and methods and having strong robust research evidence to.

211
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:14,760
Laura Power: You know figure out what makes sense what's working what's not working, but when it comes to public health policy and many laws and regulations and policies.

212
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,310
Laura Power: Those are often based on.

213
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:28,260
Laura Power: Not so much on robust evidence, sometimes you know so we're thinking a lot about that and epidemiology we're thinking about understanding the evidence, what does it mean what the end of the day, to patterns.

214
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:35,130
Laura Power: What associations can we find what can we think about cope causality is there a way to get it causality.

215
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:44,610
Laura Power: When policies are made that's not always taking into account it's not that it never is but it's not always the top of mind and policy makers i'm thinking.

216
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:52,800
Laura Power: So the evidence can be this broad and can be skewed or sort of shaping a certain narrative sometimes.

217
00:33:52,800 --> 00:34:11,910
Laura Power: And oftentimes more individual level story sometimes have a bigger impact on what's happening with public health policy so something to keep in mind you're thinking about how these things are created and how they're used to try to make a difference and have impact.

218
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:17,700
Laura Power: So what is policy and there's a it's really a lot of different things it's a broad term but.

219
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:29,790
Laura Power: Policy is a law regulation procedure and misery of action incentive or other volunteer practice of governments or other institutions, so it really can be a lot of things it's actually a broad term in that sense, so it's.

220
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:41,880
Laura Power: You know, and you hear me talking about laws and and although policy and programs are different they're very related so sometimes programs are built around but a policy like a policy can shape a program.

221
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:48,180
Laura Power: And you'll probably hear me use those words interchangeably i'll talk about program evaluation policy evaluation they're.

222
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:55,830
Laura Power: Different but they're kind of the same because programs kind of fall from what policies are to shape them so.

223
00:34:55,830 --> 00:35:14,550
Laura Power: As I mentioned earlier, those 10 the greatest public health achievements of the 20th century, those were really from La and really from which is policy so policy changes I made those great achievement that's why it's so important for for public health.

224
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:21,510
Laura Power: Sometimes you'll hear people talk about big T and little pee so big P policy and little P policy.

225
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:39,030
Laura Power: Big P is more formal so laws, rules and regulations, things are enacted by elected officials and little P would be things more from organizations guidelines internal agencies and voluntary practices so.

226
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:50,160
Laura Power: I think this is helpful to think about that because it just gives you a broader understanding of the different types of policies that are out there.

227
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:54,210
Laura Power: So again, the evidence is used is not always.

228
00:35:54,210 --> 00:36:08,580
Laura Power: The most robust when when policies are brought forward or created and it's often a story that really can make the have a lot more power, sometimes in the data so as you're learning about in your classes.

229
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:25,650
Laura Power: You know, having good quantitative or even qualitative evidence that's very helpful and then a lot of it is about how you talk about it and the stories, you can bring to kind of to make make that connect with people and the people that are making the policies.

230
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:34,830
Laura Power: And there was actually a study it's a little bit older study now is published, published in 2009 and American journal, public health, but looking at the the.

231
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:45,720
Laura Power: Evidence for policy so they're trying to they were looking to see it was there a gap between what evidence is out there and what policies are enacted and enforced.

232
00:36:45,720 --> 00:37:00,990
Laura Power: So they looked for what they called model public health law's, meaning that the the law was recommended by at least one organization it looked from 1907 to 2004 and they analyze and look for the data and look for.

233
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:14,460
Laura Power: You know why those policies were brought forward and the reasons and in their analysis they found that only 44% of the sponsors of the different laws presented information on how the policies or ideas are developed.

234
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:25,980
Laura Power: Only 7% presented information on the adoption, how I have it adopted and no sponsors provided information for effectiveness of the laws that they were trying to bring forward.

235
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:42,600
Laura Power: So that's just one study but it's just kind of bringing home the point that a lot of times policies and like laws, maybe aren't always based on strong evidence and so that can make things a little bit messy at times.

236
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:50,490
Laura Power: So the policy process, this is a very general, this is from there's a CDC page about health policy so some of these slides are taken from there.

237
00:37:50,490 --> 00:38:07,740
Laura Power: And they described the policy process of sort of it, you know so kind of common sense or Problem Solving program you know cycle, but first it's identifying the problem and understanding what the what is it you're trying to solve with a policy that you're making what are the root causes.

238
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:23,130
Laura Power: Then analyzing the possible policy options so that's the policy analysis like what are different approaches it could be taken if you're trying to address a certain issue, what are the different ways that you can do that.

239
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:34,110
Laura Power: And then, as you move forward strategy and policy development so you've decided on an approach and you're thinking about how you want to do this, what how you implement.

240
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:41,100
Laura Power: And not like the planning for it, so what, how will you do this, how will you enact it, what is the route you're going to take.

241
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:53,520
Laura Power: The policy enactment is when it's actually authorized so whether it's voted on, or you know how you're actually going to get the authority to do the policy and the actions behind it.

242
00:38:53,520 --> 00:39:00,420
Laura Power: And then policy implementation, which is really how you actually get it done and a lot of times you know, this can.

243
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:09,480
Laura Power: This is a big part where sometimes there's good intentions with the policy, but how it's actually implemented can really make a difference and the impact that policy can have.

244
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:27,360
Laura Power: So that's sort of the cycle we'll talk a little bit about some of the earlier stages, just because I think i'm trying to tie in the systems thinking approach here so we'll kind of focus on that for the earlier stage and then we'll get into some impact evaluation.

245
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:37,800
Laura Power: So the first part is problem identification so understanding what is it that you're trying to address, and I think this is really a big connection to systems thinking and.

246
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:49,530
Laura Power: Understanding what's going on is really under understanding the root cause so it's that mental model, the iceberg approach, what is going on, deeper down, that is the problem you're trying to address.

247
00:39:49,530 --> 00:40:07,530
Laura Power: And that may include some of the brainstorming approaches that we've talked about like the five Wise approach or the causal tree diagram where you kind of keep going upstream to see why something is the way it is so really understanding, the problem is important.

248
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:13,440
Laura Power: And there's many different stakeholders that you might take, along with you on this, while you're trying to figure that out, but it's.

249
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:27,240
Laura Power: Probably you know, this might be obvious, but the people who are affected by the policy or who are directly involved in, or being responsible for it, or whose jobs or lives, not be affected Community lever meters neighborhoods.

250
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:37,020
Laura Power: Other organizations local health department state health departments, you can see all kinds of stakeholders really may have input.

251
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:54,780
Laura Power: That can be a lot and how to organize that can be very challenging so it's to those tools of trying to bring lots of people together trying to have a shared agenda and common vision of where you're trying to go, so what easier said than done that's for sure.

252
00:40:54,780 --> 00:41:15,090
Laura Power: And maybe i'll stop there and see, especially from our I know we've got several public health practitioners with us, and if anyone's had any experience along these lines that they might want to share I was checking on that first.

253
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:26,700
Laura Power: Some of our group might be at the point where policies are implemented and then you've got to figure out how to get your work done around them.

254
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:29,520
alright.

255
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:33,120
Laura Power: Alright, just checking in to see okay so i'll keep going.

256
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:43,200
Laura Power: So, then, the idea of policy analysis which is trying to figure out what would be good, what are the options what types of ideas can be brought forward.

257
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:49,890
Laura Power: So these are looking at different potential policies to you know put forward or to propose and.

258
00:41:49,890 --> 00:42:08,310
Laura Power: Thinking through what makes the most sense and looking at what's going to be more efficient and effective and more feasible and maybe have the biggest impact and again this is where you can be using systems thinking and all those cross sector collaboration skills that we talked about.

259
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:14,700
Laura Power: And here's lots of questions that could help think through that one, this is the policy analysis phase again these.

260
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:24,120
Laura Power: lobby summaries are coming from the CDC that's where i've taken these tables from so you can find them at this link here, if you want to read more read the context, from which they come.

261
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:32,670
Laura Power: But you know what is like framing questions what's the policy lever, where is it coming from is it a loss and and administrative regulatory.

262
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:42,930
Laura Power: What level of governments will be implementing it, how will operate or the objectives and then thinking through, how will it have impact, how we address the issue.

263
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:58,500
Laura Power: Also things like how much will it cost, where the resources needed and what are the political forces behind it, which is a big one, and probably the toughest wanted to get through So those are things that can be thought about when you're analyzing the different options.

264
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:01,770
Laura Power: And there are different tools is the same from from that same.

265
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:13,050
Laura Power: CDC resource, you can think about you can actually kind of do this in a an organized fashion, if you're really looking through things but you're part of the creation process or maybe you're part of a process it's.

266
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:25,140
Laura Power: going to be making a decision about what to do, you can think through different ideas like the public health impact the feasibility, the economic and budgetary impact, and you can kind of.

267
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:37,590
Laura Power: best you can measure that, based on what you know about the policy to see where it is and that can help decide which one might be the best one to do.

268
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:51,390
Laura Power: And then you know again linking it back to having a systems approach so understanding the problem identifying the leavers of change and then comparing those hypothetical scenarios which would be the policy analysis phase.

269
00:43:51,390 --> 00:44:01,380
Laura Power: And that can include all these using the tools that we've talked about mapping thinking through this stakeholders and modeling different things, what what might happen to.

270
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:21,060
Laura Power: You know if this changes if this goes up or this goes down or this new program is created what might happen, then what are the downstream effects of trying to map that out before you know you implement something to think that, through.

271
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:35,370
Laura Power: And then you know the other steps again strategy and policy development so planning how to develop draft and prepare the policy, how you make it actionable how was enacted what permissions are laws, need to be voted on.

272
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:43,380
Laura Power: and implementation which how a policy is implemented, will certainly in you know, have to do with how.

273
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:56,700
Laura Power: The outcome is of the policy, so you might put something new, a new rule or new guidance or new law might go into place, but if there's no education about it, or maybe there's no enforcement related to it, you know we.

274
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:12,900
Laura Power: Talk about our mass mandates or whatnot that was happening today, you know what's happening or who was supposed to be aware, who was enforcing that and that was the big debate, sometimes, so how effective or something you can think about.

275
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:19,230
Laura Power: vaccine mandates, even for not just Kobe but say for like influenza, you can have a mandate.

276
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:31,200
Laura Power: Policy, but how is it in forest, how is it monitored so that really you know the impact of a mandatory flu vaccine policy for a health system is to really prevent.

277
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:48,300
Laura Power: influenza spread among workers and patients if it's not implemented, while it may not really have any impact that you wanted to have you know it seems kind of obvious but it's important to point out.

278
00:45:48,300 --> 00:46:04,080
Laura Power: Okay, so that's just a general overview like a very general policy process what is policy, I think I like the concept of big P little P, I think it helps me think through it and just shows you how bright, it is and lots of different things can be policies kind of general.

279
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:18,390
Laura Power: So what happens and you've got policy you've implemented it so there's a policy and then often programs related to that that are in place so there's different parts of this and we're working our way to thinking about impact of policy.

280
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:25,140
Laura Power: But there is policy maintenance, which just means you know, keeping a program and its activities going that are related to the policy.

281
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:37,500
Laura Power: there's monitoring, which is just you know, maybe some basic data points that help you see how it's going, but really what you're you know those are just kind of pieces of data about the policy and the related programs.

282
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:51,510
Laura Power: or activities that happen around that with that, but how do you know if a policy is had its intended effect and that's where really things like policy evaluation and impact assessment come in.

283
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:57,300
Laura Power: And this just kind of pointing out the difference of evaluation versus monitoring.

284
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:07,560
Laura Power: and monitoring, do you like down the core impact evaluation so did this activity actually make a difference it's trying to.

285
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:18,570
Laura Power: Trying trying to look at causalities so think of put your epidemiology caps on and think about you know causal inferences and how do you actually get to that through data, it can be very challenging right.

286
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:30,330
Laura Power: So then, outside of that is policy or program evaluation and then outside of that is monitoring and evaluation, so that monitoring and evaluation is just some of the very basic.

287
00:47:30,330 --> 00:47:46,290
Laura Power: Data points of of what's actually happening order the ins and outs and then the program evaluation might be those shorter term outcomes, but the impact is what you're offering trying to get at to know, do you really want is this policy worthwhile or not.

288
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:54,090
Laura Power: So, bringing together the ideas of evaluation and the policy development process, so we went through those phases.

289
00:47:54,090 --> 00:48:04,500
Laura Power: This is just they're just now presented in the linear fashion here problem identification policy analysis strategy and policy development and management and implementation.

290
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:16,920
Laura Power: And you can do evaluations of all those phases, so this part is really more if you're doing an evaluation this part of the phase it's more about content evaluation, so you might be evaluating.

291
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:36,030
Laura Power: What items are inside the policy or program what content items, who is it what's it about this part here implementation evaluation is how How has it been implemented, how was that happening, and then the very end is impact evaluation okay.

292
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:44,040
Laura Power: So content evaluation just thinking through like again examples of content evaluation so.

293
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:53,190
Laura Power: Are there evidence based components of the policy is it consistent or the policy components consistent with those of model policies.

294
00:48:53,190 --> 00:49:09,570
Laura Power: Are the requirements feasible given available resources, what are the key changes originally proposed to how is the content of the policies similar or different from that of others so it's looking at how it's written, what is it intended to be based on how it's written and the plan.

295
00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:20,340
Laura Power: Implementation evaluation looks at those items that really are about implementation so you know if there's a big policy that was written.

296
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:26,820
Laura Power: You know, are there organizations that have that into embedded into their own organizations.

297
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:37,650
Laura Power: Are there citations or enforcement related to that are their training materials or educational materials that have come out for that do people know about the policy or the Program.

298
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:48,300
Laura Power: Is their compliance is there any auditing like this is all just getting data like how are you implementing, how do you know what's happening with a policy.

299
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:59,100
Laura Power: Now impact evaluation again this is getting to the deeper question of does this actually make a difference in the outcome that we're looking for is actually improving health.

300
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:09,960
Laura Power: So this is about attribution and it's trying to get the idea of causal relationship, but of course that can be challenging to really figure out oftentimes our students can only give us associations.

301
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:28,710
Laura Power: And it depends on the epidemiological methods that we use to really understand if you can say that the impact is related to the changes that have been made so it's very difficult it's important to know but it's not always easy to get to these answers.

302
00:50:28,710 --> 00:50:35,130
Laura Power: You can kind of fit break it down and think through the impact in different ways, so did the policy contribute to change.

303
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:44,910
Laura Power: Did the policy produce the intended outcomes and impacts and where there are unintended consequence an unintended consequences of the policy or other things.

304
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:49,500
Laura Power: factoring in, and you can kind of break it down to short term outcomes.

305
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:57,390
Laura Power: intermediate outcomes and really long term impacts so, for example, this first one is looking at seatbelt laws.

306
00:50:57,390 --> 00:51:04,260
Laura Power: And really the whole reason that we have seatbelt laws is to try to decrease injury rates and decrease harm from accidents.

307
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:09,660
Laura Power: So that would be the long term impact right if you're making a law about wearing seatbelts.

308
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:17,220
Laura Power: What is it that you really want to see why are we doing that that is the long term impact, but oftentimes what can be measured.

309
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:28,380
Laura Power: As that lives there may be some short term things like awareness of the seatbelt law or maybe intermediate is using the seatbelt, but long term, what is the bigger picture.

310
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:40,470
Laura Power: Another example attitudes toward violence violent behavior injuries from violence, you can think about how you're what you're looking for what you're studying.

311
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:50,880
Laura Power: So why this matters why impact evaluation matters is really important to know if you can justify your program and thats related to the policies and programs.

312
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:57,600
Laura Power: If you should scale off your program or not, and you know disseminate the policy throughout other areas.

313
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:12,720
Laura Power: and understand you know, is there is this beneficial or not, should we be arguing for this so it's really important to understand the impact and if you need to push forward, for it is this is cost effective, you know these are all really important things to know.

314
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:20,280
Laura Power: Now, a lot of times we don't have a good understanding of unintended consequences of things i'm have a couple of examples of here where.

315
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:38,460
Laura Power: You know, there were laws or policies put in place that ended up having unintended consequences so i'll ask if anyone's familiar with these so first the prohibition in the 1920s, what what are some unintended consequences that you can think of from now.

316
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:44,790
Laura Power: What do you think of when you think of prohibition.

317
00:52:44,790 --> 00:52:48,180
Samantha Lyons: So telling someone not to think of a white elephant.

318
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:50,400
Samantha Lyons: and have a white elephant.

319
00:52:50,400 --> 00:53:00,660
Samantha Lyons: Is it that's what I think of when you telling someone you can't do this that I feel like most people are at least they're just feeling like Well then, I want to do it.

320
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:02,610
Samantha Lyons: So it's a thought.

321
00:53:02,610 --> 00:53:09,780
Laura Power: Totally yeah and then think about what go to Sophie with that timeline if people really they weren't allowed to drink alcohol.

322
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:10,890
Quintin Solano: But I think of.

323
00:53:10,890 --> 00:53:16,440
Quintin Solano: Like speakeasies and the rise of the Mafia and mob moving alcohol back and forth.

324
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:26,250
Laura Power: Exactly so sometimes argue that this was related to being unintended consequence was organized you know games and.

325
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:35,640
Laura Power: yeah just alcohol organized crime that's what i'm trying to say more organized crime coming up from that so that's maybe one when intended consequence.

326
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:50,580
Laura Power: I don't get some Texas people in the audience here, so this is an older one I think I learned because i've talked to other Texas people about this as well, but the Texas top 10% plan, I think it might have a different name now or a different variation but.

327
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:54,780
Laura Power: My Texas, people are you familiar with.

328
00:53:54,780 --> 00:54:03,060
Aliyah Abdul-Wakil: Anyone heard of us, I have no idea what that is but i'm also a Texas transplant so.

329
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:05,340
Laura Power: Little older.

330
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:10,980
Erin Thompson: Is that when like the top 10% of graduating classes automatically got into state schools.

331
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:14,460
Laura Power: Yes, yes, yes, so Aaron you've heard of admin.

332
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:15,120
Erin Thompson: mm hmm.

333
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:25,890
Laura Power: yeah were you aware, so just yeah just like Aaron said this was, I think this was back from the 90s, I want to say, from what i've read about it and I, but I believe.

334
00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:34,620
Laura Power: Our for our private people James was his family in Texas, and he had talked about this, but explained to me that I think they might have changed.

335
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:48,840
Laura Power: slightly different now than the first version of the plan, but it was basically if you were in the top 10% of your high school class, you were guaranteed admission into a state college.

336
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:56,520
Laura Power: Does that sound right here and yeah, and so the unintended consequence for the way I understand it, is that.

337
00:54:56,520 --> 00:55:01,260
Laura Power: People who are able to move, but this was meant to try to benefit people and.

338
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:19,800
Laura Power: include like be more inclusive and allow a wide range of people and want to get into schools were supposed to further educational opportunities, and I think aimed at people that may be needed more help getting in or trying to diversify and allow lots of people to get into college.

339
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:32,160
Laura Power: But certain people who had the ability and resources to move basically relocated to different districts where maybe they weren't as high performing and.

340
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:47,850
Laura Power: Then their students were able to were more likely to be in the top 10% so so people kind of figured out the system and it didn't really that was not really the intention of this I know Aaron does that resonate with that and I kind of getting the spirit of it.

341
00:55:47,850 --> 00:55:57,780
Erin Thompson: yeah that sounds familiar, and I said yeah cuz there's schools within you know even a city there's a lot of variation between the the.

342
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:12,420
Erin Thompson: Competition like I know in Austin there's a couple of magnet school and they're a lot more competitive than not in magnet school, so you could have no people in the top 10% of a non compete school that would fall blow you know top 20% in the magnet school so.

343
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:15,030
Erin Thompson: Exactly yeah.

344
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:25,260
Laura Power: yeah so that was just kind of you know, it was a learning thing I think there may be something like that still going on and but in a different version.

345
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:29,400
Erin Thompson: will be there might still be some kind of version I don't know I haven't heard much about it lately.

346
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:30,840
Laura Power: yeah I think it's different.

347
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:40,860
Erin Thompson: But it's I think there was some kind of version of it when I was graduated went to started college in 2008 so I feel like there was some kind of version number on there.

348
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:43,920
Laura Power: And it was more about admission it wasn't covering.

349
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:46,890
Laura Power: It was amazing so just.

350
00:56:46,890 --> 00:56:52,560
Laura Grage: there's a policy in Alaska that covers cost it's the top 10% of high schoolers.

351
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:53,520
Laura Grage: or get them to.

352
00:56:53,520 --> 00:57:01,590
Laura Grage: State Alaska schools and the costs are covered, it was a little different we only you know, two colleges.

353
00:57:01,590 --> 00:57:03,750
Laura Grage: Well, to state colleges in Alaska.

354
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:05,430
and

355
00:57:05,430 --> 00:57:23,850
Laura Grage: yeah but I hadn't thought about that that that people would move around, to try to get in the top 10% and that's not as applicable in Alaska because there's so few urban locations and most girl residents are are pretty rooted in their and their rural villages and communities so interesting.

356
00:57:23,850 --> 00:57:25,560
Laura Power: yeah very interesting interesting to know that.

357
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:29,070
Laura Grage: left hand that I didn't know that.

358
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:34,770
Laura Power: Okay, how about this other one tax on sugar sweetened beverages.

359
00:57:34,770 --> 00:57:39,690
Laura Power: you've heard about that and from your nutrition classes or.

360
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:46,950
Laura Power: Some cities have experimented with this.

361
00:57:46,950 --> 00:57:54,000
Laura Power: I think there was one study that show, I think it was just in one location, though, the one i'm thinking of, I want to say it was somewhere on New Jersey.

362
00:57:54,000 --> 00:58:04,890
Laura Power: that there was an increase in alcohol purchase, so there was a tax on sugar sweetened beverages, and I think this one study showed that basically people were buying beer, instead of top.

363
00:58:04,890 --> 00:58:13,860
Laura Power: So you know i'm not sure that that was like and all it was just one study, but that was one thing that was maybe an unintended consequence of trying to decrease means of.

364
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:17,910
Laura Power: And purchase of sugar sweetened beverages, because they put more tax on it.

365
00:58:17,910 --> 00:58:26,250
Laura Power: Then they just purchased other stuff that maybe wasn't the intention my baby they wanted people to have more healthy or drinking water and things like that.

366
00:58:26,250 --> 00:58:43,050
Laura Power: And then last example here the California vaccine exemption plan so you know, for a long time there was only two states in our country that did not allow any the only allowed medical exemptions to certain vaccines for school entry.

367
00:58:43,050 --> 00:58:49,020
Laura Power: It was Mississippi and wasn't Virginia and blinking there was to.

368
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:53,520
Laura Power: Think Victoria, is it Mississippi.

369
00:58:53,520 --> 00:59:01,410
Laura Power: I think they don't allow they only allow medical exemption so just those two is that right Victoria.

370
00:59:01,410 --> 00:59:03,630
Victoria Walker: is really strict laws here.

371
00:59:03,630 --> 00:59:12,780
Laura Power: yeah yeah, this is a bs always have strict laws about vaccination and if I think it's I think it's I should know this up top my head, I think it was Virginia to.

372
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:23,370
Laura Power: It sometimes they fit maybe you'll we wouldn't think of as being super strict about vaccination laws, but that's kind of how it's been slowly other states have.

373
00:59:23,370 --> 00:59:26,280
Laura Power: You know, been changing and response to various things this is.

374
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:37,020
Laura Power: A lot of this is more in response to the measles outbreaks that have happened a few years back so California, I had you know many flint Michigan has a philosophical and religious exemptions that are allowed.

375
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:55,620
Laura Power: we've tried to tighten up how they're done, but we still have them and California, a few years back, did change their law so that only I think only medical exemptions are allowed now for school entry for vaccines requirements cool entry.

376
00:59:55,620 --> 01:00:07,980
Laura Power: What unintended consequences have you heard about, or could you think of that might happen with a with a policy to do like that.

377
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:20,700
Laura Grage: Was it something I don't know the answer to this, but i'm speculating that it was something about the medical exemptions getting hijacked by pediatricians that were willing to kind of break bogus exemptions.

378
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,860
Laura Power: exactly they found that their medical.

379
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:23,790
Laura Power: Medical exemptions.

380
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:31,800
Laura Power: To increase so nothing that that's like why you shouldn't do that, but it was just something that was noticed and.

381
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:40,470
Laura Power: It may be that still there were more vaccines happening so it's not it's not that it was necessarily a bad thing, and the best shouldn't have been done, but it was just something that wasn't.

382
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:46,170
Laura Power: Maybe wasn't thought through, or just was something that happened in relation to this policy, so.

383
01:00:46,170 --> 01:00:53,310
Laura Power: So just kind of thinking through policies laws and then potential unintended consequences that can happen, and this.

384
01:00:53,310 --> 01:00:56,880
Laura Power: know we try your best to.

385
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:04,800
Laura Power: plan and avoid, but these will happen, but the idea is trying to think through and even just foresee challenges that might be ahead.

386
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:10,050
Laura Power: You know, so if you're using systems thinking principles, you might be able to think through some of this stuff.

387
01:01:10,050 --> 01:01:20,700
Laura Power: Some other examples, so this is an older one this sort of us sometimes it was a long time ago 1930s, the Cambridge somerville youth study, where it was trying to.

388
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:27,150
Laura Power: Help boys and young men from low income backgrounds and it had to do with it, I.

389
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:35,430
Laura Power: read it like I haven't read all the details of my understanding, it was like a summer camp and they got matched up with mentors and.

390
01:01:35,430 --> 01:01:42,630
Laura Power: It was like this ongoing program and it was there was a longitudinal study associate this was built there was a study built around this.

391
01:01:42,630 --> 01:01:49,080
Laura Power: And they followed up and they found that over it started in the 1930s, I think, late 1930s.

392
01:01:49,080 --> 01:02:00,360
Laura Power: And like 10 years later, and on they did some studies and they found there was really no difference and then actually the end of this but 1978 they found that the treatment group actually fared worse.

393
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:09,480
Laura Power: And then they were involved in more in crime and other life stressors alcoholism stress related diseases, I think, even like.

394
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:21,000
Laura Power: longevity was less than the group that was in this program and there's a lot of speculation, I think this there was a book written here, and I think they have a lot of speculation as to why.

395
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:29,070
Laura Power: But it was just interesting because, at first, this was that to be like a role model program that is new idea of mentoring.

396
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:37,140
Laura Power: at risk, people and, for some reason, this one was really not like, but they only they only knew that because they put this longitudinal study, and so it was.

397
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:47,850
Laura Power: This is sometimes it is an example why it is important to study look back understand our programs and understand if they're actually working and what are the what is happening with that so.

398
01:02:47,850 --> 01:02:58,230
Laura Power: The impact evaluation of this program actually shows the impact was really not what was intended, and I think eventually stopped.

399
01:02:58,230 --> 01:03:10,020
Laura Power: Another one vouchers to attend private schools, this was in Louisiana yeah Jane just talked about this one before our primary residence at him yelling and I know.

400
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:14,520
Laura Power: And they found that students who received vouchers to attend private schools.

401
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:20,730
Laura Power: Actually ended up scoring lower on some of their tests, so there was this idea that the private schools of students went to these private schools.

402
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:29,220
Laura Power: They would do better in school, but then, when they actually studied it the the students that got these vouchers, for some reason didn't do as well as the students that remained in public school.

403
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:39,030
Laura Power: And you know there's probably a lot of layers as to why, and that may be a very like a local situation as whatever was going on but it's just an example of wanting to understand what's happening.

404
01:03:39,030 --> 01:03:55,110
Laura Power: So, it gives me a lot of examples of negative things happening here's one this is kind of a big program that's really expanded now, but this is based on a sort of a cash transfer a welfare incentive program that was.

405
01:03:55,110 --> 01:04:07,080
Laura Power: piloted and it really started in Mexico, where was trying to incentivize healthy behaviors in low income people in Mexico and was aimed at.

406
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:16,440
Laura Power: Women and children, and it was actually found to be very successful, so this is just try and on a positive note, I gave you a lot of negative examples this study actually showed.

407
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:17,400
Laura Power: That there was some.

408
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:27,510
Laura Power: Good examples and this really this program has been replicated in many other countries as well, so to try and ended on a positive note.

409
01:04:27,510 --> 01:04:34,020
Laura Power: Okay, so those are examples and just kind of bring home the idea of like you know we we put in place these policies.

410
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:39,480
Laura Power: We have certain intentions for them there's a process for that we want to know what the outcomes are.

411
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:44,130
Laura Power: And we were hoping that there's going to be a good impact, but how do we get to that impact.

412
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:55,320
Laura Power: So what I mean i'm not covering that here, and you guys, you know as you're studying your epidemiology methods that will help you think about the data like, how can you what are methods, you can use for impact evaluation.

413
01:04:55,320 --> 01:05:06,840
Laura Power: And as you all know, it's you're since you're studying genealogy the summer session, you know randomized controlled studies will be the best ones, to tell us about that and help us okay causality closer other.

414
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:11,580
Laura Power: Methods one you'll often see difference in differences is often used.

415
01:05:11,580 --> 01:05:19,260
Laura Power: Because that's just like pre and post is not always robust so sometimes looking at the differences in differences and other things like matching and combined methods so.

416
01:05:19,260 --> 01:05:27,930
Laura Power: That will get into deeper a few methods that i'm not covering here, but I know you maybe cover them in other classes so there's methodology for the research that's there.

417
01:05:27,930 --> 01:05:36,300
Laura Power: And then there's also the system's approach and think about this, so of course that's the part i'm going to focus on for this class i'm pointing out this.

418
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:48,240
Laura Power: This resource guidance on systems approaches to local public health, evaluation and they really get into about how to use systems thinking in policy evaluation i'll just pull out a couple examples for you.

419
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:59,310
Laura Power: They talk about you know, thinking of through Where are you are you like Where are you in the research question you're asking the question you're asking about policy evaluation, so what is it that you want to know.

420
01:05:59,310 --> 01:06:05,640
Laura Power: And what how you ask your question or how you ask the impact evaluation question, what is it you're trying to find out.

421
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:14,880
Laura Power: does help you decide what approach you should you should you be using this deep systems thinking process or do you really need like a more linear just give me some numbers.

422
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:32,310
Laura Power: And they both maybe right it just depends on what you're trying to find out, so if you do think that there's use for systems approach you can think through all the different visualizations and tools that you might use and think about the stakeholders that would be involved.

423
01:06:32,310 --> 01:06:45,450
Laura Power: The example that they give is this program about dimming street lights and that many towns and cities were doing their street lights to save money and energy but there's different ways, you can look at it could be very simple.

424
01:06:45,450 --> 01:06:55,620
Laura Power: In one sense of meaning of the streetlights a simple right there either on or off, it could also be complicated because they mean the town's lights is not as easy as that might sound, it can be very technicals.

425
01:06:55,620 --> 01:07:06,240
Laura Power: And then it could be more of a complex problem, because you could be looking at the wider issues at hand, like the stakeholders, what does it mean is it politically acceptable and publicly acceptable.

426
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:15,900
Laura Power: Is it, how is it affecting the environment, how is it affecting safety, how is it affecting affecting business so depending on what you're trying to answer like.

427
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:33,120
Laura Power: Is it working how hard, is it, how much is the cost versus things like what's happening with safety or business us or perceptions and in the environment that might affect how you approach, an evaluation of a policy.

428
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:41,190
Laura Power: Okay, so now we're getting into the logic models pay attention at this point because you'll be making your logic model for your policy.

429
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:50,430
Laura Power: So, as you can see kind of break it down to these components and it is a way to visualize and think through what is going in and out and then what impacts may happen.

430
01:07:50,430 --> 01:07:58,530
Laura Power: So a logic model, maybe you've heard of a logic model for logic models are widely used in policy evaluation, because they can really.

431
01:07:58,530 --> 01:08:09,990
Laura Power: articulate like what goes in what are you doing what things come out and it helps you separate out the outputs the outcomes and the impact that is very helpful to think through.

432
01:08:09,990 --> 01:08:17,880
Laura Power: This may be helpful in fact I just was talking to some colleagues or last week they're putting in a grant proposal, they have an intervention idea.

433
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:26,790
Laura Power: And we realized, it would be very helpful for them to have a logic model so they could try to explain why they should get funded to do this, what is the big impact.

434
01:08:26,790 --> 01:08:41,460
Laura Power: But then of course they'll be measuring all the steps in between, which is really more about outputs and outcomes and then trying to say why they think that's going to have an impact, and what they're trying to impact.

435
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:57,390
Laura Power: So, looking at the components of a logic model is he thought had the inputs or things like resources examples could be funding materials staffing that's needed locations buildings, you know supplies.

436
01:08:57,390 --> 01:09:07,710
Laura Power: Activities or the program events or strategies so that could be trainings or treatment programs or educational activities.

437
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:10,260
Laura Power: outreach activities.

438
01:09:10,260 --> 01:09:23,670
Laura Power: output to be any product so like if it was patient testing and treatment that maybe down with a number of patients treated, or if it was staff trainings maybe it's the quality of the trainings or the number of trains attended or something.

439
01:09:23,670 --> 01:09:41,970
Laura Power: So that's kind of those are broken down into like the planning elements of what goes into a policy or which program completed, and then the outcome components will be those short term intermediate term and long term outcomes, so this could be things like.

440
01:09:41,970 --> 01:09:46,260
Laura Power: The increased proportion of patients that are treated in the short term.

441
01:09:46,260 --> 01:09:54,450
Laura Power: Maybe this is like using an STD example So if you have people, maybe worrying about the eyes, maybe to increase proportion of patients treated.

442
01:09:54,450 --> 01:10:07,800
Laura Power: Maybe intermediate Lee because look at the increased proportion of partners treated and then the long term you'd be looking at reduced STI prevalence so an example how to kind of think through the different components.

443
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:20,910
Laura Power: So here following a similar example using here's a program really, really to reducing the prevalence of STDs among men who have sex with men and random city X.

444
01:10:20,910 --> 01:10:29,730
Laura Power: And the process, they say they're going to do these professional development workshops on STD screening recommendations for providers in the city.

445
01:10:29,730 --> 01:10:38,220
Laura Power: And so that's what they're wanting to do, but if you break it down what are the inputs activities outputs and outcomes that are looking at.

446
01:10:38,220 --> 01:10:49,260
Laura Power: So inputs funding staff time screening guidelines workshops meeting space activities will be conducting the workshops outputs would be.

447
01:10:49,260 --> 01:10:56,370
Laura Power: workshops that were actually done so that to doing them the output is how many where they done maybe where they completed.

448
01:10:56,370 --> 01:11:07,710
Laura Power: A short term outcome could be increased knowledge intermediate could be increased routine screening and then the long term output is really hoping to decrease the prevalence of disease.

449
01:11:07,710 --> 01:11:14,640
Laura Power: makes them sense.

450
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:24,600
Laura Power: Now there are just a couple other examples there's different logic models, this was, I think it's about training related to say, this was.

451
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:33,450
Laura Power: an educational one about oh yeah by alcohol consumption and they had a program that had to do with education so talked about.

452
01:11:33,450 --> 01:11:51,360
Laura Power: The money and the training and the partners and space they need, then they broke it down into the outputs and then the outcomes and really the ultimate one was reducing you use alcohol use and the consequences related to that.

453
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:59,970
Laura Power: here's a state level policy, so this was looking at a big policy, this is a big state policy, so this is related to early childhood education.

454
01:11:59,970 --> 01:12:09,840
Laura Power: And so you can just see another example of how they broke out the inputs activities outputs and then the different short intermediate and long term outcomes so, starting with the inputs.

455
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:21,090
Laura Power: Not all the way to these hoping for these long term outcomes and increased healthy eating physical activity and eventually decreasing obesity.

456
01:12:21,090 --> 01:12:31,740
Laura Power: So then bring in the systems thinking ideas to this So these are things that can just help in the evaluation framework, so when you're thinking through these questions.

457
01:12:31,740 --> 01:12:44,520
Laura Power: You know, you can do take all of these tools to thought about all these approaches that we've talked about and put them into the policy evaluation process, and these are just the basic.

458
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:50,070
Laura Power: Questions you can ask as you're going through that.

459
01:12:50,070 --> 01:12:54,360
Laura Power: Okay, so here's a a template that is.

460
01:12:54,360 --> 01:13:08,100
Laura Power: can be used and just showing it here because it's a nice template and it gives different ideas so sometimes it's helpful to have ideas of like what to think about what goes in and out of the policy.

461
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:13,110
Laura Power: Okay, stop there let's see what questions you have.

462
01:13:13,110 --> 01:13:21,690
Laura Power: And then we'll get into what i'd like you to do next.

463
01:13:21,690 --> 01:13:32,160
Laura Power: What questions do you have.

464
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:36,240
Laura Power: Pretty solid pretty straightforward okay.

465
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:52,770
Laura Power: So what i'd like you to do now we're going to get back into our teams and you're going to think about that policy that you use, I mean pulled out my template here so here's a template that you can use so you'll use this from the canvas page.

466
01:13:52,770 --> 01:14:00,210
Laura Power: And you can think through the policy, so one decide on the policy when you get together one decide on what policy you want to use for this.

467
01:14:00,210 --> 01:14:09,750
Laura Power: It looked like you all, probably had potential policies so that might be the first step is just to hey Kate which one which one do we want to talk about.

468
01:14:09,750 --> 01:14:19,620
Laura Power: I think include just so I know when I look at these include what is the policy because I don't I won't know I didn't put a space for you to do that, but you can just add in like what is the policy you're analyzing.

469
01:14:19,620 --> 01:14:26,070
Laura Power: And then some you know put in filling the template there to decide what might be.

470
01:14:26,070 --> 01:14:32,760
Laura Power: portions that applied to that So what is the situation, what are the inputs outputs and outcomes.

471
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:48,450
Laura Power: Now you might have to use depending on your policy, you know you might have to use some creative thinking or like what might be, because I know you didn't write these policies yourself, but I think about what could be inputs outputs that might come from those okay.

472
01:14:48,450 --> 01:15:01,200
Laura Power: All right, I see you nodding heads i'm going to just take it that you're all doing Okay, and I think why don't you take let's see i'm going to say take about.

473
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:04,410
20 minutes.

474
01:15:04,410 --> 01:15:08,610
Laura Power: And then i'm going to bring you back real quick check in.

475
01:15:08,610 --> 01:15:11,700
Laura Power: And then we'll take a break okay.

476
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:23,370
Laura Power: So i'll put you into your groups it's about 245 so around three to five will bring you back just for a quick check in and then we'll do a break.

477
01:15:23,370 --> 01:15:55,980
Laura Power: Okay, go ahead.

478
01:15:55,980 --> 01:15:57,450
Laura Power: back.

479
01:15:57,450 --> 01:16:05,040
Laura Power: turn your videos on for a SEC, so I can see, you make sure they're not in your back from your brakes and stuff.

480
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:11,490
Laura Power: I hope you stretch your legs, a little bit.

481
01:16:11,490 --> 01:16:19,950
Laura Power: excited to go outside after class today that's my plan.

482
01:16:19,950 --> 01:16:27,600
let's see.

483
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:31,980
Here we go.

484
01:16:31,980 --> 01:16:36,960
Laura Power: Alright, welcome back I think we've got everybody back now.

485
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:39,510
Laura Power: So first just.

486
01:16:39,510 --> 01:16:49,230
Laura Power: like to just get some reflections on the process of doing the logic model, how was it for you and I, you know I got to talk to each of you, but maybe kind of share your.

487
01:16:49,230 --> 01:17:02,160
Laura Power: process through it, I think sometimes we'll have a hard time thinking Alec kind of pulling out the different outcomes short term intermediate impact that sometimes is a challenge.

488
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:06,840
Laura Power: anybody wants to comment.

489
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:09,000
Laura Power: Pretty straightforward.

490
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:23,130
Aliyah Abdul-Wakil: I think for me hey, this is a Leah that it was harder for me to think of like on a larger scale because i'm so used to thinking of like at the state level um so yeah that's just something that.

491
01:17:23,130 --> 01:17:24,150
Aliyah Abdul-Wakil: I bought him.

492
01:17:24,150 --> 01:17:35,070
Laura Power: yeah so just within the org like what the organization you're used to working in and how you approach things, how you measure things probably and your team was looking at like you were starting to look at like national.

493
01:17:35,070 --> 01:17:36,270
Aliyah Abdul-Wakil: Right maternal deaths.

494
01:17:36,270 --> 01:17:39,330
Laura Power: yeah so like the big picture and how would that look.

495
01:17:39,330 --> 01:17:47,880
Laura Power: yeah yeah yeah you can do the different levels right, this could be very small scale is a very large scale depends on what the policy is and.

496
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:54,900
Laura Power: You can use this for a lot of different things I think Victoria you mentioned like it using this and writing some grant proposals.

497
01:17:54,900 --> 01:18:01,770
Laura Power: And things like that, and like I said that's what I thought you know this definitely was a useful model to use and like explaining.

498
01:18:01,770 --> 01:18:13,230
Laura Power: What your plan is and why you think it's why you think it's important like why these activities, what outcomes, or they lead to, so I think it's a nice way to demonstrate that.

499
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:20,670
Laura Power: Good okay all right well it's so it's 330 i'm going to do a little bit more and kind of.

500
01:18:20,670 --> 01:18:30,240
Laura Power: So we talked about basics and policy we can look at the anatomy of policy and how you think about it, trying to tie it back to systems thinking trying to tie it back to.

501
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:37,530
Laura Power: Just like public health 3.0 concepts and now to the next step of that is just thinking about.

502
01:18:37,530 --> 01:18:48,510
Laura Power: Health and all policies and how we can bring all of that, together, and bringing in health equity lens and so just kind of touching on those topics, but I think those are things that are important and you think about.

503
01:18:48,510 --> 01:18:54,690
Laura Power: When you're trying to have a systematic approach you're trying to like think about different stakeholders, you know, see the big picture.

504
01:18:54,690 --> 01:18:59,640
Laura Power: So just some ways to some tools to do that and always the weekend, think about doing that.

505
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:06,480
Laura Power: So i'll go through a couple things then we'll have one more activity which will be a shorter one, I think the logic model was the bigger one you had to.

506
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:14,190
Laura Power: take some time to fill that out the next activity will be a shorter one, but it will be just thinking through the same policy, taking like a health.

507
01:19:14,190 --> 01:19:20,370
Laura Power: equity lens to that so just how would this policy affects different groups so we're going to lead up to that.

508
01:19:20,370 --> 01:19:27,660
Laura Power: When we get to that will let you get back will be a worksheet fill out and then you can also take time to think through.

509
01:19:27,660 --> 01:19:36,840
Laura Power: How, you might think about your presentation for tomorrow you'll still have more time to work on the presentation tomorrow too because one part of it we won't actually do until tomorrow.

510
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:50,490
Laura Power: which will be thinking about creating a vision statement and a few other things, for your project but i'll give you some time to work on things today that sounds like a good plan that all right.

511
01:19:50,490 --> 01:19:55,140
Laura Power: Okay everybody's on board okay very good so.

512
01:19:55,140 --> 01:20:05,040
Laura Power: See the screen i'm sure and health and all policies i'm guessing is a term that some of you are probably pretty familiar with.

513
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:16,740
Laura Power: I would say, especially those of you working in the health departments right now I think you're probably familiar with that and maybe you're welcome to share any stories or experiences you've had.

514
01:20:16,740 --> 01:20:26,970
Laura Power: Working in that are kind of doing any analysis and health impacts that way Okay, are you seeing my screen right now.

515
01:20:26,970 --> 01:20:30,870
Laura Power: Okay, and let's make sure I got the right one.

516
01:20:30,870 --> 01:20:36,810
Laura Power: You can see the big one presenter view excellent okay good good good good or on the right track.

517
01:20:36,810 --> 01:20:47,790
Laura Power: All right, so stepping back and making sure we're on the same page I know some of you definitely know this and live thinking about this every day you're working public health.

518
01:20:47,790 --> 01:20:57,150
Laura Power: But we've talked about it first day of class I asked you to divine to find public health, sometimes people will ask you is what is health, how do you define health.

519
01:20:57,150 --> 01:21:06,150
Laura Power: According to the World Health Organization health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity so.

520
01:21:06,150 --> 01:21:14,070
Laura Power: One way of looking at health and we know that there's a lot of different things that contribute to our health so you're probably familiar with the determinants of health.

521
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:29,670
Laura Power: We focus a lot on and then we're talking lot more now about the social determinants of health but there's there's different ways of breaking down and how we think about what things go into determining our health, this is one model.

522
01:21:29,670 --> 01:21:38,400
Laura Power: Often, if you use at the county health ranking and other types of models and how they how they even calculate the different factors that go into healthy communities.

523
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:45,810
Laura Power: is thought that really, really it's a smaller portion of our medical care and our health care that really contributes to our own health.

524
01:21:45,810 --> 01:21:54,570
Laura Power: But other things like health behaviors the physical environment associate an economic factors are really the things that determine our health.

525
01:21:54,570 --> 01:22:04,590
Laura Power: there's different models of this, but this is a nice one the county health rankings has a model that they use of how they pull in different data points and determine health rankings.

526
01:22:04,590 --> 01:22:10,650
Laura Power: And not exactly this is sort of the same concept it's broken down differently, but this is a.

527
01:22:10,650 --> 01:22:26,100
Laura Power: kind of a little bit older figure now, but the point of it is that we spend a lot of money, a lot of our federal budget goes to medical services when and not as much really goes to prevention, so that's kind of an interesting mismatch.

528
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:34,530
Laura Power: We just talked about policies and how policies really can impact our health so thinking about you know how how we can improve our health through policies.

529
01:22:34,530 --> 01:22:43,200
Laura Power: But then, recognizing that there's many different types of policies and different types of things going on, so if we pull together that idea of all the different things that determine our House.

530
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:51,420
Laura Power: And we think about different policies and different things that are going on, you can see that there's an overlap so policies that are having to do with housing.

531
01:22:51,420 --> 01:23:05,940
Laura Power: Probably contribute to our health in some way or policies and plans and ideas that have to do with transportation or schools or policing all of that is really meets our health in some way so there's really like systems everything's actually really connected.

532
01:23:05,940 --> 01:23:13,110
Laura Power: So the idea of health and all policies is recognizing the health is created by many factors beyond health care.

533
01:23:13,110 --> 01:23:19,620
Laura Power: And oftentimes beyond the scope of traditional public health activity, so you can think of a public health department that has its.

534
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:28,440
Laura Power: You know usual maybe communicable disease prevention and maternal child health work like are you know we have many of you here on this.

535
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:40,290
Laura Power: Class so that those are there some traditional things that we tend to do in public health but there's really a lot of other things and we're often having to work outside and across sectors with with different areas of.

536
01:23:40,290 --> 01:23:47,430
Laura Power: Business and housing and transportation and all of that really does contribute to health, and this also brings.

537
01:23:47,430 --> 01:23:56,760
Laura Power: back the idea of a collaborative approach cross sector collaboration and working together, making decisions together across sectors.

538
01:23:56,760 --> 01:24:08,190
Laura Power: and trying to have a health and all policies approach hopes to ensure that all decision makers are informed about the health equity and sustainability of different policy options so.

539
01:24:08,190 --> 01:24:16,440
Laura Power: trying to get everyone to have that big picture, understanding and respond to the complex problems that we have today.

540
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:37,140
Laura Power: there's a nice guidance here about health and our policies approach, this is one for state and local governments, just for her are seeing local workers here do is this i'm wondering if you use this framework at all is this a familiar document for any of you just curious.

541
01:24:37,140 --> 01:24:50,310
Laura Power: I use it a lot as a structure, but of course i'm not actually in the health department so probably the concepts, at least, maybe not this.

542
01:24:50,310 --> 01:24:53,790
Laura Power: Last my chat room michiko okay.

543
01:24:53,790 --> 01:25:04,560
Laura Power: All right, so well, according to this, this is a nice guy to do if you haven't used it it's an I think a nice kind of steps helps you step through the ideas of health and all policies and provides a guide for state and local governments.

544
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:08,430
Laura Power: And it talks about the five key elements of health and all policies.

545
01:25:08,430 --> 01:25:16,320
Laura Power: So kind of general things are promoting health equity and sustainability, supporting intersect oral cross sector collaboration.

546
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:29,400
Laura Power: benefiting multiple partners engaging stakeholders and creating structural or process teams, I think you can see that all those ideas link up to what we've been trying to talk about in our class.

547
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:35,730
Laura Power: And this can also be a you know looking through a health and equity lens.

548
01:25:35,730 --> 01:25:44,460
Laura Power: So it can be a systematic way to find opportunities to improve health and equity and can provide evidence to allow consideration of those maybe.

549
01:25:44,460 --> 01:26:01,560
Laura Power: unintended negative consequences or thinking about positive consequences they have an action and and using health and all policies approach can be a very structured approach or it can really be informal, it can be just sort of a way of thinking and working together.

550
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:10,380
Laura Power: there's different ways of doing this, a couple there's a lot of different tools out there, but I think sometimes it's broken up in different ways to look at it.

551
01:26:10,380 --> 01:26:23,970
Laura Power: One way could be thinking about a health impact assessment, which is a really a little bit more formal systematic process that uses data and different analytical method methods to analyze a policy.

552
01:26:23,970 --> 01:26:36,420
Laura Power: and how it affects health, and this can be done, you know at the beginning of a policy and that's coming forward or it can be after sometimes it's done Africa see like what health impacted this.

553
01:26:36,420 --> 01:26:42,390
Laura Power: Policy have and the policy could be something that's not related traditionally to health, so it could be.

554
01:26:42,390 --> 01:26:57,960
Laura Power: i'll show you an example in a little bit of a transportation change it was actually a bus fare change that was being made and there was actually health impact assessments done to try to understand what would that mean for people, including things like access to care.

555
01:26:57,960 --> 01:27:10,290
Laura Power: So that's I think a more formal way of doing it, and often will include research techniques and other methods to really look at gather data and make assessments and more rigorous approach.

556
01:27:10,290 --> 01:27:21,420
Laura Power: So you'll see those times published to you can find health impact assessments that are published so i'll give you a couple examples of those and then there's the health lens analysis, which is just kind of.

557
01:27:21,420 --> 01:27:34,050
Laura Power: Trying to take like how to certain perspective, as you look at something and assess how it will affect other people so it's kind of having a systems approach where you're just trying to think of all the different people involved and.

558
01:27:34,050 --> 01:27:42,150
Laura Power: How you want the effect of different ways you're looking at all those how things are interconnected and I change this thing here, how will that affect other people there.

559
01:27:42,150 --> 01:27:48,270
Laura Power: And there are certain tools and almost like a checklist sometimes to help you like go through this in a systematic way say okay.

560
01:27:48,270 --> 01:28:02,910
Laura Power: You know who is affected are the people I need to look out for their vulnerable populations involved that we should think about so there's different tools there's a nice one from the health department that i've used before they'll share here and you'll use for your activity.

561
01:28:02,910 --> 01:28:10,590
Laura Power: So back to the health impact assessment again this is can be a little bit of a more formal process and it's got all these aspects to it like.

562
01:28:10,590 --> 01:28:23,550
Laura Power: Should screening like do you need to do a half impact assessment scoping what is the future planning to do actually gathering the data and analyzing it making recommendations reporting and then evaluating from there.

563
01:28:23,550 --> 01:28:34,740
Laura Power: So here's the example, this was a health impact assessment of a proposed transit service cut and fair increase in Boston so if you're familiar with the Boston transportation.

564
01:28:34,740 --> 01:28:42,720
Laura Power: Then bta was proposing a couple scenarios they had to do with either one they're going to increase the fair by 43%.

565
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:50,190
Laura Power: And they were going to have service reductions that we're going to affect like millions the 30 to 40 million trips a year.

566
01:28:50,190 --> 01:28:57,990
Laura Power: Another scenario they were looking at as affairs and increased by 35% and the service reductions would be even bigger so they wouldn't instead.

567
01:28:57,990 --> 01:29:03,930
Laura Power: decrease the service of it more, and you know just due to certain budget constraints that they had.

568
01:29:03,930 --> 01:29:10,890
Laura Power: So these are the options that they were considering and they actually did before they made the decision, so in this case, it was a before.

569
01:29:10,890 --> 01:29:20,790
Laura Power: They did the health impact assessment went through all what they could figure out try to find out what would the impact be of this, and this is a lad years I don't expect you to like.

570
01:29:20,790 --> 01:29:28,530
Laura Power: Take all this in but just to kind of orient you this was part of their health impact assessment, where they look to see in those two scenarios.

571
01:29:28,530 --> 01:29:42,210
Laura Power: What would the annual impact be of these proposed transit fare increases and service cuts, so they looked at things like time spent in fuel burning traffic air pollution physical activity crashes.

572
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:48,150
Laura Power: Noise carbon emissions things like that, and then they looked at costs as well.

573
01:29:48,150 --> 01:29:55,320
Laura Power: And what actually happened is they ended up choosing a different plan so they did these analyses with scenario one is the new two.

574
01:29:55,320 --> 01:30:03,330
Laura Power: And then from that they ended up deciding to raise the fares less so, they chose that 20% and they only use.

575
01:30:03,330 --> 01:30:08,610
Laura Power: I don't know the exact number, but it was not a service cut, so I think it was less than what they originally proposed.

576
01:30:08,610 --> 01:30:16,770
Laura Power: So it was actually they by doing this, they actually found other sources of revenue, because they could see all the negative impacts that we're going to happen.

577
01:30:16,770 --> 01:30:22,110
Laura Power: So this is a very thorough evaluation now they have a time and they were able to do it like you know this.

578
01:30:22,110 --> 01:30:38,130
Laura Power: You need to be working in a place it's allowing you to put all this together and make do this planning before making these decisions, so this was a before and that affected, a decision that was in the transportation world but was looked at from the health perspective.

579
01:30:38,130 --> 01:30:43,230
Laura Power: here's another one, closer to home, and this was about.

580
01:30:43,230 --> 01:30:54,090
Laura Power: How familiar you, those of you are here in Michigan about the gordie howe bridge, you know there's a new bridge that they're building and there's certain Community in Southwest Detroit that is more affected.

581
01:30:54,090 --> 01:31:05,040
Laura Power: By this, because the construction is right there and there's a lot of concerns about air pollution and physical activity and safety, and this has been ongoing.

582
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:15,930
Laura Power: there's a nice through the region five political training Center there's a nice webinar actually if this is of interest to you, you can watch this for free and they kind of go through they did a Community driven health.

583
01:31:15,930 --> 01:31:18,450
Laura Power: Impact Assessment to look at.

584
01:31:18,450 --> 01:31:29,400
Laura Power: How the Community was affected this was like this has been ongoing So this was not one that was like planning okay let's plan and minimize any bad impact, it was sort of like it was happening.

585
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:39,180
Laura Power: And there was concerning the Community and so together they kind of came together to do this health impact assessment and then try to work to try to minimize any future.

586
01:31:39,180 --> 01:31:48,240
Laura Power: negative consequences so that's just a local example that, and you can find out more for that region by public health training Center.

587
01:31:48,240 --> 01:31:51,840
Laura Power: So those are more formal health impact assessments.

588
01:31:51,840 --> 01:32:01,590
Laura Power: And then less formal but enough also a nice way of looking at things is sort of a health lens analysis, sometimes you can also think of a health equity lens analysis tools there's.

589
01:32:01,590 --> 01:32:11,700
Laura Power: Different toolkits and sometimes they're they're called differently, but it's just like applying a health lens which often includes having an equity lens or perspective, depending on how you want to talk about it.

590
01:32:11,700 --> 01:32:21,150
Laura Power: Towards an issue that you're reviewing or any policy really whether it's you know, not just the health policy and again like transportation or housing or something else.

591
01:32:21,150 --> 01:32:28,590
Laura Power: So when doing this, the goal is really to look at different alternatives and kind of think through different different.

592
01:32:28,590 --> 01:32:31,770
Laura Power: outcomes that may happen again have a big picture thinking.

593
01:32:31,770 --> 01:32:42,600
Laura Power: you're trying to engage and work across sectors gather evidence generate different perspectives and then evaluate and get recommendations and evaluate the outcome, so you can see how that relates to.

594
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:49,110
Laura Power: What we've talked about in the last few days and through the thinking through a logic model as well.

595
01:32:49,110 --> 01:33:08,280
Laura Power: Okay, so this is a lot here, but what this example is table reminds me it's i'll walk you through this a little bit is that this is a health lens analysis looking at water security, this was in Australia, yes, it was in Australia, and it was looking at water use and they were thinking about.

596
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:23,550
Laura Power: Like they're Gray water so like runoff from like their laundry and just different water sources that was a concern about water security and how they were using water, and so they looked at different possibilities and they looked at.

597
01:33:23,550 --> 01:33:36,330
Laura Power: Who would be affected, so I think what stood out to me in this example, as they when they looked through different types of water us they looked at different population groups that might be affected so whether it was people.

598
01:33:36,330 --> 01:33:50,730
Laura Power: You know, recreational recreational use of water is like fishing, and you know other activities that water based activities Taurus whether it was Homeowners children, older people.

599
01:33:50,730 --> 01:34:05,310
Laura Power: You know this is These are the groups that they thought about was the people in a certain area, so the thing is like this analysis and they went through the process, they had to think through how different groups of people would be affected by different concerns.

600
01:34:05,310 --> 01:34:11,490
Laura Power: So this is sort of just questions that people can ask sort of as a health lens approach.

601
01:34:11,490 --> 01:34:15,510
Laura Power: And when you might get involved in doing that, so.

602
01:34:15,510 --> 01:34:24,990
Laura Power: Are their existing or newly forming agencies like this is how to find opportunities like when do you apply your health plans analysis, so you can find different opportunities to do that.

603
01:34:24,990 --> 01:34:40,890
Laura Power: There may be new things coming along there may be new proposals happening, maybe you're going through your own strategic planning process and net that may be a time to bring in your health lens and your health equity lens.

604
01:34:40,890 --> 01:34:47,460
Laura Power: Some other examples where this came was put into play, was like after.

605
01:34:47,460 --> 01:35:00,270
Laura Power: Different hurricanes like hurricane ike, for example, there was the health development checklist tool that was used in all the city planning and housing planning, so, while there was rebuilding going on there was.

606
01:35:00,270 --> 01:35:09,570
Laura Power: different tools and checklists used to try to make sure that people were thought about and just having a broader picture and thinking through health and health equity.

607
01:35:09,570 --> 01:35:16,260
Laura Power: And same thing here to when there was a comprehensive comprehensive revision of cities zoning and baltimore.

608
01:35:16,260 --> 01:35:35,580
Laura Power: There was thinking through like how different people would be affected and that actually ends up, leading to a health impact assessment tool, so they started off with a more kind of general health lens and then did health health impact assessment as a way to do health in all policies.

609
01:35:35,580 --> 01:35:44,460
Laura Power: OK so back to just you know either approach helping on policies again it's great because it can help with cross sector collaboration address a determinants of health.

610
01:35:44,460 --> 01:36:00,450
Laura Power: Make sure the health issues are thought of across the board, where you know people may have control on these more non traditional public health settings it really can affect our health, it can ideally improve population health and reduce health disparities and and also ideally.

611
01:36:00,450 --> 01:36:12,960
Laura Power: streamline government activities and costs, I know, maybe these are ideal ideas, but like you know, ideally, this is what it does, it does it always work, you know that that's if it goes well that's what's supposed to happen.

612
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:16,110
Laura Power: Another nice example, this was.

613
01:36:16,110 --> 01:36:21,480
Laura Power: This was some city planning for Kansas city Missouri and.

614
01:36:21,480 --> 01:36:30,210
Laura Power: It was kind of like ongoing So if you read through this document, they talked about how they hadn't been noticing and paying attention to like their health department.

615
01:36:30,210 --> 01:36:40,770
Laura Power: Was focusing on differences in life expectancy noticing that white residents had a longer life expectancy than black presidents, this was a new year 2000 so a while ago.

616
01:36:40,770 --> 01:36:47,370
Laura Power: And they were attributing many of the city deaths to things that could be tied to social factors.

617
01:36:47,370 --> 01:36:54,780
Laura Power: And so, as part of their Community health Improvement Plan, they were trying to work on making a difference with this.

618
01:36:54,780 --> 01:37:02,700
Laura Power: But they were struggling, so it was like on the radar they're working on it, but they were kind of having a challenge and moving things forward.

619
01:37:02,700 --> 01:37:10,890
Laura Power: And they ended up kind of bringing outside of the health department and connecting more with of the broader city.

620
01:37:10,890 --> 01:37:18,030
Laura Power: at large, so it was like outside of just traditional public health, it was actually the the government itself that was.

621
01:37:18,030 --> 01:37:30,810
Laura Power: When the inner city planning they actually brought in life expectancy into their city goal, so not just the health department, but the city itself the higher up government they.

622
01:37:30,810 --> 01:37:35,580
Laura Power: Added life expectancy into their city business plan.

623
01:37:35,580 --> 01:37:41,220
Laura Power: And it seemed that that was able to get a little more traction because all of their players, not just the health department.

624
01:37:41,220 --> 01:37:53,400
Laura Power: had to think through how their activities were working towards the city goal, and one of their goals was to increase overall life expectancy and reduce health inequities in the zip codes, with the lowest life expectancy.

625
01:37:53,400 --> 01:38:03,720
Laura Power: So that was kind of unique that it was added into the business plan, not just the health department, it was like the city business plan.

626
01:38:03,720 --> 01:38:22,800
Laura Power: Okay, so already I told you get to our activity quickly and it's good timing was a 350 so you're going to have time to now again think about your policy and take a health lens approach to that, so let me get to the canvas page, so I can.

627
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:38,250
Laura Power: get us all on the same page here so we're back at the date for slide so before canvas page, and if you go to help lens analysis there's a little health lens tool let's see.

628
01:38:38,250 --> 01:38:40,320
Laura Power: Here we go.

629
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:43,830
Laura Power: Actually, let me download it to.

630
01:38:43,830 --> 01:38:47,070
Laura Power: This was adapted from.

631
01:38:47,070 --> 01:38:54,480
Laura Power: Though i'll show you the actual original one but Tacoma pierce county health department, this is a health lens analysis tool that they use.

632
01:38:54,480 --> 01:39:03,600
Laura Power: And, basically, I, so I adapted it from them for this assignment, so what you'll do is go through your policy so just like what is.

633
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:10,410
Laura Power: right out the policy, so I know what it is just briefly summarize what is it proposal trying to accomplish.

634
01:39:10,410 --> 01:39:21,840
Laura Power: So the policy you've been looking at today and then just think through, and you can think through this together you'll you're going to turn this one in individually, this one is an individual one i'm.

635
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:40,410
Laura Power: So you'll tell you can talk through it together, but then think about who will be affected, maybe positively negatively, and then which groups of people should be consultant, with the proposal may already be out there, but so you know who who should have been involved in the policy development.

636
01:39:40,410 --> 01:39:48,570
Laura Power: How do you think it will impair or help the social conditions, the economic conditions and the environmental conditions.

637
01:39:48,570 --> 01:39:58,650
Laura Power: And what are some possible unintended negative consequences and where things that might need to be done to ensure the supportive health and the Community.

638
01:39:58,650 --> 01:40:16,080
Laura Power: So it just kind of go it's basically going through the policy and, like thinking about what are some potential unintended negative consequences of who needs to be looked out for in this i'm kind of going through it there i'll show you in case you, I have the link to it to see.

639
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:35,910
Laura Power: So i'm actually here it is you can link it to the original worksheet that original tool here, and then they also have a document that kind of gives a little more explanation about the questions so i'll just link on them here so here's the tool.

640
01:40:35,910 --> 01:40:38,790
Laura Power: That they use.

641
01:40:38,790 --> 01:40:46,890
Laura Power: And they actually I took this out of your worksheet but they if this is helpful to you if you look at their tool they actually lists.

642
01:40:46,890 --> 01:40:56,700
Laura Power: groups of people to think about you know some and what sometimes we need reminders like maybe we have certain groups of people that we tend to gravitate towards and think about but.

643
01:40:56,700 --> 01:41:01,950
Laura Power: One helpful thing of a checklist is just make sure we haven't forgotten like maybe you had certain groups.

644
01:41:01,950 --> 01:41:14,280
Laura Power: Vulnerable patients or you're concerned about you know mothers or children, or something, and you might have that, on top of mine, but maybe you forgot to think about the rural community or the elderly Community like how, how are the policies be affected.

645
01:41:14,280 --> 01:41:21,570
Laura Power: Is there something special you need to think about for them, so I kind of sometimes think it's helpful to have a checklist to remind us to think about.

646
01:41:21,570 --> 01:41:36,420
Laura Power: People that may be like maybe we forgot to think about people who are non English speakers like Are there things so but I find that helpful to just remind me like did I consider everything we're positive and negative impact so.

647
01:41:36,420 --> 01:41:40,260
Laura Power: And then there's also this tool, they have here.

648
01:41:40,260 --> 01:41:42,270
Laura Power: She they.

649
01:41:42,270 --> 01:41:47,340
Laura Power: They kind of give you things to think about if you're having a hard time answering the question.

650
01:41:47,340 --> 01:41:55,020
Laura Power: They have an example here that you can look at and it's linked in the worksheet.

651
01:41:55,020 --> 01:42:05,190
Laura Power: So that's The next step so we'll put you in your groups to work on that we can work on that together talking through and then you can also take a look.

652
01:42:05,190 --> 01:42:12,300
Laura Power: Take a look at what you'll be asked to present tomorrow and work on together you've got about an hour still officially for class.

653
01:42:12,300 --> 01:42:28,710
Laura Power: So that way you'll have some time to think through like maybe look at work at the background and how you want to introduce the issue do your show your systems thinking tool that you use plugin that logic model finish that up if you haven't been able to yet.

654
01:42:28,710 --> 01:42:44,760
Laura Power: And then you have a little more time still tomorrow, as a group as well, so let me just stop there and see what questions you have.

655
01:42:44,760 --> 01:42:53,280
Laura Power: It must be clear, everyone, I can hear you can hear like there's you guys are working, I feel like so.

656
01:42:53,280 --> 01:42:55,650
Okay.

657
01:42:55,650 --> 01:43:02,040
Laura Power: All right, alright i'm going to we're going to put you into your breakout rooms and i'll come around as usual.

658
01:43:02,040 --> 01:43:09,810
Laura Power: Let me office questions just go ahead.

659
01:43:09,810 --> 01:43:29,580
Laura Power: Thanks me.

660
01:43:29,580 --> 01:44:04,192
Laura Power: breakout rooms.
