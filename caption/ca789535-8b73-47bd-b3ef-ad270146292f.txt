1
00:00:00,303 --> 00:00:10,613
Okay, so in this module, we're gonna talk about some strategies that utilize visualization, kind of a meditative approach.

2
00:00:10,613 --> 00:00:17,973
And what you can do is a lot of times these are going to be when you're trying to kind of

3
00:00:17,973 --> 00:00:23,793
help your confidence, coach yourself along, but you're having difficulty accessing

4
00:00:23,793 --> 00:00:32,583
what you need. So the first one that we're going to do is kind of a self compassion guide companion.

5
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:40,043
We're going to use, as opposed to kind of an individualistic approach, we're going to really visualize

6
00:00:40,043 --> 00:00:50,213
our connection with people who help us. So when you do this exercise, what I want you to think about is, in the moment that you're going through,

7
00:00:50,213 --> 00:00:57,603
who is somebody who would be a help? Who is somebody who sees you and values you for all of who you are, and believes in you,

8
00:00:57,603 --> 00:01:06,663
even in your most difficult problems. A lot of times what can happen is, before we got into our academic programs

9
00:01:06,663 --> 00:01:08,583
or whatever current challenge we're in,

10
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:13,713
we had some confidence, we knew that we were capable and other people saw that in us too. But in this current moment,

11
00:01:13,713 --> 00:01:18,093
we've had some difficulty and it's harder to access that. So

12
00:01:18,093 --> 00:01:25,473
we're gonna kind of connect with and borrow some of that collective energy from the person that we're gonna visualize being with us.

13
00:01:25,473 --> 00:01:33,423
This can be a friend, a family member, it can be a pet, if that's something that when it's with us, we feel calming.

14
00:01:33,423 --> 00:01:43,383
It can also just be kind of a presence or a mentor, a teacher, an ancestor, whatever feels most useful.

15
00:01:43,383 --> 00:01:47,233
It's mostly like, those are people who help us along,

16
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:53,593
but may not be here with us right now. We can kind of borrow from what we know of that relationship to help us through it.

17
00:01:53,593 --> 00:01:58,933
So and also you can, I'm going to talk about this in an individual sense, one person,

18
00:01:58,933 --> 00:02:04,163
but sometimes people think about this like a circle, kind of visualize themselves

19
00:02:04,163 --> 00:02:09,113
having like a you know, these people over sitting on the couch, having brunch,

20
00:02:09,113 --> 00:02:14,033
having dinner, and however you want to visualize it, is kind of up to you.

21
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:18,553
But I want you to start and like usual, somewhere where you can relax in your chair,

22
00:02:18,553 --> 00:02:25,753
somewhere you can close your eyes or just look at the space in the room and just breathe.

23
00:02:25,753 --> 00:02:36,873
And what I want you to do, is to think of the person that you kind of want to invite to be with you in this moment and help you through this moment.

24
00:02:36,873 --> 00:02:45,783
And so imagine yourself somewhere with them, wherever it feels, kind of cozy, safe, makes sense, and imagine them

25
00:02:45,783 --> 00:02:49,833
coming into that space with you. And I want you to really see them,

26
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:59,173
I want you to see what they're wearing, their facial expression, their body language.

27
00:02:59,173 --> 00:03:04,973
And once they're kind of there, seated, comfortable, and if you want, you can kind of see that.

28
00:03:04,973 --> 00:03:10,293
What I want you to do is to think about almost kind of like that glitter ball,

29
00:03:10,293 --> 00:03:16,873
holding it out to them and showing them, what you're carrying right now. You don't have to explain it.

30
00:03:16,873 --> 00:03:23,483
You're just kind of holding it out there. And again, see their face,

31
00:03:23,483 --> 00:03:30,303
see how they might acknowledge or feel with you what you're going through.

32
00:03:30,303 --> 00:03:41,543
See what they might offer as comfort or reassurance, like a laugh, or a joke, or a hug, or just a facial expression.

33
00:03:41,543 --> 00:03:53,533
Whatever that person would do. And then I want you to kind of just let them hold it with you,

34
00:03:53,533 --> 00:04:05,273
and just breathe. Think about how or what they might say or how they might convey to you that it's a lot and you're okay.

35
00:04:05,273 --> 00:04:14,403
Just breathe. Things maybe about yourself that they would remind you that maybe you've lost sight of in this moment.

36
00:04:14,403 --> 00:04:27,713
And maybe they just sit with you and breathe. Then lastly, just see if they have anything to offer.

37
00:04:27,713 --> 00:04:35,233
Maybe even kind of a token that you can take with you, whether that's a quote, whether it's just a hug or a squeeze of your hand.

38
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:40,293
Whether it's suggestion or whether it's just a reminder that they're going to value

39
00:04:40,293 --> 00:04:47,473
you and be with you, no matter what. But see if there's kind of a token

40
00:04:47,473 --> 00:04:59,973
they can give you to carry with you from this time. And then when you're ready, kind visualize them leaving the space.

41
00:04:59,973 --> 00:05:12,793
Take a few slow, deep breaths. And then you can bring your attention back to the room.

42
00:05:12,793 --> 00:05:22,393
I'll give you a couple more small things that you can try as you're playing with this kind of meditation.

43
00:05:22,393 --> 00:05:27,943
Sometimes we're being really hard on ourselves and kind of picking ourselves apart,

44
00:05:27,943 --> 00:05:30,673
and it can be helpful to do a self compassion body scan.

45
00:05:30,673 --> 00:05:40,343
There's a longer one on the website if you want to do that, but sometimes just kind of starting at your toes or wherever you wanna start on your body,

46
00:05:40,343 --> 00:05:45,083
and just noticing all the work that they do and all that they're holding.

47
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:52,373
So you're kind of just like, for example, right now I'm kind of wiggling my toes, I'm thinking about the fact that when I stand,

48
00:05:52,373 --> 00:05:57,193
each and every single one of them helps me balance.

49
00:05:57,193 --> 00:06:03,283
And I'm just kind of noticing them and offering them a little bit of self compassion and gratitude.

50
00:06:03,283 --> 00:06:10,683
Then I kind of just might move my way up ankles, calves, thighs, bottom, core,

51
00:06:10,683 --> 00:06:14,723
and what we tend to find is that our body is doing a lot of really good things for us,

52
00:06:14,723 --> 00:06:19,873
even on the days where we feel like we're not getting a lot right.

53
00:06:19,873 --> 00:06:26,873
We just want to kind of take time, notice, and observe those things.

54
00:06:26,873 --> 00:06:31,703
Lastly, it could also be helpful sometimes to just go back,

55
00:06:31,703 --> 00:06:38,833
you know how we've talked in one of the modules about positive, safe spaces, good memories.

56
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:43,453
Sometimes I think when we're not performing well, the way that we want to,

57
00:06:43,453 --> 00:06:49,363
it can be useful to go back and remember when was the last time we really were?

58
00:06:49,363 --> 00:06:56,263
And what did that feel like in our body? Also, things like sometimes you get working on a project and started the paper really excited about it,

59
00:06:56,263 --> 00:07:02,233
and now you can not, for the life of you remember why you even wanted to do it especially if you have a few things.

60
00:07:02,233 --> 00:07:08,303
So going back and visualizing the moment when the idea first came to you and the ideas were kind of flowing.

61
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:14,583
And we don't just want to think about it, kind of like we've talked about before, you wanna go back into your five senses, bring up their memory,

62
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:19,413
remember what it felt like in your body, remember what it looked like around you,

63
00:07:19,413 --> 00:07:26,873
and just kind of soak in that feeling. If you feel like I need to feel more confident right now, I need to feel calmer right now,

64
00:07:26,873 --> 00:07:31,493
sometimes it can just be useful to go back and think of a time when you felt that way, because it's in there.

65
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:36,683
It's hard to access right now, but it's in there. So you want to pull up that memory,

66
00:07:36,683 --> 00:07:40,153
bring it up with all of your five senses,

67
00:07:40,153 --> 00:07:48,763
and let yourself hang out there for a few minutes and come back to the present and reengage in the next moment.

68
00:07:48,763 --> 00:07:55,093
So you'll kind of notice for you, some people really do really well with these visualizations, some people it's just not the

69
00:07:55,093 --> 00:08:03,953
best way for them to engage. So keep trying it out a few different ways and see how it works for you.
