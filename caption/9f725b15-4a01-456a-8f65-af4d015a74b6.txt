1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:09,750
Oh good. We are going to start our Today's Leg tour before we start.

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,580
Just a couple of housekeeping announcements obviously for most of the students.

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:22,620
Remember that you you haven't done it yet. You need to give me the form by December 31st.

4
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:29,610
Do you see your name? Just a few lines about where you propose to do for your thesis.

5
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:38,520
I will need to have the your mentor advisor seeing that you're underneath your mentor.

6
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:48,480
Now, for this form, you need to have a complete proposal in just a few lines here, what you're planning to do.

7
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:56,220
I'm usually a student at the moment. Yes, it's more paragraph by six lines that will be okay.

8
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:05,850
Then after you complete the form I signed by your mentor does give it to me because then I will file the form.

9
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:09,980
I will keep track of your progress. Okay.

10
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,630
You see that first announcement? That second announcement.

11
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:20,010
Remember, next Monday, we start with the students presentation and then we will have three presentation.

12
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:26,520
So we are not in. And remember that it has to be a complete presentation.

13
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:33,599
Remember? Yes. Are almost 10 minutes. You want to do PowerPoint?

14
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,970
That's okay. You are not required to do the PowerPoint, but basically is to tell us what you're planning to do.

15
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,690
And then we will have that discussion,

16
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:52,050
maybe five minute discussion for his presentation and then just that idea to also to help you to try to mature, repeat your proposals.

17
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:59,349
Questions. Okay. How you doing with your semester?

18
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:02,750
Everything going well. But we are almost done.

19
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:12,220
Any plan for Thanksgiving? Staying here and it in Turkey isn't good.

20
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:23,200
Okay, then we are going to to talk a little bit about imposter syndrome and we will discuss the video idea.

21
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:26,470
Do you watch it? Yes. Okay. What do you think about what do you do?

22
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:33,610
What do you think was interesting? Very relatable. Yes.

23
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:46,330
What did you feel are relatable and you feel something the example that the presenter gave you, feel you fell down that resonated with you?

24
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:53,580
Yeah. For those of you, the English is not your first language like self.

25
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,950
Do you? What do you think about.

26
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:09,580
He was talking about how he presented on a manuscript and was rejected and said that English is like the logic doesn't flow.

27
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,200
Do you feel also relatable to that? You have that experience.

28
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,079
Well, let's look at the then then here.

29
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:30,430
I guess I want to share my own experience. And also you'll feel comfortable also sharing your own experience.

30
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:42,490
You are usually and I think this is very common in academia, I will say not only in academia or to other fields,

31
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:57,460
that the we feel that this is the this is what I know but but we think the other no more than

32
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:09,370
ourself when the reality is that we know an important part but also the others our colleagues,

33
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:15,430
our peers, our friends, they also know a small part with some overlap.

34
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:28,720
The problem with this type of thinking is that that what this one that we see here to your left are it that we in academia is a competitive field?

35
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:36,790
You are to study in your need to present homework midterms and you will need to present your days in your research.

36
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:43,390
But for our for our faculty also we are we need to submit grants.

37
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:51,140
We need to get funding because that that way that we are going to do our research to get the students to get both dogs.

38
00:04:52,160 --> 00:05:04,360
If we don't do that or if we fail to get funding, we start to think this okay, in my in the right place I am I will do research here.

39
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:13,179
I will faculty or sometimes even if we don't, we don't want to do it but we tend to compare our said it with all there.

40
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:22,690
So let's say someone got a good ground and maybe I didn't get that ground and I think why I didn't get the grant then this is a big problem.

41
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,790
How to feed our self,

42
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:38,830
how that impression that we all also we have our place in academia now again share what you feel comfortable to share here in the class with a group.

43
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:44,950
But when we are up, when you were applying to that program,

44
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:54,130
did you feel that you went to go to reject that or anyone just to use this period your physical for never to share?

45
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:58,719
In my experience, it was a very stressful period of my life.

46
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,500
I was applying for like my programs to increase my chance of getting accepted.

47
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:08,739
And every time I used to do this orientation sessions, for example, to have if we have some questions about the program.

48
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:15,090
And every time I look at the total number of students that are attending, although not all of them would be inaccurate,

49
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:22,180
I'm miss and be like out of all these, for example, let's say 50 students that are applying.

50
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,540
Yep. When my application stands up, I don't think so.

51
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:32,050
Like why they will accept me like them, you know. So yeah. Every time I use, every time I used to attend these talks,

52
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:37,659
I felt like I'm demotivated because why they should accept me like no more

53
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:41,440
students and they have good abilities and when applying to the universities.

54
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:44,980
So again, it was first test for AP. Yes, it is.

55
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:52,360
It is. Thank you for sharing. Actually, my dad went here for undergrad, talked about how competitive it was.

56
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,550
And then when I applied, he was like, okay, just know it's going to be hard.

57
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:06,070
You become caliber. I was like, this is not helping. So I had a bunch of like back and just in case and now I like did the research.

58
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:09,730
I was very passionate about what I want to do. I was like happy to have to get it.

59
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:17,680
But then I just had a backup plan. Yeah. So as much as I was motivated, I also just made sure, like, there was something there, just.

60
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:25,690
It didn't work out. So I think that. Yeah, yeah, that, you know, that happened because I don't tell you what parents, our friends they went to,

61
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:31,780
we are supportive of our goals and they say, okay, that's I go to university, those are great university.

62
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:38,980
But somehow that them feel like, okay, I'm not going to do good there because it's too good to me for me.

63
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:42,880
Now, I don't know if I told you my own my own case.

64
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:49,540
You know, they tell you before what happened. Well, when I was applying to my for my doctoral studies.

65
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:55,900
Okay. I was in Costa Rica. I yes, I have finished my master's degree.

66
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,190
I was working at the university. They're teaching someone as more research.

67
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:11,230
But my interest was to, to do, um, population genetics and anthropology genetics.

68
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:15,640
And then there was a researcher.

69
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,950
University, I think at that moment was in Texas, in Houston.

70
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:26,660
He was doing research in that area. I could not. I think getting caught up him.

71
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:32,100
And then he said, yes, apply. You see what happens. Then I applied.

72
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,530
I wasn't selected to the university, but I didn't have funding.

73
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:45,600
Then I need to get funding. Then I applied the Asylum Fellowship from the US government to the embassy.

74
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:49,710
It's called the Fellowship and the Fulbright Fulbright Fellowship.

75
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:53,430
Then I applied to that. I went to that interview.

76
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,020
I did my talk for the that area.

77
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:07,350
I then I got a letter that I was rejected. I didn't I didn't get the Fulbright that well, I felt so bad.

78
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:12,150
I remember at that moment I recently married they have a little daughter.

79
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:17,280
She was just a few months old. And I think that that word came down, I said,

80
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:29,610
and I'm not going to be able to get my Ph.D. But then I admit to my the person that was doing research at the end was my mentor.

81
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:34,020
Then he was at Harvard and Yale applied to Harvard and see what happened.

82
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:38,040
And I was I said that I get the fellowship complete funding then.

83
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:41,520
You never know. You never know what is going to happen.

84
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:47,999
Or in my own life, what is to keep your options open or be flexible.

85
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:55,920
Because the option to to go to Harvard at that moment was to study nutrition, nutrition.

86
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:04,950
It was not my original plan. But is that was stay here in Costa Rica.

87
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:16,470
They had not that was because the study was great doing genetics what I wanted to do being an byrom, interacting with cardiovascular disease.

88
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:24,000
And also then also I had the opportunity to to to do down the global degree in epidemiology.

89
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:30,870
They are then always keep your options open, even if initially it doesn't sound like something that you are really interested.

90
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:41,310
But the long closed doors, because you don't know what is going to happen, then they end up there.

91
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:49,380
After I finish my just values, my doctoral study idea postdoc.

92
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:59,250
But then because of visa regulation, I think you have to after you graduate, you have 15, two years with your student visa,

93
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:06,510
but after that, you have to get some kind of work to be able to do, save to the to the H-1B visa.

94
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:13,590
They are again, that was also another stressful moment because I wasn't getting any job.

95
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:19,470
I was applying for both for both each on the the option was, okay, let's return to Costa Rica.

96
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:24,209
But then I got the position at Boston University. Then I was able to get a green card.

97
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:32,550
And then in the history and now here in Michigan, then always gig, gig going.

98
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:37,390
Now these are and again, feel free to share it.

99
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:45,630
You feel comfortable. But I think this even when we get to analyzed it still, we are always built in our own abilities.

100
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:51,900
And I think a big part of this, the academic culture,

101
00:11:52,710 --> 00:12:01,970
that they are highly respected and people expect that you are going to get you research do get to have your paper even.

102
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:11,370
Are you do you do you use social media, maybe Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn to do you?

103
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:18,510
Yes, I have has I have my LinkedIn account, but I having me use it a lot.

104
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:28,260
But I feel I feel that you see a huge pressure from for for us, for faculty that you have to get to make the news somehow.

105
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:35,940
Your journey. My own experience that I feel that is could be a little bit counterproductive.

106
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:49,890
But they are they are also the games do have experience working with journalist explaining your research to the general public.

107
00:12:53,050 --> 00:13:03,340
No. Okay. Now there are different consequences of this are impostor syndrome.

108
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:09,880
Ah. You want me to demonstrate? That's interesting.

109
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:13,630
Beat writing. Yeah. That you're familiar with that?

110
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:20,840
Yeah. I hope I get it. Yet.

111
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:28,990
The problem is the problem, because usually that means writing the consequence of procrastination.

112
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:35,080
And that really may be different. Why exactly?

113
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,370
Because you I mean, I you see, my youngest perience,

114
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:48,000
you need to submit a grant that you need to submit these papers and I just procrastinate most of the time then that the deadline is coming,

115
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:51,940
then we go to beach right right now deploying it.

116
00:13:51,940 --> 00:14:01,390
The quality of that work is not going to be what you expect because you can imagine what what can you writing in a few days under the stress.

117
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:11,890
Then I think here we could apply some of the advice that we watch and the other be about doing a routine for writing.

118
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:16,270
I mean, these are all I don't recommend doing these.

119
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,010
And of course, frustration when you don't get the ground that your paper is rejected.

120
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:27,250
And also, of course, that can have not only professional consequence about consequence in your in your personal life,

121
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:44,230
then are you call the ideal this class or these exist in a class is to provide useful tools or at least some ways to avoid all these.

122
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:53,890
And then I hope that you apply now in your study some of the suggestions that we discussed for writing making I

123
00:14:54,010 --> 00:15:04,780
being avoid made your calendar blog time for yourself for your writing then please apply some of those advice here.

124
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:11,590
What more any comments questions.

125
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:15,939
It's a really good tip that he talked.

126
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:19,179
For example, put in your mind that you want, for example,

127
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:25,060
to write for 20 minutes and then you're going to take a small break for 5 minutes, and then you're gonna start again.

128
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:30,790
Mm hmm. This is, I think, very important. Yeah. Putting time when you should stop and take a break.

129
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:34,090
Yeah. I ask you to work like I'm taking a break.

130
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:38,260
An idea that I think that was aggravated by that made this break,

131
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:43,930
because I also you get just I mean, there is a moment that you can not think anymore.

132
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:49,360
Uh, do you, do you use breaks to write or.

133
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:53,650
We just, you try to write in that alone? I yeah.

134
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:58,600
I take a break. For example, I put this down, outline what I'm going to talk about.

135
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:03,940
Mm hmm. And then try, for example, then say, I want to talk about this in one paragraph.

136
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:08,020
Then I take a break. For instance, the second paragraph making that.

137
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:21,009
Yes, also, I'm on my own way to write, but no one, I mentioned that, but I used to write in these longest range of time.

138
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:32,739
But without brave I was too. I get tired of the and nothing doesn't work now I feel and this is something that also we need

139
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:39,610
to remember all will always remember why you decide at the very first place going into academia,

140
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:46,200
why you decide to go into this particular field of public health and nutrition.

141
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:55,030
Because we tend to forget that if our papers are rejected, if our grant are rejected,

142
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:00,490
we tend to forget about what that white porpoises, what I'm doing here.

143
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:09,850
Then on we need maybe to do some more adjustments or maybe we need to, to, to achieve in our line of research.

144
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:18,580
But don't forget that, because if we just keep doing this little thing, getting papers out, getting grants out,

145
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:30,729
but even we do you get then but you don't feel that it's worth you that you are doing that you are helping the wedding public health people.

146
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:36,639
We are helping to improve public health where even if we are interpreting in more basic science,

147
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,459
but you have to be fluent in that you feel like what people do,

148
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:47,020
they they worth your time, your effort now or their or a bite that I found very helpful.

149
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:55,480
This is an important report. Do you have this negative super between yourself to be great?

150
00:17:56,110 --> 00:18:02,110
Yeah. No, that's that's important. I try to to be part of this group.

151
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:09,879
For example, I know that in previous schooling groups are public health that school have these support groups even

152
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:17,320
just are getting going out these little activities talking about what you're doing with other students.

153
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:28,890
That is helpful. We when I was a student, I remember we have a group of four Hispanic students.

154
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:38,250
And the thing was, I was a nice buffer footballer because on time you need to talk with someone your own language.

155
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:48,330
Now, another another point that I found interesting is that read was of pro-life.

156
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:57,280
And this concept that we are symbolic creatures. I mean, we tried to find meaning and.

157
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:05,680
Where are you from? I tend to be more people get the word.

158
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:17,770
What I'm trying to say is that we trying to find meaning or were doing in English old things.

159
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:22,480
We are not robots. Robots we are.

160
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:25,590
Ding dong.

161
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:33,579
The presenter suggested that even if we decide to write when we are working in a paper,

162
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:42,910
we are working in our research project, but the windows are breaking the break or even having some.

163
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:50,980
I like to write drinking coffee, for example, and making the coffee for me to write.

164
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:56,470
This is like and this is more read. What that you find are you're going to help you to through your day.

165
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:04,780
Do you have any ritual? I mean, my ritual I mean, any little thing that you do to you can have a designated space.

166
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,730
Yeah, that's good. Often.

167
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:15,920
Do you have any spin here in the school to write? We have our cubicles.

168
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:23,690
Yeah, I know.

169
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:27,470
And always remember that you are unique. Your life is unique.

170
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:34,280
The research I do you are doing, even if it's part of your mental research.

171
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:37,910
But it has unique research. You are going to have setbacks.

172
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:46,819
Most likely that is going to happen. Then we sometimes we find that nothing popping up.

173
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:52,940
We expect the event to happen. But you are going to have actually for me.

174
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,040
I always tell a student when you graduate, when you finish your thesis,

175
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:05,630
when you you are going to at that moment, you are going to know something that no one else in the world know.

176
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:09,860
When you find something new, when you are, you get new knowledge.

177
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:18,650
And for me, I will say find figuring magic, find for both in what you do.

178
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:25,830
Hopefully at the end we're going to get wisdom that I am getting older and

179
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:32,350
then hopefully we are at the end of in this process we will learn something.

180
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:40,549
I always I expect to learn also from my students question, comments, you know, what do you think about DVT?

181
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:49,430
Do you think there was a U.S. fall or or not was the time?

182
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:57,450
Feel free to say it was it was a thing about which pardon the media, whatever, you know.

183
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:00,850
Do you think that was useful? They're useful.

184
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:07,010
New tools. I like the thing that we have to take a deep breath from here.

185
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:12,670
Once again, I have to read you too many deep breaths.

186
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:20,560
Yeah, and I know. Yes, although I wait.

187
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:27,280
Also, I want to remind you all so that you can take advantage of this period will be this and that and that website,

188
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:34,659
the arrow that beta that you can find useful that we don't we're not going to watch the here in the flat,

189
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:41,050
but the arrow there, for example, how to say no, how to manage conflict with your mentors.

190
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:47,260
Because conflict is going to happen with your mentor, with your rest, with your friends, with all their faculty.

191
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:50,530
Then they to use it will be there. How to manage that.

192
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:56,680
Then I recommend going through that website and take advantage of the resources.

193
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:02,890
Question. I know. And I hope that really that that that's.

194
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:07,160
Um, so I really hope that it was helpful for.

195
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,360
Do they have watched this video? I've seen this. Is that poor plan?

196
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:17,060
Yeah. You have to watch, I believe, because this is one notable idea that we we discuss in the fall.

197
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:21,030
But always I find something new that is useful to for me.

198
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:33,810
You know. Hmm. Okay, then, before I forget, then remember next Monday we have a student presentation.

199
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:44,510
You can find these a spreadsheet in the in bus. We have two presentations, 10 minutes at most and plus 5 minutes for discussion.

200
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:56,600
Student Uh, also, three students remember to put in canvas this form the point that you need to complete.

201
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:02,750
And after you get the signature from your mentor, please give the form for me.

202
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:12,209
So we just should. We should just printed off and have a mentor beside you.

203
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:19,700
Okay? Yeah. You like that? Yeah. You need to talk with your mentor because your mentor has to agree what other research at going to do.

204
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:23,660
But he had you with a few sentences would be enough.

205
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:27,920
Because I do, Bob, and maybe you are not completely clear what you want to do,

206
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:34,490
but you need to complete the form gift to mentor for teaching that you and then give to me.

207
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:45,640
And I will see you Monday. If you have any questions about your presentations, please let me know the slides too.

208
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:49,389
I've seen the slides too. Yes.

209
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:58,150
You are preparing a slides. Please send them to me. Let's say yes to the for the presentation.

210
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:04,240
You can send it to me. Even that that Monday, Monday morning I do it.

211
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,540
But again, you are not required to do up our presentation. You can.

212
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:11,320
You can discuss. Yes. You prepare.

213
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:16,960
Thank you. You're welcome. Can I send you a my.

214
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,130
Okay, give me one second thing. I'm going to stop this.
