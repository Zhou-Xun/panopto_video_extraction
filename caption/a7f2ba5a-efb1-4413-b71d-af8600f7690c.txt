1
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:04,923
More than six months. I really care about, you know, what she was like.

2
00:00:14,292 --> 00:00:22,062
Okay. So as I this is what I normally do, I would like to review like what we needed last time.

3
00:00:25,992 --> 00:00:30,632
I always tell people the first reviews of most procedures this issue economy.

4
00:00:33,882 --> 00:00:38,261
Okay, so now let's talk about our survival analysis.

5
00:00:38,262 --> 00:00:43,602
Right? So as I said, our variable of interest is t, right?

6
00:00:43,632 --> 00:00:49,922
So this actually. Is a random variable and this is a non-negative random variable, right?

7
00:00:49,952 --> 00:01:00,222
So normally we think of this as a time from the time that between your time zero until an event of interest that happens.

8
00:01:00,302 --> 00:01:06,782
Right. So for example that s disease onset or your graduation.

9
00:01:07,112 --> 00:01:10,862
So it his of our family right.

10
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:14,822
So I think the statisticians are really of a funny group of people.

11
00:01:14,822 --> 00:01:20,162
Right. They are using survival. Our analysis, everything is quite a failure.

12
00:01:20,292 --> 00:01:25,142
Right. Even though your graduation. Let's call it a failure.

13
00:01:26,642 --> 00:01:31,742
But when you look at when you go to the Bernoulli trial, everything is success.

14
00:01:32,942 --> 00:01:36,932
Therefore, success probability, even if you got the disease, that's all.

15
00:01:37,022 --> 00:01:40,672
Know that's a success. Okay.

16
00:01:40,682 --> 00:01:46,832
So that's why people say physicians. Just so we. Okay.

17
00:01:46,832 --> 00:01:52,802
So here here is basically basic you. Here is the time that it's not the end of the calendar high.

18
00:01:52,832 --> 00:01:57,752
Right. It's really the time that. So it's going from time to time.

19
00:01:57,752 --> 00:02:01,682
Zero for the dot here until something happens.

20
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:06,752
Okay. And then the whole thing. Here is time t.

21
00:02:08,672 --> 00:02:15,652
Okay. So and another thing here is the cause of a sense for me where I.

22
00:02:15,662 --> 00:02:25,742
So what distinguishes this course from the other class is we do not even though key is our interest.

23
00:02:26,072 --> 00:02:30,332
Right is this is our main interest. Everything actually is type of study what the key is.

24
00:02:30,782 --> 00:02:38,462
But we do not fully observe this t she actually is subject to the sense of right which

25
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:48,022
means she actually is the the that the joint the result of key and the C right.

26
00:02:48,032 --> 00:02:54,972
C it actually is like a troublemaker. It is like the for example, this because it's like a center in time.

27
00:02:54,992 --> 00:02:58,651
Right. So normally we are soon, right.

28
00:02:58,652 --> 00:03:02,492
The censoring, which means. Okay. So for example, humans.

29
00:03:02,492 --> 00:03:08,432
Okay, so what happens you for your study just to stop that here.

30
00:03:08,442 --> 00:03:20,332
Right? And then you only know, well, this person is still surviving at this time point, but you do not know exactly when this event happens.

31
00:03:20,372 --> 00:03:24,422
Right? So you can only guess, right. This event, but haven't offered this.

32
00:03:24,422 --> 00:03:27,542
Right. So this is the only conclusion you can have. Okay.

33
00:03:27,692 --> 00:03:37,262
So as a result, we are poking about about the continued so T and the C actually they are competing each other.

34
00:03:38,132 --> 00:03:47,362
So in the end, what you observe here actually so I use this detail which to denote this the minimum of the two quantities.

35
00:03:47,372 --> 00:03:54,452
Right. Okay. So, so people ask me this, this actually is just the minimum of the C, right?

36
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:57,122
Okay. So again,

37
00:03:57,212 --> 00:04:10,351
here we use X here to denote the of the observer survival kind of the T is our true survival time and ask here is our observe the survival time.

38
00:04:10,352 --> 00:04:28,082
So this observer and this she is here is our for example she both qualities have a true survival time or underlying survival time.

39
00:04:28,172 --> 00:04:31,232
So basically you can think about this. This t theory is not your sense.

40
00:04:31,352 --> 00:04:37,762
Okay. Of course, we do not only observe this X, we also know whether the event happens or not.

41
00:04:37,772 --> 00:04:41,582
Right? So that's why we have this delta. This is very important.

42
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:47,482
So they here indicate whether you observe this T or not.

43
00:04:47,492 --> 00:04:56,402
Right. So for you that when Delta is you go to one, this means you observe the true survival time, but you do not observe the sensor in time.

44
00:04:56,432 --> 00:05:04,832
Right. Okay. But if you observe Delta, which is zero, which means actually so for you, this situation,

45
00:05:04,832 --> 00:05:10,772
you know that you observe the sensor on time, but you do not observe the the true survival.

46
00:05:11,042 --> 00:05:18,452
Okay. So as a result, you can think of in a survival setting, you'll all come.

47
00:05:18,872 --> 00:05:23,612
Yeah. This is not a you. And you're very admirable, right?

48
00:05:23,792 --> 00:05:29,122
Instead, it's a full dimension of variables.

49
00:05:29,132 --> 00:05:34,802
Right? So. So I think this is something you'll have to understand.

50
00:05:37,142 --> 00:05:44,642
Again, here we are talking about the light sensor. And actually, I have briefly talk about there are many other sensor types.

51
00:05:45,692 --> 00:05:52,852
In reality, 95% of chance you are gonna encounter the censoring situation.

52
00:05:53,192 --> 00:06:01,892
Yeah. Okay, so another thing here is we are normally we are still here and the C of here are independent.

53
00:06:02,012 --> 00:06:12,002
Okay, so here this is what a lot of it was about the, uh, you know, random or random message from a random.

54
00:06:14,882 --> 00:06:30,392
Right. So I think this is a basic setup for what kind of a survival data you are expected to

55
00:06:30,402 --> 00:06:37,442
encounter and also what quantities you are suppose or you are expected to observe in reality.

56
00:06:37,922 --> 00:06:42,152
Okay, so what do you observe?

57
00:06:42,182 --> 00:06:47,942
This s all the time. Okay. But in the end, we try to infer what?

58
00:06:49,272 --> 00:06:53,452
But you sound just like the Steve here.

59
00:06:53,472 --> 00:06:57,582
Actually, it's sort of like some nuisance quantity, right?

60
00:06:58,062 --> 00:07:07,762
You are really trying to use the observe data to infer what is the key is or what the distribution of key is.

61
00:07:07,782 --> 00:07:15,672
Right. They, you know, see here is just a troublemaker, just making your task more challenging.

62
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:20,012
But you are not really focused on see.

63
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:23,532
Right. You are really trying to use this to you first.

64
00:07:24,882 --> 00:07:28,082
Am I clear here, guys? Okay.

65
00:07:28,092 --> 00:07:33,192
I think this is a fundamental concept. I hope everybody will understand.

66
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:37,362
Right. You don't care about the distribution of data.

67
00:07:37,572 --> 00:07:47,412
You do not care about the distribution of X, even though you may use the distribution of X and the data to infer that distribution of T.

68
00:07:47,742 --> 00:07:51,492
Right. This actually is your major interest.

69
00:07:52,742 --> 00:07:58,931
Okay. Okay. So after this, I probably here we are talking about this, right, the center,

70
00:07:58,932 --> 00:08:08,282
because this is the most this perhaps this is as I said, this is the most frequently the counter censoring type.

71
00:08:08,292 --> 00:08:15,912
Right. But actually, you gravitate you may also encounter some other, you know, right of center and type, right.

72
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:19,722
So I, for example, here I like just give you some very basic.

73
00:08:23,852 --> 00:08:28,862
Okay. So, for example, you went within the right censoring situation.

74
00:08:28,952 --> 00:08:35,431
So. So you down care. We're just talking about the system. Okay, so we are talking about this censoring type, right?

75
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:38,632
So we have a lot of things.

76
00:08:43,352 --> 00:08:46,382
Even within a greater citizenry, there are three types.

77
00:08:46,562 --> 00:09:00,722
Okay, so the first one here is another that first of all, you're so qualified once and for all, since army is actually for everybody.

78
00:09:01,562 --> 00:09:07,112
You know exactly what is a center time is something like that in a clinical trial.

79
00:09:07,472 --> 00:09:16,972
We know that because a trial is going to end after the end of this year, you know, you know, December 31st of this year then.

80
00:09:17,282 --> 00:09:21,962
And then we are going to know that because by that time, we are going to run out of our funding.

81
00:09:22,202 --> 00:09:28,632
We have no funding to sustain the study. And then we know that the study is going to end at that time.

82
00:09:28,652 --> 00:09:29,012
Right.

83
00:09:29,162 --> 00:09:39,512
And so in this situation, we are talking about this actually so-called hypothesis or because we know exactly what the CIA's full air body itself,

84
00:09:39,722 --> 00:09:44,672
you can see how clear this is sort of either in the clinical trial.

85
00:09:45,062 --> 00:09:53,181
But think about this is. Okay.

86
00:09:53,182 --> 00:09:55,822
So so for example, there are three people, right?

87
00:09:56,092 --> 00:10:06,142
I recruit them at the end of first of this year and then we know we are gonna stop the study here December 31st of this year.

88
00:10:06,532 --> 00:10:14,872
Right. And then for this sensory time and, of course, for this person, I'm gonna I'm not going to observe this.

89
00:10:14,872 --> 00:10:19,522
I'm gonna observe these things are right. And then for this person, I'm going to observe it.

90
00:10:19,672 --> 00:10:27,352
Right. Well, this person, I'm not going to observe. Okay, so this cut here is caused by type one since you,

91
00:10:27,442 --> 00:10:35,992
because for everybody we know exactly the central time here is like the last the day of this year or universe.

92
00:10:35,992 --> 00:10:39,262
We know that the CII for everybody is one one year.

93
00:10:39,562 --> 00:10:43,062
This has been fixed. I know this. This.

94
00:10:43,072 --> 00:10:48,442
No, I know this has been prespecified. Okay. Okay.

95
00:10:48,822 --> 00:10:56,242
Another thing here is so called a type of clue, a sensory type percent for me here is.

96
00:10:56,842 --> 00:11:01,521
Okay, we are gonna stop the study one way.

97
00:11:01,522 --> 00:11:06,602
Observe. Exactly. For example, here I have three people here.

98
00:11:07,582 --> 00:11:11,092
I will start with the trial when I observe.

99
00:11:11,432 --> 00:11:15,382
Exactly. To, for example, to you. That's okay.

100
00:11:15,382 --> 00:11:22,672
So for you that in this situation I'm not so very good at how you think happens.

101
00:11:23,032 --> 00:11:29,482
I observe by your back. Right. And then I keep you I keep following off that person.

102
00:11:29,632 --> 00:11:39,472
Right. And then when this happens here, I will start to try out because when I specified pre-specified to event happens,

103
00:11:39,622 --> 00:11:43,462
I'm gonna talk to you when it happens I'm gonna stop the trial.

104
00:11:43,462 --> 00:11:48,712
Right. So here. So that's why in this situation here, this is called a type two, a sensory.

105
00:11:48,712 --> 00:11:57,022
So basically in this sensory, you are gonna stop the trial when the specified number of events happen.

106
00:11:58,362 --> 00:12:07,092
And I tell here. Okay, good. So normally this half has been annual trials.

107
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:10,812
Okay. So but not really in the clinical trials.

108
00:12:11,012 --> 00:12:16,992
Okay. So I think this actually most of most happen in clinical trials, but this doesn't happen in animal trials.

109
00:12:18,582 --> 00:12:27,332
Okay. So the the third time here actually is actually more a more popular this just like our site here, because grandma says so.

110
00:12:31,032 --> 00:12:38,172
So this actually assumes for everybody the CIA and its CIA here, they are just independent.

111
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:43,572
Okay. You do not specify their their relationship.

112
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:48,402
So so for people, people can't just drop out at any time over points,

113
00:12:48,522 --> 00:12:57,552
but they are talking about has nothing to do with their health or they are talking all has nothing to do with t in this situation.

114
00:12:57,772 --> 00:13:01,482
CI has nothing to do or is independent from T.

115
00:13:01,602 --> 00:13:08,352
Okay. As I said, just the basic ordeal of placing a date data x and a build up.

116
00:13:08,502 --> 00:13:13,992
You cannot really verify or test this assumption.

117
00:13:14,652 --> 00:13:22,032
So you have to understand what is the reason of loss to far right.

118
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:33,071
And then basically you need to have some subject matter knowledge to justify whether this is random or informative,

119
00:13:33,072 --> 00:13:37,691
informative a sense or amuse t in the CIA here are they depend on each other.

120
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:42,822
So for example, people can die of from cardiovascular disease.

121
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:48,641
People can die from, you know, they are cancer.

122
00:13:48,642 --> 00:13:57,461
Right. Okay. So for example and then if you know how people are per se versus st and as end the people actually die from the cardiovascular disease.

123
00:13:57,462 --> 00:14:03,992
But actually this person can also be can also die from the kind of also dying from cancer as well.

124
00:14:04,002 --> 00:14:11,892
Right. So that's why in this situation here, this two events here can be can be dependent.

125
00:14:16,392 --> 00:14:25,122
Okay. By the way, there are. Okay, go ahead. So for the first two, have less aspirin capsules that are those legs are.

126
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:30,252
Well, that's good point. So yeah, actually in this situation,

127
00:14:30,272 --> 00:14:38,742
you have one CIA and the CIA are independent one for this one is they are not independent actually they are dependent.

128
00:14:38,982 --> 00:14:47,681
But somehow the life actually I tried I did not specify this, but if you have a little bit interest, it turns out well,

129
00:14:47,682 --> 00:14:56,312
you specify the likelihood is that no matter whether you assume they are independent or dependent, the likelihood actually sustained against them.

130
00:14:57,482 --> 00:15:02,922
So in theory, they are not they are not independent.

131
00:15:03,042 --> 00:15:10,662
But you may if you train them independence, you turns out the likelihood function is the same as good question.

132
00:15:11,442 --> 00:15:16,152
So back to you knows the cause of death.

133
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:22,062
Right. So we we just you know sometimes that actually that's is competing events, right.

134
00:15:22,062 --> 00:15:25,332
So because Peter Chi and the CIA are competing events.

135
00:15:25,332 --> 00:15:33,192
So I tried to use this as a example, but as I said, you have to have some subject matter knowledge,

136
00:15:34,662 --> 00:15:42,641
you know, in, you know, in this word, people, there are always some people can do some extreme things.

137
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:49,242
Right. Do you know how many people in this word climate volcano every year.

138
00:15:51,302 --> 00:15:54,812
6000. Do you know how many of them died?

139
00:15:56,842 --> 00:16:04,582
3000. Okay, so you this situation die from volcano climbing.

140
00:16:05,032 --> 00:16:09,502
I will say it has nothing to do with dying from cancer. Actually, I think they are negatively correlated.

141
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:15,922
Right. So this very weird, you know,

142
00:16:15,922 --> 00:16:22,672
example just it tells you you have to really have some self of knowledge to understand the

143
00:16:22,672 --> 00:16:28,942
true reason of dying or to reason of US citizenry in order to understand that relationship.

144
00:16:29,272 --> 00:16:39,712
But based on the data, no way. You cannot tell whether they are dependent or independent their recklessness.

145
00:16:40,872 --> 00:16:46,692
Sure. For a random censoring, can we show exactly where the CIA is in this war?

146
00:16:48,482 --> 00:16:52,432
Oh, yes, sure. Absolutely.

147
00:16:53,082 --> 00:17:01,902
So, for example, this person can be can be also can drop out from the from the satellite.

148
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:06,642
Okay. So that's a thing here. If I put a circle here, this that person.

149
00:17:06,662 --> 00:17:10,252
You, sir. Okay. NSA folks in Whitehall, they're going to use the CIA.

150
00:17:10,842 --> 00:17:14,172
But you do not have the satellite here. Okay.

151
00:17:14,572 --> 00:17:19,542
So, yes. So we can use this diagram to. To show the CIA and FBI.

152
00:17:21,912 --> 00:17:27,432
Okay. So to make actually our life even a little bit more difficult.

153
00:17:27,912 --> 00:17:42,912
Now, we can also talk about the so called allow for the sensory optic nerve center here in the U.S. So, for example, we are trying to understand.

154
00:17:42,992 --> 00:17:49,972
So I think most of you actually were here at the meeting.

155
00:17:50,952 --> 00:17:55,542
So you actually, Suzanne, I close on 21, right.

156
00:17:56,322 --> 00:18:06,042
Okay. So so actually, I still remember on March 12th, I was in my office.

157
00:18:06,802 --> 00:18:11,642
Then I then the suddenly we got the notification.

158
00:18:11,652 --> 00:18:21,192
Everybody should go home because we found one positive COVID case on the campus of Michigan State.

159
00:18:21,882 --> 00:18:28,642
I said, Oh, heck, oh, here we go home because Michigan State has got a COVID case.

160
00:18:28,662 --> 00:18:38,172
Okay. But anyway, that is when the Michigan when we started wasting catches the pandemic happened in Michigan.

161
00:18:38,412 --> 00:18:41,772
Okay. That's March 12th. Okay.

162
00:18:41,832 --> 00:18:48,172
And I saw it. We could go back to our office, you know, probably three weeks back.

163
00:18:48,222 --> 00:18:52,602
But it turns out that three weeks time it took three years. Okay.

164
00:18:52,812 --> 00:19:03,072
So. Okay, so in the study, we try to understand why how soon, you know, people will get a COVID infection.

165
00:19:03,072 --> 00:19:07,391
Right. So, for example, then we recruit the people are probably the study.

166
00:19:07,392 --> 00:19:15,172
When the study happens, we begin to recruit the people in April of 2000 to 20.

167
00:19:15,192 --> 00:19:19,722
Right. And then we follow up people until they got the COVID infection.

168
00:19:19,842 --> 00:19:25,961
Right. But when we often recruit the people and the wait has the, you know,

169
00:19:25,962 --> 00:19:31,272
the the people as the serum, and we find some people already got the COVID infection.

170
00:19:32,052 --> 00:19:38,452
Right. So in this situation, we have the.

171
00:19:41,082 --> 00:19:44,281
So this is our speed. See, it is like our recruitment time.

172
00:19:44,282 --> 00:19:51,042
Right. And the we try to study when. So, for example, the starting time here is March 12th of it to end it.

173
00:19:51,042 --> 00:19:56,622
Right. But this person already calculated before recruitment.

174
00:19:56,652 --> 00:20:03,342
Right. So in this situation, we know that in 20 it's greater than seen.

175
00:20:03,792 --> 00:20:07,072
Then this person actually got the sensor right. Okay.

176
00:20:07,092 --> 00:20:12,522
So that's why, you know, the sensor situation when T is less than C.

177
00:20:14,472 --> 00:20:18,642
So we basically this means the event happens before recruitment.

178
00:20:18,912 --> 00:20:24,642
Okay. So that's why you this age, Rachel, we know that the T is less than C, but we don't know when it happens.

179
00:20:24,972 --> 00:20:28,752
Only when this T happens after recruitment.

180
00:20:28,992 --> 00:20:38,472
Wait, how observant. Okay, so this actually is left the sensor.

181
00:20:38,502 --> 00:20:48,402
Okay, so for the sensor in way knows the operation of this guy, but we we don't know when, when, when this event happens.

182
00:20:48,582 --> 00:20:53,042
So, for example, this also happens a lot in HIV study, right?

183
00:20:53,052 --> 00:20:58,712
So we try to study, you know, when people got HIV infection, but when we test the people,

184
00:20:58,722 --> 00:21:04,692
somebody already got a cold of not got an HIV infection before recruitment.

185
00:21:04,872 --> 00:21:08,502
And we we know that the person got event, by the way.

186
00:21:08,652 --> 00:21:11,912
We didn't know when that patient got the gun.

187
00:21:11,922 --> 00:21:16,902
You bet. So this is for the representative. Okay.

188
00:21:17,022 --> 00:21:33,702
So and also there is also cause the problem sensory double sensor means actually for your bank for a study.

189
00:21:35,012 --> 00:21:39,942
Well, and we also know that the the study has a limited time.

190
00:21:39,942 --> 00:21:43,362
Let's. And we know that the story is going to end sooner or later.

191
00:21:43,362 --> 00:21:49,902
Right. So you ask only one test person, so.

192
00:21:55,372 --> 00:22:02,772
Okay. So in this situation here, we have this the lower bound and also the author of this study.

193
00:22:02,782 --> 00:22:10,492
Right. Okay. And is then you for this you might have has her this are then the other use right censored you for that

194
00:22:10,512 --> 00:22:18,922
event happened before see then this event is left to censor not only when this event happens between CNR.

195
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:22,722
Then we can't fully observe this event. Okay.

196
00:22:22,732 --> 00:22:35,092
So that's why in this situation we are talking about a so-called double system to look so long.

197
00:22:35,092 --> 00:22:38,231
But actually we've actually we've we've got the closes.

198
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:53,992
So let me make this like a c, c, l, c, r frontiers represents the plan b, c.

199
00:23:08,582 --> 00:23:12,122
Okay. So you got me this double censoring, and I will just.

200
00:23:12,192 --> 00:23:15,601
Maybe I just didn't do anything, so. I mean, that's PR.

201
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:19,322
I just closed myself because nobody want me.

202
00:23:19,442 --> 00:23:23,582
This is the left. The censoring. Unrevised.

203
00:23:24,362 --> 00:23:35,212
It's only when this team here happens what the event happens between this, the lower bound and also the upper bounds.

204
00:23:35,212 --> 00:23:40,192
Then you'll account for the opposite of this event. Okay.

205
00:23:40,602 --> 00:23:47,582
Now to. We know this in a sense.

206
00:23:47,582 --> 00:23:59,462
Right. But also there's another thing here is the. There's also see the Liberals are still confident in perilous influence.

207
00:24:08,832 --> 00:24:14,432
Well, in a real sense right here, it means that you never know when this event happens.

208
00:24:14,442 --> 00:24:25,212
You only know after the event happens between that interval. So, for example, you go to a clinic, you try to study, you know, when you you know,

209
00:24:25,212 --> 00:24:32,022
for example, for an asymptomatic patient, the patient has no symptoms.

210
00:24:32,292 --> 00:24:39,472
Right. He went through the clinic trying to understand, you know, whether he or when he got his COVID advice.

211
00:24:39,492 --> 00:24:46,842
So he went to last last months. There's no you know, the test is still negative.

212
00:24:47,202 --> 00:24:51,132
And then this mask, the test turned out to be positive.

213
00:24:51,132 --> 00:24:55,182
Right. Which means what say you when the event happens?

214
00:24:55,452 --> 00:25:08,982
You'll this one? That's right. Okay. So which means in this situation, you only know that he if here is between know and ah okay.

215
00:25:09,072 --> 00:25:12,132
Ali is last amongst our is this month.

216
00:25:12,162 --> 00:25:21,082
Right. Okay. So, so you have to make sure you will not get confused with the Tablo sensor right now

217
00:25:21,082 --> 00:25:26,112
the sensor here me is actually that you will have is just during the study period.

218
00:25:26,502 --> 00:25:29,682
You are actually you are gonna observe this event.

219
00:25:30,312 --> 00:25:38,052
Exactly. But affordable sensory. You do not really observe the exact time of the event.

220
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:41,732
You only know it is between you know, to.

221
00:25:42,032 --> 00:25:43,452
To to. To limits.

222
00:25:47,762 --> 00:26:00,212
Okay so for example you have for the year for this are you fill out so after this entire process recovers both left sensory and right sensory.

223
00:26:00,362 --> 00:26:12,252
So if you left this are here to be. I'm positive you validate this becomes you know right sensor and then you feel after this l here to be zero.

224
00:26:12,552 --> 00:26:15,732
This becomes therefore a sensor. So.

225
00:26:17,652 --> 00:26:22,182
So what do you think the internal censoring actually is is a broader.

226
00:26:22,392 --> 00:26:29,951
Okay. And also and also for the and that for the L and R you've got to some finite right.

227
00:26:29,952 --> 00:26:37,602
And the R here is is not infinite here actually. Then if if if all the division has this form,

228
00:26:37,782 --> 00:26:42,822
actually it has actually much less information then for for you that is a double sensor

229
00:26:42,822 --> 00:26:49,511
data because in this situation you do not observe the event that you time at all.

230
00:26:49,512 --> 00:26:57,782
You only have this increment actually statistically of analyzing interval since our data is much more challenging.

231
00:26:57,792 --> 00:27:02,322
So there's a, there's a specific technique you'll have to use.

232
00:27:05,062 --> 00:27:10,422
Okay. And so finally, I actually I'm going to talk about the another term.

233
00:27:18,402 --> 00:27:22,932
Okay. So this actually is even a little bit more.

234
00:27:23,592 --> 00:27:27,012
You must do a little bit of confusing concepts.

235
00:27:28,632 --> 00:27:34,452
This is code. So we have left the censoring. And as I'm now, I'm going to talk about there the truncation.

236
00:27:35,082 --> 00:27:39,672
Okay. People got confused with left the censoring and left the truncation all the time.

237
00:27:40,272 --> 00:27:45,372
Hopefully after my installation, you will become even more confused.

238
00:27:48,222 --> 00:27:53,772
Okay. So [INAUDIBLE] our side and they are jokes.

239
00:27:53,932 --> 00:28:02,052
Let me try my effort to understand what do they mean by some Asian?

240
00:28:03,372 --> 00:28:15,402
Okay. So. So Tom Kitchen means that you are trying to target one particular population,

241
00:28:16,422 --> 00:28:26,712
but in the end you are gonna lose people simply because some people may never got a chance to be recruited into your study.

242
00:28:28,072 --> 00:28:33,132
So. So think about it from whatever.

243
00:28:33,192 --> 00:28:42,851
So, you know, for example, if there is a super power, super power, enter this super power can witness everything.

244
00:28:42,852 --> 00:28:46,932
Right? So this is what's going to happen here, right?

245
00:29:03,132 --> 00:29:10,362
Okay. So. Okay.

246
00:29:10,452 --> 00:29:17,292
So there's a B, C, D. Okay, so here I think about the vectors.

247
00:29:17,292 --> 00:29:21,042
They are they the this is a they have a different starting points, right?

248
00:29:21,402 --> 00:29:28,511
And then this is a where their events are. Okay. I'm trying to study their survival time.

249
00:29:28,512 --> 00:29:36,462
Right. So but I always have some, uh, this is my starting time, right?

250
00:29:37,212 --> 00:29:40,482
Okay. Because I always have to, you know, usually gravitate.

251
00:29:40,482 --> 00:29:44,082
I want to serve some of the people that I'm on to serve as the people.

252
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:47,112
Right. This is amazing. This is a this is a cut off. Right.

253
00:29:48,352 --> 00:29:55,702
And as in what's going to happen here is okay with which person is I you though

254
00:29:55,702 --> 00:30:00,982
here I'm trying to target these three or four people by four persons here.

255
00:30:01,942 --> 00:30:08,452
How many persons actually will be included in my study if my survey time happens here?

256
00:30:10,082 --> 00:30:13,262
She screams for the first person. Yeah.

257
00:30:13,292 --> 00:30:16,462
Okay. This person at this point is still. Still alive, right?

258
00:30:16,802 --> 00:30:24,242
Hey, he's going to be in my study, right? So he's still alive here, right?

259
00:30:24,452 --> 00:30:28,682
Still can't see Espy Snead is here, right?

260
00:30:29,432 --> 00:30:34,952
Yes. Is back here. About to be or already died before my.

261
00:30:36,242 --> 00:30:39,482
My survey happens right before the story begins.

262
00:30:39,782 --> 00:30:45,622
Which means I'm sorry, Sergeant. You that the bad people cannot volunteer itself to join my study.

263
00:30:45,632 --> 00:30:50,102
Right. So the guess this person would all be excluded.

264
00:30:50,462 --> 00:30:52,082
Okay. In this situation,

265
00:30:52,082 --> 00:31:07,502
I would say person B is left the truncate it simply because my data or my database will not contain any information about this person.

266
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:15,292
B. Okay. So now can you tell me what is the difference between the FDA censoring and the left of truncation?

267
00:31:16,432 --> 00:31:20,902
For have the same sort of people. Do I have this person's record?

268
00:31:22,542 --> 00:31:28,622
Yes. The only thing is, I do not know exactly what time this person had the event.

269
00:31:29,002 --> 00:31:34,642
Right. But for there's a truncated people and you don't know their existence.

270
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:38,752
Right. So that's why there's the truncation here.

271
00:31:38,962 --> 00:31:42,612
Well, loose. Even much more information that never sense.

272
00:31:44,962 --> 00:31:47,552
Am I good here, guys? Right.

273
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:55,882
So basically now you can say here therefore is truncation b, you have even much more less information that deficits are right.

274
00:31:56,042 --> 00:31:59,272
Now, the center of people, at least that you still have their records.

275
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:05,992
The only know the only thing here is you do not know the exact time points when they had their events.

276
00:32:08,362 --> 00:32:22,282
Okay. So I think those are the these are the basic types of censoring or truncation we are going to encounter here.

277
00:32:22,342 --> 00:32:30,712
Yes, go ahead. So for this truncation example, like, if we don't if we don't know anything about them because are not in the database, then why do it?

278
00:32:31,422 --> 00:32:34,132
I mean, why do we even know that they're being left truncated? Yeah.

279
00:32:34,192 --> 00:32:41,512
So, you know, again, this is really you try to infer something that you don't observe.

280
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:46,102
Right. This means, again, you need to have some subject matter knowledge.

281
00:32:46,492 --> 00:32:50,782
Right. And also another thing here is you have to make some assumptions here.

282
00:32:51,312 --> 00:32:57,402
Right. You have to make an assumption. And then when we deal with the left, the truncated data.

283
00:32:57,772 --> 00:33:01,072
Normally what we do here is we wait.

284
00:33:01,072 --> 00:33:09,262
We conditional conditional on units, agents and in great condition objects greater that A's recruitment time.

285
00:33:09,682 --> 00:33:16,222
Okay so you work we do real we do inference by the conditional on this condition.

286
00:33:17,092 --> 00:33:23,182
Right. So you are worse. Well, you deal with left sort of truncated data, you understand?

287
00:33:23,532 --> 00:33:28,572
Even though you try to infer the whole general population.

288
00:33:28,582 --> 00:33:34,731
But in the end, you should know that your your inference should only be conditional.

289
00:33:34,732 --> 00:33:39,942
And that's not true. Basically you try to infer ABCD.

290
00:33:40,462 --> 00:33:46,442
But you should know that your results are only generated by a c d.

291
00:33:47,362 --> 00:33:50,422
Okay. So this is limitation you try to address.

292
00:33:53,362 --> 00:34:05,442
Yeah. Basically is your study population differs from your population do try to infer and so that you know, there is some disconnection.

293
00:34:05,452 --> 00:34:16,142
So this is something you have to be aware. And then normally in order to break that scab gap, you'll have to make some further assumptions.

294
00:34:19,892 --> 00:34:25,952
Okay. But so I think that there are several things that can be very confusing.

295
00:34:25,982 --> 00:34:31,922
I think the first part here is tablo censoring versus internal censoring.

296
00:34:31,922 --> 00:34:37,402
Right. Again, bravo. Censoring actually has more information than internal censoring.

297
00:34:37,422 --> 00:34:46,292
Right. And also, there's another probably even more confusing point is the so-called level of communication,

298
00:34:46,562 --> 00:34:50,492
again, between the left function and the left, the censoring.

299
00:34:50,522 --> 00:34:55,682
That's the function actually you book has, you know, even less information that they have a sense of.

300
00:34:55,922 --> 00:35:00,242
Okay. Okay. So I think that actually.

301
00:35:01,412 --> 00:35:05,612
So you in my course note lumbar while I have a lot of people.

302
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:16,772
Okay. So I try not to just read the slides here one by one, but, uh.

303
00:35:18,002 --> 00:35:21,612
Yeah, but I think they are just talking about for this, for the stuff here.

304
00:35:21,632 --> 00:35:28,482
Yeah. So here I would say I'm with the changes this interval, the single censoring tool around the ground in a sense.

305
00:35:29,602 --> 00:35:34,982
It's it's not either. Yes.

306
00:35:36,962 --> 00:35:40,072
Cannot help. It's okay.

307
00:35:40,092 --> 00:35:43,632
Yes. Yeah. I have you.

308
00:35:55,552 --> 00:36:06,252
You. You.

309
00:36:09,012 --> 00:36:13,332
So we don't have to shoot you up.

310
00:36:24,402 --> 00:36:33,642
Okay. So you know how well our PR is working on this technology, you know, working on this technical glitches.

311
00:36:34,512 --> 00:36:39,502
Let me just continue. Okay. So now we have covered all sorts of sensor in pipes.

312
00:36:39,722 --> 00:36:44,922
Right now, I'm going to talk about the many functions.

313
00:36:44,982 --> 00:36:49,092
We are going to study in survival our analysis. Okay.

314
00:36:49,092 --> 00:36:57,222
So aside from this technical part, do we have any questions on those sensor types?

315
00:36:57,972 --> 00:37:04,362
Sure. Go ahead. Ask about the difference between the double hand internal sensor in the device, which you know.

316
00:37:04,752 --> 00:37:12,252
Okay. Toggle sensor. It means at least the event happens during the study period.

317
00:37:12,642 --> 00:37:16,722
You will be able to observe you being passed by the full screen.

318
00:37:17,112 --> 00:37:21,162
You only know you have this between the interval. You'll never observe the exact time.

319
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:33,732
Okay. Okay. So anonymous interval, sensory. You has much more that much less information than than what I said about my neighbor.

320
00:37:33,822 --> 00:37:39,972
So. Okay. So another question is about all those different types.

321
00:37:41,532 --> 00:37:46,722
Sure. I noticed the slide is that the single sensor is also right.

322
00:37:47,002 --> 00:37:52,212
So it is. Yeah, I would I would just to change that to to a random sensor.

323
00:37:52,422 --> 00:38:05,652
Yeah. So I think that that is more processing.

324
00:38:11,792 --> 00:38:15,632
Okay. So if no more questions, I'm going continue.

325
00:38:16,652 --> 00:38:24,812
I'm going to continue and then talk about some, some basic concepts that involves the.

326
00:38:38,752 --> 00:38:42,862
I think so. You are of good perspective.

327
00:38:47,722 --> 00:38:58,222
Okay. So and another thing here is I you know, our statistical analysis is always built upon assumptions.

328
00:38:58,732 --> 00:39:02,042
Okay. So in this course, we have a.

329
00:39:03,282 --> 00:39:08,902
We have some basic assumptions we want to make in the first assumption.

330
00:39:08,922 --> 00:39:13,362
Here he is. Of course we use TEI and a C.I. and I.

331
00:39:13,372 --> 00:39:18,252
From what I hear, you didn't see the patients right?

332
00:39:18,582 --> 00:39:33,431
Where in this situation I have and patients. So the first assumption here is so called the random sensory random sensor in the

333
00:39:33,432 --> 00:39:41,802
community and a CIA here are independent so this happens for all the I right and honor.

334
00:39:57,362 --> 00:40:04,862
Another independence assumption I have to make here is the independence across the subjects.

335
00:40:05,192 --> 00:40:12,302
Others, like C.I. and T.J. are independent.

336
00:40:12,692 --> 00:40:16,922
If I had to choose, I'm not I'm not actually the same.

337
00:40:17,192 --> 00:40:21,572
Okay. So Javers even posts, right? Patient number one.

338
00:40:22,172 --> 00:40:26,941
He's a survival. Has nothing to do. What is patient to to her survival.

339
00:40:26,942 --> 00:40:31,292
Okay so so this is kind the independence across the subjects.

340
00:40:33,122 --> 00:40:43,482
But this may not be. The the the first one here, this is not testable.

341
00:40:43,782 --> 00:40:49,332
Fourthly, the second amount here is testable. And you will be able to use the statistical models.

342
00:40:49,332 --> 00:40:54,302
You can use the data to test this assumption. Okay.

343
00:40:54,312 --> 00:41:04,422
And remember, Tina, TGA here, there can be testing and also again, you can also have some subject matter knowledge.

344
00:41:04,422 --> 00:41:09,432
So for example, if you try to study the survival times of a twin brothers.

345
00:41:10,442 --> 00:41:14,282
Actually the term brothers actually is their survival time.

346
00:41:14,292 --> 00:41:23,552
Sachin Tendulkar did it right because they are coming from the same they have the same genes, all of the same very similar genetic makeups.

347
00:41:24,422 --> 00:41:33,422
Or you try to study the new type of study, actually the survival times, you know, of the cardiovascular disease in the family members.

348
00:41:33,812 --> 00:41:41,371
Okay. And then in this situation, the family member's survival times actually can be correlated because of the sheer,

349
00:41:41,372 --> 00:41:47,302
the environmental factors or risk factors or some of the family genes.

350
00:41:47,312 --> 00:41:53,522
Right. Okay. Okay. So these are the two assumptions here.

351
00:41:53,532 --> 00:42:04,202
You have two and a lot of you in that situation, you have to use, for example, in your non-utility, no data analysis.

352
00:42:04,242 --> 00:42:07,412
We know how to analyze according to data. Right.

353
00:42:07,682 --> 00:42:11,372
And they use a survival analysis. They also know how to.

354
00:42:11,372 --> 00:42:19,892
And we actually there is also a specific technique for analyzing the correlate the survival times, which is quite so called the frailty model.

355
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:24,391
Right. So there is also the marginal models and also the frailty models.

356
00:42:24,392 --> 00:42:32,462
It's just like in the next now utility of data analysis, you'll have the G model versus what's grabbing the best models.

357
00:42:32,822 --> 00:42:39,572
So there is always a counterpart use your regular statistical methods.

358
00:42:44,162 --> 00:42:50,972
Okay. So now this is this is a little bit of of I'll just ask you some questions here.

359
00:42:54,392 --> 00:42:57,062
Example of you. Okay.

360
00:42:57,422 --> 00:43:13,572
So we are trying to to study is a we try to estimate to the median time to truth to say this is a defense right so basically this to congratulation.

361
00:43:14,072 --> 00:43:20,372
So the study is sample here he is just amputees these students in the college of being in Canada.

362
00:43:21,842 --> 00:43:33,482
So you this study actually some of the students were included in this data and then the 17 events were censored.

363
00:43:33,572 --> 00:43:39,871
Right. So in this situation is time from coming to campus until graduation.

364
00:43:39,872 --> 00:43:43,562
Right. And it turns out the 17 students were dropping out.

365
00:43:45,582 --> 00:43:54,342
Okay. Then why the actual would you? What is up with greatest concern regarding the assumptions underlying our analysis of this data?

366
00:43:57,232 --> 00:44:00,772
Draw, but would not be independent until March. Yes, certainly.

367
00:44:00,892 --> 00:44:05,852
So people drop out maybe because of academic reasons.

368
00:44:05,872 --> 00:44:16,672
Right. So. So it is the analog is like the patients drop out from the clinical trial because their body cannot tolerate the treatment.

369
00:44:17,002 --> 00:44:26,972
Right. So Yadira is here. Our concern here is whether we are censoring or independent censoring still happens here.

370
00:44:26,992 --> 00:44:30,202
Right. Okay. So that's an excellent answer. Thank you.

371
00:44:32,182 --> 00:44:36,712
Okay. So another thing here is now we have this multiple myeloma.

372
00:44:36,712 --> 00:44:40,851
Multiple myeloma is sort of like some of bone marrow disease.

373
00:44:40,852 --> 00:44:44,152
You're like so like a profit but out of bladder cancer.

374
00:44:44,392 --> 00:44:50,892
Right. Okay. So we are we are going to have some, you know,

375
00:44:50,902 --> 00:45:00,941
the multiple myeloma patient normally in severe pain and then they can also cause like a recurrent infection.

376
00:45:00,942 --> 00:45:06,492
And at the end. That's right. So here we have a bunch of covariates.

377
00:45:06,792 --> 00:45:13,542
And as we try to study how those co areas here are associated with time until infection.

378
00:45:13,992 --> 00:45:20,742
Okay. So what is the one conflict, one complexity of this event time here?

379
00:45:21,582 --> 00:45:25,512
What kind of complication you may encounter in this data?

380
00:45:27,772 --> 00:45:33,442
Okay. So we didn't study this work here, close knit.

381
00:45:33,442 --> 00:45:42,202
But actually there's a recurrent event. As I said before, the event could happen multiple times within the same patient.

382
00:45:42,202 --> 00:45:49,582
So as a result of the independence assumption across the different events here may not

383
00:45:49,792 --> 00:45:55,882
hold right so so that's why the complicating feature here is the recurrent events.

384
00:45:59,982 --> 00:46:07,282
Okay. So this actually is, for example, in prostate prostate cancer trial.

385
00:46:08,022 --> 00:46:17,412
We we apply the you know, the treatment is a D s is, you know, is a more aggressive treatment versus placebo.

386
00:46:17,742 --> 00:46:27,731
And then we try to study actually whether other patients actually on the treatment group will have a better survival compared to the placebo group.

387
00:46:27,732 --> 00:46:37,122
Right. So in this situation, the time of origin here can be the state of randomization, right.

388
00:46:37,422 --> 00:46:40,541
Okay. So from the time zero till death.

389
00:46:40,542 --> 00:46:44,422
Right. Oh I see. Yeah.

390
00:46:45,522 --> 00:46:48,912
Best deal to prostate cancer right after the age or whatever.

391
00:46:49,302 --> 00:46:56,202
A lot of queries. Okay. Can you also just give me an alternative choice for the time scale?

392
00:46:56,802 --> 00:46:59,982
So here I use that my time scale here is my origin.

393
00:47:00,372 --> 00:47:05,142
I use the date of randomization. What other time?

394
00:47:05,142 --> 00:47:09,761
Zero. You can have the individual diagnosis and that's good.

395
00:47:09,762 --> 00:47:12,972
Well, yeah, diagnosis. Cure can be good. Well, okay. Thank you.

396
00:47:12,972 --> 00:47:22,632
Yeah, that's that's good about. Okay, but if I really want to study the treatment effect in treatment starting date, right.

397
00:47:22,842 --> 00:47:31,662
So when the patient begins their treatment that's that's can also be very good, you know, time scale.

398
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:36,032
Thank you. Let's go. Okay.

399
00:47:36,032 --> 00:47:44,372
So another thing, here he is. Now we have another we have a multiple sentence file where these are children.

400
00:47:44,372 --> 00:47:53,492
And then patients were matched into pairs by their relation status and a partial complete remission at each hospital.

401
00:47:54,482 --> 00:48:00,242
And then each pair actually would be randomized to receive that treatment or disabled.

402
00:48:00,242 --> 00:48:09,302
Right. Okay. So now can you just the challenge is the independence across subjects from full perspective.

403
00:48:13,382 --> 00:48:16,712
The first perspective is what? So think about this.

404
00:48:16,892 --> 00:48:20,192
We have the children coming from different hospitals, right?

405
00:48:21,212 --> 00:48:31,202
But for the patients coming from the same hospital because of the similar treatment, the protocol, they just similar the same doctors.

406
00:48:31,412 --> 00:48:34,532
Rise year survival. Medical related.

407
00:48:34,562 --> 00:48:39,002
Right. And also another thing here, you see the pairs Xavier match.

408
00:48:39,032 --> 00:48:46,172
Right. So that's why their correlation here can also be be introduced by by this match.

409
00:48:46,742 --> 00:48:59,321
So these are there are two perspectives here. Okay.

410
00:48:59,322 --> 00:49:01,662
So here I don't know what happened here.

411
00:49:01,662 --> 00:49:16,162
I had the patient received the kidney transplant in Ohio State and then the some people just move out of the campus and then you see,

412
00:49:16,212 --> 00:49:21,162
I like it to be independent of that setting. These are people that drop out from the study.

413
00:49:23,022 --> 00:49:26,352
Maybe they don't like the Ohio State. They want to move to Michigan.

414
00:49:28,272 --> 00:49:32,472
In that situation. I would assume kids are out here and that are independent.

415
00:49:32,472 --> 00:49:37,482
But but seriously, I think at the Ohio State University, it has zero hospitals is great.

416
00:49:37,482 --> 00:49:43,061
So I would think in this case, most likely the patients cannot tolerate the treatment.

417
00:49:43,062 --> 00:49:48,352
So I think in this situation, see, as you are likely to be dependent on ice.

418
00:49:48,762 --> 00:49:52,632
Okay, so, okay, so this is a good one.

419
00:49:53,472 --> 00:50:03,162
I so we try to study actually the construct, the survival curves for a for a channel house.

420
00:50:03,192 --> 00:50:06,582
You know, a ten year policy is like sort of like a retirement community.

421
00:50:06,852 --> 00:50:11,172
The Imparato, you know, a very rich neighborhood in California.

422
00:50:12,672 --> 00:50:20,232
So we try to construct this survival curve for for the residents there using their age as a time absence.

423
00:50:20,262 --> 00:50:25,362
Right. Some time, you know, from their birth date to the child.

424
00:50:25,362 --> 00:50:35,172
That's right. Okay. What actually could be the most prominent characteristics of the observed failure times in the study?

425
00:50:35,172 --> 00:50:41,922
What could be something you may consider that could complicate complicated your study?

426
00:50:44,872 --> 00:50:50,362
You're doing a survey, right, for for the patients for the residents there.

427
00:50:51,492 --> 00:50:54,542
Right. There may be love, truncation.

428
00:50:54,912 --> 00:51:03,072
Thank you so much. Yeah, exactly. After surgery, some patients or some other people may already die and already die.

429
00:51:03,432 --> 00:51:11,112
What? You began your survey, right? So you're trying to infer the whole community by then you instead and you may laugh out,

430
00:51:12,222 --> 00:51:16,662
you know, the sicker patients who didn't survive past your survey time.

431
00:51:17,022 --> 00:51:22,572
Yeah. Yeah, I think this is a left. The truncation is a prominent feature of this study.

432
00:51:23,712 --> 00:51:28,792
Okay, I'll be good here. Okay.

433
00:51:30,532 --> 00:51:33,602
Looks reasonable, right? Okay.

434
00:51:35,722 --> 00:51:40,492
Okay. So now you just watch what time, okay?

435
00:51:40,542 --> 00:51:48,022
We still have time. Okay, so now we move to our second chapter.

436
00:51:49,882 --> 00:51:52,882
Now let's talk about our survival.

437
00:51:54,712 --> 00:52:01,312
Now we understand so far, we understand the concepts right off.

438
00:52:01,462 --> 00:52:07,762
What kind of data? What the survival data look like. Right? Survival data look like X and are they all right?

439
00:52:08,032 --> 00:52:12,802
X is our observe survival time and the data is the indicator, right?

440
00:52:12,822 --> 00:52:17,242
And then based on X and Y, those are wage high value for a lot.

441
00:52:17,992 --> 00:52:22,192
We try to infer some quantities for what?

442
00:52:23,302 --> 00:52:26,372
For T right. So this is the where we are. Right?

443
00:52:26,442 --> 00:52:29,652
We have a XOR and a delta and if we try to infer t.

444
00:52:29,842 --> 00:52:34,852
S, okay, and then these are the qualities we try to infer.

445
00:52:35,122 --> 00:52:41,222
So we try to infer the survival function. We try to infer basically a function.

446
00:52:41,272 --> 00:52:48,292
We try to infer have their function which infers a life expectancy, and also we try to infer the mean residual life.

447
00:52:48,922 --> 00:52:55,072
Okay. So then after the loss of truth, honey, this here actually can be quite interesting.

448
00:52:55,492 --> 00:52:59,842
So life expectancy here is even the survival.

449
00:53:00,262 --> 00:53:08,272
This is our survival time, right? So the next expectation is the life expectancy.

450
00:53:08,422 --> 00:53:15,542
But. Okay. So and then what does that mean, residual lifetime me residual time periods.

451
00:53:15,562 --> 00:53:16,211
Okay. Okay.

452
00:53:16,212 --> 00:53:26,472
So for example, if a patient, a cancer survivor, a cancer survivor is this person has already survived, you know, five years after surgery.

453
00:53:26,712 --> 00:53:30,582
And then that patient would ask you, Doctor, how many more years?

454
00:53:31,032 --> 00:53:35,052
I can start right now. You say, okay, I can calculate that the residual time, please.

455
00:53:36,252 --> 00:53:40,422
Okay. So when you ask, given this patient here he is zero.

456
00:53:40,842 --> 00:53:51,222
The patient has already survived. Right? So given you know that this person has already survived, she is enrolled in the reunion of time.

457
00:53:51,612 --> 00:53:56,922
And then you try to calculate the expected patient the mean residual time.

458
00:53:57,102 --> 00:54:02,562
Okay. How many more years this patient can survive after this patient survived?

459
00:54:03,042 --> 00:54:07,542
Zero. So this is cause the median residual survival type.

460
00:54:10,922 --> 00:54:18,422
Okay. So these are the and also we are going to talk about actually so for the first.

461
00:54:19,902 --> 00:54:22,932
Three quantities here. There's survival function.

462
00:54:23,112 --> 00:54:29,832
Those in a function has our function. You know, also actually I wasn't going to talk about the two minute capacitor function.

463
00:54:30,012 --> 00:54:34,692
So if you know one of them, you also, you know, the rest are three or four.

464
00:54:34,962 --> 00:54:39,402
Get at a certain way is the survival function, which is the density function.

465
00:54:39,642 --> 00:54:46,902
You will be able to calculate the life expectancy and also you will be able to calculate that that's the residual time.

466
00:54:47,082 --> 00:54:51,252
Right. Okay. So Hirers, based on their survival functions here,

467
00:54:51,402 --> 00:55:01,002
you will be able to calculate some quantities of interest to the patients or to the their for the physicians or to the patients, the families.

468
00:55:03,502 --> 00:55:06,922
Okay. So survival.

469
00:55:07,372 --> 00:55:10,792
So. So here, actually, we define our survival function here.

470
00:55:10,882 --> 00:55:14,422
This way. Okay, so. So are we.

471
00:55:14,692 --> 00:55:21,052
First of all, we all assume the independence across objects and is only assumed the survival function is defined this way.

472
00:55:21,082 --> 00:55:27,962
Okay. The member here, the way defines a paramedic is greater than he.

473
00:55:28,102 --> 00:55:32,931
We do not need a you cosine easier for you.

474
00:55:32,932 --> 00:55:41,452
Very sensitive here. Well, of course, if our underlying random variable here is continuous, it doesn't matter, right?

475
00:55:42,202 --> 00:55:48,922
Because for the continuous rather variable, it's gonna be equal to a fixed constant.

476
00:55:48,922 --> 00:55:52,392
With what probability? Zero probability.

477
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:55,612
So it doesn't matter whether you, you, you usually include the you.

478
00:55:55,612 --> 00:56:02,692
Cos I will. What not. Right. But for that this create the survival times z the u cosine here.

479
00:56:02,722 --> 00:56:09,652
That's a huge difference. Okay. But using our course, we we.

480
00:56:09,652 --> 00:56:12,762
We do not leave the u cosine zero. Okay.

481
00:56:13,702 --> 00:56:22,202
To. But if you meet our students, you know, coming from Boston, coming from Harvard School,

482
00:56:22,202 --> 00:56:27,722
perhaps they have a you call signs here so you can trade with them.

483
00:56:33,992 --> 00:56:41,702
So these are they just like that you do for the discipline for the CDF, for the CDF.

484
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:46,772
And you know what is increasing right for the survival function here.

485
00:56:47,252 --> 00:56:51,722
You know that you start you started out there, right?

486
00:56:52,532 --> 00:56:57,752
Because here our survival time is a non-negative random error.

487
00:56:57,752 --> 00:57:00,762
Right. Okay, start with the arrow. Okay.

488
00:57:00,782 --> 00:57:09,692
It starts with one, right? And then the other just gradually approaching zero.

489
00:57:10,022 --> 00:57:13,332
Right. When 20 goes to infinity. Right.

490
00:57:13,412 --> 00:57:19,412
So. So, again, the survival function here is always monotonic, decreasing.

491
00:57:19,412 --> 00:57:24,992
Right. Okay. Which means actually eventually the event will happen, right?

492
00:57:27,942 --> 00:57:33,492
And then first we have this month on Tuesday, and then we have the.

493
00:57:35,092 --> 00:57:40,342
The rest of the food properties are so cool that we're going to look at aggregate.

494
00:57:40,362 --> 00:57:47,452
So which means your story is one and as and when he goes to infinity, it's going to be approaching zero, right?

495
00:57:47,452 --> 00:57:53,462
So this causes the record average conditions. Okay.

496
00:57:53,482 --> 00:57:59,181
And then we we know that there's a density function definition, right?

497
00:57:59,182 --> 00:58:06,832
So you can see that this is a for the density function of areas of chi nice between this is for the continuous

498
00:58:06,832 --> 00:58:14,542
about immovable and then you'll have to compensate the for the width of your of the time interval.

499
00:58:15,352 --> 00:58:20,482
So the working conditions are the working definition means that it's not really precise,

500
00:58:20,482 --> 00:58:28,492
but you can sort of think about this as, you know, what happens what is appropriate in Keith this is let you go to the key.

501
00:58:28,492 --> 00:58:31,942
Right. So but this is just a working definition.

502
00:58:31,972 --> 00:58:37,162
Right. But in the in theory, if you just directly use this is you know, this is coming zero.

503
00:58:37,162 --> 00:58:43,282
Right. But you can sort of think about this happens when t is is a discrete random variable.

504
00:58:44,692 --> 00:58:52,852
Okay. So with this definition, we know that that my ass, my survival function and the desire to function is connected.

505
00:58:52,972 --> 00:58:59,662
That's right. Okay. So. But but one key.

506
00:59:00,262 --> 00:59:07,252
Yes. Is great. Then we don't have the we don't have the equal signs here.

507
00:59:07,462 --> 00:59:16,552
We would have the. Okay.

508
00:59:16,762 --> 00:59:32,192
So in this see here. Okay.

509
00:59:32,542 --> 00:59:41,982
So one by one, I when my chief here be discreet, then I don't have the integral.

510
00:59:41,992 --> 00:59:45,142
I have the summation. Right. Okay. And is that here?

511
00:59:45,202 --> 00:59:50,842
Is you greater than P? And then I add up, you know, all are what one atoms here.

512
00:59:54,762 --> 00:59:58,062
Okay. Then we can also define the CDF.

513
00:59:58,602 --> 01:00:00,672
CDF here is just all here.

514
01:00:00,702 --> 01:00:14,742
So I know that's why in Michigan here we want to define the survival function in this way because because actually we always define the CPF.

515
01:00:15,522 --> 01:00:18,612
So we write CDF actually has a u cosine here.

516
01:00:19,092 --> 01:00:28,902
Right. Which means that because we be the Western Reserve which how to make our life a little bit easier.

517
01:00:29,772 --> 01:00:38,412
So that's why this attribute is always true here no matter t is discrete or continuous.

518
01:00:39,522 --> 01:00:50,502
Right. Okay. If we find our. Okay, so that's why the u cosine here is very important.

519
01:00:50,592 --> 01:00:58,152
Right. Okay. Without that u cosine here, then this quantity here, this equation here holds true all the time.

520
01:00:58,332 --> 01:01:05,952
No matter my underlying random variable, all my underlying survival time is great or continuous.

521
01:01:07,992 --> 01:01:11,702
Okay, so. So this. This thing here always true.

522
01:01:11,802 --> 01:01:19,482
Okay. No matter my underlying cap that he is this this is this create all continuous.

523
01:01:22,432 --> 01:01:31,612
Okay so here it just tells you actually the for example in the continuous case at and you can use you can actually get as a CDB you can

524
01:01:31,612 --> 01:01:40,462
get a function from CDF and also vice versa and as N you should be able to get the same thing here for this created rather miracle.

525
01:01:40,492 --> 01:01:54,732
Right. Okay. So what we are trying to do here is user and we try to estimate our survival function based on the the observed theta x and that there.

526
01:01:54,742 --> 01:01:58,642
All right. So we try to estimate our survival function.

527
01:02:00,082 --> 01:02:08,661
Because of the nature of the survival studies, we are more interested in survival function then the density function.

528
01:02:08,662 --> 01:02:14,422
And then because of a censoring, we cannot estimate the survival function directly.

529
01:02:14,662 --> 01:02:20,662
Instead, we are going to find that estimate.

530
01:02:20,902 --> 01:02:31,432
The hazard or function is much easier than estimating the density function and it turns out once you are able to estimate the how their function,

531
01:02:31,642 --> 01:02:36,532
then you will be able to estimate as a survival function so you can have their function.

532
01:02:38,092 --> 01:02:43,971
Okay. So I just want to tell you, you know, many years ago when I was a graduate student,

533
01:02:43,972 --> 01:02:49,062
my professors asked me, what is the most important concept, these statistics to you?

534
01:02:49,152 --> 01:02:54,292
What is the most important concept these statistics make?

535
01:02:54,712 --> 01:02:58,102
Right, because everything here is surrounding the likelihood.

536
01:02:58,162 --> 01:03:06,412
But now I tell you, for the survival analysis, the most important a concept is what has a function,

537
01:03:07,042 --> 01:03:12,642
because everything, Peter, everything here builds upon the hazard of function.

538
01:03:12,652 --> 01:03:17,772
So once you have that has a function, you will be able to get everything you want.

539
01:03:18,472 --> 01:03:21,082
And also, it turns out the have their function.

540
01:03:21,082 --> 01:03:28,311
We will be able to use our data to estimate the has or function, or at least there's not too many other functions.

541
01:03:28,312 --> 01:03:32,631
So this is something I will show you later. Okay.

542
01:03:32,632 --> 01:03:36,652
So before we do here, because actually we are going to introduce a have their function,

543
01:03:36,652 --> 01:03:44,332
but it turns out it has a function is introduced as some sort of like a conditional probability, all conditional transitive function.

544
01:03:44,332 --> 01:03:53,992
So so that's why we we need to just briefly review the concepts of the conditional and the marginal probabilities.

545
01:03:54,142 --> 01:03:54,262
Okay.

546
01:03:54,292 --> 01:04:04,521
So now we have the and a, B, our to events, we can introduce their marginal property and then we can also introduce their conditional probability.

547
01:04:04,522 --> 01:04:08,572
Right. So conditional probability here is. So for example, I have fully events.

548
01:04:10,222 --> 01:04:15,772
So this is conditional profit for A given B, right?

549
01:04:16,042 --> 01:04:24,712
So, so this after me is okay. So given that V happens, what kind of heaven what what is the probability that A will also have an object?

550
01:04:24,892 --> 01:04:31,371
It turns out you will be able to calculate the death as the ratio of the two marginal probabilities.

551
01:04:31,372 --> 01:04:39,022
Right. So the denominator, the numerator here he is going to be A and a B, both happens, right?

552
01:04:39,232 --> 01:04:42,742
It's going to be a intersection B, right.

553
01:04:43,252 --> 01:04:51,081
Divided by property of D, if you have A, your denominator is non-zero.

554
01:04:51,082 --> 01:05:01,941
Right. Okay. So this actually is the conditional probability definition actually.

555
01:05:01,942 --> 01:05:04,912
Then we are going to talk about it, have their function.

556
01:05:04,912 --> 01:05:12,472
So you can see here and how their function is very much related to the things of function except for that I am gonna.

557
01:05:14,392 --> 01:05:18,052
So this exercise is actually very important for the patient, right.

558
01:05:18,502 --> 01:05:23,152
Because for the patient what their concern here is, Doctor, I have already survived.

559
01:05:24,652 --> 01:05:27,801
So this morning. Okay, what is the chance?

560
01:05:27,802 --> 01:05:33,262
I'm going to go. I'm going to die today. Doctor says, okay, I'm going to calculate your hazard or functions.

561
01:05:33,622 --> 01:05:40,072
Okay. So that's why the have their function is all about the given the patient the the status

562
01:05:40,372 --> 01:05:45,082
you try to study where when the state that when this patient is going with that

563
01:05:45,082 --> 01:05:50,631
right so this is why to have their function here is very important so the working

564
01:05:50,632 --> 01:05:55,042
condition here so just think about this one t is this create this means actually.

565
01:05:56,092 --> 01:06:08,751
So think about actually if your if your yes your data are recorded very coarsely, which means that you only have the year, right?

566
01:06:08,752 --> 01:06:12,831
You only have the you only know when people die years.

567
01:06:12,832 --> 01:06:13,032
Right.

568
01:06:13,042 --> 01:06:22,851
So this means actually for a patient you already have survived past, you know, this year, 2023, what is the chance you are going to die in this year?

569
01:06:22,852 --> 01:06:26,082
So this is going to be the working definition for the other function.

570
01:06:26,092 --> 01:06:29,662
I think hopefully and I'm I'm clear here.

571
01:06:30,472 --> 01:06:43,462
Okay. So you can see here the first of all what is let's look has lap now not here here we we we sat before

572
01:06:43,482 --> 01:06:49,342
that is a survival function is a probability of function which means it's between zero and one.

573
01:06:49,342 --> 01:06:54,381
Right. And also my survival function is always a monotone decreasing.

574
01:06:54,382 --> 01:06:57,502
Right. Okay, now let's look at the lab that here.

575
01:06:57,502 --> 01:07:01,122
Here you can. What can you say?

576
01:07:01,272 --> 01:07:04,512
What can you say about the bonds of a dynamically.

577
01:07:05,682 --> 01:07:10,002
Condemned to be negative. No.

578
01:07:10,002 --> 01:07:13,631
Right. Because it's a conditional thing, right? It's a conditional.

579
01:07:13,632 --> 01:07:19,452
Right. Right. Okay. But now that he is here.

580
01:07:19,662 --> 01:07:24,342
Greater than what? Can it be?

581
01:07:24,822 --> 01:07:28,852
Yes. Yes. Right. It can be great a lot. So it's a rate.

582
01:07:28,972 --> 01:07:34,422
Right. So it can be great. Well, but of course, you know, this working definition you that is critical.

583
01:07:35,242 --> 01:07:40,132
Now, that is always between zero and one, because now this is a conditional probability.

584
01:07:40,192 --> 01:07:52,822
Right. But if you have if you're writing this form in a continuous scenario, they ask them that he here can be just between zero and positive.

585
01:07:52,822 --> 01:07:57,862
You benefit. Write something. What about the modernizing the old game that you guys.

586
01:08:01,302 --> 01:08:10,362
And now that he'd be increasing monotone increasing to stay a constant.

587
01:08:14,562 --> 01:08:19,152
Yeah. So I'll show you. So in some situations.

588
01:08:22,232 --> 01:08:27,532
Mm hmm.

589
01:08:27,852 --> 01:08:31,272
Let's see. So now.

590
01:08:39,282 --> 01:08:43,122
What kind of process? What kind of process?

591
01:08:43,152 --> 01:08:52,722
Well, what kind of a, you know, psycho will probably have this kind of passed, have had their function.

592
01:08:54,642 --> 01:08:57,701
Thank you so much. You're so smart.

593
01:08:57,702 --> 01:09:05,322
And people this life cycle, right. When you when you are born, you are really the member.

594
01:09:05,322 --> 01:09:08,802
Actually, you got here. You should be very proud of yourself.

595
01:09:09,102 --> 01:09:17,232
What's the matter with you? So the first of a few months is going to be actually, you know, that the heart rate is very high.

596
01:09:17,532 --> 01:09:21,982
And I think now probably you guys are here, right?

597
01:09:22,602 --> 01:09:27,382
And nothing can kill you. It's not that you are invincible here.

598
01:09:29,142 --> 01:09:31,392
Yeah, exactly. So you can see in here now.

599
01:09:31,392 --> 01:09:38,892
Now, the name that he here doesn't have to be bothered to be right up here for you got here is your your hazard.

600
01:09:38,902 --> 01:09:41,982
Actually, for a long time here he is going to be a constant.

601
01:09:42,492 --> 01:09:49,752
Okay. So you're going to be close. Close to zero. The point. So basically just to stay healthy and does that nothing can kill you.

602
01:09:54,392 --> 01:09:57,542
Okay. So great this life cycle. So, um.

603
01:09:58,232 --> 01:10:06,691
Okay. So I've come also just to give you some other have has it right.

604
01:10:06,692 --> 01:10:22,322
So. You can also find another scenario where this land here and you can be straight pretty crazy.

605
01:10:24,632 --> 01:10:27,871
Some parents don't have the life cycle, right?

606
01:10:27,872 --> 01:10:37,682
Just maybe within five years or so. Right. Think about people's hazards after surgery.

607
01:10:38,252 --> 01:10:42,031
Right. For the for the cancer patients after surgery.

608
01:10:42,032 --> 01:10:50,972
Right. So after surgery, of course, just right after surgery actually is a hazard is going to be high because a lot of infection.

609
01:10:50,972 --> 01:11:01,242
Right. But if your if the patient that got got their tumor removed, they are going to you know, they are going to have a much better life.

610
01:11:01,262 --> 01:11:01,562
Right.

611
01:11:01,892 --> 01:11:14,551
So so this this can can this can doesn't reflect the has or function for a patient after surgery, especially for the early stage of cancer patients.

612
01:11:14,552 --> 01:11:24,422
Right. Okay. But you can also have a hazard like this, like monitoring, increasing of the actually increasing the like,

613
01:11:24,512 --> 01:11:30,602
but the, for example, the advanced stage of cancer patients, right?

614
01:11:30,692 --> 01:11:37,802
Yep. If a surgery or chemotherapy fails and then normally people just kind of die, right?

615
01:11:37,802 --> 01:11:45,902
So so that's why as time goes on, the hazard or the mortality rate is going to be much, much higher as time goes on.

616
01:11:48,732 --> 01:11:52,952
Okay. So we are actually then based on this definition,

617
01:11:53,372 --> 01:12:04,062
you and also you should be able to derive the relationship between the Nam ducky and the survival function and also the density function.

618
01:12:04,082 --> 01:12:12,512
So actually this is so versus this if our straightforward just based on just using the definition of the conditional probability.

619
01:12:16,752 --> 01:12:17,051
Okay.

620
01:12:17,052 --> 01:12:29,292
So now let's now we need to talk about why we as I mentioned before the have their function is a building block for further survival our analysis.

621
01:12:29,372 --> 01:12:34,872
Right so we are going to use that have their function to help us estimate the survival function.

622
01:12:35,952 --> 01:12:39,522
Okay. So in this situation, we have like ten patients.

623
01:12:40,692 --> 01:12:48,362
We try to study their survival function and there's not nobody got a sensor.

624
01:12:48,402 --> 01:12:57,762
Right. So you can just use a step function to estimate the CTF and then certainly actually you can just a while minus CTF is the survival function.

625
01:12:57,772 --> 01:13:07,302
So in this situation, the survival the survival estimate at 20 is going to be 50%.

626
01:13:07,302 --> 01:13:12,102
Right. So here you just count how many people will survive past 20, right?

627
01:13:12,912 --> 01:13:20,622
How many? Five people survived the past 25 divided by ten is going to go for 50%.

628
01:13:22,742 --> 01:13:27,962
Okay. So now let's just make this thing here more complicated.

629
01:13:28,862 --> 01:13:32,792
Okay. Now we have a system here. Now we have a sensor here.

630
01:13:35,072 --> 01:13:45,451
Now we are. How would you use? So now we know that this patient of five, the patient patient who got a sensor at time five.

631
01:13:45,452 --> 01:13:49,712
Right. And also this guy here got a sensor at the 12th.

632
01:13:50,642 --> 01:14:01,292
Okay. How would you use this here to estimate the 20, you know, as a survival function here at 20, we have a few people got a sensor here.

633
01:14:01,592 --> 01:14:05,191
Okay. Well, it turns out it's not.

634
01:14:05,192 --> 01:14:13,892
So you may not be able to do this, but that's what you need the first to calculate their hazard.

635
01:14:14,282 --> 01:14:19,292
Okay, hazard. Here he is under the independent sensory, for example.

636
01:14:19,622 --> 01:14:24,002
This is a had their function. This is a theoretical definition over the have function.

637
01:14:24,512 --> 01:14:39,662
Then when T and this when T and uh, she had a c r independent, it turns out this actually is going to be your cost to replace as t you care about x.

638
01:14:39,662 --> 01:14:50,192
I think this is hypo here replace this t off here by x because remember this is I say quantity five ways independent of sensory.

639
01:14:50,672 --> 01:14:57,661
I can express everything here in terms of x and that the okay which means I will be able

640
01:14:57,662 --> 01:15:03,002
to use my belt might use my belt my data to estimate is s have their function right.

641
01:15:03,962 --> 01:15:08,642
Okay so if you have this. So basically I asked you here.

642
01:15:08,672 --> 01:15:15,302
So this actually just means that you are in this situation. I can see that this case, this acronym now not here,

643
01:15:15,332 --> 01:15:24,242
here is going to be equal to those x equals to a key the other time because the one even at greater than here.

644
01:15:25,922 --> 01:15:33,872
Right. Okay. So I want to have this because now this is what I observe from my, my, my, my data.

645
01:15:34,172 --> 01:15:37,862
So this actually, if you use this, I actually have this.

646
01:15:38,072 --> 01:15:49,992
I can just have my estimate out here. My denominator here is going to be the number of the people at the risk as a T and as

647
01:15:50,222 --> 01:16:01,892
the numerator here is people observe at this observed observe that this at the time.

648
01:16:03,032 --> 01:16:09,482
Okay. So now everything here actually can be use your data.

649
01:16:10,082 --> 01:16:14,852
You actually you can calculate the hazard estimate at each time point.

650
01:16:15,452 --> 01:16:22,062
Okay. So that that's why this quantity here, this equation here is a very important.

651
01:16:22,412 --> 01:16:31,262
Okay. Again, in order to gather this, you need to have the assumption of T and a c r independent.

652
01:16:31,562 --> 01:16:34,891
Okay. So that's like independence independent.

653
01:16:34,892 --> 01:16:38,312
Awesome sense around here is very important here. Okay.

654
01:16:38,312 --> 01:16:44,762
So when we come back, we are going to talk about this and more and then perhaps I will give you some concrete examples.

655
01:16:45,032 --> 01:16:49,742
But when you go back to please don't reveal what nothing what what happened in for this cost.

656
01:16:50,072 --> 01:16:51,062
Thank you.
