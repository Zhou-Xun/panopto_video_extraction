1
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,570
Yes, I think so.

2
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:16,560
Okay. We'll go ahead and get started. Welcome back. I hope everyone had an okay experience with the exam.

3
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:21,390
Any major logistical issues to report similar?

4
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:27,569
I didn't get any like emergency emails or anything, so I'm assuming everything went fairly smoothly,

5
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,080
just as far as at least getting it submitted and completing the exam.

6
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:37,320
So if you have any concerns about that process, it'll be the same for the second exam.

7
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,160
So if you do have any concerns about that, just let me know.

8
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:44,730
But it seemed like it was went pretty smoothly for the most part.

9
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,380
So we're going to talk about liver toxicology today.

10
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:58,260
I'm not sure if we'll we may just get through the entire lecture, in which case I will move the reproductive toxicology lecture up one lecture,

11
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:04,230
and we'll do that on Wednesday, and then it'll be fall break and yadda yadda.

12
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:12,240
Before I jump into this, are there any burning questions anyone has on any of the material logistics for the class?

13
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,410
Anything you want to talk about before we jump into the material today?

14
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:21,060
Seems like. Good. All right.

15
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:33,040
We'll talk about liver tox. So the liver, as you can imagine, is a pretty important organ in the field of toxicology.

16
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,640
There's tons of research that's done on liver toxicology.

17
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:46,540
It is a anatomist anatomically situated to receive a supply of nutrients and oxygen,

18
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:52,720
but also so it has this role in sort of normal metabolism in the body,

19
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:56,350
but it also receives toxic substances that we might be exposed to,

20
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:02,110
like single biotics that are absorbed by the gut and end up in the bloodstream and are delivered to the liver.

21
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:07,690
And we see a lot of metabolic activity in the liver, as you may already know.

22
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:18,010
So the liver can metabolize and eliminate waste products.

23
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:25,389
And so a lot of the same enzyme enzymatic systems that metabolize xeno biotics are the ones,

24
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:31,410
the same ones that metabolize endogenous compounds in the body and having stabilized and excreted from the body.

25
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:35,380
So you see a lot of overlap there.

26
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:43,120
And so we'll talk about the liver structure in this in this lecture and why this makes

27
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,250
it like well designed to support the various functions that it does in the body.

28
00:02:52,140 --> 00:03:00,500
Here's a picture. Oh, shoot. This is not the. I had a I had a picture where the liver is situated in the body.

29
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:08,750
I didn't upload that version of the slides. So it's situated about like here on the upper right part of the body.

30
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:14,450
So this is the kind of like, you know, the, the midsection here.

31
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,300
Um, the yeah. So you can see here the liver is here.

32
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,900
It's closely associated with the gallbladder.

33
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:30,620
Um, and we'll talk about the functions of the gallbladder and bile, liver bile later in the, in the, in the lecture.

34
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:36,860
We also have the bile duct, which feeds into the intestines and which helps with certain aspects of digestion.

35
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:43,850
It's the largest visceral organ, weighs about three or more pounds and an adult.

36
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:53,830
So pretty big. So the functions of the liver include things like nutrient homeostasis, filtration of particles,

37
00:03:53,830 --> 00:04:00,120
like toxin particles when they're broken down in the body and parts of pathogens and things.

38
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:06,960
Protein synthesis that synthesizes certain proteins, bioactive and detoxification,

39
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:11,210
which is kind of probably the most relevant function of the liver for toxicology.

40
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:22,050
So in some cases, the liver will bile activate chemicals to more toxic metabolites or detoxify a chemical to a more sort of benign metabolite.

41
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:30,890
And then we get we have this function of the formation of bile and biliary secretion, which is an important part of metabolism and digestion overall.

42
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:35,790
We'll talk a little bit about that more at the end of the lecture.

43
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:45,090
So where are the livers situated in terms of blood flow is unique compared to other organs.

44
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:51,600
So if you look at this graph, this is a nice graph of like how blood flows between the organs in the body.

45
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:55,409
So you have the Colbert airy circulation here.

46
00:04:55,410 --> 00:05:03,920
So the lungs, you get these vessels that are transporting lungs, that are blood that has been oxygenated in the lungs to the rest of the body.

47
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:11,759
So you see the arrow going here, pumping oxygenated blood, oxygenated blood to the heart and then down to the other organs,

48
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:19,770
including like the upper body, the liver, stomach, intestines, etc., down to the kidneys and the lower body here.

49
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:27,030
Right. And then we have deoxygenated blood going up through the veins, coming back in the other direction.

50
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:34,980
And so we'll see this deoxygenated blood being from the from the heart into to the lungs for oxygenation.

51
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:44,660
So does anyone notice anything unique about the liver in terms of this blood flow compared to the other organs?

52
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,880
And I'll just give you a second to look over this graph.

53
00:05:49,530 --> 00:06:00,870
Anything at all that looks unique for the liver here compared to, say, two kidneys to veins, so as the two veins, that sort of thing.

54
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:07,000
And then just the hepatic vein. Yeah. So it has well, it has this hepatic artery in this hepatic portal vein.

55
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,610
Right. And so the hepatic artery is going to be delivering what kind of blood to the liver.

56
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:20,950
Oxygenated, oxygenated blood. And this hepatic portal vein going from the intestines to the liver is going to be delivering.

57
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:25,500
What kind of blood? Do you want relatively deoxygenated blood?

58
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,590
Right. So the blood in the liver is. And what else?

59
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:33,680
If you notice where it's coming from. It's coming from the intestines.

60
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:43,530
So that offers another sort of unique aspect to this blood that's coming into the liver relative to other parts of the body.

61
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:48,440
And that it's going to be nutrient rich because it's coming from the intestines feeding into the liver.

62
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:54,020
So the in addition to this blood that's coming, that this is kind of a little bit more of the standard.

63
00:06:54,590 --> 00:07:02,480
You also get this other kind of unique blood flow that's coming in where there's blood that's relatively oxygen poor but nutrient rich.

64
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:07,010
And so that's that's a unique aspect of the liver compared to other organs in the body.

65
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:16,920
See if there's anything else I want to talk about there. So.

66
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:26,160
So the liver is actually in its structure relatively simple compared to other organs in the body.

67
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:29,740
It's kind of just this big sort of structure that you see.

68
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:35,770
It's made up of these structures called liver globules.

69
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:42,400
So if you take a section and look at a histology slide, this is what a section of the liver would look like.

70
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:47,560
Right. And so I think we talked about this before. We see these histology slides.

71
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:53,590
It's not it might be a little bit hard to see on this slide in particular.

72
00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:03,760
But just for reference on all these slides, the purple dots you see are nuclei and the pink color is protein.

73
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:08,680
Right. And that's going to come into play a little bit later. But I just want to kind of orient you to that.

74
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:13,210
When you look at a typical histology slide, that's typically what you're seeing in terms of the staining there.

75
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:20,060
So they're made up of these like liver. The liver is made up of these labial structures.

76
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:25,489
And you'll see a couple of things that we're going to dove into more detail in the next few slides.

77
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:29,030
But you'll see these like what are sometimes called hepatic triads,

78
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:34,400
which include these tubular structures that are bringing in blood or taking out bile from the liver.

79
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:38,209
And we'll talk about that. And then you have the central vein within the lab.

80
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:42,540
You will. Where blood is flowing towards the central vein. Yeah.

81
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,360
They see it labeled here the central vein.

82
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:51,740
Um, so that's kind of what, that's like a really pretty good representation of what the liver's looking like throughout.

83
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,010
This is a better example of some of the stuff labeled for you.

84
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:01,300
Right. So this is a nice cartoon or you can kind of lay things out a little bit more clearly.

85
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:07,719
So for these triads, what we have are you get the blood coming in from the heart, right?

86
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,510
So that red oxygenated blood coming in from the heart.

87
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:18,100
You also get the hepatic portal vein, which is bringing that blood in from the intestines that's going to be relatively deoxygenated.

88
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:24,340
So that's those are both coming in and they're flowing down. The blood is flowing down these structures called sinusoidal.

89
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:32,560
So that's just carrying the blood to the central. And then you also have let's see.

90
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:37,990
So, yeah, you have the sinusoidal here. This is the blood coming out through the central veins.

91
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:45,280
You have these structures called bile canal, if you like, which is taking bile into the bile duct.

92
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:53,440
We'll talk about the some of the functions of bile later. The bile comes out, goes to the gallbladder and or the intestines.

93
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,590
Right. Um, just as anything else you want to talk about here.

94
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:04,430
Oh, these are the liver cells, the hepatic sites. So hetero meaning liver.

95
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,629
Right. So these are the hepatocytes. I think that's about it.

96
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:15,630
So that so you can kind of see how that cartoon would overlay onto this general structure.

97
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:19,499
Right. Well, we'll look at a few more pictures, but you kind of get the idea, right?

98
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:25,650
The blood flowing this direction, the bowels coming out this direction to go into the bile duct.

99
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:39,750
Any questions so far? So some of the major cell types of the liver we have the hepatocytes, which are the printable cells,

100
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,290
printable meaning those are the cells that are sort of specific to that.

101
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:46,710
We're going to do the sum of the specific functions of that organ.

102
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:54,980
So you have the parasites like 50% of the liver cell population as much as like 80% of the volume.

103
00:10:54,990 --> 00:11:03,000
So these are like the major cell type in the liver. The sinuses are lined with endothelial cells which are not really specialized.

104
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,060
The endothelial cells are lining the inside of blood vessels throughout the body.

105
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:14,520
That's like 25, 20, 25% of the cells. You have what are called cooper cells.

106
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:21,810
So talk about those a little bit later, which are immune or macrophage types of cells that are found in the liver.

107
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:27,960
And then finally, you have IDO or stellate cells which are found associated with the sinusitis as well.

108
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:36,770
We'll go over each of these. Here's another picture of like a small chunk of one of those globules.

109
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:45,890
Right. So again, you have your bile duct, you have your portal vein and you have your hepatic artery and your blood flowing down here.

110
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,820
Your bile is flowing in the opposite direction.

111
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:57,680
And your hepatic, hepatic, hepatic cells are hepatocytes are kind of lined up along that whole structure there.

112
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:05,410
Um. Let's see, I think we just talked about hepatic compact cells are known as hepatocytes.

113
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:09,720
Um, the silent sites are lined with endothelial cells.

114
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:12,850
Yeah. The panic sells here.

115
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:21,160
And this is again, if you take a look, if you see a histology slide of one of these globules, this is what it's going to look like.

116
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:26,799
So hopefully, based on these cartoons we've just looked at, we can kind of understand what we're seeing here a little bit better for you.

117
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,790
Just walk through it here.

118
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:36,310
One thing that will help you key in when you're looking at really kind of any kind of histology slide that kind of helps you or any of yourself.

119
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,630
Let's see how well gets picked up here. Those cells in the middle there,

120
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:47,680
if you notice a difference between those smaller cells compared to like everything else in the middle, like I wish I had a pointer.

121
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:54,370
Oh, I've got to point these cells here. Do you notice anything different there about them?

122
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:59,080
It's like they don't have a nucleus. Exactly. They're lacking a nucleus.

123
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:06,730
So those are red blood cells. Okay. So any time you see that type of structure and it's got kind of this almost a donut ish looking shape,

124
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:10,810
it doesn't have a hole in it per se, but it's kind of a disk shape with an indentation.

125
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:16,860
Those are red blood cells. And so these would be I think it's even labeled here.

126
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:22,240
So these are the sinuses with the blood flowing down the sinusoidal into the central vein.

127
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,120
Right. And then these are all the hepatocytes.

128
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:31,120
And you can tell that those are the hepatocytes compared to the red blood cells, because you're seeing a nucleus with a parasite's.

129
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:40,760
Right. Makes sense. But. See here.

130
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:48,900
Okay. So there's. Okay. So this is kind of a zoom in on one section of what we just saw.

131
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:55,190
So, like, if we, like, zoomed in on one part. Like one section of these cells here, it looks like something like this.

132
00:13:55,700 --> 00:14:02,090
Right. So the hepatocytes are here, lined up. The blood is flowing through the sinusoidal area.

133
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:13,120
And also associated with this sort of structure. You have your Cooper cells, which are like macrophages in ethanol injury.

134
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:20,889
So individuals that are exposed to a lot of ethanol, alcohol, they you can see activation of the Cooper cells,

135
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:31,330
which is like this inflammation in the liver and that can be associated with some scarring and other sort of impacts on liver function scarring,

136
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:37,569
fibrosis deposition of a high amount of collagen, you know, as the liver sort of tries to repair itself,

137
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:42,490
but it's not able to really do it because it's having to constantly be repairing, trying to repair itself.

138
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:51,160
So it's kind of similar to what we talked about in the cancer lecture where you have these wounds that don't heal type of phenotype or, you know,

139
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:59,020
use processes that would be repairing are not able to actually quite do the job and you end up with scars or disrupted tissue where organ function.

140
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:03,669
So. COOPER Cells will play a role in that. So they're here.

141
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:09,220
They also perform a useful function by helping to clear like, say, pathogens in the case of a pathogenic infection.

142
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:18,340
So that's a supercell. And then you have your stem cells, which sort of line against the sinusoidal.

143
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:26,660
These are contract tile. They help to like basically contract and push blood through the sinuses.

144
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,850
So they have that role. They also have a role in immune function as an antigen presenting cells.

145
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:34,219
So if you're exposed to some kind of infection,

146
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:41,990
they can develop present antigens to other immune cells and they play a role in basically ramping up the immune response.

147
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:48,890
These can also be activated in cases of liver damage and play a role in like fibrosis where you get

148
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:54,350
like an overabundance of extracellular matrix and like basically scar tissue within the liver,

149
00:15:54,680 --> 00:16:03,379
um, in cases of severe liver injury. And again, if we go back to the Carcinogenesis lecture, some of the slides that you saw,

150
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:08,780
how there was like basically you're you're getting these wounds that don't resolve sometimes.

151
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:14,659
And so some of this stuff can kind of contribute to this stuff, can contribute this type of response,

152
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:18,380
can contribute to things like liver tumors, the formation of liver tumors.

153
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:24,320
Um, yeah. So. Here's yet another picture.

154
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:29,839
It was a couple of different views here. So, you know, some some one person might prefer one to the other.

155
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:34,459
So it's good to look at it from a few different angles here. Yeah.

156
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:38,120
So you have your get your bio of what they're calling a doctor.

157
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:42,169
You'll hear this bio can kind of like you lie, the blood flowing in.

158
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:48,290
You have your Cooper cell here like in, like sort of in contact with the blood endothelial cells lining the side.

159
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:52,880
And so it's in the stem cells would be here, right?

160
00:16:54,090 --> 00:17:03,540
That's. One interesting aspect of the liver is this concept of different cells within the liver.

161
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:11,910
So we've kind of identified in terms of as the blood, it is flowing towards that central vein.

162
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:17,880
There are different zones that are characterized by different sort of metabolic capacities and different sort of.

163
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:22,830
Well, we'll talk about the differences across these different zones as you move towards the central vein.

164
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,600
So they're called a pair of portal, the middle zonal and the central lobular zones.

165
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,120
Right. And so this is how they're numbered. So this is your hepatic vein, right?

166
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:38,550
So the blood is flowing, coming in through these vessels and then flowing in this direction.

167
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:46,979
So you have a zone one, two and three. So they progressed from the para portal, the portal triads, remember.

168
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:51,720
So the triad is the bile duct, the hepatic artery in that portal vein.

169
00:17:54,680 --> 00:18:01,700
Uh. Yeah. So this lab bill could be divided into these three zones, and this are characterized by different metabolic capacities,

170
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:08,540
which is going to play into how susceptible different zones in the lab people are to different types of toxicants.

171
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:20,570
Because as we've discussed. Toxicants, you know, depen different toxicants have sort of different pathways, if you will, towards becoming toxic.

172
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:28,580
So some of them are activated by phase one metabolism to the, to, to the most like, um,

173
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:36,620
to like a toxic metabolite like the benzoate pyrithione needs to be this oxide metabolite needs to be formed.

174
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,680
Other chemicals are toxic in and of themselves.

175
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:46,670
And so the way the body is dealing with different toxicants is going to it metabolizes different toxicants is going to play into,

176
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:52,070
um, which part of the liver is more susceptible to a particular chemical.

177
00:18:54,620 --> 00:19:07,500
Anything else I want to talk about here? So here's what it looks like in terms of the differences in the different zones.

178
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:11,790
So basically, as you're moving from zone one to zone three.

179
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:23,540
You're seeing more nutrients in zone one and more oxygen, greater metabolic capacity, more bile acids, more cofactors that are used.

180
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:29,929
And like phase two metabolism. Remember we talked about how like gluten eradication and sulfates and require these

181
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:35,750
cofactors to provide these molecules to attach to toxicants during detoxification.

182
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,620
So yeah, as you're moving this way,

183
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:50,090
that's going to all of those are going to reduce the one difference is you're going to get more p450 enzymes as you get closer to zone three.

184
00:19:51,820 --> 00:20:04,389
Or like greater activity of p450 enzymes. And I have not heard a real good explanation in terms of evolutionary pressure or what have you for why

185
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:11,050
that difference in p450 enzymes exists in terms of that more activity going towards the central vein.

186
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:17,110
Um, I think it's, you know, I don't think anyone's come up with a silver bullet answer for why that is so.

187
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:29,110
But that is the case. And so this influences the types, you know, where we see toxicity in the liver.

188
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:39,610
So for example, there's a chemical called l, l, l l alcohol, which is an intermediate in the synthesized synthesis of chemicals like glycerol.

189
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:47,319
So individuals who might be working in manufacturing cholesterol compounds might face exposure to this chemical that's

190
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:54,340
used to like flame resistant materials and various other sort of products like plasticizers used as a plasticizer.

191
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:01,740
So we'll see with alcohol more.

192
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:11,809
Necrosis. So remember we talked about necrosis or seeing this this kind of very disorganized look to the cells here.

193
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:17,870
So we see a very organized situation with the cells and then we see a very disorganized and,

194
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:21,770
you know, this is pretty, pretty indicative of cells that are undergoing necrosis.

195
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:33,810
They're dying like disorganized. So this alcohol is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase to a really highly reactive metabolite.

196
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:41,280
And so this this alcohol dehydrogenase is more active in zone one.

197
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:50,640
Um, and this is because zone one, as we talked about, this one has more oxygen, right?

198
00:21:52,980 --> 00:22:00,060
So oxygen is required for this metabolism to this reactive metabolite.

199
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:04,350
And therefore, we're seeing more of this toxicity in the zone one area.

200
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:17,930
A chemical like carbon tetrachloride, which is used in the production of various things like refrigeration or refrigeration agents,

201
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:24,770
is in the manufacture of like refrigerators. It can be used as a solvent sexually found in lava lamps, I guess.

202
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:40,570
Which means. I guess. So this metabolism metabolism, the metabolism of carbon tetrachloride is dependent on cyp p450 activity.

203
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:49,280
So the cytochrome p450 enzyme which creates when it's metabolized by this p450 via phase one metabolism,

204
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:58,000
you create this reactive free radical metabolite that causes damage to the liver via things like lipid peroxidation.

205
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:02,690
So just, you know, basically essentially attacking lipid structures within the cell.

206
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,490
It also attacks the mitochondria. Um.

207
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:19,960
And so. As we've mentioned before, the PS4 windows are more active in zone zone three.

208
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:24,040
So this is where we see more of the toxicity from carbon tetrachloride in the liver.

209
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:35,060
Does that make sense so far? Yeah.

210
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:42,830
And the particular p450 that's involved in this is called CIP 2e1 that metabolizes a number of relevant compounds.

211
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:51,630
So in a minute, I want to talk about acetaminophen, liver toxicity.

212
00:23:51,690 --> 00:24:00,280
And I think probably bears going back and talking through the thigh on the good side of metabolic pathways first.

213
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:07,010
So the glutathione metabolic pathway is a phase two metabolism.

214
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:11,670
It's a major detoxification pathway within the liver.

215
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:19,739
The glutathione molecule is the cofactor that's involved in this glutathione on metabolic pathways.

216
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:31,770
So you're basically attaching the solidify own molecule onto a onto a chemical which facilitates excretion as a detoxification reaction.

217
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:39,690
And so go to file itself is is a tri peptide made up of three amino acids, glutamate, cysteine and glycine.

218
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:43,830
The concentrations of gold found in the liver are pretty high.

219
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:49,290
So 5 to 10 billion molar, that's pretty high concentration to observe in a cell.

220
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:55,139
I think these are defined as transferase enzymes that catalyze these reactions.

221
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:58,380
So they put the glue to file onto the chemical.

222
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:01,770
They can take up to 10% of the total cellular protein in the liver.

223
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:12,890
And so this is a major detoxification reaction for like getting rid of chemicals that cause reactive oxygen species and free radicals in the liver.

224
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:17,840
So acetaminophen. So we take acetaminophen.

225
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:23,760
You know, it's found in like, say, Tylenol as a pain reducer, fever reducer, etc.

226
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,210
So again the cool factor is this good a. So acetaminophen can be this is the molecule of acetaminophen.

227
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:36,340
It can be cougar on dated it could be sulfate. Um,

228
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:50,240
but it is also metabolized via sip to e one and cyp3a4 to a highly reactive metabolic intermediate that reacts with proteins and things in the in the,

229
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:58,070
in the liver. And so the glutathione conjugation pathway is important for detoxifying these reactive metabolites that form.

230
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:05,380
Um. Yeah. And so this reaction is catalyzed by glutathione on s transferase enzymes.

231
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:17,020
So you see you're attaching this portion of the solidified molecule to this, um, conjugated molecule which is, you know, a non toxic metabolite.

232
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:26,070
This is. Let's see if. Well here I want to talk about, yes, this is good to see them,

233
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:30,720
but this is just another view of the same metabolic pathway, maybe a little bit more clear than the other one.

234
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:39,240
So you have acetaminophen here and then the sulfate and glue guaranteed conjugation pathways here on either side.

235
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:46,620
And then it's showing how these side p450 enzymes metabolize acetaminophen into this highly reactive metabolite.

236
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:50,069
The main one that we usually talk about with acetaminophen is called nap.

237
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:59,610
Q I has this long name here. And so, again, that's not how that's conjugate into the school to assign a molecule which you could see here.

238
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:03,260
And this is like the nontoxic metabolite, right?

239
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:13,719
This guy. However, though Ken is toxic, he can bind to proteins and cause central lobular necrosis.

240
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:25,090
So. Zone three. Right. Um, I may be I may be over showing the pathway here,

241
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:34,870
but it is a fairly important set of reactions against reactive intermediate and that's why conjugate it to glue the file.

242
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:45,009
Let's see. So the idea here is that, um, with acetaminophen toxicity you get not quite depleting these stores of glutathione on that we have.

243
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:55,540
So yeah. Is it just toxic if you just go to cyanide or is it like w toxic without this iron and it makes this conjugate intermediate.

244
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:59,530
That's not good. Is it toxic? I served is the first part of it.

245
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:04,330
But is it only toxic because you're depleting glucose iron, which is like, no.

246
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:08,470
Yeah. Sorry. No doubt too. I ended of itself as toxic.

247
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:12,190
But that's certainly not helping that you're depleting your glutathione on stores.

248
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:16,600
That UI reacts, it forms again here access.

249
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:21,459
So you get a formation of protein addicts. It can bind cysteine groups on proteins.

250
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:25,930
It's a very reactive metabolite. Um, that's a good question.

251
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:29,620
Thank you. Yeah, but so there's there are multiple things going on here. That's a good point.

252
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:31,000
So, you know,

253
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:38,470
if you're if you're dealing with a situation where you're facing other exposures that require the glue to fight on cofactor and you've also depleted,

254
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:44,860
uh, your included file stores that could, you know, that could also present a problem in terms of liver damage as well.

255
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:52,150
So that's a really good point to make. So yeah, sorry, just one more so that there's like no way to get around this intermediate event.

256
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:58,450
Like, you can't do anything until they change the fate of this intermediate existing as a result of taking Tylenol.

257
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:03,730
Like you just talking about, like, if you know that it's like taking too much Tylenol.

258
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,440
Like, is there anything you can do to sort of. Yeah.

259
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:12,550
Like, is there any other thing that you could add just to kind of like, is it kind of like a sodium nitrate and nitrate situation?

260
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:16,870
Like you can take vitamin C you like we're going to talk about actually one thing that you can do.

261
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,820
Yeah, that's that's a really good point. Um, so let's see here.

262
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,910
Yeah. Now that I've shown you the acetaminophen metabolic pathway like four times, um,

263
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:32,740
so the things that are targeted by that UI are things like mitochondrial proteins.

264
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:36,400
We talked about how important mitochondria are. They're the powerhouse of the cell.

265
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,020
They can attack ion channels which are important for cellular metabolism.

266
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:46,750
You know, you can get loss of energy production, iron imbalance, ultimately cell death.

267
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:53,620
Right. And again, because the CYP four fifties are so active in that zone three,

268
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:59,200
you're going to see more of this in near that central vein as opposed to zone one.

269
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:05,080
Right. Because this guy is more active in that region compared to zone one.

270
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:15,220
Yeah. You're getting induction, so you're going to start expressing more support to E to help to like metabolize acetaminophen.

271
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:24,340
Your glutathione on is coming in to detoxify this intermediate and thus you're going to see necrosis in zone three hepatocytes.

272
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:31,589
And so these are some of the clinical stages of acetaminophen.

273
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:37,950
So physicians have noticed like different phases to acetaminophen toxicity with phase one

274
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:44,530
kind of can come on pretty quickly like 30 minutes to 24 hours causing things like anorexia,

275
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,930
nausea, vomiting.

276
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:54,839
There's another phase that's kind of odd a little bit with this phase two that physicians have noticed, like a false sense of well-being.

277
00:30:54,840 --> 00:31:02,249
Like the person is like, oh, I feel okay, I feel fine. But that is you're also going to see along with that, if you look at like their liver enzymes,

278
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:06,900
you're seeing like elevation of certain hepatic enzymes indicating damage to the liver.

279
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:15,960
You might see, you know, right upper quadrant pain of elevated mg in which we'll talk about bilirubin later in the lecture.

280
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:21,480
Um, you know, some of these other other things as well as a new level of phase three,

281
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:26,010
you're starting to see things like jaundice, which we'll talk about later, hyperglycemia.

282
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:30,720
You'll start to see things like confusion or lethargy, maybe even coma.

283
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:38,940
Um, so this is like three or four days after like acetaminophen overdose example and then onto phase four.

284
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:43,740
Um, if you take exposure to like acetaminophen away, you know,

285
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:48,719
sometimes people can recover if the damage isn't too severe, the liver is able to recover.

286
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,480
And we'll actually have some examples of that later as well.

287
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:58,380
Or you may, you may be looking at things that you may be looking at needing a transplant or the the person may end up dying.

288
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:03,960
So these are the sort of the phases that are at play with acetaminophen toxicity.

289
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:15,280
And then this gets to your question. There is a way that we can help to kind of mitigate this response.

290
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:20,410
There's a chemical called an acetyl cysteine, which can be either ingestible or injectable.

291
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:28,490
It contains a cysteine, which is the again, the remember I talked about beautiful is made up of three amino acids.

292
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:33,250
It contains the cysteine, which is a limiting amino acid in the formation of modify.

293
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:38,170
So you can help to build your own stores back up by exposure to a single system.

294
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:44,070
So you're replenishing your good sound. And in of itself it has some antioxidant activity.

295
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:49,299
So it's going to help to deal with some of that reactive oxygen species and reactive

296
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:54,850
molecules that are probably showing up along with your depletion of glucosinolates stores.

297
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:59,560
And that is also doing damage to the liver as well. And in.

298
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:10,700
In our research. Sometimes, if we're wondering whether oxidative stress is playing a key role in toxicity for a particular chemical,

299
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:17,330
we don't really know the mechanism of action of that toxicant. Well, sometimes use acetyl cysteine as a code treatment.

300
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:22,340
So like with say, trichloroethylene, we want to know if oxidative stress is involved with its toxicity.

301
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:32,390
Will kothari and acidosis even like rats? And if it mitigates the toxicity like, oh, we were seeing, the liver is like completely damaged.

302
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:37,010
But if we are treated with like additional system of the damage went away,

303
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:43,770
it might be indicative that assisting is mitigating some of that oxidative stress of reactive oxygen species.

304
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:50,420
So we use this as sort of a way to probe for molecular mechanisms sometimes as well.

305
00:33:53,210 --> 00:34:12,330
Yeah. So again. So, um, and these are some examples here for some zone specific or site specific toxicity in the liver.

306
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:17,920
So a zone one hepatocytes we could see are susceptible to like high levels of ions.

307
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:22,800
Or we talked about how high LDL alcohol can impact zone one hepatocytes.

308
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:30,450
And so this might be due to the levels of oxygen that are found in that region of the liver versus the other zones.

309
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:38,430
You know, things that have an oxygen dependent bio activation to form their toxic metabolites in zone one,

310
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:43,650
you know, you're likely to see more toxic effects in zone one and then zone three.

311
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:48,660
Again, we talked about like, uh, carbon tetrachloride, acetaminophen and ethanol.

312
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:53,139
More set P450 is a is around for bio activation.

313
00:34:53,140 --> 00:35:01,690
If that's the pathway of activation less as we talked about, there's less cofactors available.

314
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:06,730
The cofactors go down as you go towards the center or towards that central vein.

315
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:12,189
And so you'll have less glue to fire and cofactors around to help detoxify chemicals.

316
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:16,450
So that could be the same for glutathione. Cofactors are sulfate and cofactors.

317
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:24,520
Let's see. So we have like bile, bile duct cells which we'll talk about bile duct in a little bit here.

318
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:28,660
A couple examples. Let's see what else.

319
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:39,260
You can just kind of barge through here and see. You know, some of the like immune cells, like super cells might be, you know,

320
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:45,970
especially susceptible to like endotoxin or like toxins related to pathogens because they may have, you know,

321
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:59,059
a preferential uptake or maybe sort of stimulated by these types of chemicals as opposed to like a like a like a carbon tetrachloride type of pop out,

322
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:07,020
like a solvent or something. Um, so you can think about how there's like there are immune cells within the liver too, that could be sort of activated.

323
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:10,280
That would be part of the overall response to a chemical.

324
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:16,040
Yeah. Okay.

325
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:20,029
So by all. So, Bill,

326
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:32,300
is this like greenish yellowish fluid that's really important for digestion and it also plays a role in like kind of detoxification in a way.

327
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:37,459
It's one way that our bodies help to get rid of metals in the body of where it's supposed to.

328
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:42,380
Metals like copper or cadmium bile helps to get that out of our body.

329
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:52,280
So we have these biochemical alkali that are associated like closely kind of associated with the hepatocytes in the body.

330
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:57,679
And so the bile is released into these can alkali structures,

331
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:04,580
eventually making its way into the bile ducts, which then feeds into the gall bladder and the intestines.

332
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,870
Yes. Let's go to the bile duct and then to the gallbladder.

333
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:21,610
So the bile contains things like water, bile, salts, bilirubin, cholesterol and other like metabolic byproducts.

334
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:27,879
So this is just in a way, just another pathway for a body to get rid of certain types of chemicals that

335
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:33,370
are not easily broken down in other via the other mechanisms within the body.

336
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:42,050
Cholesterol is important for the formation of these bile salts. And again, they play a role in fat digestion.

337
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:47,540
They help to emulsify dietary fats that are not usually that are not, you know, sort of broken apart in like, say,

338
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:55,550
a water soluble environment that helps to sort of break these apart into more easily digestible portions, if you will.

339
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:07,999
So you'll get a release of let's see. So this is just a cartoon showing the release of like these bio salts and things will for, well, kind of again,

340
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:16,990
most of emulsify dietary fats in the intestines, the bile salts themselves will be re uptake in, into the intestine, um, a couple of times.

341
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:21,620
So they're kind of sticking around and doing their job a few times.

342
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:29,690
They're eventually excreted though. So you get the formation of structures called Micelles, which involve bile salts.

343
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:40,100
So in the intestines you'll get these. The use of these triglycerides as well as the bile salts to to form are called mixed micelles,

344
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:45,710
which again, is a way of digesting certain fatty acids or vitamin molecules.

345
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:53,160
And again, you have these files, let's get reabsorbed a few times.

346
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:57,060
You know, they go through this enteral hepatic cycling and are then released in the feces.

347
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:04,100
So bilirubin is a kind of an important one.

348
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:15,670
So bilirubin is essentially the red blood cells in the body exist for about 2 to 3 months and then die and they can take iron.

349
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:20,210
And we need to essentially like break down these red blood cells,

350
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:25,730
sequester the ions that does build up in the body and cause toxic responses in the body.

351
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:33,290
Um, we need to do something with the key molecule, which is like holding the iron in the red blood cells.

352
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:38,840
And so the process of breaking down the heme involves the liver.

353
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:51,590
Erythrocytes are another word for red blood cells. So he was broken down by into a compound called delivered in,

354
00:39:51,980 --> 00:40:01,970
which is then broken down further into bilirubin in the blood and bilirubin is that attached to that carrier protein called albumin,

355
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:06,520
which we talked about, that forms attacks with certain types of toxicants.

356
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:10,360
It also binds to the spill and Rubin molecule.

357
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:14,960
And so bilirubin has like a yellowish color to it, it has like a pigment to it.

358
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:22,070
So it has this yellowish color. And so this bilirubin bound to albumin is delivered to the liver.

359
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:28,130
So I'm taken by the liver and then conjugate it and sort of metabolized.

360
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:33,820
Again, this is a case of this endogenous metabolism as opposed to metabolizing is, you know, biotic compound.

361
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:40,330
We're attaching a good run and molecule to the spiller Rubin molecule for excretion.

362
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:50,580
So this Google validation makes the Bill Rubin more water soluble, and then it can then be excreted into the bile for and excluded from the body.

363
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:54,600
Right. So we have let's see this cartoon.

364
00:40:54,600 --> 00:41:00,120
We have this bilirubin attached to albumin delivered to the liver conjugated.

365
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:10,890
So we have a bilirubin glucagon and then that's delivered via the bile into the intestines and we can excrete.

366
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:19,250
Sorry if there's another reaction where the bill of Rubin is broken down into another chemical called Euro below the little Dogen,

367
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:31,810
which is not said many times. So yeah so the but the gut bacteria can de conjugate these glucocorticoid conjugates to this

368
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:39,490
colorless durable energy in chemical and then you have that the chemical is excreted in the feces.

369
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,480
You can get some of this reabsorption and some excretion in the urine.

370
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:47,920
So this is sort of the life cycle of going from a red blood cell all the way

371
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:54,370
to this Bill Rubin and finally excreted as a euro billion origin chemical.

372
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:58,540
Any questions on that process so far?

373
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:10,550
Sounds good. So when the liver's not functioning normally, I said that Billy Reuben has a slight yellowish tint to it.

374
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:19,700
We have a normal level of total serum bilirubin, which is 0.1 to 1.2 milligrams per deciliter.

375
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:26,600
We can see the effect of jaundice, which is the yellowing of the skin or the white parts of the eyes.

376
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:30,020
In the case of that, Bill Rubin is starting to build up.

377
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:36,770
And so this will be we're looking at something like 2 to 2.5 milligrams per deciliter in the blood of Bill Rubin.

378
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:40,700
And so this is an indication that the liver is not doing its job.

379
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:45,019
It's not functioning properly, because if it is functioning properly,

380
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:53,420
we are metabolizing Bill of Rubin and keeping things at a relatively reasonable low level in terms of the Rubin concentration in the blood.

381
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:59,460
So we use this as a clinical measure of like liver functionality.

382
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:03,960
Right. So doctors will measure things like the free total bilirubin.

383
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:10,710
We can measure that the blood that's conjugated to the corona or the total, which would be both the free and the conjugated.

384
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:17,280
And this will give us an indication of how well this whole system is operating within the body.

385
00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:26,450
And so when we see things like jaundice, it doesn't necessarily have something to do with the liver.

386
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:30,770
There is a pre hepatic version,

387
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:41,600
a set of events that can happen where if we're getting excessive red blood cell destruction before delivery to the liver, you could see things.

388
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:44,930
You can see a buildup of Bill Rubin and thus jaundice.

389
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:51,170
So if you have like a hemo hemolysis or the breaking up or killing of blood cells,

390
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:59,240
some hereditary disorders like sickle cell disease or other acquired hemolytic disorders that are targeting the blood cells,

391
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:07,250
you can have auto immune reactions that are breaking up these red blood cells. So when this starts to happen, you might see a buildup of bilirubin.

392
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:18,550
Well, the liver is involved. We would call it intrahepatic, and this could be due to the liver not taking the bilirubin efficiently.

393
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:23,560
We could have the liver not being able to conjugate the bilirubin for excretion,

394
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:30,640
just damage to the cells related to hepatitis or cirrhosis or cancer of the liver.

395
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:40,179
Um, and then also we could have post hepatic impacts, we could have structural disorders in the bile duct.

396
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:44,350
So remember the, the bilirubin is excreted through the bile duct into the intestine.

397
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:52,510
Or other types of events that, you know, basically describe disrupt the ability of the bile duct to perform its normal functions.

398
00:44:53,230 --> 00:45:00,850
So although we use this often as a sort of a way of understanding how how efficient the liver is working,

399
00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:08,440
there are other reasons why we might see a buildup of Bill Rubin and jaundice, I should say Bill Rubin ended up itself can be toxic.

400
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:16,269
Some newborns sometimes have decreased capacity to basically do this metabolic process.

401
00:45:16,270 --> 00:45:18,879
You'll see some infants born with jaundice.

402
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:27,520
It's usually not a problem, but in some cases you'll see things like neurotoxicity, a sort of associated with a high level of bilirubin in the body.

403
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:37,320
Okay. So I'll pause there real quick. I think we're kind of making our way through this fairly fast.

404
00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:43,040
But get out a little bit early. Any questions so far?

405
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:49,079
Yes, I know. The liver has quite a stunning ability to regenerate for most organs.

406
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:54,570
And I'm kind of curious as to I mean, are there any medicines that you like?

407
00:45:54,660 --> 00:46:00,560
I guess, I mean, besides just making sure a person is healthy enough and has fluids and stuff?

408
00:46:00,570 --> 00:46:04,580
Is there any medicines that kind of use that mechanism to help prepare the liver?

409
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:10,590
Or I guess I'm trying to think that mechanism to use like a way of like jumpstarting the mechanisms.

410
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:15,700
Yeah. I mean, there's different like the nasty little coal and acetyl cysteine, you know,

411
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:23,790
that's I'm more familiar with those types of things where you're building back up the capacity that was there like on sort of a biochemical level.

412
00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:31,440
I'm not aware of any sort of treatments that could that sort of jumpstart like the regeneration process.

413
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:35,940
But they may be out there. Yeah. Does anyone anyone have any.

414
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:39,990
Someone's heard of that type of. Yeah. It's very interesting. Yeah.

415
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:46,739
Whatever you get that. Like whenever I hear about the liver, the finger of the liver, being able to do these types of things.

416
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:52,050
Yeah, it makes you think of like, what exactly is going on there that we could maybe take advantage of in like,

417
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:56,890
I don't know, therapeutic, but yeah, I'm not aware of it. But there might be, they might be out there.

418
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:03,850
I know I learned this undergrad a long time ago. I don't remember.

419
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:08,590
Babies that are born with jaundice. How does the light therapy help that?

420
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:12,759
How does the what? How does light therapy. Oh gosh. That yeah.

421
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:16,060
I mechanism so no, I don't know the mechanism of that.

422
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:21,940
You just reminded me of it when you said that. Yeah. That's a good. I don't know.

423
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:26,410
I really don't. I'm sorry. No worries. It's totally unrelated. Yeah.

424
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:30,790
No, that's. That's a good. That's. Yeah, that's okay.

425
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:36,040
I want to look into it. Maybe I'll put it in the announcements of, of okay.

426
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:39,880
It's a little jump into I think. Yeah, we might finish early so we'll see.

427
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:43,540
Other types of liver damage, gallstones.

428
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:48,610
Um, this is a picture of someone's gallbladder. It's the formation of gallstones.

429
00:47:48,610 --> 00:47:55,510
You can imagine that the gallbladder is not functioning in its normal matter when you have this like, level of blockage.

430
00:47:56,980 --> 00:48:04,900
So you can have like abnormal abnormalities in the bile composition, the bile not flowing through the spaces like it should.

431
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:07,030
You can get inflammation in the gallbladder.

432
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:12,520
This is all going to lead to impacts on the various functions of the gallbladder, which we just talked about.

433
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:23,960
Some were like really long words here. So bile duct damage, it'd be called COLLEGIO Destructive cholestasis.

434
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:31,220
We there are biomarkers like alkaline phosphatase activity that can help us understand if that's going on.

435
00:48:31,850 --> 00:48:40,819
We'll see things with this like swollen biliary epithelium, inflammatory cell infiltration.

436
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:45,890
So these are just like indicators that the bile duct is venting, which we can have,

437
00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:50,839
you know, a lot of the similar things that happen in terms of like cirrhosis.

438
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:59,450
So we'll see like with chronic bile duct damage, we can get like bilateral proliferation of like fibrosis, this scar tissue,

439
00:48:59,450 --> 00:49:06,350
this buildup of like these structural proteins, like collagen and things, basically disrupting the function of the gallbladder.

440
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:10,610
There's actually a condition called vanishing bile duct syndrome,

441
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:17,960
which has been linked to certain types of steroids or antibiotics in which you get a loss of the bile ducts, which is pretty fascinating.

442
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:27,620
So just kind of want to hit those real quick. So we're going to march through these last few slides are going to march through kind of increasing

443
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:33,260
severity of some of the more common types of ailments that are associated with the liver.

444
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:40,430
So to start, we have fatty liver stay a ptosis, a normal liver kind of pictured here.

445
00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:52,940
You see this organized, you know, set of liver cells with these nice nuclei here that you can see in the case of a fat,

446
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:58,489
this would be a picture of a fatty liver. So it's going to look a little bit different, little slightly different color and under a microscope.

447
00:49:58,490 --> 00:50:01,430
You're going to see these like lipid these like big lipid,

448
00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:07,760
like droplets and things under the microscope, which is kind of crowding out the other liver cells.

449
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:19,070
So lipids, like triglycerides, are usually a small percentage of the total liver mass, but you can get a buildup of lipids in the hepatocytes.

450
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:23,600
And we could see this triggered by things like obesity.

451
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:34,270
You know, it's a fairly straightforward sort of thing, like reliable thing in like, say, animal models of we switch rats over to like a high fat diet.

452
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:38,540
They're going to start to have developed this type of fatty liver phenotype.

453
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:49,069
But we also have things like nonalcoholic, fatty liver disease or or we're learning more about toxicant associated fatty liver disease,

454
00:50:49,070 --> 00:50:57,590
where exposure to certain chemicals appears to be leading to fatty liver, which may be related to, you know, fatty acid metabolism.

455
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:01,610
And I think that's still kind of an ongoing area of research,

456
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:07,820
and it could be sort of a silent situation because a lot of times individuals with this

457
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:13,700
type of phenotype are showing like really obvious other clinical symptoms other than just,

458
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:18,080
you know, when they actually look at the liver, it ends up being fatty.

459
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:24,440
But yeah, so this is kind of an active area of research about which chemical exposures,

460
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:30,139
particularly in say like occupational settings with things similar to or the same family as

461
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:34,850
say something like carbon tetrachloride might be contributing to this type of liver toxicity.

462
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:41,150
The good news about this situation is that if you pull drug or toxicant induced,

463
00:51:42,110 --> 00:51:47,330
if you pull the person away from exposure to the drug or toxicant, this is generally like reversible.

464
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:52,610
You're not killing the hepatocytes. You can deliver, can recover the situation.

465
00:51:52,610 --> 00:52:05,010
So that's good. So going through to the next stage of severity, we can say is when we get into fibrosis and cirrhosis.

466
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:09,960
So this is a picture of what a normal liver would look like. It's very smooth kind of looking.

467
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:15,660
In the case of cirrhosis, we get an overabundance of scar tissue on the liver.

468
00:52:15,690 --> 00:52:18,599
It has the sort of like bumpy look to it.

469
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:28,890
As this accumulate, you get this accumulation of collagen, which is called fibrosis, and this could be response to repeated inflammation or injury.

470
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:38,340
And you're essentially replacing the hepatocytes with scar tissue, which you can imagine is going to disrupt the function of the liver if you do that.

471
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:44,220
And this is generally when when this gets so bad, the liver function is severely compromised.

472
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:51,450
It's generally it's not reversible. You are looking at liver transplant or the or facing the person may die.

473
00:52:53,640 --> 00:53:03,240
And so the things that caused this are, you know, you may have heard probably heard one or more of these have hepatitis infection, alcohol abuse.

474
00:53:04,870 --> 00:53:10,380
It also, you know, we found some cases chronic chemical exposures can lead to cirrhosis.

475
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,690
And then kind of moving forward through these various ailments.

476
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:24,649
We have liver tumors. So liver tumors can form from hepatocytes and they can also form like from bile duct

477
00:53:24,650 --> 00:53:29,780
cells and different like progenitor and stem cells that are found in the liver.

478
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:33,560
And we see this with things like steroid abuse for androgen abuse.

479
00:53:33,590 --> 00:53:39,620
We can see it with alcohol abuse in some cases or exposure to aflatoxin, which you talked a little bit about.

480
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:49,879
Aflatoxin is produced by molds that can be found on certain crops when they're stored in improperly or in certain conditions.

481
00:53:49,880 --> 00:54:00,200
You'll get formation of these molds that can produce really toxic toxins and aflatoxin, sort of like the most toxic liver carcinogens that we know of.

482
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:07,220
And you get a lot of, uh, potential for synergistic interactions here.

483
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:13,460
So someone may have hepatitis and then be exposed to aflatoxin and their risk for liver cancer is going to go way up.

484
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:21,379
Similarly, someone may be, uh, you know, drinking a lot of alcohol or abusing alcohol and exposed to aflatoxin.

485
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:25,580
Again, you're going to get like a high. So any combination of like alcohol abuse,

486
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:31,610
aflatoxin exposure and hepatitis is going to be a really potent synergistic set

487
00:54:31,610 --> 00:54:37,190
of exposures that really puts one at higher risk to for developing liver tumors.

488
00:54:38,570 --> 00:54:42,650
So you can see pictures here, right, of these liver tumors forming.

489
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:49,760
From these? Yeah. So yeah, it's it will probably get done early.

490
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:55,070
So there's a lot of experimental models that we use to study liver toxicants.

491
00:54:55,070 --> 00:55:02,510
So as I mentioned, there are several, you know, things that we still don't know about, you know, how toxicants can impact liver health.

492
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:08,899
So we use things like rodent models, as I mentioned, and we have like some pretty well-established models of,

493
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:13,880
say, of a high fat diet leading to things like fatty liver.

494
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:22,340
So if we want to study how a chemical might impact, um, you know, and make it have a synergistic or additive effect on, let's say,

495
00:55:22,490 --> 00:55:30,809
like steatosis, we've got like animal models for that that can model the fatty liver phenotype at a chemical exposure to it.

496
00:55:30,810 --> 00:55:37,610
And we can see that potentially exposure to phthalates is contributing to this problem in a public health context.

497
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:46,160
Zebrafish are they're kind of just a kind of a more widely used model in toxicology overall.

498
00:55:46,190 --> 00:55:51,410
They have like a you can like breed them very fast compared to like mammals.

499
00:55:52,400 --> 00:56:01,070
Um, and they have uh, uh, like skin that you could see through in certain stages so they can track the formation of Oregon.

500
00:56:01,070 --> 00:56:03,860
Some things. There's a lot of advantages to using the zebrafish model,

501
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:09,530
and they actually do have a lot of overlapping molecular pathways to humans, believe it or not.

502
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:15,410
So zebrafish are really kind of more and more being used in toxicology studies.

503
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:23,719
We typically use these to assess what we call apical endpoints, meaning like really bad damaging endpoints that we agree with.

504
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:30,050
Physicians are like an indicator that this chemical is causing like a real problem in terms of damaging the liver.

505
00:56:30,530 --> 00:56:32,509
So things like tissue damage,

506
00:56:32,510 --> 00:56:41,989
the formation of lesions or like the pathology of liver cancer are all things we could like measure or investigate using an animal model with mice,

507
00:56:41,990 --> 00:56:45,070
we could use genetic knockout models to test our mechanisms. Right?

508
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:48,290
If we knocked out expression of CYP 2e1.

509
00:56:48,290 --> 00:56:52,879
What does that do when we expose that mouse to acetaminophen?

510
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:56,150
Does it modify the response? Um, you know,

511
00:56:56,210 --> 00:57:00,740
you might think that if we knocked out two in one expression that the acetaminophen

512
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:04,120
isn't going to be causing as much liver damage because that's the cutoff.

513
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:10,220
The enzyme that creates that UI, which is the toxic metabolite, is that actually what happens?

514
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:14,180
You have to do the experiment. I'm sure someone's probably done that experiment, but.

515
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:20,920
We also have in vitro, a lot of in vitro models we use.

516
00:57:21,330 --> 00:57:24,870
So these include like what we call slice cultures where it's like slice up the

517
00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:28,740
liver and culture it in a dish and then treat it with chemicals and measures,

518
00:57:28,770 --> 00:57:39,629
cellular and molecular responses. We can there are like hepatocyte cell lines both from humans and various species.

519
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:43,980
We have like induced pluripotent stem cells that we can use and the cell lines.

520
00:57:44,550 --> 00:57:50,700
So this is why we're looking at things like dose response and mechanisms of toxicity when we want to look at kind of the more,

521
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:59,310
you know, molecular or cellular level as opposed to like the tissue level in terms of liver toxicity,

522
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:04,600
we can look at things like metabolic effects of drug metabolism, you know,

523
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:10,889
treating hepatocyte with a particular chemical and see what types of metabolites are formed.

524
00:58:10,890 --> 00:58:17,530
And that's a pretty good bet that the hepatocytes are going to form those in vivo in most cases.

525
00:58:17,550 --> 00:58:21,840
So it's a way of kind of interrogating the metabolic pathways using these in vitro models.

526
00:58:23,430 --> 00:58:27,660
So that is it for liver toxicity for now.

527
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:31,920
I think we kind of got through it a little faster than I expected.

528
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:39,190
So I think next time we're going to jump into repro toxicology and we'll just go from there.

529
00:58:39,210 --> 00:58:43,560
So thanks for being here. If you have any questions, let me know.

530
00:58:43,890 --> 00:58:46,260
Otherwise, enjoy the 20 minutes. Thank you.
