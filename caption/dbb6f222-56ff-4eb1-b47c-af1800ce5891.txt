1
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:19,889
The one thing for me is kind of I think most of us know about resubmitting problems that to me I've seen it when so I would extend the time.

2
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,070
SHORTEN So just take a minute and resubmit it.

3
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:33,440
I'll give you a minute while I set up. But so basically if you go to assignment because it was just not showing me kind of problems that.

4
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,110
Were there any questions about problems that you.

5
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:14,260
The only solution was to say and then today we will go over the practice process for linkage analysis,

6
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:22,490
because this is also going to catch analysis and I think problem set theory is posted now.

7
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:28,330
So next Thursday, I believe we will have time to work on it.

8
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:41,880
Next Tuesday, I'm sure class will go over probably about the reading for this section, my refresh on it and then we can sit next to them,

9
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:51,910
go over the whole reading and I'll give you plenty of time to work on problems that three points should be our most problem.

10
00:01:51,910 --> 00:02:06,790
Set for Exam one today will do the practice problems which will help you work on where you work on to at least three of them.

11
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:16,830
Let's see which countries.

12
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:26,270
Okay. So for the first question, each of the following statements are false.

13
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:36,320
So as you remember from a recorded lecture, some megabytes is a measure of physical distance sent to Morgan as a measure of genetic distance,

14
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:41,920
and they are roughly equivalent where one said Morgan is equivalent to one negative gaze.

15
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,650
This one is the false one. Can anyone tell me what it's equivalent to?

16
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:52,340
Once any Morgan is equivalent to one chance of recombination.

17
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:58,160
1%. 1%. So it's not 10%. Okay.

18
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:10,100
So recombination fraction of 125 between two loci indicates the answer is linkage.

19
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:16,710
So remember, anything between zero and point five is in the front page.

20
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:20,660
And then once you have 2.5, then they are unlinked.

21
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:31,580
So, you know, he thinks which characteristics increase the usefulness of a genetic marker for linkage studies?

22
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:43,820
Most people get this right, so we want multiple so a lot of polymorphisms and then roughly equal frequencies.

23
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:54,260
Then the Elodie score, a score of one between two loci allows the investigator to draw which conclusion.

24
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,370
So the correct answer is that there is no significant evidence for it to come.

25
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:15,229
So remember the range for the lots where we're looking at more than three or more for a significant length and then the negative to on the other hand,

26
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:22,310
two for significant significantly unlinked. And anything in between is that which is which is the one here.

27
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,600
It's indicative of no significant evidence so cannot really say.

28
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,010
So this is this is sort of an equivalent of a statistical test.

29
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:37,709
So we're testing hypotheses here. Any questions of anyone?

30
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:45,130
One. So in a phase one pedigree, what is the maximum likelihood estimation of the recombination fraction?

31
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:51,579
So most of these people get most of you got this right.

32
00:04:51,580 --> 00:05:02,530
So it's k over and one in case the number of recombinant meiosis or events divided by the total z of theta is for the LOD score.

33
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:09,070
We will talk about it. So this is the statistical test l of theta is the is the probability function.

34
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:13,719
So it's the probability of observing of the data given a certain theta.

35
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,110
So so it's not an estimate of the theta per say.

36
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:23,940
I don't know what I think it means. Anything. Okay.

37
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:30,759
So are there any questions about this or in Lincoln's analysis before we work on the problem sets,

38
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:37,840
which will help kind of clarify what you need to know, how you solve problems related to that?

39
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:50,720
Okay. So if your group didn't pick up one of those practice folks that go out and come and pick clients,

40
00:05:51,560 --> 00:06:01,580
give you maybe like 10 minutes, just try to go over A, B and C and then we will do so.

41
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:09,650
Some extra passes here is.

42
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:22,410
I don't. Second place, but I got stuck with this.

43
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,320
Yeah, I know. This is just.

44
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:56,300
I just went over the question of, like, the fact that this was anyway Brazilian coffee and you've been working day.

45
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:08,930
So on an yeah, I know.

46
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

47
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:19,610
Hundreds or thousands.

48
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,839
I don't know if this works.

49
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:52,260
$2.8 billion to $131 million is going to be included in that which is used to make our citizens because you can get like an ongoing.

50
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:03,840
So because there is my other name because in Cape Verde so there's even.

51
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:10,420
So I got to go to Florida. Yeah.

52
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:16,260
Oh, oh, oh, oh. Cool.

53
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:22,510
One Â£23,300.

54
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:39,830
There's like you're saying the same way that we want to know what's up with that kind of response the everyday.

55
00:08:39,850 --> 00:09:01,140
But I think this is like, you know so you don't have to be in that way to take to shop.

56
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,770
So I guess that's one of the things you got to do, you know?

57
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:15,370
Yeah, exactly. I know. And I'm assuming that this was like, okay, yeah.

58
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:23,480
I don't think I should tell.

59
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:33,740
Like I was doing. I thought she was going to use this homogenous use of your time.

60
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:41,130
Okay, I know, but it's still not, like normal. They've been trying to understand.

61
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:47,810
Yeah, I know. It's like this.

62
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:57,420
This is. This is the most. They're not lined up with something that's going to be like or noise.

63
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:10,300
I don't know. Because just making it clearly, there's a recombination to the conversation.

64
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:14,860
Think this is kind of like that.

65
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:23,220
You don't know which one to be about to. Right.

66
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:31,220
Just based on how he worded the.

67
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:37,469
I see. So I see. Yeah.

68
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:44,240
Because they're so busy all the time.

69
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:56,430
But how you how about it? Because it doesn't make sense to you.

70
00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:04,169
What. Which do you want. Yeah. So I don't know which one.

71
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:09,690
It's from the mom. Which one is from. You can see like and things on this.

72
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:26,240
How did see. You are, which are the five serious boundaries raised by this experience as long as there was crossing the river,

73
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:37,560
Smiley's refusal to hear it saying that we don't know because we want to do good.

74
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,860
I understand what you're trying to he like.

75
00:11:47,970 --> 00:12:02,070
But I'm telling you, these things more than once where you'll have I will take some nomination because there's no one from the mines.

76
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:07,550
Right. Yeah. No, I agree with that of this one, that presentation, because there's no to do.

77
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:11,580
But that still doesn't seem like this is there for those trials.

78
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:15,450
So it wasn't like this one.

79
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:21,030
You just get one like this more that as well.

80
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:31,380
So this one's a big deal to these three or these two and they can't switch those types of they can switch.

81
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:41,310
I just think they shouldn't. If she said that we so don't know that she could be in for a switch.

82
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:46,080
I don't know if it's 35 feet long.

83
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:50,490
So it's a long story.

84
00:12:50,920 --> 00:13:01,430
Yeah. Yeah. So the thing is, on the show itself, like this or this one, if this goes, you're saying like this guy.

85
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:04,750
No, no, this is this. I think so.

86
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:11,569
You know, or and even that this is there for all of you in common.

87
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:15,770
And because you can't. Yeah, but yeah.

88
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:21,490
This is not like the three they came from the 122.

89
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:29,249
He's a big I'm saying there was a recombination between these two during meiosis to give this

90
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:40,500
combination because there's no big three in any of the parents had to be a result of me in my life.

91
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:53,730
I was like, I don't know. I just I just got so confused.

92
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:58,410
You just know that she has no. Yeah.

93
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,340
You can't see it, and that's why. Oh, I see.

94
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:12,440
Oh, I see. Because it doesn't really get to the question of starting the little one page and it.

95
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:31,970
My dad was in the wrong one, cause I should be to about 10 minutes to get out of prison.

96
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:37,120
I think that there's a link between those two families.

97
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:50,670
Yeah. And then also, you may also remember something where I was I have seen like things like twice so far this week.

98
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:55,800
We know, but we do. Yeah.

99
00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:09,090
So it was like I can do, you know, 20 or 30 minutes of me celebrating 30 minutes.

100
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:18,270
And so it's a small, too small to increase.

101
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:25,770
So because it's based on own, the mom could be any of those obviously.

102
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:30,420
You know, none of this makes sense to me, truthfully.

103
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:35,520
So I'm glad that your help can be separate for each potential.

104
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:52,170
So we're going to go with this first. She's going to do that because this is one all the things she used.

105
00:15:52,170 --> 00:16:08,750
It was like the first few weeks and the mother of three really transformed into like, you know, this was the one.

106
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:25,110
Right. But no reason why that is necessary for her, because in terms of it's either it's just 3 hours because it would be three.

107
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:33,389
She wants a father and they're just going through it and it's so busy and doing

108
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:40,320
the same clothes because we don't know for sure that it's going to get it all.

109
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:49,530
Okay, like, oh, I can't get little T through here. We definitely want the three of us sitting in the back of our stomachs right now.

110
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:57,230
Okay, I'll have to do that, right?

111
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:01,550
Yeah. I've never learned that.

112
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:07,280
I didn't know, you know, the computer came from that.

113
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:11,520
We don't know what little or. No, that's not it.

114
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:29,890
So everything we give and you know, it's like, I can't tell you what happened, but it was the same scenario.

115
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:40,570
And so that's why I'm here, isn't why they either have the same information, which we're here for.

116
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:54,450
But so far your answer has the best explanation was it puts you in the combination of the two is and it's like what is it look like.

117
00:17:54,450 --> 00:18:05,820
I'm not saying it does it does sound like it's from Q because it seems like like when they come together in some place,

118
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:13,440
they should go back to people that are just like, Yeah, but then it's like they're only getting like a story, like things.

119
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:22,230
These are going back to our little history and that just doesn't that's not a the combination if you get.

120
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:32,670
But then when there is a recombination, there's it would be little flu but units private industry.

121
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:48,720
Plus I hear you say like, where's the screen for you?

122
00:18:53,250 --> 00:19:00,260
Know who would you say this is coming?

123
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:16,890
And to try to make sure that it's just that I really I didn't really want to leave, you know, several parts.

124
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:25,050
I get a little bit more. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

125
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:34,380
Like, I know that for sure. I don't know if you know, someone goes, Yeah, you have to work together.

126
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:47,150
Yeah. Yeah. I think the type of things that I was thinking, oh, that's what they wanted to do.

127
00:19:47,490 --> 00:20:02,570
Yeah, I think, I think I want you to specify which is this idea that we're going to shape.

128
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:19,170
Oh, I think so. And it's kind of hard to define.

129
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:32,580
Yeah. So this is this is the same as this one is coming Tuesday.

130
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:51,530
And it was pretty interesting to me some predictions about social media around the world.

131
00:20:51,700 --> 00:21:08,250
There's like this is like the recombination was like this morning is that Mike Rogers says I

132
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:29,370
can do for me if you said it could have or like at that moment well let's do this evening.

133
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:33,300
Yeah. And so it makes the mom in the class.

134
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:50,579
What makes the most interesting person come here for the rest of the long zoom meeting?

135
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:54,420
But it did have a lot of low.

136
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:58,230
Yes. So how was your neighbors?

137
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:17,010
Are you still going to get like I was saying, oh, I remember you guys probably didn't, even if I know what you're saying.

138
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:49,830
Yeah. So like the characteristic is that and I was saying even the person like the same thing is through it seems like it,

139
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:54,450
it's like social networks like that could be not.

140
00:22:54,450 --> 00:23:05,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You just you guys need more time just for ambiance, so you don't have to kind of get all this more time to read, so.

141
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:22,920
Okay, so let's work through them together as the question is showing a particular family where we have a smartphone that has four a so one.

142
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:32,730
Two weeks before. And we think that this marker is located near the gene that causes the disease phenotype esthetically.

143
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:40,360
And we're told that the disease is a design of dominance and and strength.

144
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:52,810
So this is the pedigree. And then for the the thing that's not told to us is whether they're in their phase or phase.

145
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:56,980
So so in that case, we have to assume that they're unfazed.

146
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:07,060
So so what does that mean? Like if I'm trying to tell the parental haplotypes.

147
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:14,600
So let's see. So this the mom here was is like that.

148
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:19,020
So we know that she has a D here and a two here.

149
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:24,600
So that that's like one scenario in a D here and the three here.

150
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:33,450
But because they're unfazed, we could have we don't know if it's actually the big D here.

151
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:40,740
You can see for small D here, too.

152
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:52,020
Is that is that clear? And for this for this for the father, it doesn't matter because he can only give one haplotype.

153
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:59,190
There's one outlet type. He can only give the D one this small D with the one and then.

154
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,130
Are the milestones in the father informative?

155
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:15,410
No, because if if this if crossing over happens here, then you would technically so they switch like this is coming with this this one here.

156
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:22,130
You would still end up with the same types of types and you're not able to tell if the combination happened or not.

157
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:29,000
Yeah. Is that clear? So here recombination is that when the chromosomes come together,

158
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:34,400
some a piece from here was break come attached to here and then the other one will come here.

159
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:38,580
Then you're not able to tell. Yeah. Very little.

160
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:42,390
One little detail. Oh, yes. Oh, that's weird.

161
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:52,560
Okay. But still, if it'll still be this thing, you're not able to tell if you're a combination of friends or not.

162
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:58,430
Is that somewhat clear? Okay.

163
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:06,230
So that's how we can until we're able to tell whether the meiosis is informative or not.

164
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:18,170
Okay. And then since we don't know about the phase, then we're going to have to take two scenarios, whether the haplotypes are this or this.

165
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:22,489
And we're going to call those. We're going to have to kind of scenarios.

166
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:27,290
We'll call this phase one. We call this phase two.

167
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:31,190
And then if recombination happens in phase one.

168
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:36,410
So those would be those top ones would be the parental haplotypes, the original ones.

169
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,160
And then extreme combination happens. Then what do we end up with?

170
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:46,010
Can someone tell me, like assuming this phase here. What would the haplotypes be?

171
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:58,360
The three little data. Yeah. So we're going to kind of switch those so big to include those two.

172
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:04,430
So those would be any one of the offspring that has those recombinant haplotypes.

173
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:13,370
That would be a recombinant. We would count them here as recombinant.

174
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:22,490
We'll get to that later. Okay. And then for this one again, we would have that big D we went to.

175
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:29,050
We then the small D three. Is that there?

176
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:32,550
Any questions? Okay.

177
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:41,150
So we kind of this kind of helps us set up like the the, the, the, the information we need to answer the problem.

178
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,250
So how many formative meiosis are there in this pedigree?

179
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:51,600
Yes. So five. And they are all from the mom.

180
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,970
This is uninformative because if you combination happens, we're not able to tell.

181
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:02,920
Because of the hormones, because they're homozygous at one one.

182
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:12,459
Yeah. If the father were to be heterozygous at both, would the number automatically be ten?

183
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:19,000
Or would it depend on the, I guess, haplotypes at each locus compared to the mother's?

184
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,010
And you'd have to go through and compare and see what you mean.

185
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:30,100
I think for informative meiosis percent, I would say it's ten, but it'll probably be yeah,

186
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:35,710
we'd probably probably be confusing like thinking about the haplotypes if they're coming from the mom or the dad.

187
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:39,660
He's saying that he was like 82 little d one.

188
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:43,260
The mom also has Yeah. Situation where she can be 82.

189
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:50,950
So we'd have to kind of go through and compare because it wouldn't necessarily be ten and still be informative for my niece, I believe.

190
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:59,860
But I don't think you would I don't think you're able to tell which one is coming from the mom or that or the dad account for that.

191
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:06,340
I don't think we'll have to deal with such a scenario in this class or like I don't think that kind

192
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:12,670
of calculation you can do by hand in a statistical software like you're assuming different stuff.

193
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:21,760
So for this class to find informative meiosis is like a good rule, like number of children times,

194
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,300
number of heterozygous in the parents, or is that not going to work?

195
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:42,850
So. I guess you can assume that like five and then one heterozygous, then one if you have both heterozygous and to.

196
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:50,940
I think so, yeah. That makes sense to everyone.

197
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:54,809
What she's asking. Like if both are heterozygous and you have informative.

198
00:29:54,810 --> 00:30:05,520
My list is here and here and for each of you would have kind of five meiosis from from the informative meiosis from the dad five from the mom.

199
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:17,160
You would have ten informative. Yeah. How would that work then if they were both homogenous then do not if you don't have informative meiosis.

200
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:25,420
And then I don't like in typical analysis, like when you're doing linkage analysis as you'll see like in the second part,

201
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,899
we're, we're not going to have a single family.

202
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:35,970
We usually have multiple pedigrees and some would not be informative, would not give you a good estimates of the theta out in a blood score,

203
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:47,100
but we're able to kind of aggregate information from different entries to reach the conclusion whether this genetic is located near that marker.

204
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:50,760
So maybe not all categories would be informative.

205
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:57,790
Any more questions? Okay.

206
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:03,670
So let's try to do the haplotypes of the offspring.

207
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:22,210
Okay. So for this person here, generation two one, what are the haplotypes?

208
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:27,160
So here we're going to look and see what what can the father give?

209
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:31,930
And then try to guess, because this one we can tell the phase.

210
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:41,820
So we're going to have to assume that if this person has something like a small D with a two, then that came from the father.

211
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:49,150
Whatever is left is coming from the mom. So what do you think for this person?

212
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:57,040
B one. These are we cannot tell the face.

213
00:31:57,370 --> 00:32:03,370
So if you read to me. Big D, small big D to see that they're showing that way.

214
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:07,000
But this is a phase. So we don't know if they actually worked together.

215
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:17,320
And so little doo doo would have to come from little D to.

216
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:29,360
Yes, yes. So little detail would come from the prompter and that would leave a pretty good to me coming from the mom.

217
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:34,790
It is one of the haplotypes, as we said up here.

218
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:40,670
Is that clear? So would this be considered?

219
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:48,409
It depends if you are assuming phase one or phase two. So if you're in phase one, then it is recombinant.

220
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:52,970
So those are recombinant. So we're working under two assumptions.

221
00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:02,389
So if you're assuming you're assuming phase one, you count counted as recombinant.

222
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:06,920
If you're assuming phase two, then those would be one of the parental haplotypes.

223
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:12,530
There are two scenarios like we're working under two scenarios. So how do you respond?

224
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:18,170
So when we're calculating, like when we do that probability and likelihood, we're going to do an average.

225
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:21,830
So we're going to kind of use both information into an average.

226
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:31,960
Yeah. And then like in other like here we could just say under phase one or under like this assumption that they have this many of them.

227
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:35,250
So you can put those. Okay.

228
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:40,290
So this person here, there's not many options.

229
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:48,190
So. Need to get to know about this person here, obviously.

230
00:33:53,400 --> 00:34:01,740
63. Little demon. Yes. My little D has to come from the mystic.

231
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:13,640
This one here. This one.

232
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:22,430
So what can the father give? We?

233
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:31,310
The last one.

234
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:38,310
The small d has to come on the.

235
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:46,580
Is that true? Yeah. I'm still confused on why it can't be useful.

236
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:50,470
Why? Why are we only doing, like, in the two one?

237
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:53,860
How do we know it's little data in 33 instead of 50?

238
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:58,510
It's not so. So let's.

239
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:02,350
Let's let's take this person here. Just last person.

240
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:06,160
So they're unfazed, right? So their haplotypes could be.

241
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:12,240
The 2 to 3.

242
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:17,510
Or it could be the other way. The. We?

243
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:24,110
Small the two. Right. So.

244
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:28,639
So one has to necessarily come from that from the farther.

245
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:34,730
Right. And look at those haplotypes that these are the options like for this person's haplotypes.

246
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:38,660
One of them has to come from the father. And what can the father give?

247
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:43,530
Little do too little? Yes. Only like the father.

248
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:47,310
So these are like one option together. It's either this or that.

249
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:53,339
So the father has to give this this small D two, and then this one.

250
00:35:53,340 --> 00:36:00,530
The victim has to come from the mom. No.

251
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:05,350
And no comment like oh you can't re combine between parents.

252
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:10,820
I was thinking you could combine the top two would make these top two.

253
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:15,420
No, I was. I was doing it from there. Never mind.

254
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:24,150
This. Is that here? Everyone knows it's up to them to have the tapes.

255
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:32,910
I guess, just to clarify that. So there is no recombination between the parent, the parental meiosis.

256
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:43,330
So recombination would happen within the person kind of with their parent with their parent's chromosomes.

257
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:48,100
So you inherit one like one copy of comes one from your mom.

258
00:36:49,600 --> 00:37:00,159
Once you're done, then when meiosis is happen, like each cell would kind of give for member for gametes and then your parental

259
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:06,070
chromosomes kind of shuffle that's recombination within the then each parent.

260
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:16,660
So here and then that's when you would have the the have sometimes or for gametes set clear.

261
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:28,440
Oh. Okay.

262
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:34,260
So what are the potential haplotypes of the parental generation?

263
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:44,540
So we kind of did them right. So for the father, it's one thing to.

264
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:57,730
Two for the one for the moderate Fritz Toomey.

265
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:05,070
Phase one, assuming they're organized in a certain way, phase one.

266
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:17,140
So this one big D to. Small D three assuming they are in a different phase.

267
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:39,120
And then it. He's not clear.

268
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:46,229
Questions? If you I don't know,

269
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:53,700
sometimes like you might think it's confusing like about like the facing like why wouldn't we know that we're we have here and

270
00:38:53,700 --> 00:39:02,280
to hear if it's so when we're like genotyping people it's not like we have a single strand of DNA with like meeting on it.

271
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,290
We actually kind of have information on this genome type here.

272
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:13,740
So we know this person is big, this small D and then we have information that they are two or three here.

273
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:22,440
So we're kind of reading this way like and the genotype, we're not reading along the chromosome like the DNA sequence itself.

274
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:27,120
It's not like we know at least this technology here, like the genotyping.

275
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:30,389
It's not like we have all this strand of DNA. Wow.

276
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:34,080
I'm going to read it. And I know all those emails came from your mom,

277
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:41,190
but it's actually kind of like you think this person has big data from his from a parent, small d, from a parent.

278
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:50,790
And then we're going to have to use like facing like matching match it to a reference genome to be able to tell exactly like how they're organized,

279
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:53,919
like which one is actually with which ones.

280
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:59,760
I'm going to get it on the same strength. You more confusing.

281
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:15,490
Any questions? Do you want me to start, sir? Yeah.

282
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:20,710
Is it possible to ever have more than two phases? One and two phases?

283
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:33,940
Probably. If you have to go first to look for two loci.

284
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:40,690
Probably be for four haplotypes and then two phases.

285
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:50,070
Okay. Should I keep going?

286
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:54,630
Any more questions? No. Okay.

287
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:58,440
So how many recombinant, recombinant offspring are there?

288
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:05,670
And then we're going to have to give. The numbers are under two scenarios.

289
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:10,559
One, one, one, one, two. Okay.

290
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:18,100
So let's assume that the mom has these haplotypes here and that says she's phase one.

291
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:28,620
And then look at the offspring. So this person here, if they we said that they have the big D three haplotype.

292
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:33,920
So does that make them a recombinant or. Non recombinant.

293
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:46,890
Become recombinant. Yes because they have some type three is actually a recombinant like it's it's a result of the two two strands crossing over.

294
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:57,880
So this one is recombinant. What about this person here?

295
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:04,219
They have this one from the father, which we know is not informative.

296
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:09,860
We cannot tell if recombination happened. They have the data and we're under phase one.

297
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:15,230
So with that, make them recombinant or parental haplotype.

298
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:28,530
Is it clear? Yes. It's confusing because you've put them at the top, but then at the bottom they're the opposite.

299
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:31,750
So I'm just looking at it on the screen or just confused by the screen.

300
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:39,380
Yeah. So just looking at it at phase one, you see that the top one's that you're on, but you also have the opposite, which is phase two.

301
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:43,750
So then it just kind of can be confusing. I understand.

302
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:49,450
It is just I don't know how you put it up, so.

303
00:42:55,720 --> 00:43:03,680
Well, let's do this. So these are the original parental.

304
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:14,030
Right until the end. Those are separate scenarios in this one.

305
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:20,920
This is my space.

306
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:30,590
Is that clear? But are we? Okay, so if we're under phase one, which is this case, you have these parental haplotypes,

307
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:38,390
like what we assumed the parent had if no recombinant without recombination, this is what the hub subtypes would be if recombination has happened.

308
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:53,950
So what about this person to speak here? Tried recombinant recombinant because the big D three is actually a very common haplotype.

309
00:43:57,550 --> 00:44:01,120
This one here. D one. D three.

310
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:05,590
So small. D With a three. No.

311
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:14,890
None. Yes. It's in the current. This one.

312
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:26,450
53. I'm confident it is as we.

313
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:36,210
Clear for everyone. So now we're going to.

314
00:44:44,290 --> 00:44:49,010
Now. What are we going to do now with these two?

315
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:53,410
Yeah. So work on your assumption of space to see.

316
00:44:55,960 --> 00:45:03,010
So if the haplotypes of the offspring are recombinant or not.

317
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:12,130
So the big three under phase two wouldn't be what?

318
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:22,940
Parental jeopardy. Three is parental. And remember, we're again, I'm looking at this because this one is from the dad.

319
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:29,710
I can't it's not informative for me. So I know it's for non recombinant.

320
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:37,980
Small d to. Yeah.

321
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:44,950
And if you work through it, you would notice that it's kind of the reverse case.

322
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:52,430
Whoever you assumed was recombinant. Phase one would be non recombinant and face to face versus.

323
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:00,300
Okay. Clear. Okay.

324
00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:13,020
So this one's actually I put it under B, but we're working on Part D, so how many recombinant offspring are there?

325
00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:19,600
So under phase one. How many for?

326
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:29,380
Four on their face. To do so.

327
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:43,610
Any more, any questions before we do?

328
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:51,040
Should we keep working on this together, or do you want to try to work on it on your own or no, since getting through this part together.

329
00:46:51,050 --> 00:47:03,980
Together? Yeah, I would say one thing now is when we get to start to use some of the formulas and equations

330
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:07,430
from the slides and hopefully navigate like you would kind of get an idea of what,

331
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:11,630
what formula you need to know. Okay.

332
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:23,960
So for part B, it's saying using the formula theta equals p p over what is the maximum likelihood estimate of freedom.

333
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:29,569
And then gives a separate answer for each potential experiment.

334
00:47:29,570 --> 00:47:34,460
Have them on haplotype. We then say if the theta makes sense.

335
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:39,530
So. So we're given the formula and we're told how to estimate theta.

336
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:51,110
So who can tell me what is what is k the number of recombinant components?

337
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:56,419
Okay. And then I'm going to have to have again, both scenarios being a phase one.

338
00:47:56,420 --> 00:48:01,550
Phase two. Let me let me write one case that you guys.

339
00:48:13,110 --> 00:48:17,850
Okay. So K is the number.

340
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:28,740
Thomson 12 sprays then and.

341
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:34,470
But. Information. A number of informative emails.

342
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:46,060
Excuse. So.

343
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:54,340
So we know that as we did here, the number of recombinant 4K can be either four, it can be one.

344
00:48:54,520 --> 00:49:01,270
So we're going to have two estimates for theta. So under phase one, what would theta be?

345
00:49:07,290 --> 00:49:19,080
For over five. Then under phase two, what would be 3114?

346
00:49:25,810 --> 00:49:32,120
If you win the. Okay.

347
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:44,280
Is it clear how we got to those answers to those? So which one?

348
00:49:45,630 --> 00:49:57,570
Based on this information, our estimates of the data, which phase we think is the more not correct, but which one makes more intuitive sense.

349
00:50:00,410 --> 00:50:05,180
Phase one. Phase one? What you see is what I got from.

350
00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:18,290
Even more so. Remember that theta we so theta equals 0.5 means what?

351
00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:25,110
That's the maximum value of theta. That's when we when there's no leakage at this point.

352
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:31,880
Yes. Or like they're on separate chromosomes. So this one here doesn't really make sense.

353
00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:38,600
So phase two is the more likely scenario.

354
00:50:39,590 --> 00:50:51,550
So if you have theta at point five, then no linkage and then theta and there's an equal sign to check.

355
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:55,550
But then that's when you might have linkage or.

356
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:29,820
Well. So we can say that face to face makes more sense.

357
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:36,170
It's someone that. More intuitive.

358
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:46,790
Who? Any question?

359
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:51,200
Yeah. How do you know? Like. Like, why would you assume they're like.

360
00:51:51,410 --> 00:52:06,710
It's not like. You see how taking this plane.

361
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:22,100
So it's the marker and the genetics, the disease causing loci is like really close then.

362
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:31,050
You would have less recombination. So they are close, so then they are linked.

363
00:52:32,070 --> 00:52:36,270
So they're are less likely to be separated by recombination.

364
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:44,520
So your recombination fraction would be point two or like the smaller ones.

365
00:52:44,610 --> 00:52:58,650
Yes. So less than if they are for two separate chromosomes and they are unlinked far from each other.

366
00:52:59,430 --> 00:53:04,110
And then you can have recombination happening and mixing them.

367
00:53:04,110 --> 00:53:07,680
They're not coming. They're not linked. They're not being inherited together.

368
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:21,560
Does that help? Yeah. Well, I guess then you were making more intuitive sense, so it's really just like touching it between zero and five.

369
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:27,240
Like, I guess I just don't know. Like, why would the point eight not make any to if it's like this?

370
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:31,230
Yeah. It's like a limitation on theta.

371
00:53:31,330 --> 00:53:36,730
Like it's like a maximum value of theta. It cannot be like five, I guess.

372
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:49,200
You could have like this many re combinations. But. And they.

373
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:53,620
I know. Yeah, it's just the mutation of the theta.

374
00:53:53,860 --> 00:54:01,300
Maximum 19.5. Any more questions?

375
00:54:02,170 --> 00:54:07,090
No, not a question, but just something that might help. Is that when you think about meiosis?

376
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:10,630
Only half of the chromosomes recombine, right?

377
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:13,480
We have strands that don't recombine in every meiosis.

378
00:54:13,930 --> 00:54:23,139
So the likelihood of seeing four out of five of the offspring being recombinant is unlikely because for every recombination,

379
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:29,550
there's also two parental strains that stay the same. So seeing that many recombinant in the pedigree is unlikely.

380
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:33,110
So it's more likely that it's the other phase.

381
00:54:33,130 --> 00:54:36,140
Does that help? Yeah. Thank you. Thank you.

382
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:47,050
Yeah. Any more questions or anything.

383
00:54:48,550 --> 00:55:02,560
Okay. So we got our estimate of theta and now we are going to use this formula here to calculate the life of data.

384
00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:10,360
So kind of like the probability of this pedigree. So the probability of observing this pedigree under a certain theta.

385
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:17,760
And in the slides this would look like.

386
00:55:23,950 --> 00:55:33,340
No. The sciences, sea theta, King Theta and minus.

387
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:38,410
Okay. So this one is just this is just an.

388
00:55:41,330 --> 00:55:42,680
This is not the answer to this question,

389
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:50,840
because we have to do remember is we have to kind of take into account both phases when we're doing the likelihood.

390
00:55:51,290 --> 00:55:58,790
But I'm just writing this because you would see this in the slides. So this is the likes of it and it's actually a form of the binomial distribution.

391
00:55:58,790 --> 00:56:04,050
So it's like we're doing a coin toss, we're seeing this person being coming in.

392
00:56:04,550 --> 00:56:09,530
So this one is recombinant and this these are all non recombinant and so on and so forth.

393
00:56:09,530 --> 00:56:13,970
So it's like this, an expansion of the binomial distribution, if that helps.

394
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:19,740
So we're doing probabilities under like a probability of success if you want.

395
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:31,680
And then how many trials? It's like we're doing trials. In this scenario, since we have we have we have unfazed pedantry.

396
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:36,820
Then we are going into [INAUDIBLE].

397
00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:41,910
Peter is being quoted to have.

398
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:47,960
Theta. Theta.

399
00:56:50,220 --> 00:57:04,630
This case was. My esthetic and my mask, and each one of those would be for one phase.

400
00:57:05,070 --> 00:57:11,070
So I'm going to fill in the case in the end based on what we did.

401
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:14,370
So for phase one, we have.

402
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:20,270
For me, confidence of four is equal to four.

403
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:31,050
And then. One here was Peter.

404
00:57:34,110 --> 00:57:42,110
First under. This one is coming from space one.

405
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:48,050
This one is coming face to.

406
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:55,750
Know, one theater east of the bar. One buffets one.

407
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:03,660
For my escape. So if gays and.

408
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:11,030
One minus one minus theta.

409
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:16,160
So five is the number of minuses.

410
00:58:16,790 --> 00:58:19,790
So five minus four, right?

411
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:25,190
Yeah. So phase one K equals four.

412
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:30,000
In Phase two equals one and in both cases is five.

413
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:35,800
You are using one half of the concept because there's two things.

414
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:43,030
So yeah, this is actually confusing. So this is not and I just put this for me because that's what you would see in this slide.

415
00:58:43,030 --> 00:58:49,540
This is not actually the same concept. This is the concept from the binomial distributions.

416
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:55,000
Like any choose k is going to get canceled out when we do the the lot score.

417
00:58:55,510 --> 00:59:03,700
But I just put it here, but we're actually kind of just adding this to this kind of part and then do we have we're not going to solve this equation.

418
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:10,950
It's just the form of the like things. So it would always be have if if you're doing two.

419
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:14,890
Yes, if you have two phases, then we have this is a separate constant.

420
00:59:14,890 --> 00:59:18,160
It's just for the binomial distribution. Yeah.

421
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:28,239
Yeah. I mean you could choose what I wanted to kind of link back to the slides because this, I think it is given maybe like that table in the slides.

422
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:31,390
But if it's not, then you can just refer to this.

423
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:46,860
So we're basically taking an average of both the likelihood under phase one and the likelihood under phase two.

424
00:59:53,950 --> 01:00:01,790
Any questions? Okay.

425
01:00:02,780 --> 01:00:06,560
One more. So now.

426
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:16,380
We asked what is the general form of C of theta for this category?

427
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:30,790
Don't know. So what is the of theta? These slides.

428
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:42,760
Z of theta. It's the blood score.

429
01:00:44,110 --> 01:00:49,269
So this says you're testing the probability and looking.

430
01:00:49,270 --> 01:01:02,080
How likely is it that we observed this pedigree under different values of theta and the formula for this one?

431
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:11,720
I just looked. And.

432
01:01:13,110 --> 01:01:18,690
In the numerator, we're going to put the likelihood of the pedigree.

433
01:01:18,870 --> 01:01:25,320
So this top part here and then we're going to compare it to the likelihood under no linkage.

434
01:01:25,530 --> 01:01:30,910
So when theta is equal, 2.5. So let's fill it in.

435
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:37,300
So I'm going to put 3 to 4.

436
01:01:38,510 --> 01:01:44,550
When you see them, you want. You know.

437
01:01:52,970 --> 01:02:09,360
Streets. And I do the same.

438
01:02:09,870 --> 01:02:19,400
But I'm going to assume that this one is under the assumption, under the null or the assumption where that theta is equal to 25.

439
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:27,180
You're going to fill in the same thing. But now I have the value for data.

440
01:02:53,050 --> 01:02:57,700
And if I just simplify it a little bit more and.

441
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:46,230
Which. This talk you have.

442
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:53,850
To survive, he had to have like half a point 20.

443
01:04:06,330 --> 01:04:09,870
Time to do so.

444
01:04:10,290 --> 01:04:12,900
And this would not change, like any idea.

445
01:04:13,110 --> 01:04:20,120
Like, if you no matter how much you change the tough part like assume different values data that interesting.

446
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:25,170
I'm just trying to understand this part, the bottom part.

447
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:32,880
So. So it's half point five to the power of five.

448
01:04:33,270 --> 01:04:37,710
Right. You add that to the power.

449
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:46,280
Which would be. One time.

450
01:04:46,310 --> 01:04:54,560
Sweet time to the Pirate Party. Right. So those would like this one simplified 2.5.

451
01:04:55,290 --> 01:05:00,290
And when we're adding and multiplying against exponential, we add the export.

452
01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:10,710
But it will always be point five to the power of the number of miles.

453
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:17,690
You. Look.

454
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:32,840
No. We are going to evaluate which value oscillator would give us the highest score.

455
01:05:33,590 --> 01:05:37,310
So we're going to do the calculations for the lot score.

456
01:05:37,370 --> 01:05:42,110
Assuming theta equals zero, assuming theta equals point one.

457
01:05:43,930 --> 01:05:55,649
20.3%. So let's do it.

458
01:05:55,650 --> 01:06:01,469
Maybe for the Queen, one zero would be for this one.

459
01:06:01,470 --> 01:06:06,930
Probably be more challenging. You guys want to try that together?

460
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:12,480
So that's point one. So I'm going to solve the point one.

461
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:31,050
Remember the last time is. So I'm going to fill in one.

462
01:06:33,290 --> 01:06:36,710
491.

463
01:07:02,580 --> 01:07:46,190
Try it out. If you get an answer, just.

464
01:08:18,820 --> 01:08:32,760
This. If we.

465
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:52,390
Anyway. Jim, question can you point to one thing?

466
01:08:54,070 --> 01:08:59,770
Yeah. Yep. So the answer would be point to two.

467
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:07,850
Now, the good news is like it's good to practice those probabilities by hand.

468
01:09:08,380 --> 01:09:12,670
But in the. If you go under.

469
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:20,760
Here. Linkage analysis is a table or log score, which helps.

470
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:25,600
Figure it out though. So the whole lifetime.

471
01:09:25,770 --> 01:09:30,849
But at least that's what let's go through. I know what you prefer.

472
01:09:30,850 --> 01:09:36,580
The table or the cancelation plan. It's not as easy as it's not as hard as it looks.

473
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:47,050
So this table will give us the lowest score under different assumptions or different some of these structures.

474
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:51,400
So let's go look at our family here. We have.

475
01:09:52,610 --> 01:10:01,130
Five children. And we're unfazed situation so we don't know if it's for recombinant one recombinant or the other way around.

476
01:10:02,570 --> 01:10:05,690
So you would go on to this table.

477
01:10:05,780 --> 01:10:09,650
So you have number of children? I have five.

478
01:10:12,260 --> 01:10:15,860
Okay. You see it.

479
01:10:16,690 --> 01:10:21,800
So I have five. And I.

480
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:26,450
So this. This top part here is when you.

481
01:10:26,690 --> 01:10:36,140
When you have the face. No. So you know for sure you have five non recombinant, zero recombinant and then you would go and say let's.

482
01:10:36,650 --> 01:10:41,960
The question you ask is asking to evaluate theta at point one.

483
01:10:42,470 --> 01:10:50,900
So you would go down here and get the log score for this kind of family at this value of data.

484
01:10:51,650 --> 01:10:59,060
So clear. Okay. So in our case, we are evaluating five children.

485
01:10:59,810 --> 01:11:05,690
Phase is unknown. So at this part here, this is one phase is unknown.

486
01:11:06,050 --> 01:11:12,710
Okay. So we have C for one. So it can be four recombinant 119, recombinant the other way around.

487
01:11:13,250 --> 01:11:18,080
And then the one we just solved was for theta one.

488
01:11:18,410 --> 01:11:21,620
So I'm going to read here Z for one.

489
01:11:22,310 --> 01:11:26,080
And this is the point. Oh, two, two and five.

490
01:11:27,170 --> 01:11:32,960
So it all together. Then this is the log score at the start of point one.

491
01:11:34,490 --> 01:11:40,590
Exactly how to use the table. Yeah.

492
01:11:44,110 --> 01:11:49,749
So generally with phase known and unknown, it will tell us if it's in Phase II.

493
01:11:49,750 --> 01:11:55,120
Do we assume it's phase unknown and the success rate? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

494
01:11:56,810 --> 01:12:05,060
Okay. So let's let's quickly look up the remaining log scores.

495
01:12:05,270 --> 01:12:10,950
So like that question. So we got point one here, .02.

496
01:12:11,390 --> 01:12:14,480
So let's look at Lost or zero.

497
01:12:15,050 --> 01:12:18,260
So I'm going to look at five, score one.

498
01:12:18,260 --> 01:12:25,430
And then it is this one is the zero theta is what, negative and negative infinity.

499
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:50,220
4.206.124.

500
01:12:52,450 --> 01:13:06,380
You practice doing the the. And then point three is .095 and.

501
01:13:08,940 --> 01:13:21,730
Now. So these overlords course. And the next question is asking what is the maximum likelihood estimate of theta and its associated LTT score?

502
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:26,690
So now we're going to choose the data that maximizes the lot score.

503
01:13:26,710 --> 01:13:34,780
So the biggest value of lots for which is point 1 to 4 and the associated theta is 0.2.

504
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:45,820
So the maximum likelihood estimate of theta is point two and the log score for that is point 1 to 4.

505
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:51,640
So what that means is, is we assume a theta of 0.2.

506
01:13:52,210 --> 01:13:59,170
And this is the kind of highest probability that you would observe this pedigree.

507
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:05,170
And then if we go by trying to interpret, what does that mean about linkage,

508
01:14:05,830 --> 01:14:20,049
remember that for the lots where we're looking at more than three or 33 and higher for evidence of linkage and point 1 to 4 is way below that.

509
01:14:20,050 --> 01:14:23,470
So what would we what do we conclude about linkage?

510
01:14:25,270 --> 01:14:31,930
No significance either. Yeah. So it's not there's no no evidence.

511
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:38,410
Not not enough evidence. Not evidence of significant linkage.

512
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:55,189
And yeah, so the value of theater indicates like if it's between 0.5, there could be linkage.

513
01:14:55,190 --> 01:14:59,360
But the LOD score is the probability that there actually is this family.

514
01:14:59,810 --> 01:15:09,950
Yeah. The Lord score is like a test of significance because the like it's like a square, like we're trying to test if this is significant.

515
01:15:10,310 --> 01:15:13,310
Okay. Yeah. Well,

516
01:15:13,340 --> 01:15:26,690
the only thing kind of left in this section like to introduce is that remember how we said that we we're not just looking at one category with most,

517
01:15:26,690 --> 01:15:34,219
that is, we collect information from multiple pedigrees and we'll work through this section next time.

518
01:15:34,220 --> 01:15:44,150
But if we have another family, we can add the lot scores across families and we do that at the same level of data.

519
01:15:45,110 --> 01:15:58,470
So if we the next part is asking us to look at the log score for this family and I'll just fill it in so that we have it somewhere for me,

520
01:15:58,820 --> 01:16:11,180
I'll post the solution to this, but we can add we do add the considering both pedigrees, we can add up the log score.

521
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:18,559
So here would be .27, 6.3, two, three, one, two, two, two.

522
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:23,629
And then if we're looking at both pedigrees, then we, we add those.

523
01:16:23,630 --> 01:16:35,930
So at point one, it would be point two, seven, six and 9.022, and you would do that for each value of theta.

524
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:44,240
So of course the solution for you to look at and we can talk more about it next time.

525
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:54,200
Chinese.
