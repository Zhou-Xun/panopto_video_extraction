00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:13,150
Imagine that spring is coming and I need a good rain jacket.

2
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:16,840
I found two that I like in the store and was deciding between them.

3
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:22,330
Both jackets were on sale for 20% off, but the first jacket I found was $50,

4
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:30,670
whereas the second jacket cost $200 as a percentage, the sale is the same, but in absolute dollars saved.

5
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:35,379
There'd be a really big difference between the two coats for the first jacket.

6
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:40,930
I've only saved $10, whereas the second jacket I would save $40.

7
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:47,710
This goes to show that how different two values looks really depends on the scale that you choose to evaluate it.

8
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:52,510
Effect modification is no different in this video.

9
00:00:52,510 --> 00:01:00,639
I'm going to start by revisiting the notion of what an additive and multiplicative measure of association looks like all

10
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:07,630
then show you how effect modification appears when using a multiplicative scale versus an additive scale of association.

11
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:14,860
And finally, I'll wrap up by talking about when people tend to use additive versus multiplicative measures.

12
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:25,210
So just as with jackets, we can and often use two different measures of association to understand the impacts of an exposure on an outcome.

13
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:33,490
You've seen these before and likely recall that we have an additive and multiplicative scale to compare disease frequency,

14
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:37,330
be it incidence proportions, incidence rates or prevalence.

15
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:43,809
And we do this between groups. For first option, we assess differences in disease,

16
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:50,950
frequency and absolute terms by subtracting the disease frequency in the unexposed from the exposed group.

17
00:01:51,700 --> 00:02:00,190
This is shown on the left where for example, the disease frequency in the exposed is five units larger than that of the unexposed.

18
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,540
In the second type of measure, we use a relative scale,

19
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:11,530
meaning that what we do is we divide the disease frequency among the exposed by that of the unexposed.

20
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,580
So here, instead of reporting a five unit increase,

21
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:23,320
we would report that the frequency in the exposed is two times or 100% larger than that of the unexposed.

22
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,290
Because of this difference in scale,

23
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:34,980
you're going to see the presence or absence of effect modification differently depending on what measure of association you're using.

24
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:37,360
In the next few slides,

25
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:45,500
I'm going to walk you through these exact scenarios to get a sense as to when effect modifications occurring on each scale of association.

26
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:55,489
Taking the first scenario, you likely recall from the last video that there was no evidence of effect modification on the additive scale

27
00:02:55,490 --> 00:03:03,649
here because the difference between the risk for the exposed and the unexposed is 30 independent of the level Z,

28
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,240
which was our effect modifier.

29
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:15,890
However, if we look at this exact same data now using a relative scale, there is indeed effect modification on the multiplicative scale.

30
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:21,020
Let's now change our graphic and we look at this one.

31
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:26,959
You may recall from the last video that this did show evidence of effect modification on the

32
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:33,620
additive scale since the risk difference due to exposure is 60 among those in the Z positive group,

33
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,010
but only 30 among those in the Z negative group.

34
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:42,980
However, when we think about the same exact data on the multiplicative scale,

35
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:53,270
we see now that there's no evidence of effect modification because the risk ratio due to exposure is four among those with Z positive and Z negative.

36
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:59,780
So just to summarize in the graphic, you saw that in the first scenario,

37
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:05,810
we had no effect modification on the additive scale, but we did have effect modification on the multiplicative scale.

38
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:12,620
And in the figure on the right, we had effect modification on the additive scale, but not on the multiplicative scale.

39
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:23,360
So given that we see different answers on different scales, it raises a very important question as to what scale should we be using,

40
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,270
and especially what do we do when we get these different answers.

41
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:36,589
Practically speaking, most epidemiologists who are analyzing binary outcomes are really modeling using either logistic or binomial models,

42
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:44,450
which imply multiplicative associations. As a result, this is most often how people will look at interaction.

43
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:51,200
That said, additive scales are also commonly used and they're used in settings when we're

44
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:56,270
trying to assess the true population health burden of some kind of exposure,

45
00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:01,190
or sometimes if we're looking for improvements in health as a result of interventions.

46
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:08,659
Now the reason that people like additive scales for this particular kind of analysis is that it's actually getting

47
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:14,600
at the true numbers of people and inherently captures the prevalence of the risk factor in the population.

48
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:22,790
So in summary, the key takeaways for this particular video are that effect modification is scale dependent

49
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:28,250
and the decision of which scale you want to report should really be decided by the science.
