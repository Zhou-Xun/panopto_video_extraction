1
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:12,060
Okay. So last time we almost review everything our measurement error.

2
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:21,670
I have a few more things that are just kind of like to remind you that a correction for human error can be more complicated than we saw.

3
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:29,780
And then I will, because some of the corrections, you don't need to kind of mind your own models,

4
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,470
but there are already packages and macros that will do that.

5
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:42,260
So what we are going to do today is that I'm going to show you the basics of SAS macros, so then you can use those macros in the future if you need.

6
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:51,080
And also if you want to kind of like try your small kind of like my question, your own, have you have you try to do macros on your own?

7
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:58,730
And of, you know, okay. So then that that would be good because then it won't be like something early, you know,

8
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:05,570
and then we will leave all the rest of the time of the class to kind of like focus on the mundane assignment.

9
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,020
So then I will be here for any questions. Okay.

10
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:16,520
So. So on top of correcting for the main exposure,

11
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:24,560
I actually happens that also confounders are variables the same as postures and everything is measured with error.

12
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:31,300
Right. So then the problem is that when you have ever seen the measurement of confounding there,

13
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:35,480
that can distort the relative risk estimates in any direction.

14
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:44,600
Right. This is what we call procedural. Confounding by some vertical confounding is due to either because the confounders

15
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,960
are measured with error and therefore the adjustment is not verified,

16
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:53,150
which is always the case because we know that everything is measure with error or because there are

17
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:58,490
major confounders that we have not adjusting for local finding is because of those two things.

18
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:05,550
And residual confounding is something that is kind of like a well known limitation of additional studies.

19
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:06,770
So it will always be there.

20
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:16,430
So whenever you see any association in the results, you always have to kind of lie think that it could be due to the funding.

21
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:25,520
I mean, they something that you can never rule out. Okay. And there are also methods that they can take an error in in each of their model and the

22
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:30,020
correlation of errors between the errors in the confounders and the errors in them.

23
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:38,980
But again, this is beyond the scope of this course. But just for you to kind of like realize that the the topic is is more complex, right?

24
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:52,550
So there are many more things. So so the issue is that when you have kind of like the errors are kind of like related.

25
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:58,309
When you have a I mean, when you are trying to do I'm sorry, I'm moving to another topic.

26
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:01,580
So the idea is that when you when you have measurement error,

27
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:07,000
we have seen that you can correct this with a calibration, kind of like a two step calibration.

28
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:17,899
But the problem also is that sometimes when you are doing that calibration, you are assuming that you are calibrating your surrogate measure,

29
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:27,290
that you know that it has error with that ideally gold standard, something that is really measure the the whatever you are measuring implicitly.

30
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:32,900
Right. And we know that unfortunately that that's not true most of the time, particularly in diet.

31
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:38,840
Right. I mean, we know that there is no gold standard in diet. So our true measure is also an imperfect measure.

32
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:47,540
Right. So when we are using the we are using our measured in the few in our study to see if there is any association with a nutrient and an outcome.

33
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:51,810
And we know it has evolved. So then we use a small calibration,

34
00:03:51,830 --> 00:04:00,319
a study where we ask people also 24 hour recall for the 24 hour recall of repeated dietary records to get the true estimate.

35
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:06,979
But we know that 24 hour records and dietary records, even though they are better, they're more accurate, they are not really a gold standard.

36
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:15,440
They also have error. Right. They are an imperfect measure. So and we know also because we have seen that before.

37
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,769
Right. That on top of not being a perfect measure,

38
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:26,060
also the errors in the dietary the other dietary method like the 24 hour records so that

39
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,129
they are the records are usually correlated with the errors in the in the fifth year.

40
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:34,700
So then the calibration is not that that perfect, right.

41
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:42,470
So so that's what I mean when I say if the errors in the true and surrogate measure myself correlated, then you will get some bias.

42
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:49,210
And this bias is believed to have low impact. So it's kind of like you always have bias in epidemiology, right?

43
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,560
I mean, it doesn't matter what you do, there is always bias.

44
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,060
So your job is to make sure that that bias is minimal, right?

45
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:04,070
Because if the bias is low, at least you can feel confident about your results.

46
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,520
But the device is large. Then you don't feel confident, right? How do you know that?

47
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:15,030
Well, I mean, it depends. I mean, sometimes it's sometimes that the you know, because of the of the substantive topic,

48
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:18,569
then you may know that, oh, yeah, there's a role here that is not really terrible.

49
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:25,740
However, because you have experience with that particular tool or with a particular measure or whatever.

50
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:32,060
Right. Um, so in any case, I mean, there are also ways around that problem of the correlated errors.

51
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:40,440
And then there's this triangulation approach which is something kind of like in the same idea of what you did for the biomarkers,

52
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,040
kind of like the methods of trials that, you know, basically the same is a different thing,

53
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,219
but it's kind of like you use another method to triangulate.

54
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:53,910
So that way you kind of like come up with with something that wasn't a calibration that would result in any bias.

55
00:05:54,270 --> 00:06:00,600
But again, this is beyond the scope. So I'm just telling you, because this is another problem that can happen.

56
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:10,140
So the the issues that this kind of like correction for error using calibration studies may be very

57
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:14,970
complicated is when we use very simple models in class that those are the ones that you're using the same as.

58
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:20,069
But you can use models that are more complex and probably closer to the truth.

59
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:28,430
Because I mean, with the calibration variation, you're assuming that kind of like the, the variable is related linearly, right?

60
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:34,900
So that it's only there's kind of like the the bias is always kind of like systematic in this same kind of like amount.

61
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,940
Okay. But that may not be true, right?

62
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:47,069
So there may be kind of like all that type of of error that is not the same all over the range of the order of the measure.

63
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:58,590
Right. So because of that, there are kind of like many macros and packages that can use more complex models to correct for measurement ever.

64
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:07,889
And then I but there are a few this are actually kind of like all I'm sure that there are more now that are kind of like public,

65
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:11,520
maybe more advanced and these are actually a little more kind of like advanced.

66
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,040
And then macros for those. There are also packages in this data.

67
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:19,860
There are also packages in are definitely so. There are I mean, whatever you need, you need it.

68
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:23,100
I mean, is there to just Google it and I'm sure you will find it.

69
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:32,910
But the idea is that for SAS, which is where we are using those things are in the form of access model.

70
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:39,150
Right. And what is the SAS macros as macros just like a template that you can use.

71
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:46,379
So when you have like I mean you can program or your goal or if you have kind of like some type of code that

72
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:51,780
you want to run over and over and over and over instead of being kind of like that being all the time,

73
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:57,059
the same goal with changing the variables, you can create that macro,

74
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:03,600
that type of template that you can just kind of like have about and then invoke for your program.

75
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:13,530
And then you will see what I mean about invoking. So, so there are two main situations in which you may find very useful to use macros.

76
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:24,630
One is the one that I came up with this issue here is that when you have no idea how to do something that is relatively complex,

77
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:31,850
but someone else has created a nice macro for you, like for example, splice, which is kind of like Sam's model to make it.

78
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:38,159
That is complex. That is how micro for that or correcting for measurement error using very complex kind of like models.

79
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:47,160
That is a macro for that. Right? So so the only thing you don't need to kind of like call that because someone else has already done it.

80
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:51,510
So the only thing that you need to do is to take that and then make sure that you

81
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:56,490
input the correct variables and then the macro will give you the correct results.

82
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:03,630
Right. So the only thing that you need to do is know how to save that macro, compile it and invoke it.

83
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:12,900
Right. And that's what I'm going to show you now. The second thing is that you can even start doing your own kind of like simple tiny macros.

84
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:21,570
And this is when you have to do some simple procedure or set of procedures that you have to do them over and over and over and over.

85
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:30,390
So rather than I mean, it may be just three steps like Lizzie, one data step, one block and then another block.

86
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:36,600
But still you have to do like 20 times. Then your parents may be awful, right?

87
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:47,310
And you have to I mean, you usually copy and paste and then you replace the the variables in your template, but that's very prone to error.

88
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:56,280
So you can kind of like put that piece of code in a macro, then it will be easier to just call the macro and then that will do this.

89
00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:03,030
Is there no like a for loop? And so well, I mean, no, not really.

90
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:07,880
I mean, the loops they loops can be as. Inside. Magnus took every big thing sober and all.

91
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:10,490
Yeah, when I would be the over. I know what I mean.

92
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:17,620
For example, the way you've been doing with actually the assignment that is the 18 year old Magnus for the blog.

93
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,240
Right. For the receivables, which is only one product. Right.

94
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:26,929
So but instead of kind of like maybe four lines of code, you will have just one like the one that evokes the macro.

95
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:32,550
But there's no loop there that you run your copy the macro again, you you could do it in a loop, definitely.

96
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:39,680
But yeah. So so for that, for doing this, you need to know a little bit of macro language,

97
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,940
which is not I mean, the one that I'm going to show you today is very basic.

98
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:52,040
I mean, we are not going to really very sophisticated programing, programing, language issues.

99
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,060
Okay. So so these are the fancy macros like for example,

100
00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:05,750
like copy are kind of like this is actually not the not the macro policy, but the kind of like how you invoke the macro.

101
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:13,099
So this is kind of like like the first part of the or the macro and those are all the parameters that you can input into the macro.

102
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:21,590
And then you can see that it has kind of like this comment that it tells you exactly which parameter to have you.

103
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:28,120
So when you have and this one, this is the one for Splice, then this one has,

104
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:33,260
I don't know, like maybe six pages of code below that will do all sorts of things.

105
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:40,669
So for that one, the first thing that you have to make sure is that you need to understand where you are doing it clearly,

106
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:45,370
because this is one of those examples that garbage in, garbage in, garbage out.

107
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,390
Right. So you are you don't know what you are doing.

108
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:55,590
You are not going to impute the correct in the variables that you need to adequately, and then you will get notice.

109
00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:04,610
Right? So you need to understand what you are doing. At least then all this kind of like fancy complex macros or with gun with macro documentation.

110
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:11,089
So then that will come with kind of like some document that will tell you exactly what the macro is doing,

111
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:14,650
how is doing and what was the meaning of every parameter imputing.

112
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:24,200
So something really doing that carefully and then you know how to use the macro and then also many times some macros call all their macros.

113
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,190
So then inside one macro, the macro will call another macro.

114
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:32,270
If you don't have it, then your macro you're not going to work.

115
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:37,309
So when reading the documentation, make sure that you understand that that's happening.

116
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:41,960
Make sure to gather all the macros you need. You will need the macro, but also the macros that is calling.

117
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:46,069
Right. So that happens a lot. Okay.

118
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:52,030
So now let's look at the really kind of like basic concepts of the macro.

119
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:56,990
So, so this is an example of a really, really simple macro, right?

120
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:00,400
And what I thought you said a macro is just like a template.

121
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:05,420
So it is SAS code and it is the same source code that you're using but in the form of a template.

122
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:06,410
Right.

123
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:18,460
So then what happens is that the macro will start with kind of like that percentage macro thing, so that that's kind of like all my precious stuff.

124
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:24,980
So that's telling says, Oh, this is a macro, right? And then it will finish with that percentage.

125
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:28,940
So those are the beginning and end of the macro, right?

126
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:37,579
And then after that kind of like percentage macro, I mean, you can see that you have this is the name of the macro.

127
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:40,580
In this case, I call it this for distribution.

128
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:48,260
You can call my macro whatever you want. And then in parentheses, you had the key parameters that you're going to pass to the macro.

129
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,810
Okay. So then in this situation, I, I'm using that like the data and the like.

130
00:13:54,200 --> 00:14:00,680
And again, those things are things that you can call whatever you want, but clearly call them something that people can recognize.

131
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:08,580
Let's see if I put in here. Then people will think like, Oh, this must be the name of the that I said that I'm going to use if I'm putting here.

132
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:15,480
One of these must be the name of the variable and then you could call them going to make that.

133
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:21,230
I got it in Johnson Right. But no one is going to know what the what you mean, right?

134
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:25,520
So it's going to like use names that are recognizable, right.

135
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,930
So then what happened in this macro is that you look at the what I'm kind of everything here,

136
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:38,030
this is just like you're gonna you forget about be kind of like some of the weird things like yourself.

137
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:43,730
You can see here that these are going to stay. Right. And then you can see here that I have this creating variables.

138
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,409
And then one variable, unless you've seen the transformation in the other model,

139
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:56,420
I'm using a square root transformation in your model and using kind of like power to the to the power measure of it.

140
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:05,280
So I'm going to mean that they stay in the in the model and then I'm running a of univariate with the reason why.

141
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:11,820
And there free new special. That's why I was calling this macro this because what I'm doing is this.

142
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:22,239
Let's look at this variable. Let's do the three most common transformations and let's take the distribution of those transformations.

143
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,380
So I see which one is more normal. Right. So let's say that what this macro is for.

144
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,340
So it's a simple magnitude to check for normality. Right?

145
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:37,770
So everything there is something that you recognize the circle of, like there are steps and probably univariate that you recognize,

146
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:46,230
but there are some kind of like things like re-emphasizing that you're not you don't know what they mean, but it's okay when they do what they are.

147
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:56,790
Right. So so those ampersand actually where we know by macro whatever.

148
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,970
So my pull variable to start with that symbol, right.

149
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:06,540
And basically what happened is that whatever you kind of like put here,

150
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:15,810
whatever you put here then says is going to look at basically the ampersand and is going to substitute by the thing that you put here.

151
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:22,980
Right. So when you want to run this macro in a way said that is called, I don't know, first,

152
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:32,150
then sass is going to look at what do I have in the macro, the ampersand dataframe and then what I call the ampersand there.

153
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:39,270
I think I'm going to put first because I put here first they simply dividing the variable is be one.

154
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:43,200
For example, this stuff is going to look up. What do I have?

155
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:48,150
Emphasize that and I'm going to give you that. This is just this material like like string of characters.

156
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:53,550
I mean, instead of the ampersand, like you would put the B one big one B might be what want.

157
00:16:53,610 --> 00:17:04,140
So then that way you can instead of kind of like copy and paste in your own variables and your own name of the that I said,

158
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:07,170
SAS is doing that for you and then it will run the whole thing.

159
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:13,830
Okay. So, so before we go into more detail about how to do that,

160
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:24,890
there are three ways that you can kind of like store and reduce the macro and that will depend on the type of use that you want to do.

161
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,990
I mean, for the one that we will use today, you will use the first one,

162
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:33,660
which is the temporary use that basically you just have your macro in your program, you just run it.

163
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:37,070
And this is what what we call compiling.

164
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,360
So when you run it, then it will get into the memory, into the memory of that section.

165
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:48,510
Right. So then basically says will recognize the macro and then you can use it in that current session.

166
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:55,589
So this is the same as with temporary addresses. The only issues are once us it, then it won't be stored.

167
00:17:55,590 --> 00:18:00,419
So you have to run it. Every time is the same as the library. You had to run it every time you want to use it.

168
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:06,570
If you use this, this approach, this first approach, okay, now you want this,

169
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:12,360
this is something that you're going to use all the time then is better to store it, right?

170
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:20,430
So then for yourself, for permanent use, for yourself, what you have to do actually is to create a library for your macros,

171
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:28,530
the same as you created a library for you to research. So you have to create a library for your macros to test my permanent in my grocery store here

172
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:34,650
because your macros are just kind of like a fine access file where you have the all the code,

173
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:44,680
right? So then if I, if you kind of like create that, then you can the first thing, the options, the same thing where to look for those macros.

174
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:52,859
I mean, you still have to compile them at least once, right? So you have to open that file, run it with an option of store.

175
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:57,749
I'm not going into a lot of details here because we want to do that here today.

176
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:03,750
But so, you know, for the future and then once it's gone by once because it's a permanent file and you have your library,

177
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:07,110
then site will recognize them every time you open source.

178
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:18,389
Right. So you don't have to run them again. And finally and this is probably go to use this ever is when you're working with a group

179
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:23,490
of users and you are sharing macros and then you have some static on the facility.

180
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:31,709
This this is usually this is mostly used when when when you run when you're working on Unix environment or kind of like a

181
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:36,930
different kind of like a large you know that I know this is doable and things like that but this one you should I mean,

182
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,580
you probably want to use the one that we're going to use to adjust the temporary use.

183
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:45,180
So we will just run it in the moment. Okay.

184
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:49,580
So so this is this is the second one, right?

185
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:59,370
So then the second one for by my name, you, you have to book you have to create your library for me, for your macro and for you my macros.

186
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:05,210
And then it would be in that box. And then in the options you have to book and store presence.

187
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:10,110
My right. So you have to say to somebody wants to vote for us.

188
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:16,650
I'm saving some macros and then my library for those matters is called my marriage.

189
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:23,190
Okay, so you run that, then these one, and then when you run for the first time,

190
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,900
you had to put these last stops and then it would be compiled and safe, permanent.

191
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:39,060
And then you arrive, and then you just leave it there. What it is in some physical directory, in your computer or in the globe.

192
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:45,240
And then and then when you run a program where you want to use that macro,

193
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:53,460
you use these two lines and they begin to you that you don't have to copy this because this has already been compiled and safe.

194
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:58,680
Okay. But again, this is the second approach that you can use in the future, if only.

195
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:03,150
But today we're only going to use the first one. Okay.

196
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:16,230
Okay. So now they issues that you look at this and you say, okay, but you are telling me that I'm saving space by a specific length of code, right?

197
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:23,010
So by the issues that you have the same length of goal, you are not using, you are not going to use macros.

198
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:28,709
You are going to I mean, you will take these and then copy for another variable and then copy that.

199
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:30,340
If I know that on the road, I know that.

200
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:38,430
But when you are using method, you only need once this template and this would be either in your program if it's temporary or not,

201
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:47,250
even in your program will be safe if it's permanent. Because now the only thing that you need to do is kind of like this length to invoke the macro.

202
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:55,950
So then invoking the macro node that you just need the percentage, the name of the macro.

203
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:58,080
Now you can put the macro, the macro.

204
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:04,200
That's when you have the event when you're invoking the Haskell, a percentage based mechanism for the macro here.

205
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:12,479
And then the parameter you have to kind of like right now, because now you want or you want to run this,

206
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,530
you want size to have something to see that program, right?

207
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:20,850
So this situation, I want to do this in, then I say that is the missing.

208
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:24,970
So this is the library. And I will do this without.

209
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:29,490
I will. That is be free, right? If I run, that will happen.

210
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:42,880
Is that this is how the model looks like and this is what is going to happen when you run this line.

211
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,799
But you won't see this. So these guys will do that.

212
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:53,470
And then what you can see is that will happen. I'm going to use some kind of like clause.

213
00:22:56,350 --> 00:23:04,210
Well, I could better then be satisfied to look at their personal data because of their microbiome.

214
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:09,230
And then it's going to substitute that by whatever I eat them.

215
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:18,520
This is what we think. And then what I put right.

216
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:27,099
So this stuff is going to look at the person, but and is going to substitute that with whatever I said,

217
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:35,930
which is very similar to what we now know that here I was using this ampersand by the end of December.

218
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:43,000
This is true because that is the way that you can join string character.

219
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:46,780
So then what I want to start is to come up with this really deeply and quickly.

220
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:50,260
So this is just kind of like one way of doing that. Right.

221
00:23:50,920 --> 00:24:03,999
So then basically from my family using these two things, I come up with a recognizable circle that I can run on my own.

222
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,460
But you don't have to get the sausage back to do it for you.

223
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:15,459
Where I'm using would be three in the that I said then that meeting to look at I need to create three whatever there are going

224
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:21,210
to be three different kind of like transformations and then I going to check that additional measure and appropriate about it.

225
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:29,320
And the nice thing is that, okay, I'm doing this for one, but now that is like a template I got.

226
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,639
This is what I would tell you, what I was telling you about the concatenation.

227
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,600
So kind of like says uses this dot to concatenate the strings of this.

228
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:43,720
Okay. So now you can run the macro over and over.

229
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:48,009
So then I can run it in the center of it for the electricity.

230
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:56,889
And if you want it to six and so many and now you can see that you have safe God because remember there was a this piece of code that was not there.

231
00:24:56,890 --> 00:25:05,350
I mean, I just have to invoke one line and then SAS will give me the results of this for everybody.

232
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:09,249
I will just running one line. And of course, this is a very simple one.

233
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:17,320
That is this is not a big deal. But if you have like a considerable long size goal,

234
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:27,200
then you will see that you're saving a lot of kind of like space and effort and also less prone to ever because one day once they the macro,

235
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:33,219
you make sure that is running well, then you know that you are not going to make mistakes by replacing that.

236
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:36,250
Oh, I forgot to replace this one. I forgot to replace this one.

237
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:41,920
I mean, is going to replace that where you reassess this and make those type of mistakes?

238
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:50,950
Okay. So this is kind of like a useful thing that you can try and we will try today.

239
00:25:52,450 --> 00:26:01,450
So, so the last thing going back to the measurement error and then I'll give you most of the time

240
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:08,800
to work on the on the today is like if measurement error is relatively easy to correct,

241
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:15,000
at least using the I mean, the, the fact that the models where you are simple doesn't mean that they are wrong.

242
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:19,300
I mean, they're perfectly fine. So you could kind of like always be correct information and error, right?

243
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:23,020
So why do you think that is not corrected more often?

244
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:29,799
Because it's not it's not that often that you see kind of like in in the studies published.

245
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:40,300
That is the correction. Yeah, it's on the slides but there are validation studies that show that this you have been validated or whatever.

246
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:49,810
Mm hmm. Yeah, but I mean, the fact has been validated by still we know that in measures with error, why people don't correct for error.

247
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:56,620
I mean, value validity the same 100% validity.

248
00:26:56,620 --> 00:27:00,760
And remembering the additionality. We are we have very low standards.

249
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:09,459
So actually we are okay with small correlations. So basically because there are not validation studies.

250
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:12,790
There are calibration studies, actually. So it's not that easy.

251
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:19,120
I mean, you have to invest extra money and extra time to do those calibration studies.

252
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,840
So so many people don't will have time or resources to do.

253
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:26,340
Right. So that's that's additional ways not corrected so often.

254
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:37,870
Okay. So then the last thing is that what we were doing when we were correcting for systematic error,

255
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:41,620
we were correcting first emetic error that was non differential between groups.

256
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:47,679
Remember. So imagine that you have cases and controls that that systematic error we were saying that was not differential,

257
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,950
I mean it was systematic, but it was the same for cases and controls.

258
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:57,490
Now when, when you have systematic error, that is differential.

259
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:04,270
So basically what you have is you either have selection bias or you even have information bias, right?

260
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:07,820
So in those situations, actually, there is nothing you can do.

261
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:14,380
Actually, those are the worst type of kind of like error that you can have one day when there is differential,

262
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:19,060
the bias divide is going to be corrected because.

263
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:27,810
Because there's no no, no, no. That's not something that I mean, the that there's no method that you can apply.

264
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:32,890
I mean, basically the methods that we have is for either random error or systematic error that is not differential.

265
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:39,640
So in this situation, where you have to do is to make sure that you don't have selection bias or you don't have information bias.

266
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:44,740
So these are things that are treated mostly at the design stage, right?

267
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:47,200
When you are designing your study,

268
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:53,790
you have to make sure that the selection bias is going to be minimal and information bias is going to remain basically.

269
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:59,740
And of course, again, there is always some potential for selection bias that shows any potential potential bias.

270
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:03,730
But if that's minimal, then it won't really affect the results terribly.

271
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:07,059
Remember, bias. Bias sounds terrible, right?

272
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:12,070
I you using like. Oh, I have bias. Yeah, we always have bias, but as long as the bias is not huge,

273
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:18,640
then I think it's okay because if they by a small basically is not really going to change terribly their conclusions.

274
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:26,320
One thing that people do to approach this type of bias is to do a lot of sensitivity analysis.

275
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:32,200
So when you can and I think that you may have some type of selection bias is one type of information bias.

276
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:40,030
You kind of like repeat the analysis changing your kind of like your assumptions, like, for example,

277
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:46,030
you are excluding you're not excluding patients and they don't know who have certain issues or whatever.

278
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:53,950
And then suddenly you feel, well, maybe that will be kind of like, you know, that will be upsetting, resulting in some selection bias.

279
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:58,470
Then you can repeat the results by excluding them or including them.

280
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,860
I mean, depends on what you have actually as well by sure.

281
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:08,770
Kind of like you do that because without without people or without without kind of like something that you can see that it's introducing bias.

282
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:15,760
And then if you repeat the analysis and then you see similar results, then you feel like, well, maybe it's not a big deal.

283
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:22,930
Maybe kind of like you are by repeating, by doing many sensitivity analysis, you're showing that your shows are relatively robust.

284
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:28,480
Right. So that's that's the way of kind of like you have no correcting for anything if there is anything.

285
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,660
But unless you feel like well, I mean, probably not that terrible, right?

286
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:44,060
Another way of doing things is kind of like trying to think about the worst case scenario on the best case scenario and then feel you.

287
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:48,220
You may sometimes estimate your results in those situations.

288
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,739
And then in theory,

289
00:30:50,740 --> 00:31:00,549
if you're kind of like if your results lie in-between and kind of like you feel like even the worst of the best is not that far away,

290
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:09,260
then maybe it's okay, right? Kind of like feeling like, well, maybe it's still having kind of like pressures that are valid enough, right?

291
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:12,790
But again, I mean, there's not much you can do.

292
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:17,499
So just try to avoid that at the same stage. Okay.

293
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:25,629
So bottom line with measurement error is that you have to live with measurement error and kind of like tolerate it in that way,

294
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:30,190
particularly for nutritional epidemiology is because diet is measure with a lot of error.

295
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:34,299
So, so there are ways of correcting that.

296
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:42,790
A sentence is not the perfect correction, but at least kind of like I mean,

297
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:49,239
at least as long as you interpret things carefully and kind of like with caution, then it's okay, right?

298
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,450
So kind of like don't make a big deal about some sentence,

299
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:59,620
some associations if you think that bias is kind of like, gosh, in those associations, right?

300
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:04,660
Or be that way, we are always very careful. Like we never say, Oh, this is associated.

301
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:10,129
And I say this, maybe we use a lot of kind of like very, you know,

302
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:15,920
may Google and things like that because we are not always very sure when we are working with a situation I studies,

303
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:20,090
there are so many sources of bias that we are not really sure that we we know the truth.

304
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:26,570
Right. So that's why we are unconscious. And that was I mean, I like the the the joke.

305
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:31,330
I mean, there's a statistician there, but it could be also an epidemiologist.

306
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:36,680
So kind of like so long as you have a confidence interval.

307
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:42,320
Right. Anyway, okay. So in love bar.

308
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:47,180
So. So you can there are two parts.

309
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:57,060
One is that the this part is not going to be graded unless you want to go for the second part for this.

310
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:00,530
So the first question is not really because you don't have to do anything.

311
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:07,530
You just have to kind of like go to the link and check. I mean that's that's done at people months on website because she is no longer

312
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:10,670
that horrible but she still has that link and that's always still there.

313
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,790
And you will check for silver for measurement error,

314
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:21,379
misclassification correlation and then you check some of the some of the of their materials and some of the documentation.

315
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:26,500
You don't need to read it in that. Just I just want you to kind of like get familiar on how,

316
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:31,009
how people can apply both those materials and to see the documentation so that you

317
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:36,240
can see all the tons of information that you can get or not on that complex model.

318
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:39,470
Right. So then just just check that quickly and browse it.

319
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:46,069
And then the second part is that I would like you, if you want to do this, is going to be extra credit.

320
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:53,060
So you're gonna have to do it. You don't want to do it, that's fine. But if you want to do it in a already, then I'll give you the strategy.

321
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:59,959
So to create your own macro, to adjust for total energy intake and you have to just kind of like use the code.

322
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:05,930
Let me show you then let me go through there.

323
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:20,010
So. Yeah.

324
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:29,320
So this is this is the code that we have been using for for getting the rest of right.

325
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:33,580
So, I mean, we're not adjusting that. What would you like to see?

326
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:38,630
What I just want you to convert this, you know, macro.

327
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,930
So it's a very, really short piece of gold. So it's not a big year.

328
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:52,249
So basically what you have here is that you have been able to that I think for me maybe you not that make one out of this gold around the planet,

329
00:34:52,250 --> 00:35:00,559
basically out of everything. And then and then you have kind of like body and whatever they might have in your body.

330
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:05,990
All right. I mean, you can just come up with any solution that you think that it will work.

331
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,639
It doesn't have to be the most elegant one as long as it works is.

332
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,750
Okay. Okay. So and.

333
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:22,240
And I'll be here for the whole year. So don't worry if and again, this is a rate you need to do you want.

334
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:33,440
Okay. So the idea is that now we can go back to the now you can start working on the so many of you.

335
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:38,809
I, I believe that last time we left it that you were not able to complete it right.

336
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:41,810
The first part of your body, whatever you do is right.

337
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:49,669
How are you doing with the first part? They're still working on that.

338
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:50,989
Right. Okay.

339
00:35:50,990 --> 00:36:04,760
So you want to go back to buy one and then start working in person, then I'll be here to kind of like hug you and then and then at some point,

340
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:08,389
I mean, we will have a break because you can take whatever breaks you want.

341
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:13,030
So then we will have like more than an hour to to complete the lot.

342
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:18,590
So hopefully you will be able to complete it today and you won't have any homework for home.

343
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:20,360
Okay.
