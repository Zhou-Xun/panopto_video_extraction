1
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:21,070
Hey, good morning, everyone. Apologies and I'm running a little bit late this morning.

2
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:28,450
So let's start off with a real quick note on the proposal, assuming everyone saw the cannabis notification, OK?

3
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:33,910
Yeah, there was I don't know, I think I was up to about a third of that.

4
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:40,780
Not a quarter of the class had requested some sort of extensions for any number of reasons.

5
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:45,490
And, you know, I recognize you guys are like up to here with everything.

6
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:51,160
Right. And it's not just classes. There's all kinds of things that you're managing and dealing with right now.

7
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:56,770
So I absolutely appreciate that and I'm sensitive to it. I actually try to weigh things a little bit.

8
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:01,870
Right, because, well, extra time is often nice.

9
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:06,730
It's also sometimes a curse. Right, because you have your schedule lined up and you want to be done with it.

10
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:11,110
Right. So after this day, that'll be submitted and I can move on to other things.

11
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:14,530
And now it's like stretching it out by a few more days.

12
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:20,350
So apologies to those of you who kind of received it that way.

13
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:27,970
But yeah, hopefully for many of you, it's it's the extra few days will really come in handy.

14
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:33,970
Just a little bit of extra flexibility. And again, to those of you who do do, just want to submit it and move on.

15
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:42,310
You don't need to wait until, you know, Monday morning to submit and you can go ahead and do it at any point and consider it done.

16
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:50,410
With that said, any questions? All right, great.

17
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:54,550
So today we're actually going to be moving on,

18
00:01:54,550 --> 00:02:00,370
we've talked a lot over the course of this semester about all of these terrible things that are out there.

19
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:08,650
Right. We've got we classify the hazards as biological hazards, chemical hazards, physical hazards,

20
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:17,530
all of the different pathways through the environment that they these hazards travel before they reach us, before exposure occurs.

21
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:23,350
Right. And we talk about all the terrible health effects that can come from exposure to these hazards.

22
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:26,110
We're finally at the point we're going to talk about, OK,

23
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:33,790
what are some options or opportunities to do something about preventing those exposures from occurring in the first place?

24
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:39,940
Right. And there's actually some some relatively formalized approaches to doing that.

25
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:44,110
We're going to discuss it over a series of two lectures today.

26
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:53,020
We're going to focus specifically within the workplace and look at opportunities for controlling exposures within occupational settings.

27
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:58,210
Next class period will kind of address using the same structure.

28
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:08,620
But we'll look specifically at more of like community environmental environment context for

29
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:14,740
controlling exposures from up maybe a residential perspective or a public space perspective.

30
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:24,340
All right. So with that, our goals are to understand the concepts of what we call the hierarchy of controls.

31
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:32,260
So as you might imagine, there's actually a little bit of a priority or a preference for ways to approach it because some are more effective.

32
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:36,610
There's also some pretty important cost considerations that come into play.

33
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:42,430
And so the reasoning behind how we come up with that preferred order and then we'll

34
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:46,510
really try to to work and we'll have some kind of quick break up discussions,

35
00:03:46,510 --> 00:04:01,280
even to talk about and identify examples of applications of these different types of controls and how we might implement them in various scenarios.

36
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:11,210
So some assumptions before we get started. The reality is, is that all hazard can be controlled to some degree, right?

37
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:19,430
So when we say control, we don't mean 100 percent address, but they can they can be reduced.

38
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:25,220
Or even if the hazard can't be reduced, our our exposure to them can be reduced.

39
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:30,950
And there are alternative approaches to ways to control.

40
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:36,290
And even though we're going to go through and talk about them kind of through a classification system.

41
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:47,640
The reality is, is that oftentimes more than one control approach is kind of a layered or multiple control approach might be useful or required.

42
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,390
And then I mentioned cost a little bit ago.

43
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:59,210
But some control measures are often more cost effective and energy efficient as well than others.

44
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:06,860
And these have real ramifications, you know, within a business setting and next class period.

45
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:18,870
They even have a ramification, you know, as a as a citizen or a resident or a public entity.

46
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:31,740
All right, so that alluded to hierarchy of control, so how we affect health and safety controls starting up here at the top are most effective.

47
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:36,330
And also our most preferred is simply eliminating the hazard.

48
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:42,420
Right, if we can just get rid of it altogether. Excellent.

49
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:49,380
Almost as effective is perhaps we can't eliminate it, but we can substitute it.

50
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:56,880
Right. So through the process or the presence of a chemical might still be there,

51
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:06,960
but perhaps we can substitute it with something that's much less hazardous next in that hierarchy, our engineering controls.

52
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,780
After that, we have warnings.

53
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:19,680
So making people aware of very closely related to that are different trainings and procedures for processes within workplaces.

54
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:27,330
And then actually our least effective in our least preferred for limiting exposures is through the

55
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:33,300
use of TV sets of personal protective equipment and what kind of steps through each of these.

56
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:41,770
And I got to play some examples and some applications.

57
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:54,280
So so with this hierarchy of controls, the first two elimination and substitution are basically all under the category of policies in next lecture.

58
00:06:54,280 --> 00:07:00,430
When we talk about kind of community environmental exposure controls, the policy plays a huge, huge role.

59
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:11,170
But even even in the workplace, it's really a policy in order to accomplish an elimination or substitution and again, eliminating it, as you know,

60
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:16,330
either preventing the creation of the hazard in the first place or through identification of it,

61
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:26,080
if it can somehow be completely removed or replaced with something that is less hazardous.

62
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:33,520
When we talk about engineering controls, we might be able to prevent the release of the hazard.

63
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,730
So we can actually remove its role.

64
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:48,400
We might be able to at least prevent it being really so keep it contained or through maybe ventilation, dilute its concentration greatly.

65
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:57,280
And so in that way, we're we're modifying the rate of spatial distribution, you know, of a release of a hazard.

66
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:06,410
Warnings are pretty much what they what they sound like, informing people of the presence of a potential hazard and or an exposure.

67
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:20,770
Right. Trainings and procedures. This is big and a lot of workplace settings are formalized sessions to educate people on how to be safe and again,

68
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:25,600
to be aware when potential for exposure is present.

69
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:35,440
And then again, PPE tends to be our last line of defense during when there's a high risk of exposure.

70
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,420
All right. So this just kind of sets the stage a little bit of framework going forward.

71
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:49,030
And again, we're going to step through each of these individually and kind of describe them in detail and talk about some examples.

72
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:55,150
Before I do that, let's go ahead. And just with numbers here, we're a little bit light today.

73
00:08:55,150 --> 00:09:02,290
Maybe let's do pay or how about Peyer and apair and maybe the three of you take like two minutes.

74
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:05,830
And again, we're we're constrained to workplaces today.

75
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:14,650
So just within occupational settings, what would be some examples you could come up with of elimination of a hazard?

76
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:21,560
I'll give you a maybe like two minutes to just kind of brainstorm together and see what you come up with.

77
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:45,600
A real world example. OK. You're in control of your expertize right there as the water moves like through here, just like here with you, sir.

78
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:57,600
With regard to my family, maybe we should have both, you know, like I said, media reports.

79
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:12,170
OK. There were people out there that maybe that's.

80
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:17,260
But then you have.

81
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:25,820
Yeah. Possible, the baby.

82
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:34,930
Yeah, but we're kind of waiting for yeah.

83
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:41,990
It's like we're in the process. Yeah. You know what I think?

84
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:51,150
Yeah, and you know what I think is like.

85
00:10:51,150 --> 00:11:14,130
Society is safer from falling into the hands of the same harmful.

86
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:17,160
All right, so I hear the conversation going down a little bit.

87
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:30,260
So what what did folks come up with in terms of examples of where elimination might be possible within a workplace setting, elimination of.

88
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:41,260
Thanks to think of one that we needed. I really think it is a very disciplined lid and stuff like that place.

89
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:47,500
I don't know if this is what I was thinking, but maybe radiation is possible and not living in time.

90
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:52,490
It's not a limitation, really. But this is like lowering the dose or making barriers.

91
00:11:52,490 --> 00:12:00,070
Right, right. Yeah. And that's probably going to fall a little bit further down that hierarchy because it's really not being eliminated.

92
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:05,320
But with the example of radiation. Yeah, but but lead in in products.

93
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,250
And to the extent that that impacts potential exposures in the workplace.

94
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:16,420
Absolutely. Any others and folks came up with something as best as girl.

95
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:19,040
I mean, for pose a problem because this proposed.

96
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:25,880
Facility and I was thinking maybe a little Legionnaires disease that a lot of the buildings will have just like extraneous piping,

97
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:30,880
things not used, and you just remove that or block at off for sure.

98
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:38,830
So so asbestos actually comes up as a couple of different circumstances, right.

99
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:47,590
There's the case of existing asbestos and how to manage it, and perhaps it can be removed and therefore eliminated.

100
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:50,330
But also from a process perspective. Right.

101
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:57,610
In terms of how you insulate pipes in a building, it used to be that you, you know, coated them with asbestos.

102
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:04,090
And so we're going to eliminate that hazard from the process of insulating pipes.

103
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:09,610
And so now it's not there, although this is probably going to lead us to substitution.

104
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:15,010
Right, because those pipes don't need to be insulated somehow. So what what is that asbestos replaced?

105
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:18,970
It seems like everything was substituted. Yeah.

106
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:25,120
Which is I mean, they still need something for it, so it's hard to eliminate that entirely.

107
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:32,500
Elimination is is a challenge. What about so I mean, you came up with a radiation example.

108
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:37,930
I think it's we often will think about, you know, chemical hazards. What about like physical hazards?

109
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:50,620
Are there can anybody come up with any. Examples of physical hazards and elimination.

110
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:55,030
You know, the assembly lines to actually do the research.

111
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:59,710
We have automated tools that you're just overseeing. Absolutely.

112
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:08,470
So someone who works on an assembly line, you know, perhaps vibration for some sort of tool that they repetitively use every day,

113
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:13,210
that that exposure could be eliminated through an automation process.

114
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:23,930
Absolutely. Great example. All right, so we're we're kind of already alluding to substitution, and I didn't want to dwell too much on the elimination.

115
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:30,620
So let's let's move now to the substitution and go ahead and pair off again and discuss.

116
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,990
And I'll give you a couple extra minutes on this one,

117
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:38,390
because I think you might there might be a little more active discussion and examples you come up with.

118
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:46,270
So go ahead. Yeah, but yeah.

119
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:56,630
But also so, you know, I think she makes a place for I might be going down the line no matter what.

120
00:14:56,630 --> 00:15:11,470
You might be wondering what it's like to be able to think, oh, let's forget about that.

121
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:18,850
You know, I was like on this very subject of a seminar on safety,

122
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:29,000
someone this there's and the cops could have asked for help and others came forward and he said, oh, no, no, I'm not.

123
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,930
So we're talking about kill themselves to do something else.

124
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:44,620
Yeah, but also releasing. Yes, but it's probably done.

125
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:55,310
A little bit of.

126
00:15:55,310 --> 00:16:03,680
A lot of folks like.

127
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:20,500
They are so excited about this, like this also one.

128
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:30,900
Started, I thought I was going to be like, no, no, no, no, I'm not sure I like her.

129
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:42,550
Like a lot of times I didn't want to have like a certain degree for hours because I had all these people, you know, like water.

130
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:52,300
So I don't know. But I also think, like, so many things on my mind.

131
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:57,100
Yeah. Yeah, but.

132
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:02,460
So I just really want to start here.

133
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:16,650
This is what I'm doing here. Yeah. Check out this stuff here.

134
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:38,290
Next thing I know, the.

135
00:17:38,290 --> 00:18:00,380
You know, by the time I came home, one day of probably trying to eat.

136
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:12,020
I think that would be a simultaneous failure. You can have a pretty good night for all the flaws in your body.

137
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:16,450
Yeah, that's true, I guess.

138
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:39,180
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, so.

139
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:54,670
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.

140
00:18:54,670 --> 00:19:08,300
All right, so what did folks come up with in terms of examples of substitution when it comes to exposure hazards in the workplace?

141
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:18,290
Sort of like, you know, you get like any control measures, like guns, instead of using pesticides, you can use like fish, like a water source.

142
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:25,940
OK, awesome. So if we're thinking from an occupational setting, this would be like workers in gardens, farming, whatever.

143
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:35,360
Right. So we can remove or substitute. We still need to be able to control pests or whatever the issue is.

144
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:40,010
But we can we can substitute perhaps a hazardous chemical for something else.

145
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:49,980
Excellent. When I did folks come up with a project, General Reagonomics for the Home Office, where were you just to say, hey,

146
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:56,880
there's no time that we have send us to their keyboards and better monitors that are sort of across the board,

147
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:05,580
whether or not we still are standing sitting on stage, ironically, not this stuff, but it's better than it was.

148
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,870
Yeah, great. Great example.

149
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:19,250
So, you know, in the modern day, many of us, you know, utilize computers and technology as a huge part of our of our workday.

150
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:27,530
And sitting in front of them is a challenge and creates all kinds of musculoskeletal issues.

151
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:37,220
And so while we can't actually eliminate that, the need for the computers and the technology is part of many of those jobs or tasks,

152
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:41,090
we can absolutely substitute some of the processes involved.

153
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:48,640
Right. And how they're engaged and continue to be utilized. Great example.

154
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:58,930
What else have folks come up with along similar lines in like a factory or a place for using tools that vibrate a lot?

155
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:04,240
Maybe you can replace it with better tools or something about make sure.

156
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:12,100
Yeah, absolutely. So identifying what the hazard is, you can't maybe get rid of the the process,

157
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:24,250
but you can intervene sufficiently that the exposure is is reduced by using a different approach or replacement of the component of that task.

158
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:27,470
Excellent. All right. Nice work. Let's see.

159
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:35,950
So let's dig into this a little bit in terms of some of the formalized approaches.

160
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:48,190
So with substitution, again, our goal is to substitute a less hazardous agent or kind of like the last example.

161
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:50,680
Perhaps it's not an agent itself,

162
00:21:50,680 --> 00:22:01,810
but it's something about a process that we can change that operation or process so that the hazard is is reduced significantly.

163
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:09,020
And then, you know, the way that this is approached, actually, I just noticed about a week ago there was a new monitor up here.

164
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:12,820
I didn't really think anything of it. I just saw here, check this out.

165
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:18,900
I can, you know, doodler. So I'll have to you know, I'm always reaching for the courage here to do this.

166
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:26,380
So I might start to make a mess of the screen here if I it's a little too tantalizing.

167
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:34,930
But anyway, you know, the approach is investigating what potential alternatives might be in the first place.

168
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:43,210
Right. And then doing some screening of because clearly we want to we might come up

169
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:49,750
with an a good idea for something that could replace a hazard or a process.

170
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:55,660
But it only makes sense to do it if we can with confidence, know that it's going to reduce the hazard.

171
00:22:55,660 --> 00:23:04,570
Right. So there needs to be some assessment of the hazard, how it affects performance in the process.

172
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:07,750
Right. Like it might be a good replacement and reduce the hazard,

173
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:17,020
but it might whatever create an unreliable product in the end from a from a business manufacturing perspective,

174
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:22,540
cost is certainly a big consideration within a workplace.

175
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:26,860
Again, how does that interact with with exposure?

176
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:32,770
And only by going through like this whole process can we actually identify what would be a true

177
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:40,660
preferred alternative and then begin to actually go ahead and implement it as a substitution?

178
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:47,950
There are definitely strengths as well as weaknesses when we look at this substitution approach.

179
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:54,730
Again, our goal here is to remove a known hazard with something that's less hazardous.

180
00:23:54,730 --> 00:24:01,240
And this might be an agent, it might be equipment or even a process.

181
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:11,110
It may actually end up being less the least expensive option in terms of ways to control occupational hazards.

182
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:20,740
The weaknesses is that it requires a lot of caution to ensure that a previously

183
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:26,920
unforeseen hazard isn't now reintroduced right as part of the substitution.

184
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:35,290
So it might have solved the original problem, but through the substitution, it could create a whole new problem from an exposure perspective.

185
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:41,950
And so a lot of work needs to be done through that screening and assessment to identify any

186
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:48,760
potentially or previously unforeseen new exposures that might come along with the substitution.

187
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:52,630
And along those lines, it requires experimentation.

188
00:24:52,630 --> 00:25:00,160
It's not like, OK, here's our idea and we're going to implement it across, you know, all of our plants nationwide.

189
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:04,840
The best plan is to kind of pile on it. Right. Try it out on a small scale.

190
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:13,690
First, a single operation in a single location, in a single part of a plant, whatever it might be, a workplace,

191
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:20,620
and be able to assess how effective the substitution is before making that

192
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:28,880
substitution a more formalized part of an operation or process on a larger scale.

193
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:40,460
All right, let's go ahead and move on to engineering controls, so go ahead and give you three or four minutes to kind of pair off and discuss it,

194
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:56,950
try to come up with some examples of how engineering controls can be utilized to reduce hazards or reduce exposure.

195
00:25:56,950 --> 00:26:15,240
Say, for more than a year now, as you all know,

196
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:26,240
six of the eight workers I see that sort of throw it away for a year and a half, like that one out there.

197
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:32,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

198
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:38,530
It's all over the place.

199
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:52,840
That was great. But there is an issue of what you're doing. Now, there's no reason why the.

200
00:26:52,840 --> 00:27:02,940
Smulders, you have no idea what are you around here?

201
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:11,700
The. They in the.

202
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:23,160
I thought you were just. They are in idea of this shutdown to sure.

203
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:33,470
He's. Countersuing. It's yeah, for the.

204
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:48,780
Anything think that the U.S. military is trying to find out what's going on right now?

205
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:57,210
There are a lot more expensive than our education and everything else.

206
00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:03,690
Because we want to make sure a kind of thing here failed here.

207
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:10,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

208
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:36,410
Birthweight I. That's Charles Schumer of New York City, and they are starting of all going some kind of.

209
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:46,240
Yeah, she'll be like, is there something wrong with the American people?

210
00:28:46,240 --> 00:29:09,370
I thought that was pretty horrible. There is no that.

211
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:14,100
Yeah, know it's not over.

212
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:42,590
Have no. So they chose a unique performance, so that's why you like.

213
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:59,650
All right, let's go ahead and reconvene. What did folks come up with in terms of examples of engineering controls?

214
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:11,050
So within a workplace rights and what are what are some opportunities to kind of engineer our way to the point of reducing exposure to a hazard,

215
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:21,830
we were thinking about any device that monitors a specific exposure and then maybe that automatically elevates people that it's there.

216
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:29,080
Yeah, OK, so, yeah. So when you when you first describe dangerous thinking, OK, that's going to be like a warning mechanism.

217
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:35,300
But if it's somehow automatically shut it down then yeah that would absolutely work.

218
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:42,880
I this would be orchestrated from here under control. But a lot of like factors are going into the lock out to shut down procedure,

219
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:48,130
whatever works like if you're working on a like so you can start an up or something in the way,

220
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:53,140
like they shut it down where there's a lot they actually I. Yeah.

221
00:30:53,140 --> 00:31:02,700
That would absolutely fit into I mean this the scheme of it is absolutely an engineering control.

222
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:06,250
Operation filtration, ventilation. Yeah, right.

223
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:11,790
So this is actually a big one with with reducing exposure to covid, right.

224
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:18,930
Is it's not just actually this is a good example of it is a great example of of a multi layered approach.

225
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:25,800
Right. To reducing exposure. It's not just that there's one. It's that there's multi in these different categories.

226
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:34,560
So, you know, PPE from masking here in public health, the ventilation and all of the rooms has been purposely increased.

227
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:43,140
There was a cost analysis involved in that. It actually cost the school, the university more money to increase their ventilation.

228
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:52,260
But it's refreshing air more times per minute in the space.

229
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:59,790
So, yeah, that's a great example. Rebecca. Is that for real?

230
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:10,050
Absolutely, yeah, so here's right to help prevent a physical fall hazard having handrails built in.

231
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:14,700
I'm trying to think of where I guess the cross walks right out front across the observatory.

232
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:20,040
Has the slip resistant material built into the concrete.

233
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:24,510
It's kind of a weird one of apparently a lot of like aluminum and some of the huge

234
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:33,990
explosion rings getting hit by lightning and then like a lot of the other way around.

235
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:39,510
Absolutely. Absolutely. Great examples. All right.

236
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:46,110
Let's let's talk about engineering controls for a couple more minutes.

237
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:50,670
So, yeah. So a lot of the examples you came up with hit right on this.

238
00:32:50,670 --> 00:33:01,680
Right. So how to isolate or in close as a way to physically separate a worker from a hazard?

239
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:05,700
So we might.

240
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:19,950
So here's an image of a type of hood where the worker is actually engaging with the hazard inside the hood.

241
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:22,440
But it's completely sealed. Right.

242
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:28,260
It's not just like you have a hood with a sash that comes down pretty far and you wear gloves and you stick your hands.

243
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:38,550
And there is absolutely no interaction right there wearing these completely sealed gloving mechanisms to reach in.

244
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:43,980
So there's a physical barrier between between the worker and the hazard.

245
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:49,830
And then as as Josh mentioned, you can actually enclose the worker.

246
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:57,360
Right. So some basically head to toe body suits with with respirators and ventilation.

247
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:07,380
The environment is still there all around you where the hazard exists, but the worker themselves is entirely enclosed.

248
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:12,540
Let's see over here. There are some examples. We just talked about ventilation.

249
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:18,600
Right? So each HVAC systems are very effective.

250
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:23,430
These these didn't used to be around. Right. These weren't a thing going back.

251
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:30,240
You know, I don't know, 100 years ago when the Industrial Revolution was really kind of kicking into gear, it was just buildings.

252
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:38,790
It got hot in the building. It got warm in the building, smoke fumes, whatever accumulated in the building.

253
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:42,090
And there really wasn't much in terms, you know,

254
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:49,890
there's a there's a temperature control heating element or perhaps the cooling element that's involved.

255
00:34:49,890 --> 00:35:00,090
But more importantly, from an exposure perspective is being able to introduce fresh air and actually in modern day HVAC systems,

256
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:02,020
be able to actually filter the air.

257
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:14,530
It's not even just bringing in outdoor air, but having it filtered before it's distributed throughout throughout a building space.

258
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:22,960
Some other engineering controls if we get into the health care setting, so needles,

259
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:30,740
sharks are a huge source of physical and depending on the circumstance, biological hazards.

260
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:41,740
But in this place, talking about a needle sticks specifically and some approaches, you can basically engineer that needle and syringe system.

261
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:45,500
So there's one was a self reseating needle.

262
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,110
So after it's used,

263
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:55,570
these are slides to leap forward over the needle or it locks into place and kind of removes the shark's hazard and then also syringes that have

264
00:35:55,570 --> 00:36:09,000
a retractable needle so you can push a plunger that retracts the needle back into the syringe after use to help remove the shark's hasn't.

265
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:17,310
Some some strengths and weaknesses with using that engineering control approach to reducing hazards or exposure to hazards.

266
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:24,840
The strength is they're very much built into industrial processes and this is good.

267
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:31,380
And if they're effective, you know, oftentimes there's no further action required except to simply,

268
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:37,680
you know, continue monitoring its effectiveness and ensure that it continues to be effective.

269
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:41,460
Some of the weaknesses are our capital costs, right?

270
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:49,020
Some money. They're expensive. Some of these engineering controls, not just like the development of them, but that the implementation of them.

271
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:57,510
When you talk about a building that's old, that doesn't have an air handling system and then implementing one huge,

272
00:36:57,510 --> 00:37:08,880
huge cost beyond implementing then for operational costs over time, you know, obviously they may not be 100 percent effective.

273
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:18,420
They might be part of a multi multilayered approach and they might be disabled by workers.

274
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:24,810
Right. So, gosh darn, that thing, that alarm goes off all the time and it shuts down their gene.

275
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:31,890
And I never get anything done. So I'm just going to like, you know, get around it by disabling that that function.

276
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:39,330
So, you know, these are considerations there, potential limitations of some engineering control options.

277
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:49,390
Any any questions about any of these so far? I think the last one this morning, similar to the kitchen table members jobs and like all the cooks,

278
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:55,840
just like this in the wake of the fire, alarms are always going off.

279
00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:09,440
This is annoying. Yeah, great example. And any other comments or experiences to share?

280
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:19,460
All right, let's see, uh, moving on, so we've talked about elimination and substitution and we talked about engineering controls.

281
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:29,420
Now let's go ahead and move into two warnings and then specifically trainings and procedures.

282
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:35,510
So let's go ahead and lump them all together, because sometimes they're they're overlapping and related.

283
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:39,710
But take a couple of minutes, pare back off and think of some examples.

284
00:38:39,710 --> 00:39:01,570
And again, this is within a workplace setting where warnings, trainings or procedural controls have been utilized or are effective.

285
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:27,890
Simon is back in the country after we saw what we saw in the beginning, it was clear and all of a sudden there was a plane in London.

286
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:35,250
Yeah, something like that.

287
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:42,150
Yeah, that's right.

288
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:55,910
Yeah, it was been a long time and there was a lot of reasons for it.

289
00:39:55,910 --> 00:40:04,220
But you know what? It is different from the.

290
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:10,240
You right, you're on the own.

291
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:16,740
Yeah, you know, the.

292
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:27,650
I'm going to give you an idea how always.

293
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:33,190
You better get down to the checklist.

294
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:56,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, I hope about that.

295
00:40:56,140 --> 00:41:18,230
No. Five years after the attack, on the one hand, there's no popular support in the country freely and without actually having to the on terrorism,

296
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:33,720
if cleared the way for more people in the nationalist contingent, you have a place to evacuate.

297
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:45,600
Yeah, but I. The people that actually got fired.

298
00:41:45,600 --> 00:42:00,830
Yeah. We think that certain communities and certain jobs are pretty similar in this area here.

299
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:15,620
So we need to more. Yeah.

300
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:40,580
From the. Which is the case with the.

301
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:48,200
All right, it's getting quiet. Either you're done coming up with lots of examples or you haven't been able to come up and analyze what folks think,

302
00:42:48,200 --> 00:43:03,640
what are some some applications or examples you can think of regarding warnings, trainings and procedural controls in workplaces?

303
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:06,760
Worked in a grocery store in college, and we always had trainings for,

304
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:13,520
like proper food safety with temperatures just because that would be held and we all felt like training,

305
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:18,600
emotionally lifting techniques and how to handle the machinery.

306
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:22,850
So that is a lot of experience. Sure. Absolutely.

307
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:31,840
So the first ones you described, I'm thinking, aren't necessarily protective of workers, but protective of consumers.

308
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:39,460
Right. Of of the way we deal with the grocery produce products, whatever it is.

309
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:53,170
But yeah, certainly learning through a training on how to how to properly lift a place, you know, across the board, almost every workplace scenario.

310
00:43:53,170 --> 00:44:05,890
It's a great example. We of talk about like a lot like jobs, like like you're working like on an electrical wires or something,

311
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:09,400
you probably have like it makes sense that they look got a buddy system.

312
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,790
Like, you can't do this alone,

313
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:18,990
but also to just like generalized training and like just make sure people know what they're going to go out of the worksite,

314
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:26,010
like the construction sites, like everyone else is like, oh, look beyond that of like,

315
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:29,700
oh, turn off the electricity if you turn on the electricity like that.

316
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:35,220
Like having a good procedure. Absolutely. Yeah. Good examples.

317
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:44,740
One of the folks typing. I heard in court of are like with you supposed to check off, like every time.

318
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:49,720
Absolutely, yeah. So it's not just completing the training one time,

319
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:57,250
but a way to reinforce right through through reminders or having been visibly present as part of the job.

320
00:44:57,250 --> 00:45:07,810
It's actually the combination of the campus power plant undergoing a major refurbishment or expansion,

321
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:14,320
I guess you'd call it, combined with just limitations related to covid.

322
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:22,690
Every year I organize a tour or take interest in students right across campus and we take a tour of the power plant.

323
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:28,150
And it's a great way to learn about lots of things from a community environmental pollution perspective.

324
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:35,350
Right. It's a it's a power plant. It has emissions. And so you get to see how they monitor all those things.

325
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:44,830
They talk about how they report their emissions, what they're permitted to emit right through through state issued permits and so forth.

326
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:52,090
There's also a very much a workplace health and safety component as you're physically walking through,

327
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:59,590
you know, all these boilers and noisy things and up and down ladders and so forth.

328
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:04,660
There is signage everywhere, right around around health and safety.

329
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:14,980
And certainly, you know, each of those workers went through a training or as the procedures were modified or updated, go through new training.

330
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:17,170
But it's it's in their face,

331
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:27,850
like through every task and every day of their work shift in that plant through through visible warnings and anything else.

332
00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:36,430
Any any comments before we move on to the next one? A question.

333
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:42,940
All right, actually, we're not moving on yet. I've got a couple of slides here on on warnings and trainings and procedural controls,

334
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:46,720
but yeah, like you've already kind of come up with with your examples.

335
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:55,930
These are education and trainings to supplement whatever controls have been implemented.

336
00:46:55,930 --> 00:46:59,350
This might include supervision. Right.

337
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:06,340
So to better make sure that someone is actually following those safety procedures.

338
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:18,910
Right. If someone is watching, the workers might be, you know, more more apt to actually be following the procedures.

339
00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:25,730
And then general and preventative maintenance ends up being a procedural control.

340
00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:30,520
Right. So you can implement something that's going to assure safety.

341
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:37,120
But if you don't maintain it right, it can become no longer effective.

342
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:47,920
So approaches to reduce, you know, some sort of catastrophic omission within a plant or as equipment or components break down.

343
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:58,040
Right. There might be small leaks in systems that all of a sudden an exposure to an agent is occurring.

344
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:08,090
Yeah, here's some example of some signage here about reminding workers that that hearing protection needs to be worn.

345
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:20,840
There's some other aspects of procedural controls that we're scheduling actually comes into play as a way to reduce.

346
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:28,440
Maybe we can actually get rid of the hazard or the exposure to that's associated with the task.

347
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:38,120
But from an individual worker perspective and how much they're exposed, we might be able to schedule our way to less exposure.

348
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:46,880
So scheduling and then tracking how much each worker spends on task and the and

349
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:52,490
the associated exposure with that task allows us to potentially reduce it.

350
00:48:52,490 --> 00:48:58,400
So, you know, kind of walking through the schematic here, you see the individuals and,

351
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:02,450
you know, over the course of their workday, they actually change the job that they're doing.

352
00:49:02,450 --> 00:49:13,490
So and this would be maybe a farming example, very, very basic, not quite stick figures, but not a whole lot of detail in the graphics.

353
00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:22,250
But it illustrates the point. Right. So this individual is probably exposed to some some vibration while they're operating this this machinery.

354
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:30,070
The individual over here, you know, lifting their bending, digging different aspects of physical,

355
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:36,500
and then this person is operating, you know, some sort of wheelbarrow. So stressing different parts of the body.

356
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:42,680
So instead of having this individual be the heavy machinery operator for the entire day,

357
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:50,510
we can schedule our way to reduce those exposures where over the course of their work shift, they actually exchange tasks.

358
00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:55,160
And so their time on each individual task is reduced.

359
00:49:55,160 --> 00:50:01,160
And then often it's done in conjunction with with engineering controls.

360
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:05,840
And it actually like kind of places the burden of responsibility on the worker.

361
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:13,370
Right. So this might be the protocol or the procedure that when the workers are at the worksite, it's up to them to actually implement this.

362
00:50:13,370 --> 00:50:22,910
Right and actually do it. Some other things that we would consider would be opportunities for job rotation more formally,

363
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:30,500
again, with the goal of reducing the exposure, duration, different work practices.

364
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:35,540
We talked about preventative maintenance programs, good housekeeping, and then,

365
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:42,930
of course, training and education of employees kind of on all of this collectively.

366
00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:57,930
When we talk about employee rotation, here's here's another type of example where we're concerned about exposure to air pollutants, right?

367
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:11,100
So if we have a worker who's exposed to a toxic or hazardous vapor at a concentration of 100 parts per million, and they do that for the entire day.

368
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:17,830
Right. That's, you know, equivalent of time weighted average to an exposure of 100 parts per million.

369
00:51:17,830 --> 00:51:23,010
If somehow they're tasked where they're being rotated with another employee.

370
00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:27,780
So they trade tasks maybe midway through an eight hour workday,

371
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:34,590
we can reduce even though the concentration is present and the same amount of one hundred parts per million,

372
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:39,660
that they're only doing that task for four hours. Their equivalent exposure is now cut in half.

373
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:44,310
Right. Or if we get that time of exposure down to two hours.

374
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:49,260
So maybe over the course of an eight hour workday, each worker is due for workers.

375
00:51:49,260 --> 00:52:00,180
Each one spends two hours a time on task and reduces the exposure by a quarter or two, a quarter of total and so forth.

376
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:05,370
So there are some issues with this as well.

377
00:52:05,370 --> 00:52:13,980
So, you know, if we go back to this last one here to the least, only working for one hour and wow,

378
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:18,960
we've really cut, you know, the total exposure down to one eight.

379
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:30,090
That's fantastic. However, now, instead of having one worker that's needed to do that to complete that task, now we need eight different workers.

380
00:52:30,090 --> 00:52:34,530
Right. So that clearly that's that's an issue. That's the down side.

381
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:41,790
We need eight people to actually complete the shift. We also need eight sets of personal protective equipment.

382
00:52:41,790 --> 00:52:49,590
Right. So whatever it is that they're wearing, whether it's hearing protection, respirators,

383
00:52:49,590 --> 00:52:57,240
eye protection and so forth, you know, maybe it's footwear and there's a cost involved in it.

384
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:02,700
Right. So instead of just needing one set for one person to complete this shift,

385
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:08,160
now the facility is used to pay for eight where medical exams come into play.

386
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:17,430
Right. You're not just monitoring the health of one person now. It's eight people that need to be monitored or examined.

387
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:25,140
All right. So kind of finishing warnings, trainings and procedural controls by looking at some of the strengths and weaknesses of

388
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:36,870
each of the strengths is that management of workers is actively engaged in the process.

389
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:42,480
Documentation and accountability can easily be there also a good thing.

390
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,180
And again, like we've kind of highlighted through our examples,

391
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:57,730
is that at least it spreads that exposure or distributes the exposure among a larger group of workers so that each is exposed to a much lower amount.

392
00:53:57,730 --> 00:54:01,380
Some of the weaknesses as just the potential for human error.

393
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:07,500
Right. Someone who might be very well trained on that one path.

394
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:11,440
And that's all they do for eight hours. And they do it really well.

395
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:19,470
And there's probably less opportunity for for something else to go wrong versus having eight people that only do it, you know,

396
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:31,920
part of the time, perhaps they're not as good at that task, which could lead to other types of exposures, injuries or safety concerns.

397
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:37,140
It passes responsibility to the worker, which can be a good thing.

398
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:43,380
But but as we've also, you know, kind of Joshes example about the smoke alarms in the restaurant is a great one.

399
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:53,460
This that could also be a weakness in the approach. It spreads exposure among a larger group of workers.

400
00:54:53,460 --> 00:55:01,230
Right. So you could look at it as, all right, we only had to be worried about this one person who did this task all day long.

401
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:08,340
Now we're now we have to worry about all eight people. Right. So it actually there's more people to to account for.

402
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:21,500
And again, it might increase. We kind of walk through the example overall cost more sets of PPE, more sets of medical surveillance across more people.

403
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:30,500
All right, we're moving on to our last category is personal protective equipment, so go ahead off,

404
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:35,930
take three or four minutes and come up with some examples in workplace settings

405
00:55:35,930 --> 00:55:44,200
where personal protective equipment might be implemented to reduce exposure.

406
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:58,060
You're here, you have four or five years ago all over the world.

407
00:55:58,060 --> 00:56:08,790
Oh, yeah, I believe I guess like I was the one who has.

408
00:56:08,790 --> 00:56:18,800
Lots of pressure for you, for sure, but.

409
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:36,570
Also by was like, you know, kind of like a very special person, this is actually.

410
00:56:36,570 --> 00:56:49,890
That was. I couldn't walk away from.

411
00:56:49,890 --> 00:56:54,030
Airplane flying with you from the bottom?

412
00:56:54,030 --> 00:57:02,960
Yeah, yeah, you know.

413
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:28,240
You mentioning that I is working with the of.

414
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:37,140
Yeah. The.

415
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:51,280
Has. Earthquake survivors and like.

416
00:57:51,280 --> 00:58:06,410
And the. No. Yeah, yeah, something like that, a lot, but I think we'll be heading across the border.

417
00:58:06,410 --> 00:58:31,740
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. For a chance of health care and just never had a chance to use steamrollers and.

418
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:43,330
I mean, I think it would be good.

419
00:58:43,330 --> 00:59:13,090
This is something that. But I don't I that you would think, yeah, yeah, yeah, I think so, but I was.

420
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:31,020
So you don't have a. Oh, yeah, I'm sorry about the security situation, we were in the hospital.

421
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:51,940
Just. Ed.

422
00:59:51,940 --> 01:00:04,340
So what did folks come up with for four examples of personal protective equipment and workplace?

423
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:18,470
I was hoping this is going to be easy for you to get started with scuba gear from their scuba gear while everyone else is OK and.

424
01:00:18,470 --> 01:00:23,300
Sure. And that sort of thing that will take astronauts to the back here.

425
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:27,810
But just like bloggers and things like that where we have the Kevlar.

426
01:00:27,810 --> 01:00:31,460
Yeah. Yeah. So so let's walk through a couple of those.

427
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:35,250
Right. So some of the underwater welder is a really cool scenario.

428
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:42,880
So what what type of PPE would be involved with someone who goes underwater welding?

429
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:51,220
It's really good to see a wetsuit, OK? Really something to keep you warm, careful in the ocean for sure.

430
01:00:51,220 --> 01:00:55,790
So like thermal protection. Yeah. What else?

431
01:00:55,790 --> 01:01:01,950
Well, we definitely do this locator device and a lot of pressure gauges and all the yeah, sure.

432
01:01:01,950 --> 01:01:06,540
Just the right actual breathing apparatus, right.

433
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:11,790
I imagine I really don't know much about underwater welding, but, you know, all the face shielding right there,

434
01:01:11,790 --> 01:01:19,830
even when you're not underwater, that welders where I imagine that needs to also continue to be implemented.

435
01:01:19,830 --> 01:01:25,320
The pressure chamber is probably like engineering control because of that.

436
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:30,750
Definitely. Definitely. And then so after underwater, you talk about astronauts and then.

437
01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:37,800
And then what else? The longer like that had only Kevlar, like the pants and stuff.

438
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:42,000
OK, very slipping. Absolutely right.

439
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:46,920
Right. So with to protect from the from from cuts.

440
01:01:46,920 --> 01:02:00,870
Wounds from the device. What else did folks come up with in terms of PPE, a spray, bug spray and sunscreen for construction workers.

441
01:02:00,870 --> 01:02:05,820
OK, so anybody who spends a lot of time outdoors working.

442
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:13,520
Absolutely. Those are good examples. Actually, let's stay on the topic of construction workers.

443
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:20,910
What other PPE would construction workers be engaging with price to foods?

444
01:02:20,910 --> 01:02:28,900
Yet chances for any kind of success here are at clubs, kind of.

445
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:36,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. All right, nice job with that.

446
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:49,540
What what other what other scenarios or contacts that people think of regarding.

447
01:02:49,540 --> 01:02:57,950
If I'm being honest, they want to restart, it's so they shared Taddy.

448
01:02:57,950 --> 01:03:01,330
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, I went there.

449
01:03:01,330 --> 01:03:04,750
That's a great one. Yeah, you're a. Professional racecar driver.

450
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:07,450
There's a lot of lots to protect.

451
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:15,070
What about I'm going to shift gears on a purpose here, because this is tends to be a big one about health care settings.

452
01:03:15,070 --> 01:03:18,310
That seems to be a big one, right. For implementation of PPE.

453
01:03:18,310 --> 01:03:27,470
What are some of the aspects of personal protective equipment that are utilized in health care settings?

454
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:35,680
Masks, masks, for sure, gloves, gowns, gowns, yeah.

455
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:40,210
I think probably some eye protection in certain scenarios as well.

456
01:03:40,210 --> 01:03:47,000
A lot of them were very scary and that's really going to senators for great nation to monitor exposure.

457
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:58,390
Sure. Yeah. That the dosimeters in themselves aren't really providing immediate protection from from a hazard.

458
01:03:58,390 --> 01:04:07,270
But yeah, certainly there appear to be part of a procedure to to alert exposure taking place.

459
01:04:07,270 --> 01:04:13,300
All right, good. Any questions through your discussion about this?

460
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:22,440
Are you considered to be safe again, like a radio or a radio, like a walkie talkie or some way to communicate?

461
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:31,090
Yeah, and I would think that would be an engineering, procedural, administrative type of control.

462
01:04:31,090 --> 01:04:37,180
I mean, the radio, it's. So you like cross rescuers.

463
01:04:37,180 --> 01:04:42,390
Sure. Sure. Yeah. Yeah.

464
01:04:42,390 --> 01:04:56,740
Yeah. OK, all right, so you guys hit on lots of these, but most importantly, I wanted to get across a couple of points regarding PPE.

465
01:04:56,740 --> 01:05:01,030
If you remember, we started with that hierarchy of exposure controls.

466
01:05:01,030 --> 01:05:09,160
And really PPE is at the very bottom of the list. It's it's widely understood to be the least effective.

467
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:13,120
And because of that, it's the least preferred.

468
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:25,180
And when you talk to or hear from a, you know, a formal agency that's tasked with guidance on protecting health and safety in the workplace,

469
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:36,970
you know, they regard PPE as really an interim measure. It's not supposed to be a permanent implementation as the solution to a problem.

470
01:05:36,970 --> 01:05:50,500
It's really only expected to be used until a better in control of the exposure control can be implemented like an engineering control,

471
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:57,160
you know, during an emergency, certainly during maintenance, during repair.

472
01:05:57,160 --> 01:06:04,360
So things that aren't a regular nonstop task within it, within a workplace, you know,

473
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:13,720
certainly these are the norm as an added level of control, in addition to other approaches that are in place.

474
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:18,700
And then really it's only, you know, when you look at guidance,

475
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:29,560
the use of PPE should only be continued if engineering controls aren't aren't feasible or sufficiently effective.

476
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:34,960
It's we heard it again, I think of it as a great example with just the max, right.

477
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:40,230
I mean, at the start of the pandemic, there were all these videos about how to properly put on a mask.

478
01:06:40,230 --> 01:06:45,220
Right. They were hard to get. There were videos on how to make a mask.

479
01:06:45,220 --> 01:06:52,780
So this actually is a real thing in workplaces. So it's not just as simple as handing out your protection.

480
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:56,980
And coincidentally enough, I don't know where the principal hazards.

481
01:06:56,980 --> 01:07:04,990
OK, yeah. Wow, this is perfect timing if I look around me about something else.

482
01:07:04,990 --> 01:07:09,340
But yeah, it's not as simple as just, you know, handing out your protection, handing out a mask.

483
01:07:09,340 --> 01:07:20,260
It's actually training workers on the proper use and implementation of them to be before using the PPE.

484
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:29,150
You know, some examples you guys hit on, I think all of these here's a face and eye protection gloves to protect skin,

485
01:07:29,150 --> 01:07:38,550
you know, respirators, hard hats, footwear and so forth.

486
01:07:38,550 --> 01:07:43,500
And then finishing up here, I think I only have a couple more slides,

487
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:52,440
but I wanted to step through some general examples of how we would consider each

488
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:58,980
of these these exposure controls in the hierarchy in addressing a problem.

489
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:12,450
So if our concern is ionizing radiation in a workplace and how we might approach controlling exposure to that ionizing radiation, clearly, you know,

490
01:08:12,450 --> 01:08:19,380
eliminating the exposure whenever it's possible, substitution might be an option depending on what it is,

491
01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:24,640
perhaps with non-ionizing radiation, this would be an improvement or a reduction.

492
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:26,460
Engineering controls. Right.

493
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:34,320
And we had some examples that we've already talked about in other scenarios, but shielding someone with the physical, you know,

494
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:39,330
barrier in place between the source of the radiation and the person,

495
01:08:39,330 --> 01:08:47,400
or maybe simply just increasing the distance from the source, those administrative controls or procedural controls.

496
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:55,800
Or we can reduce the exposure time, right. When we might not be able to get rid of the X, the source of the exposure or eliminate the task.

497
01:08:55,800 --> 01:09:02,580
But we might be able to reduce the amount of time that someone spends within that exposure scenario and then,

498
01:09:02,580 --> 01:09:15,820
of course, personal protective equipment. So what someone might actually wear to shield them from exposure to ionizing radiation.

499
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:27,610
Looking at an example for Neutze, so a lot of workplace settings involve the use of loud, you know, generally machinery,

500
01:09:27,610 --> 01:09:35,530
we might be able to change the source of what we're using for something that emits less noise, so less exposure.

501
01:09:35,530 --> 01:09:42,220
There might be some engineering controls where we can have, again, kind of physical barriers or enclosures.

502
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:46,910
So here is the loud object and we don't actually need direct access to it.

503
01:09:46,910 --> 01:09:53,230
We can enclose it in in a sound insulating enclosure.

504
01:09:53,230 --> 01:09:59,590
We can have a physical barrier between the source and the worker.

505
01:09:59,590 --> 01:10:08,410
There might be some options for administrative control, again, changing up the timing or the duration.

506
01:10:08,410 --> 01:10:20,620
And then, of course, personal protective equipment right now and the visual aid, we can have more formal workplace,

507
01:10:20,620 --> 01:10:29,740
but depending on the amount of noise and type of noise, different options available to control exposure to noise.

508
01:10:29,740 --> 01:10:44,080
Any any questions on either of these two examples and how we might kind of approach applying across that hierarchy of exposure?

509
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:48,600
That's it. What is this?

510
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:59,640
Oh, no, I don't want to keep my invitations to my screamo and any questions on today's topic.

511
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:07,230
All right, so so keep it in your mind. Next class, period, we're going to go through and look at the same hierarchy, the same framework,

512
01:11:07,230 --> 01:11:12,390
but now begin to apply it basically in everything that's a non workplace setting.

513
01:11:12,390 --> 01:11:19,200
I might be in homes, it might be in communities, indoors, outdoors, public spaces, et cetera.

514
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:31,340
But we'll we'll continue to work through that. And I'll also just invite again any questions on on the proposal assignment.

515
01:11:31,340 --> 01:11:37,870
All right, well, good luck getting that finished up and submitting, hopefully sooner than later.

516
01:11:37,870 --> 01:11:47,939
Enjoy some rest and recovery. The weekend coming and I'll see you in a few days.
