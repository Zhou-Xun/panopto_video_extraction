this is

9
00:06:41,809 --> 00:06:47,769
hello everyone. thank you for joining us today at the genealogy seminar

10
00:06:47,769 --> 00:06:53,869
series and it's my pleasure to introduce our speaker today Doctor Louis Morgan Stern.

11
00:06:53,869 --> 00:06:59,069
Doctor Martinson is a professor of urology emergency medicine and surgery

12
00:06:59,069 --> 00:07:05,409
in the school of medicine and also a professor here in genealogy

13
00:07:05,409 --> 00:07:10,469
in our department. he's just last year concluded a fifteen year

14
00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:15,569
period. as the director of the stroke program and

15
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:20,769
in twenty fifteen received the American_Heart_Association. William Fineberg award

16
00:07:20,769 --> 00:07:26,109
for excellence in clinical stroke. he's well funded by the NIH. including

17
00:07:26,109 --> 00:07:31,229
twenty years of continuous funding for the brain attack surveillance this message Christy study on

18
00:07:31,229 --> 00:07:36,449
the basic study. his work is focused around. very

19
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:41,996
is. and he also teaches an undergrad

20
00:07:41,996 --> 00:07:47,236
class called the science of medicine which is a very popular course and we

21
00:07:47,236 --> 00:07:52,416
even send some of our graduate students. this way

22
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:57,656
does a great job with them. so with that. but welcome back and we're concerned

23
00:07:57,656 --> 00:08:05,176
and hope to talk to us about cognitive sometime today.

24
00:08:05,176 --> 00:08:10,216
thank you Lee and thank you all for inviting me yesterday. all of you

25
00:08:10,216 --> 00:08:15,616
today. you'll interact in. any questions. bye. hopefully you have some

26
00:08:15,616 --> 00:08:21,236
time with you to do that. so I'm gonna tell you a little bit about

27
00:08:21,236 --> 00:08:27,436
career choices. we have a little bit of mentoring. every time I

28
00:08:27,436 --> 00:08:33,136
a little bit screwed up a little bit about this orders. but basically

29
00:08:33,136 --> 00:08:38,658
in my fourth or fifth busy life crisis. I was trying to decide what to do that

30
00:08:38,658 --> 00:08:44,158
gimme a little bit but not the part so much. what I know that

31
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:49,698
we're really sleepy. so for the last twenty three years I've been a stroke doctor

32
00:08:49,698 --> 00:08:54,978
and stroke. is a very different disease and dementia.

33
00:08:54,978 --> 00:09:00,498
as you give a holler at you sweet face it's Rosie. bye. this order. because it causes chronic

34
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:06,218
disability. so it's very much. very cute. bye.

35
00:09:06,218 --> 00:09:11,298
bye. Caroline speaking. and as

36
00:09:11,298 --> 00:09:16,358
a stroke doctor we run to the emergency department. we have lots of treatment that have been

37
00:09:16,358 --> 00:09:21,358
proven successful online. we also know how to prevent

38
00:09:21,358 --> 00:09:26,438
a. you know a_lot about the risk factors and this combine it's me.

39
00:09:26,438 --> 00:09:31,538
from the third meeting. use this this process

40
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:36,998
also the course test in developing Nations in and

41
00:09:36,998 --> 00:09:43,340
know developing. so really epidemic proportion

42
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:48,480
but in this country without a_lot for stroke and it's a very different

43
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,640
disorders and dementia. right to make. on this order. it doesn't

44
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:58,700
have any features out patient type problem. I

45
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:04,020
am so as a clinician. switch from a stroke to dementia. is really a route

46
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:09,060
change and everybody was in the middle of this transition. in the clinical

47
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:14,140
side. kinda wondering what I'm doing. answer the question you know how it

48
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:19,140
is. what's the motivation and what to we know about the

49
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:24,460
are ready for you that we know a_lot about struck we have a tremendous wealth of evidence both in terms

50
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:29,520
of Public Health and clinical factors. we know much last I doubt to

51
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:35,730
mention

52
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:41,270
so what we'll discuss today is. you know why I'm sending this issue is already begun to do that.

53
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:46,630
I'm gonna review the parcel literature on cognitive impairment and Hispanic send everything

54
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:51,770
that I do is really sent an around health disparity. that is fundamentally in my soul and

55
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:57,010
no matter how much time he change the sub straights and I'm looking at Stroop or dementia.

56
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:02,690
it's very. it's most important. we'll review the e-mail sports or literature

57
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:07,770
on care giving for Hispanic patients who have had. I

58
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:13,810
have_to mention that his informal caregiver provided by family members friends et_cetera.

59
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:19,610
we'll talk about the synergy stroke and dementia that is vascular dementia.

60
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:25,450
and finally I'll tell you a little bit about this new study that we recently had fun.

61
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:30,650
so first to get to talk about some and all. so there is a_lot_of

62
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:35,950
discussion about what is the correct term. referring to Hispanic Latino

63
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:41,724
population in the community that Elizabeth and I work in Corpus_Christi.

64
00:11:41,724 --> 00:11:47,184
the preferred time there is Hispanic and the overwhelming majority of

65
00:11:47,184 --> 00:11:52,744
people. our office manager Sam Reese from Mexico. so we talked mostly

66
00:11:52,744 --> 00:11:57,964
about Mexican American. we really do find that fine

67
00:11:57,964 --> 00:12:04,564
self support. so we ask people what

68
00:12:04,564 --> 00:12:09,984
we traditionally have not done that by means of genetics although this is

69
00:12:09,984 --> 00:12:15,784
eight twenty three. any factors underline stroke risk

70
00:12:15,784 --> 00:12:20,824
in these population. because we know there's a_lot_of adventure

71
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:26,104
and we think that the cultural social demographic aspect. there's three Hispanic communities

72
00:12:26,104 --> 00:12:31,904
together. really important and release you opportunities to prevent and

73
00:12:31,904 --> 00:12:37,024
treat recently as you all know there has been a_lot_of advertising

74
00:12:37,024 --> 00:12:42,804
buy .com and twenty three. no other kind of redefine

75
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:48,044
what our genetic margins are and so I'm gonna play for you. a television commercial

76
00:12:48,044 --> 00:12:53,424
that I saw one David Mimi. stand up and scream at my TV set because it seem to threaten

77
00:12:53,424 --> 00:13:12,414
every bit of research that that we were doing

78
00:13:12,414 --> 00:13:28,934
nine.

79
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:40,694
Mike for goodness sake. do not check father.

80
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:46,054
so that is eight reck two people. you know kind of have.

81
00:13:46,054 --> 00:13:52,834
she clearly had a social cultural identification this is Spanish but

82
00:13:52,834 --> 00:13:58,134
now the other interesting aspect of working

83
00:13:58,134 --> 00:14:03,354
in Spanish population is that when you write grants for when you write. there's often

84
00:14:03,354 --> 00:14:09,154
criticism that you're selling just one of the Hispanic. bye-bye. so we study Mexican Americans.

85
00:14:09,154 --> 00:14:14,274
we don't study Caribbean review Spanish or others. this is

86
00:14:14,274 --> 00:14:19,367
very difficult. when you know honey. how you responsible for this is that we work in one

87
00:14:19,367 --> 00:14:24,427
community that is predominantly Mexican America. this is been somewhat

88
00:14:24,427 --> 00:14:29,507
of a Johnson challenge particularly recently in continuing to study Hispanic population.

89
00:14:29,507 --> 00:14:34,507
despite the fact that is fine. are the largest minority population in the United_States

90
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:39,867
and growing very rapidly and aging. making conditions like stroke and dementia particularly

91
00:14:39,867 --> 00:14:45,387
important in Spanish population. so

92
00:14:45,387 --> 00:14:50,467
while I'm studying this. this issue I was I was doing just fine a stroke doctor

93
00:14:50,467 --> 00:14:55,587
and and things are going okay. and that a couple

94
00:14:55,587 --> 00:15:00,907
things happen in my personal life that really made me think about making

95
00:15:00,907 --> 00:15:06,147
a change. and so here's a picture of my family my my wife

96
00:15:06,147 --> 00:15:11,467
and two daughters. actually over here on the right is my dance my mother sister

97
00:15:11,467 --> 00:15:16,727
who had a really big role in raising me when I was young she

98
00:15:16,727 --> 00:15:21,857
was always the I'm happy. she's

99
00:15:21,857 --> 00:15:27,777
addressing me off at her clothes when I was a baby and when my Mom came over she would just laugh hysterically.

100
00:15:27,777 --> 00:15:32,957
my mom if you like to call cell phone and my have never completed

101
00:15:32,957 --> 00:15:38,437
college. and we'll talk a little bit about this patient. patient

102
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:43,477
this is workers. but she was just like the sweetest person. there was and so this

103
00:15:43,477 --> 00:15:49,297
picture is taken right at the beginning with Alzheimer's.

104
00:15:49,297 --> 00:15:54,357
I'm going on. she became more and more impaired and just kinda very

105
00:15:54,357 --> 00:16:00,617
happy. kinda family oriented person became very withdrawn and had all the

106
00:16:00,617 --> 00:16:05,917
you know terrible a fax of Alzheimer's before. she passed away. so for extra credit

107
00:16:05,917 --> 00:16:13,057
is anybody knows to see where this is taken one of my favorite spots in the United_States.

108
00:16:13,057 --> 00:16:18,677
this is Zach Real National Monument in San_Diego with that. you

109
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:23,717
it's Omar. I recommended to everybody. and then

110
00:16:23,717 --> 00:16:28,877
the second event related to my father in law

111
00:16:28,877 --> 00:16:33,997
is here holding his grand daughter my my daughter.

112
00:16:33,997 --> 00:16:39,197
a wonderful man. highly educated. you know I always used to like to make home.

113
00:16:39,197 --> 00:16:44,457
so it's Thanksgiving dinner somebody said anything about it. how we were off making plans

114
00:16:44,457 --> 00:16:49,577
the dog. you know still milk. and always other things and gradually

115
00:16:49,577 --> 00:16:54,617
people from the family would get up and leave in an hour later. so this

116
00:16:54,617 --> 00:16:59,637
is Hines. very smart very compassionate very carrying and

117
00:16:59,637 --> 00:17:05,237
he's developed Alzheimer's and one of the issues is that

118
00:17:05,237 --> 00:17:11,177
he lives in Maryland and I have done my neurology trainees and John's Hopkins and so

119
00:17:11,177 --> 00:17:16,679
we would take him an hour and fifteen minutes in the car which he really did not like

120
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:21,959
to go see world famous dementia specialist. as you know one of the best

121
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:27,439
hospitals in the United_States. this is not for treatment

122
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:33,179
for this disorder. and the medical model which we consist on in the United_States

123
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:38,279
really is completely able to deal with. so right at this

124
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:43,499
epidemic rise of cognitive disorders happen is people live longer

125
00:17:43,499 --> 00:17:49,099
and survive cancer and heart disease et_cetera whole week to get the message.

126
00:17:49,099 --> 00:17:54,179
we have a real problem and so we use to go on these trips. we will see these

127
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:59,279
people they would kinda make minor adjustments with his medications and one called side_effects

128
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:04,779
and didn't help him at all. we would come back to his home. where the people in hospice

129
00:18:04,779 --> 00:18:09,799
would really help him a_lot. right. it would be the nurse he would be the person who came

130
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:14,919
to to respite care to my mother in law. would be other

131
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:20,327
people came in here for is physical and social needs

132
00:18:20,327 --> 00:18:26,407
and that really helps the family and that was a really powerful influence on me because I really wondered

133
00:18:26,407 --> 00:18:31,407
about what happens to families that can't. I don't have

134
00:18:31,407 --> 00:18:36,447
the resources live in places where this doesn't exist don't know how. just that I don't have

135
00:18:36,447 --> 00:18:41,627
the economic means to you to ask for that. and so I decided

136
00:18:41,627 --> 00:18:46,947
that you know maybe it was time to look at this this order now that we had conquered

137
00:18:46,947 --> 00:18:51,967
stroke. no that wasn't quite but.

138
00:18:51,967 --> 00:18:57,047
so I think that the left here. do something that's important to you. right.

139
00:18:57,047 --> 00:19:02,307
you gotta do something that's gonna make you excited about driving to work every morning

140
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:08,027
and it's gonna make you wanna walk that laptop at nine o'clock at night after the kids are in bed

141
00:19:08,027 --> 00:19:14,903
and work at night and work on the weekends it has_to be something that is fundamentally

142
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:20,243
okay to reinvent yourself and meet your career as long as you have some sort of solid foundation.

143
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:25,343
I know whether. give me work today. I was taking a chance on

144
00:19:25,343 --> 00:19:31,543
working in another area that I really do next to nothing about.

145
00:19:31,543 --> 00:19:36,583
as an addition to to what to what I was ready working. so

146
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:41,623
what are we know about the message. so Ms. Parks. Missus

147
00:19:41,623 --> 00:19:46,703
Lee very bright and so forth. honey it's for me I'll just this thought.

148
00:19:46,703 --> 00:19:51,803
you know send off a_lot_of cell right. alright anywhere.

149
00:19:51,803 --> 00:19:56,841
just e-mail you too. two hundred million people in the world I

150
00:19:56,841 --> 00:20:02,121
have a message. right. the estimates are still buried because we actually

151
00:20:02,121 --> 00:20:07,241
help people our sunglasses are right. there's two doctors report

152
00:20:07,241 --> 00:20:12,681
and I and more more we see that positions are very reluctant to write in the chart

153
00:20:12,681 --> 00:20:17,821
for the patient has dementia because it's not a treatable disorder. and there's a statement

154
00:20:17,821 --> 00:20:23,341
attached to that. so you know this customer is fifty million is probably

155
00:20:23,341 --> 00:20:30,241
wall fully underestimated the true problem.

156
00:20:30,241 --> 00:20:35,461
the estimate is however a part of that this will increase monumental. so whatever it is now

157
00:20:35,461 --> 00:20:41,281
we will triple bye. thank you sir.

158
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:46,321
recently published data from the world health organization. is eight hundred eighteen billion or one

159
00:20:46,321 --> 00:20:51,441
percent of the gross domestic product one percent

160
00:20:51,441 --> 00:20:56,642
of every dollar we spend right now is on

161
00:20:56,642 --> 00:21:01,862
expected to be increased to two trillion five two thousand. there are very

162
00:21:01,862 --> 00:21:07,142
important things. first for those of us that are interested in health disparity is that

163
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:12,342
despite the fact that we don't have very busy. he developed countries and majority

164
00:21:12,342 --> 00:21:18,162
population. we know almost nothing about the impact of dementia on minority population

165
00:21:18,162 --> 00:21:23,422
in developing countries for the incident problem once

166
00:21:23,422 --> 00:21:28,622
and severity of the mentioned in the developing world. so there is so much

167
00:21:28,622 --> 00:21:34,022
work to be done in this area. okay.

168
00:21:34,022 --> 00:21:39,662
so let's review they need literature on positive impairment.

169
00:21:39,662 --> 00:21:44,662
it's bad. so I'm gonna service some general stations and then tell you about some of

170
00:21:44,662 --> 00:21:49,782
the specifics H Y and the research

171
00:21:49,782 --> 00:21:54,822
that you have. there is more of an association clogging of this order is with the vascular

172
00:21:54,822 --> 00:22:00,020
diseases like stroke as well as depression. been in the office about

173
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:05,280
a quite place. there is of association with

174
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:10,780
genetic factors particularly. April be used for wheels and honest

175
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:16,040
quite. it seems that baseline function may already be different

176
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:21,340
at the time. measurements is in Spain. but the trajectory of worsening

177
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:27,280
overtime seems to be similar in different recess.

178
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:32,340
and there's a suggestion with with Hispanics of their gas

179
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:37,440
education wall. it is associated with severity is not quite

180
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,580
as associated as it is and not a static white. so

181
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:48,160
another words education seems to be more of an important factor in non- Hispanic.

182
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:53,574
in relating to risk it dimension that it is.

183
00:22:53,574 --> 00:22:58,594
okay it's kinda still a little bit more deeply into this one of

184
00:22:58,594 --> 00:23:03,994
the interesting things although not much of this is knowing. a_lot_of it is University of Michigan stuff

185
00:23:03,994 --> 00:23:09,274
right. so a_lot_of it is on doing work. that is either happening now or you'll see some names

186
00:23:09,274 --> 00:23:14,994
of people who have spent a_lot_of time at the school Public Health years and are elsewhere

187
00:23:14,994 --> 00:23:20,074
at this time. so the health and retirement study as you know we received the largest grants

188
00:23:20,074 --> 00:23:25,534
that the University of Michigan passes. it's right to for for social research with

189
00:23:25,534 --> 00:23:31,314
lots of Collabera readers here at school Public Health and Medical School. in other place.

190
00:23:31,314 --> 00:23:36,694
so the health and retirement studies and other suggested changes and cognition. overtime

191
00:23:36,694 --> 00:23:42,134
are not associated with me. this is the way in appropriately adjusted.

192
00:23:42,134 --> 00:23:47,194
Michael Berry. alright which suggest that base line. you know if

193
00:23:47,194 --> 00:23:52,684
there are differences they say or hurry. at eight five

194
00:23:52,684 --> 00:23:59,144
hey and so the question then call well. if there are differences.

195
00:23:59,144 --> 00:24:04,324
three I'm not your friend. this is overall Saturday.

196
00:24:04,324 --> 00:24:09,644
explain this. based on education. alright. and then the other question

197
00:24:09,644 --> 00:24:14,904
which I'm particularly this is part of the pastors that are used to determine

198
00:24:14,904 --> 00:24:20,824
talking function. bye. bye. are they culturally inappropriate.

199
00:24:20,824 --> 00:24:25,904
do they win themselves for for easier

200
00:24:25,904 --> 00:24:31,824
and higher scores in people who are not Hispanic white. compared to Theresa Minard.

201
00:24:31,824 --> 00:24:37,064
so here's an example of the mini mental status exam as you know our president

202
00:24:37,064 --> 00:24:43,704
score a perfect thirty out_of thirty and this is. so therefore it must be an excellent exam.

203
00:24:43,704 --> 00:24:49,684
and what what this study would just

204
00:24:49,684 --> 00:24:55,888
as an example you

205
00:24:55,888 --> 00:25:00,928
message. there are several different questions here at which you can imagine if they were

206
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:06,368
use and minority populations particular immigrant population. may not

207
00:25:06,368 --> 00:25:11,408
be as easy to meet. people may

208
00:25:11,408 --> 00:25:16,428
not perform quite as well currently based on their culture. rather than on their commission. so

209
00:25:16,428 --> 00:25:21,548
for example. repeat the phrase no if answer. alright. so that's a very

210
00:25:21,548 --> 00:25:26,668
kind of and the low high percent rate. one of the things asked that.

211
00:25:26,668 --> 00:25:31,668
I mean three objects and ask people to remember them over for you six and I make

212
00:25:31,668 --> 00:25:36,928
shoes or things that I'm likely familiar with. not that the patient

213
00:25:36,928 --> 00:25:43,648
is familiar with some other things here are. I

214
00:25:43,648 --> 00:25:48,848
go through about you know copying pictures et_cetera et_cetera maybe related

215
00:25:48,848 --> 00:25:54,054
to specific educational practices and have nothing really to do with with

216
00:25:54,054 --> 00:25:59,234
talk mission. so again. we wonder whether there the baseline difference is the receiving ethnic

217
00:25:59,234 --> 00:26:04,294
populations or not. artifacts measurement.

218
00:26:04,294 --> 00:26:10,054
so Mary Hansel office day has been one of the leaders in looking at

219
00:26:10,054 --> 00:26:15,674
Hispanic cognitive performance and the estimates from this

220
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:20,874
long running forward study Mexican Americans in Sacramento.

221
00:26:20,874 --> 00:26:26,034
predominantly immigrant population. overall dimension from

222
00:26:26,034 --> 00:26:31,142
with the four point eight percent and those who are over the age of fifty nine what was

223
00:26:31,142 --> 00:26:36,203
founded in this publication. was that education. and this little

224
00:26:36,203 --> 00:26:41,223
culture was negatively associated with dementia right. so although this

225
00:26:41,223 --> 00:26:47,243
is not a comparison study Mexican American Life. education is still important.

226
00:26:47,243 --> 00:26:52,403
but as I said in comparative studies. it is Pete. it is been shown before

227
00:26:52,403 --> 00:26:58,283
the education. not important. the Mexican American population. as it is not it's been a quite.

228
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:03,323
and again this culture is University associate with the mention makes me

229
00:27:03,323 --> 00:27:11,463
worried. this is not just an artifact. the measurement of the past that

230
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:17,103
Mary and I have lots of conversations about this over the years. stroke was associated

231
00:27:17,103 --> 00:27:22,623
with anything. both increase risk of dementia. that's pretty astonished and suggest

232
00:27:22,623 --> 00:27:28,443
that it maybe a really important factor in Spanish. it's Mitch.

233
00:27:28,443 --> 00:27:33,923
so here's study from UCLA. this is Sarah Alzheimer's disease research

234
00:27:33,923 --> 00:27:39,972
Center which is eight very very well. one's a clinical research Center.

235
00:27:39,972 --> 00:27:45,132
and what they do in this particular study was they look at their population

236
00:27:45,132 --> 00:27:50,272
and they found out

237
00:27:50,272 --> 00:27:56,292
the year. the man is much younger. they're not

238
00:27:56,292 --> 00:28:01,652
what their conclusion here is that Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia

239
00:28:01,652 --> 00:28:06,692
occurs in the younger population. younger Hispanic population and then the

240
00:28:06,692 --> 00:28:17,212
non- Hispanic white. when you guys think of that.

241
00:28:17,212 --> 00:28:22,552
but he wanted to pay them. this is the clinic population.

242
00:28:22,552 --> 00:28:27,652
a single center study for Sherry Referral Center. Risa this

243
00:28:27,652 --> 00:28:33,252
is all based like to listen. they got. alright. and they happen to get this matter

244
00:28:33,252 --> 00:28:38,514
over or not it's not quite that has_to do with probably access issues referral

245
00:28:38,514 --> 00:28:43,534
virus et_cetera but there's no way you can include from conclude from a single center without

246
00:28:43,534 --> 00:28:49,014
any control that mentioned happened earlier in Hispanic then

247
00:28:49,014 --> 00:28:54,334
you not a static white. so there's a_lot_of literature out there like this.

248
00:28:54,334 --> 00:29:01,534
I think is is problematic and serve some more attention.

249
00:29:01,534 --> 00:29:07,514
okay. so I was up in formal caregivers who takes care of the patients

250
00:29:07,514 --> 00:29:14,114
who have mentioned. alright. and particularly in Hispanic population.

251
00:29:14,114 --> 00:29:19,194
so what has been shown. is that Hispanic family. the late institution

252
00:29:19,194 --> 00:29:24,394
location of love ones with dementia. compare with non- Hispanic way. alright. call us back twice

253
00:29:24,394 --> 00:29:29,394
are more likely to go to a nursing home sooner with dementia.

254
00:29:29,394 --> 00:29:34,494
then it's been interesting thing is that there's an interaction with

255
00:29:34,494 --> 00:29:39,668
this notion of positive aspects of. for Spanish families. derived

256
00:29:39,668 --> 00:29:45,728
more positive feelings of care giving the non- Hispanic white family.

257
00:29:45,728 --> 00:29:50,828
so if you kinda look at that interaction. hopefully

258
00:29:50,828 --> 00:29:55,828
there's a suggestion that maybe derived driving this is. you

259
00:29:55,828 --> 00:30:01,988
know what the caregivers caregivers.

260
00:30:01,988 --> 00:30:07,528
so many of you familiar with this notion of Hispanic families and the strong

261
00:30:07,528 --> 00:30:13,408
Hispanic family structure. also call family.

262
00:30:13,408 --> 00:30:18,628
and and we in a_lot_of writings. this is Minister

263
00:30:18,628 --> 00:30:24,368
Trudy this is Hispanic culture. is very positive part of the Spanish

264
00:30:24,368 --> 00:30:29,988
and may be part of the factors that that you asked why people with cognitive disorders

265
00:30:29,988 --> 00:30:35,068
or home rather than going to nursing home. also in recent studies has

266
00:30:35,068 --> 00:30:40,858
been associated with increased stress and Hispanic caregivers. and may reduce

267
00:30:40,858 --> 00:30:45,978
the educational attainment and jobs. that the Hispanic

268
00:30:45,978 --> 00:30:51,318
caregivers are able to to

269
00:30:51,318 --> 00:30:56,398
to do while they are providing the care and the question of course is the

270
00:30:56,398 --> 00:31:02,598
younger generation Hispanic Americans are providing care for this epidemic.

271
00:31:02,598 --> 00:31:08,238
the message will this perpetual way. the economic disparity is that occur

272
00:31:08,238 --> 00:31:14,138
in this country which is interesting topic to consider.

273
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:19,358
alright someone now turn my attention to this association. risk

274
00:31:19,358 --> 00:31:24,718
factors and stroke. with this concept of vascular

275
00:31:24,718 --> 00:31:29,798
dementia. so this I think is it's

276
00:31:29,798 --> 00:31:34,858
still my my favorite basic paper that Linda Road. years ago

277
00:31:34,858 --> 00:31:40,442
where we looked at outcome I'm on patients who it had stroke in Corpus_Christi

278
00:31:40,442 --> 00:31:45,542
Texas. and tried to determine not only issues as we

279
00:31:45,542 --> 00:31:50,782
had previously reported about mortality but in logic functional cognitive

280
00:31:50,782 --> 00:31:56,022
after right so stroke is the fifth leading cause of death is not safe for the number one cause of adult

281
00:31:56,022 --> 00:32:01,042
disability. right. so disability is a really important factor to

282
00:32:01,042 --> 00:32:06,442
think about when you think about stroke and what what we found

283
00:32:06,442 --> 00:32:11,742
here was looking at hospital the function Mexican American. again that's nine thirty

284
00:32:11,742 --> 00:32:17,402
one. you know I showed you before. I've scored about three. four

285
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:22,402
points worse than not it's been a quite a big difference. that's eight eight clinically

286
00:32:22,402 --> 00:32:27,622
significant difference for the two population. so Mexican Americans

287
00:32:27,622 --> 00:32:34,890
have worked calling about some after stroke compared to non- Hispanic whites

288
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:39,910
we looked at patients that was after three months and we look at patients after twelve months

289
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:45,390
following a stroke and we look at factors that relate to their cognitive else.

290
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:50,710
we find again. I'm really highly significant difference between Mexican American

291
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:55,990
to fair words the non- Hispanic white. obviously people who are older

292
00:32:55,990 --> 00:33:01,270
people. had a previous history of the cognitive dysfunction and people

293
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:06,690
who have worked stroke have worked cognitive out town. but you know controlling

294
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:12,050
for all that Mexican American still have my force talking about. compared

295
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:18,512
to non- Hispanic whites so

296
00:33:18,512 --> 00:33:23,652
the question is what is vascular dementia. alright. is it clearly distinguish

297
00:33:23,652 --> 00:33:28,712
from Alzheimer's disease and there have been like meetings and workshops for

298
00:33:28,712 --> 00:33:33,792
thirty years talking about this and nobody's really gotten anywhere. alright. people talk about

299
00:33:33,792 --> 00:33:38,872
the over lap syndrome. where the underline policy of Alzheimer's but slacks and

300
00:33:38,872 --> 00:33:44,132
sandals are complying with the vascular changes

301
00:33:44,132 --> 00:33:49,212
and parking brain. some people think that the fax and handles or call by

302
00:33:49,212 --> 00:33:54,252
lack of cerebral blood flow. so the call Valerie is very hard to figure

303
00:33:54,252 --> 00:33:59,932
out and all we know is that there is some sort of association

304
00:33:59,932 --> 00:34:05,032
and then the question is is vascular dementia. right if it's stroke related. is that

305
00:34:05,032 --> 00:34:11,097
due to the underlying master risk factors of hypertension the cost of all

306
00:34:11,097 --> 00:34:16,157
this is the fastest one stroke occurs it. it's takes out part of the brain and that part or

307
00:34:16,157 --> 00:34:21,698
is no longer usable and that affects our mission. or is there something totally independent.

308
00:34:21,698 --> 00:34:26,998
so I'm gonna explore those those three options. this is a

309
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:32,317
systematic review that that was published several years ago. bye. and the conclusion

310
00:34:32,317 --> 00:34:37,478
downstairs the effect of stroke and dementia incidents and the population. but explain my

311
00:34:37,478 --> 00:34:43,337
common respect. my counter intuitive. at the time of population agencies

312
00:34:43,337 --> 00:34:49,357
strokes about the more research is needed to determine what efforts to determine efforts to reduce

313
00:34:49,357 --> 00:34:55,817
faster associated dimensions with not. due to the risk factors and this is the matter review.

314
00:34:55,817 --> 00:35:00,978
so wanted you well. this is a genetic study which is kind

315
00:35:00,978 --> 00:35:05,998
of out_of my area of expertise but in this particular study they

316
00:35:05,998 --> 00:35:11,260
identified a probably more for some that was associated installation. you had mentioned

317
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:16,439
following stroke. generally trying to control for things like stroke severity

318
00:35:16,439 --> 00:35:21,859
location the stroke in those sites of things and they found that there maybe a genetic

319
00:35:21,859 --> 00:35:27,139
reason. not necessarily related to a police up site that relates

320
00:35:27,139 --> 00:35:32,359
to dementia. okay so this could be some totally independent. either

321
00:35:32,359 --> 00:35:37,619
stroke or. then there's this other

322
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:44,260
study and one of my favorite words I was five tomatoes. so things rose

323
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:49,779
there so that very long. we're do with this accident in the brain.

324
00:35:49,779 --> 00:35:54,959
there are Nuance on there the supporting sales call. for site.

325
00:35:54,959 --> 00:36:00,260
and this class not still in process is where the aster sites basically

326
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:05,339
go crazy and type in goals. my number on an calls distraction

327
00:36:05,339 --> 00:36:10,491
the bring this is for Jeff. it's that. what

328
00:36:10,491 --> 00:36:15,552
happens in vascular dementia. is a process. this

329
00:36:15,552 --> 00:36:21,052
is the top is just kind of regular garden variety stroke can you see

330
00:36:21,052 --> 00:36:26,172
kind of a process and dying back up and on but down here you can see more

331
00:36:26,172 --> 00:36:31,511
extensive damage here on the near imaging. and then

332
00:36:31,511 --> 00:36:36,531
if you look at a micron. my cross to be looked at. part of

333
00:36:36,531 --> 00:36:41,692
the brain. you can see that. basically the architecture of the cells have been

334
00:36:41,692 --> 00:36:46,951
completely destroyed. and that's this class manual.

335
00:36:46,951 --> 00:36:52,072
which again said yes a completely different mechanism not related to vascular risk factors for

336
00:36:52,072 --> 00:36:57,172
this. so the Framingham group.

337
00:36:57,172 --> 00:37:02,292
did a study and what they suggested is something little bit different right so so far

338
00:37:02,292 --> 00:37:07,483
we probably the independent aspect never gonna cover what strokes do this. alright. and what

339
00:37:07,483 --> 00:37:12,503
the Framingham Group basically said was that vascular risk

340
00:37:12,503 --> 00:37:17,844
or dementia risk rest after vascular events is all related to the

341
00:37:17,844 --> 00:37:23,424
amount of brain tissue that's involved and the number of brain in folks. okay.

342
00:37:23,424 --> 00:37:28,844
so they have this grass here which shows your wrist. missing

343
00:37:28,844 --> 00:37:35,924
here. and these are patients with Regent Park. these are people without

344
00:37:35,924 --> 00:37:41,483
me this is somewhat into it if if you destroy part of the brain fog work as well.

345
00:37:41,483 --> 00:37:46,503
but their argument here is that the underline problem is not risk factors not

346
00:37:46,503 --> 00:37:53,803
something independent but just the amount and the number of brain fart static

347
00:37:53,803 --> 00:37:59,983
another study. this is the medical review from from Peter Ross well.

348
00:37:59,983 --> 00:38:05,114
look at factors associated with with post Road. mention

349
00:38:05,114 --> 00:38:11,013
and again fifty Solutions there. this is Missus Maddox with you. where is that.

350
00:38:11,013 --> 00:38:16,193
you know ten percent of patient had dementia before stroke ten percent. I've developed

351
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:21,773
dementia after stroke and also role

352
00:38:21,773 --> 00:38:26,933
here at the event. again it struck right that like the brain and fart

353
00:38:26,933 --> 00:38:31,993
people from Framingham they're suggesting that the spring part of the brain is bad

354
00:38:31,993 --> 00:38:37,094
for cognition. so putting it all together in this

355
00:38:37,094 --> 00:38:42,134
guideline statement. this is the last time and there's been a guideline statement about

356
00:38:42,134 --> 00:38:47,134
vascular dementia. this panel of experts. reviewed

357
00:38:47,134 --> 00:38:52,174
all the evidence and suggested the third that

358
00:38:52,174 --> 00:38:57,174
right so we talked about. I'll be in Japan that we talked about stroke. they concluded that

359
00:38:57,174 --> 00:39:02,174
it was a risk factors for Chick-fil-A hypertension and suggested that aggressive

360
00:39:02,174 --> 00:39:07,191
treatment of hypertension was the most important thing and trying to reduce

361
00:39:07,191 --> 00:39:13,751
I've ask you. try to reduce dementia after stroke.

362
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:19,332
okay. and just to to firm that up. this was

363
00:39:19,332 --> 00:39:24,451
another study that the cohort study looking at people after stroke

364
00:39:24,451 --> 00:39:30,451
and they found. you know important association

365
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:35,491
stroke event and perhaps blood pressure but they really thought that the mechanism here with

366
00:39:35,491 --> 00:39:41,572
that hypertension cost growth and then stroke all to match. so

367
00:39:41,572 --> 00:39:49,211
you know look it up see if we call a little diagram here maybe pretty complex

368
00:39:49,211 --> 00:39:54,607
or part alright so I wanna

369
00:39:54,607 --> 00:39:59,728
spend the last few minutes before we have a discussion talking about our new study and trying

370
00:39:59,728 --> 00:40:04,927
to put a_lot_of these things that I told you about together and that is basic target

371
00:40:04,927 --> 00:40:09,948
is. and so this is the lovely communities that we work in Corpus_Christi

372
00:40:09,948 --> 00:40:15,427
Texas is perfectly lovely at this time of year not as much of the summer but

373
00:40:15,427 --> 00:40:20,568
we've been working down there since been nineteen nineties. and really enjoyed

374
00:40:20,568 --> 00:40:25,627
working in this population. so basic carpet just started

375
00:40:25,627 --> 00:40:30,808
September of two thousand seventeen it's a five year NIH Grant find

376
00:40:30,808 --> 00:40:35,988
it by. and I and he asked specifically in search

377
00:40:35,988 --> 00:40:41,087
of use door-to-door community based case ascertain man and wanted to know follow up to

378
00:40:41,087 --> 00:40:46,268
determine the problem was and for Jack for parking impairment and dementia. among Mexican

379
00:40:46,268 --> 00:40:51,328
Americans and not a Spanish voice in this community so yes we're doing bread and butter if an e-mail and

380
00:40:51,328 --> 00:40:56,356
see where we were literally knocked on ten thousand doors ask people if

381
00:40:56,356 --> 00:41:01,636
there's anybody who is sixty five or over in the house and then do a

382
00:41:01,636 --> 00:41:06,737
call me to screen to determine if they have talked to Mark Herman. and then follow

383
00:41:06,737 --> 00:41:12,277
those people forward for two years. so that at

384
00:41:12,277 --> 00:41:17,356
the first issue and that is that we really don't have good problem. estimate of dementia.

385
00:41:17,356 --> 00:41:22,896
in any population but certainly in minority. our processes

386
00:41:22,896 --> 00:41:27,937
are the Mexican American web board to mention the non- Hispanic white and that

387
00:41:27,937 --> 00:41:32,977
the biggest ethnic difference is will be in people sixty five seventy five. rather

388
00:41:32,977 --> 00:41:38,277
than in those schools. we got we think education will be a really

389
00:41:38,277 --> 00:41:43,317
important pastor in the community we will not only be studying like

390
00:41:43,317 --> 00:41:48,437
level of education achieved but the quality of that education where they went to school

391
00:41:48,437 --> 00:41:53,695
because we think that that makes a big second specific Amos

392
00:41:53,695 --> 00:41:58,695
the study and the amount of distribution and characteristic of informal caregiver for dementia. among these

393
00:41:58,695 --> 00:42:04,015
groups and I process this is a Mexican American in formal caregivers report more

394
00:42:04,015 --> 00:42:09,075
of a burden for Smith one physical help answer more impairment in where

395
00:42:09,075 --> 00:42:14,475
they're trying to go in their lives. more difficulty. we need their education. more difficulty

396
00:42:14,475 --> 00:42:19,775
in achieving the job since they want the cost. they are care giving. however we also

397
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:24,955
expect fully that Mexican Americans will report more positive aspects of care

398
00:42:24,955 --> 00:42:32,354
giving as well. so this information will be useful for both population.

399
00:42:32,354 --> 00:42:37,615
the final specific aim is to determine the community resource is most needed by patients and families to care

400
00:42:37,615 --> 00:42:42,834
for those with dementia and differences in these plans. this is I mentioned before that

401
00:42:42,834 --> 00:42:48,195
with my father in law was most important to us was not what the doctor said.

402
00:42:48,195 --> 00:42:53,528
at a famous institution with the people in the community. who provided help

403
00:42:53,528 --> 00:42:58,628
resources respite et_cetera that we

404
00:42:58,628 --> 00:43:03,668
thought was most important and we worried that access may be different by assistant answers we will

405
00:43:03,668 --> 00:43:08,828
be investigating that and through a rigorous mix message approach needs

406
00:43:08,828 --> 00:43:13,828
available resources in the gaps between the needs and resources can be identified. is our

407
00:43:13,828 --> 00:43:18,948
help. so here is our kind of framework

408
00:43:18,948 --> 00:43:24,568
for for how we're approaching this. know if our goal is for

409
00:43:24,568 --> 00:43:29,768
individual physical and psychological help. there are many factors

410
00:43:29,768 --> 00:43:36,168
right that that have some influence. there are medical factors. there are demographic

411
00:43:36,168 --> 00:43:41,348
things that we can't control but there are lot of issues related to

412
00:43:41,348 --> 00:43:46,808
the community policies to being able to provide resources

413
00:43:46,808 --> 00:43:51,826
and support that we think very much. bye. in our control one because this

414
00:43:51,826 --> 00:43:56,947
is such a tremendously expensive disease. anything that could be done to

415
00:43:56,947 --> 00:44:02,066
improve the care of patients and have them delivered home in a way

416
00:44:02,066 --> 00:44:07,106
that the in formal caregivers can also arrive. I think be very

417
00:44:07,106 --> 00:44:12,207
be very useful. so here the instruments that we're gonna use sent in one

418
00:44:12,207 --> 00:44:17,487
of the other really fascinating aspects of this work is that the primary instrument that we're using

419
00:44:17,487 --> 00:44:22,507
to determine the dementia face is a very sumner card and a test call

420
00:44:22,507 --> 00:44:27,527
the H cap is a newly developed battery. the health and retirement

421
00:44:27,527 --> 00:44:32,727
study. that's put forward but it has no they have not

422
00:44:32,727 --> 00:44:37,906
yet finalize their data. so we actually got our study funded before

423
00:44:37,906 --> 00:44:43,007
benchmark and numbers were computers to say what was dimension what was. which made

424
00:44:43,007 --> 00:44:48,123
it very hard especially sample size and and do a bunch of other things the cool thing

425
00:44:48,123 --> 00:44:53,302
about ASAP C. it's being used around the world. there's a study in Mexico there's a in

426
00:44:53,302 --> 00:44:58,422
of the study. if you're interested doing it in the United_States. so there will be this opportunity

427
00:44:58,422 --> 00:45:04,242
for global comparisons. including our population. the new voice system.

428
00:45:04,242 --> 00:45:10,522
as you can tell we will you know be looking at a number of issues related to families and corporation.

429
00:45:10,522 --> 00:45:16,002
I caregiver assessment and we will have this opportunity to follow both the subject

430
00:45:16,002 --> 00:45:21,802
and the caregivers for two years. repeat the instrument so that we can analyze the trajectory

431
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:26,962
of their conditions. so here are the numbers which which

432
00:45:26,962 --> 00:45:32,143
may actually be under estimate. we plan to knock on at least

433
00:45:32,143 --> 00:45:37,383
ten thousand doors and we plans also involved nursing home residence

434
00:45:37,383 --> 00:45:42,442
most studies of dementia only include communities walling subjects but since we've been

435
00:45:42,442 --> 00:45:47,682
working in this community so long and have relationships with the nursing homes so also going to nursing homes

436
00:45:47,682 --> 00:45:52,787
to help our estimates are prevalent and as we

437
00:45:52,787 --> 00:45:57,806
as you kinda go through this diagram you can see there certain factors people won't answer the door

438
00:45:57,806 --> 00:46:02,846
they wanna agree to participate in one degree for one hour. we hope in the

439
00:46:02,846 --> 00:46:08,247
end you have almost eight hundred. subject to that. we will follow up then and

440
00:46:08,247 --> 00:46:14,787
also have their caregivers for this to your to your file.

441
00:46:14,787 --> 00:46:19,866
so as I mentioned I'm new with this and I've already made some mistakes and I keep finding

442
00:46:19,866 --> 00:46:25,467
other mistakes I've made. so I have the audacity to plan a huge

443
00:46:25,467 --> 00:46:30,487
study. never psychology but I'm not in her psychologist and we didn't have any on the

444
00:46:30,487 --> 00:46:35,591
on the application and I can't believe the review panel that is fine. but

445
00:46:35,591 --> 00:46:40,871
fortunately Emily Percy now has agreed to be a nurse psychologist

446
00:46:40,871 --> 00:46:46,010
and it's been a great job on that. I didn't put any budget for all

447
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:51,250
the instrument licenses or supplies to do these things because I'm not a nurse psychologist.

448
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:56,371
so we're kinda digging in the budget to find that. but that's okay as well.

449
00:46:56,371 --> 00:47:01,510
and even though I am a clinician. I really kinda neglected the idea that we're not measuring

450
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:06,891
blood pressure and part of the concern is that one population ninth manic wife

451
00:47:06,891 --> 00:47:12,031
may know more about their hypertension history than the Mexican American population. so we're trying to figure out now

452
00:47:12,031 --> 00:47:17,451
what to do about blood pressure because as I mentioned some people feel it's really important.

453
00:47:17,451 --> 00:47:22,591
bye. so this list now has three major and about four hundred. minor things

454
00:47:22,591 --> 00:47:27,691
on it. but everyday I'm like when's the next major one gonna show up and

455
00:47:27,691 --> 00:47:33,371
and that is the just advantage of not being the expert and embarking on something

456
00:47:33,371 --> 00:47:38,536
new like this important again. my father

457
00:47:38,536 --> 00:47:44,196
in law here. who is the main reason why

458
00:47:44,196 --> 00:47:49,696
I'm doing this and I think that we owe it to treat people like this to continue to

459
00:47:49,696 --> 00:47:54,956
try to figure out an answer to this problem and

460
00:47:54,956 --> 00:48:01,016
help all of us in the future. so here's the basic cognitive

461
00:48:01,016 --> 00:48:06,016
investigator. team are also really really happy to have the Saber Group. you

462
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:11,056
and all of our data base working doing it really well and be more than

463
00:48:11,056 --> 00:48:16,696
happy to hear your questions your comments and invite your participation in our study.

464
00:48:16,696 --> 00:48:34,716
thank you

465
00:48:34,716 --> 00:48:39,936
so we're like. so we doing the training right now and that's okay.

466
00:48:39,936 --> 00:48:45,055
and I start putting together the sampling frame so they're gonna tell us you know which of the ten

467
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:50,115
thousand houses we have_to go to and we're doing things like

468
00:48:50,115 --> 00:48:55,775
going to the police and saying hey we're gonna knock in ten thousand houses. you know I'm gonna call the police.

469
00:48:55,775 --> 00:49:01,135
where were the good guys since there's so many different boxes. check

470
00:49:01,135 --> 00:49:10,795
as we go along but we hope to actually start in about three weeks.

471
00:49:10,795 --> 00:49:26,755
bye.

472
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:32,055
yeah. so that's a very good question we are not collecting bio samples.

473
00:49:32,055 --> 00:49:37,654
we had planned to. thank allied and

474
00:49:37,654 --> 00:49:42,714
the first of this week that was submitted the first time and she's got like

475
00:49:42,714 --> 00:49:47,974
eight or four fifty fifth percentile mostly because they were upset

476
00:49:47,974 --> 00:49:52,974
at the fact that we were banking blood samples and basically the only thing we get from

477
00:49:52,974 --> 00:49:58,154
the first the second submission was take out that and we got eight percent. so I don't

478
00:49:58,154 --> 00:50:03,194
really understand they thought it was not supposed to collect a line. unless you knew what you

479
00:50:03,194 --> 00:50:08,974
were gonna do what we had proposed we said that you know there were his interest in.

480
00:50:08,974 --> 00:50:14,194
I think we mentioned there at toxicology stuff. we will talk more about genetic thing

481
00:50:14,194 --> 00:50:19,914
and you know we supposed to kinda be identify it. thanks a blood and let

482
00:50:19,914 --> 00:50:25,234
people look at it but they don't like that. so

483
00:50:25,234 --> 00:50:31,074
probably will have have had some issues and answers that you haven't started. so you know

484
00:50:31,074 --> 00:50:36,088
if there people if you're interested in that this is Mike. you know maybe it

485
00:50:36,088 --> 00:50:58,348
was just that particular review panel that needs to be bias against file samples.

486
00:50:58,348 --> 00:51:03,568
so if you have any questions. online

487
00:51:03,568 --> 00:51:11,028
my knowledge base. you know.

488
00:51:11,028 --> 00:51:17,908
anyway. this is an exercise.

489
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:23,188
the only

490
00:51:23,188 --> 00:51:55,049
thing. yeah she's around. bye
