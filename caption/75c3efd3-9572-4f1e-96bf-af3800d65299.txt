1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:05,520
The focus of this is this semester we talk about most of the domestic issues.

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:10,230
Drinking water. But using what we know is just.

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:19,180
The United States is always and good and the missions the UN and the United Nations

4
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:24,820
declare that access to safe and cool water is the best way to get access to more rights.

5
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:34,059
Okay, so that means also the government has to play to to provide to provide physical office to this public.

6
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:39,850
And they can use also the pressure to pressure the governments to say you have to do something to improve the workforce.

7
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:45,730
So now the question is why can some developing countries have the same drinking water as the Western countries have?

8
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:56,480
The question is why they cannot have the. What we have here. Funding.

9
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,470
Funding. Resources and materials.

10
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:17,420
And resources. Materials. Economically, it seems developing means that they have probably a lax.

11
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:23,669
Regulation, which means industries are more likely to pollute more with social water.

12
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,670
Basically, a source of water is contaminated by.

13
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:38,420
Based off the result of regulations there might not be any early might not be like we have to have the Clean Water Act to the safety net.

14
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:45,010
Yeah. The policy. Ah, yeah.

15
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:54,890
But we were just talking about all this. Um, usually in developing countries and cities in the U.S., wealth was really concentrated.

16
00:01:55,430 --> 00:02:00,800
It was like a very large gap. So there may be like some people have access to clean water.

17
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:07,550
That's going to be like the extraction of resources and the that's issue.

18
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:14,180
And then what we also see there's a lot of conflicts worldwide.

19
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:22,820
So if there was something, then they they have no intention to give up this infrastructure provided for.

20
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,450
Okay. So here's the rough. Just measure your resources.

21
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,610
Maintain the resources, just political stability.

22
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:39,360
And then the the sometimes they have the sparse reserves like in the remote areas.

23
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:46,020
It's very good for some areas. Okay. There we have very difficult to provide the water that we have as we have here.

24
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,020
When we talk about deep water issues, the effects, it's a feeling that you see from health issues as well.

25
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:56,909
And every Detroit sometime that people cannot get access to clean water as long as it's

26
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,690
provided by resources because the financial situation they may not be able to have.

27
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:06,780
But even some of the areas, for example, in the United States, I'm just talking about emerging population areas.

28
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:15,270
And in the in the California of California, sometimes they also don't have access to the the is speaking of Central Valley.

29
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:25,020
They don't really have the civil war on civil war. However, for some people here, we have a conflict on that with the true I mean, you know,

30
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:30,780
like they choose poetry three and then they say why they don't access to the country to try

31
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:39,630
to get pretty remote and to just do the pipes for them because who care for it basically.

32
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:49,470
So so there's there's a there's a lot of issues here of what next week, next Wednesday, we'll talk about the water, water, the rivers on this area.

33
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,210
I mean, visual, click to the seashore. But sometimes it's just it's all this.

34
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,360
So, yes, that's the.

35
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:11,140
If you think about the situation here, you know, this almost 1 billion people that don't have access to the to the informal workforce.

36
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:17,530
Let's talk about what is improved workforce. Almost 2 billion people.

37
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:21,070
We have we have already have 8 billion people worldwide.

38
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:33,040
Okay. That's alarming numbers. Now, a billion people think about us, almost 25%, one quarter of people use it to convert to contaminated.

39
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,890
So the deaths from diarrhea attributed on safe drinking water.

40
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:49,070
Okay, that's the worldwide. And then Nakia, the children are five years old, died from diarrhea.

41
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:53,900
It's almost 1 million people. It used to be like 2 million people die from waterborne diseases.

42
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:58,590
But here, just for the diarrhea here, it's almost like in 100,000.

43
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,890
So it is a pretty high numbers here. Think about this.

44
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:17,230
So if you look at this people like by from on age five like attribute to the diarrhea and they think about here

45
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:26,380
look at this number the areas really in the south is south south Asian countries and the African countries.

46
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,740
And then because of our safe water, I mean, then we know that most most of the diarrhea,

47
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:39,099
over 90% of this attribute to this to the to the unsafe water.

48
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:48,340
And then you can see, as we reduce the children under five years old that die from diarrhea, it was a percentage of die from diarrhea.

49
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,910
It's pretty high still now nowadays.

50
00:05:53,570 --> 00:06:01,430
And then you see the discrepancy in most of the African countries and then in the Asian some some South Asian,

51
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:06,990
Southeast Asian countries, it pretty high. Okay.

52
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:14,840
And you can see here that scroll is pretty good.

53
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:20,030
Proportion of people that use it for drinking water source in the vicinity is only 50.

54
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:26,750
And then if you look at these maps overlaps pretty good that the if you don't have the safe water.

55
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:34,040
Yes. Then judging on five years olds die from diarrhea is pretty common there.

56
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:42,340
So now what's what what do we see the improves future to?

57
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:47,960
They're not talking about this the same thing you want to see and save what we have here.

58
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:55,400
Okay. We talk about in particular. So that's how we define the drinking water source.

59
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:03,710
A by virtue of proper use, adequately protect the source from outside of contamination, particularly vitamins.

60
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:10,130
So basically this is adequate to protect the source from outside contamination.

61
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:18,930
Okay. That's called improver. We are not talking about privilege here for for United States.

62
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:23,820
It's a much more painful process. Provide sufficient treatment.

63
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,570
It's one of the key. One of the key. But here the enforcer says, you know,

64
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:42,390
we protect the the the source of the water from outside contamination and the fecal contamination, especially for fabric.

65
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:45,520
That mission that's impromptu towards source. Okay.

66
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:49,630
So here's the piper water, the 20 yard approach.

67
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:55,330
This is from drinking water. Drinking water. Public taps. Stan Pipes.

68
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,040
Tap wells. Protect the wells. Rainwater collections.

69
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:07,190
So all you were doing was force. If you think about us, unprotected, unprotected.

70
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:17,240
Every car with small tank surface of water, just directly with a sip of water that's not improved and bottled water.

71
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:22,130
So why think the bottled water is not the improved drinking water?

72
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,730
It's not sustainable. Not sustainable. That's one of one thing.

73
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:40,130
So the drinking water took up a whole topic up on the board over here and talk in details.

74
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:43,970
But what water? Water. It's not really all the same.

75
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:45,620
Talk about the bottle,

76
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:52,610
what its value is dramatically and sometimes that people just boil water from the river or from the tap and they say That's all we want.

77
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:59,000
Or somehow we have my procurement process to remove and they have the bottled water.

78
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:09,870
Okay, so. While the world cannot consider as a as a improves due to Warsaw's.

79
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:22,690
So the. The. Even with that ever, with this, the so-called impure water, they still have this contamination.

80
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:34,770
The difference. Contamination of the the fiscal mature so so we can improve the workforce.

81
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:44,160
We try to improve that. So the situation here is always you still see the water that's contaminated from

82
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:49,200
the improve our source so that also we improve also source a fifth okay computer.

83
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:56,170
So that's the you see the numbers here. So I just mentioned again, that's the situation always.

84
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:02,770
But now the U.N. has a resolution in July 2010.

85
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:08,620
Clean drinking water and sanitation are essential to the realization of all human rights.

86
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:22,129
So the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights defines the rights to water as a right for everyone of everyone to a sufficient,

87
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:28,400
safe, acceptable and physical, accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic use.

88
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:40,650
So if the environment in which a person or community lives and is not suitable for clean water,

89
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:49,049
does that resolution demand the country to implement wastewater treatment plants in that

90
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:54,000
area so that it provides water as a right regardless of the environmental conditions?

91
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:59,370
So so they are not talking about sanitation here.

92
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:06,180
Okay. The resolution, as I noted here, is talking about access to clean and safe water.

93
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:10,330
Okay. Well, I've had sanitation in it, so.

94
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:20,220
Yeah, I mean, the the does that mean that the clean drinking water and sanitation that's best that's where you have to access to clean your.

95
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:28,540
But the sanitation is the basic sanitation is very much bigger than the cure.

96
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:37,069
So the most work. Focused on the drinking water, on the waste water signs.

97
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:43,790
Yes, but it's much less, much less. So this risks engaging, which means really negative.

98
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,430
You have a lot of cooler heads. Wash your hands.

99
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,150
It's not like so many nights you have all these, like, sewage system.

100
00:11:54,210 --> 00:12:04,160
Talking about. Okay. So you can have like a process or a building that just provides clean drinking water but doesn't treat anything yet.

101
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:10,340
Yeah, that's the that's the that's the the situation, the reality of the situation.

102
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,820
Wouldn't it be just better to just implement both processes and solve it?

103
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:20,329
That's great idea. That's really great. I mean, I'm sure people could do that.

104
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:29,200
Right. But the the in terms of the investment of this is much less because they have to emphasize to me, if you look at this,

105
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:38,450
what we have the map theory of people access to safe drinking water, the percentages are much higher than the sanitation system actually goes in.

106
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:48,000
Right. The reason for that is. You know, in many countries they know the judicial sure to talk about it.

107
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:55,950
I mean, how could the people by the elites waste the police officers, any of us, if we don't use something?

108
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:01,460
And then if you think about it, some countries have this, they have the open defecation.

109
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:11,360
But a common practice is open defecation. Okay. So now what is the safe water?

110
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:15,390
The human rights of the water? Like the how?

111
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:19,550
550 to 100 meters water within a certain distance.

112
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:26,030
Uh, 30 minutes. And then some images from this.

113
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:34,700
That's that's of course the the. Access to safe water or at least basic human rights.

114
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:43,070
So that means I mean, this also indicates that now we can press the government because you have this resolution,

115
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:49,730
so we can present governments to comply, to abide to this resolution, and then need to provide security.

116
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:56,780
And before ever before we do that in whatever place is essential.

117
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:05,710
But now because we say this is. Basic human rights are essential now to the realization of all human rights.

118
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:14,030
I mean, that's really the key to this, right? So think about in this country the whole way.

119
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:21,090
Go to in the war. In remote areas.

120
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:27,860
How they can give the water to the woman. Children who chose my mice appear to want.

121
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:34,410
Okay. I mean, if because that's the loss of the opportunity, that's the reason why we think for you to step in on.

122
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:37,030
Want you to realize the basic human rights.

123
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:54,920
So here is also a link to the Millennium Development Goal here, reduced by two thirds to two on five on the five and on five mortality rates.

124
00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:01,250
And then we'll also talk about the project population without sustainable access to safe drinking water reduced by half.

125
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:10,490
So that's the Millennium Development Goal in 2015 with in terms of whether we achieve this goal, yes, yes or no.

126
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:15,440
Some countries yes, I checked. I go to some countries. Okay.

127
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,170
You basically say reduced by half.

128
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:29,690
This is to start and then the other accesses the half so that the are you go here for them which is on the 15 coverage,

129
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:34,220
about 91% of your life is pretty good. I mean, you see this improvement.

130
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:43,790
You see the improvement here. That's pretty good. But in Tucson, the 515 and the coverage is about 91% worldwide.

131
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:48,140
But the varies from country to country varies from country to country.

132
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:57,200
Now, with represses, the Millennium Development Goal, we have the sustainable development goal here by 2020,

133
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:02,900
reduce the number of this illness from how those chemicals air water soluble Louisiana contaminants.

134
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:12,510
Achieved by 2030, achieve universal, equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all.

135
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:16,560
Because that's the the goal here, the sustainable development goal here.

136
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:27,700
Okay. So. 1250 was a reduced half an hour with everyone should have the access to a safe, clean water.

137
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:35,860
By 2030 I just mentioned, this varies pretty dramatically from country to country to achieve this goal.

138
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:42,130
But overall, yes, we do see pretty good improvements in some of the coverage.

139
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,600
91% of the people have improved to acceptably improve drinking water.

140
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:55,800
Again, when people want to remember improve, important people are not in need of a system and we have to protect ourselves.

141
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:08,270
Other measures. But but again, because low income countries may have economic, physical water, insecurity, cost of beauty,

142
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:14,600
lack of water quality, lack of multiple barrier drinking water imbalance that cannot have these issues.

143
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:23,280
And also, they may have the political stability issues and especially among resources, for example, to build this for this.

144
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,709
So the issue they have, for example, is imports of water.

145
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:35,620
For example, here when we were here in the United States by the Safe Drinking Water Act, where you try to identify the peace of the social order.

146
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:40,160
We have reached the one party of the day that we use ourselves for to you want.

147
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:45,790
But in a lot of cases, they have no choice. Okay.

148
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:49,760
Now, mutuals, easy access for social water, for example, is like that.

149
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:53,900
And then sure, you have to ask for the social.

150
00:17:55,610 --> 00:18:03,200
For transportation, one of since they have the transport, the water, and then they have to use these baskets,

151
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:11,210
for example, for transport use for this transport for far ways to get the water.

152
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:17,940
And then this is how the stories and then the stories home.

153
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:22,440
And then kids will probably play to give second level contamination.

154
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:27,230
So that's all the issues. And then here, probably the junior, what he can have is no coffee.

155
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,980
Okay. It's no coffee.

156
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:38,710
It's going to have some places. So you should have one of the key and a safe drinking water.

157
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,140
So how do we realize this?

158
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:49,720
How do we provide a safe and more so in the United States, the developed countries where we have we have a centralized portion of this.

159
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:58,250
We have a development. The first thing you need to provide it's future what you want.

160
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:06,500
So we use centralized system. So you change the water in some areas and then industry is disappeared.

161
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:16,040
That's because a centralized drinking water system. Can we provide to the centralized drinking water system?

162
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:20,150
Yes or no in some process like that.

163
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:28,100
That's this is the one of the typical example you kind of me one night when I was a kid here, when I grew up there.

164
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:33,680
We don't make it easy for my system. We go to the river water to get.

165
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:40,400
Okay. Sometimes we use some cooperation to cooperate the water.

166
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:46,160
But then what do we do most is going to avoid one way or another.

167
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:51,139
But as the central nervous system and in that remote areas I remember.

168
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:55,130
And another key to repay the war all the time.

169
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,520
Would you let the water there? Do you want to deregulate?

170
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:07,860
And we would give the new system to this. Okay. So we are okay among a few that will give us some of that we really think about.

171
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:12,120
Got close by the water we have no no information about that.

172
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:15,830
You no knowledge about it. Okay. But now we are looking back.

173
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:21,980
Okay, so that's the that's all the case we are to give it all improved.

174
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:27,870
Give your father's access to the info before August nine.

175
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:40,080
But in a way they let lot of YouTube now with all this. Now they do it on a centralized system in many locations, even in my hometown,

176
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:46,090
that we have the tap water for many years to come and take it to the extent of the tap water running the tap water there.

177
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:49,590
So which is great improvements for that. So.

178
00:20:55,330 --> 00:21:08,470
To have the if you have the resources you have probably of the population density, the best approach for drinking water is to adjust the this.

179
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:21,550
Okay to preserve the public schools. The security system is a good way to get somebody paid by the effective system is a good way of doing this.

180
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:30,130
There's a lot of ways because we have the expertize and we have the disposal of the mail to make sure that the treatment process.

181
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:34,580
Is it working? It started. Okay.

182
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:39,080
This is why we just use everyone to do one at home.

183
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:42,800
But, you know, that could vary dramatically from person to person.

184
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:47,360
I mean, we already have so many.

185
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:52,490
You have a centralized system and then you have these people who are professional who can really

186
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:59,450
make sure that you process involved and then that everyone can have access to that water,

187
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:08,600
which is great. So, so, so again, the centralized system is still a good system to abide to if we have the conditions for that.

188
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:18,170
So this is one of the examples here. In such an area, they use such a so surprised like.

189
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:28,770
55 million people in China use the centralized system to develop the centralized system for that purpose.

190
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:37,730
But again, now in our president, we talk about the kind of already developed decision system.

191
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:43,880
The decision system. So what you can do and then we'll have to use decentralized system for that purpose.

192
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:50,200
Especially a point of use of the system for them as for that purpose.

193
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:55,760
You remember that when Brian's here asking you a question?

194
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:09,440
So, you know, it was tried to move the press, but we try to bring the press down to zero points, ten PPC or whatever the number of it that they have.

195
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:16,370
But then we use our water. Q What are the loans for the invasion covers?

196
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:19,810
What would be? Why would you?

197
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,660
Why we just have the separatist in no particular order.

198
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:31,250
We choose the future war for that purpose and then the other world.

199
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:36,580
We can use less strict rules or criteria, but we don't do that.

200
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:45,080
That's just going to make our water sources more polluted or it's like the starting point of where we have to live.

201
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:49,890
Yeah. Okay. Yeah. That's the one of the concerns that people say, well, we have already too much.

202
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:52,310
So and that could be the side effects from that.

203
00:23:53,410 --> 00:24:00,670
The real deal, real concern here is really if you have if you want to go to Sephora, a distribution system.

204
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:07,000
Right to separate. We have to compare the two separate experiences.

205
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:11,550
Not to cause you to do that. Okay.

206
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:19,370
Too close to the. We think about different approach values, maybe use our discipline system for that.

207
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:25,070
Not really the party system, use our system, but talk about making the best use for.

208
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:31,090
Okay. And then, moreover, it becomes another concern. We'll talk about another concern.

209
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:41,960
Great. So so overall in the United States, for example, we said ever we saw wow, we spent $5 million in this area originally speaking to us.

210
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:48,090
So we don't really want to change that because we still can do it.

211
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:54,460
Quite you. I mean, how about getting rid of the volume of the water we produce and distribute?

212
00:24:55,010 --> 00:25:00,410
I mean, everyone we said every year we spend $2 million dollar gain in Arabic.

213
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:06,980
But if you think about it, how much of what we produced, used and then was produced as very cheap.

214
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:12,470
So we don't really need to. What do you do to change that?

215
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:19,580
Evan Everyone, sometimes I think that's kind of a waste. So.

216
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:26,110
But. But here. Now. Now. I said, can we do something like.

217
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:32,400
We'd start you off your work here. And then each at home we use a point of use devices for purpose.

218
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,770
To remove the content. You may not. You are doing that anyway.

219
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:42,770
Okay, we're doing that anyway. But as a as a tug of war system, we cannot rely on.

220
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:49,670
But it is effective, but it cannot be allowed, especially in the United States.

221
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:58,940
We will only rely on the filters. We rely mainly on the treatment process to make sure that what might have been or not U.S. rely on

222
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:06,290
the point of use device on this emergency situations of funds that provide the filter for that.

223
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:12,290
But that's not very reliable. If we let this magical barrier approach for that purpose.

224
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:19,020
But in the countries like we cannot really go this particular system, then you have to use point of view.

225
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:25,670
Okay. You have to use point of use devices for for this that's highly recommended.

226
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:30,530
So decentralize, really small scale, tremendous distribution of water.

227
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:33,470
That's household a community level. Okay.

228
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:43,390
Point of use, horror or device, typically treating like a 25 liters per person per bed port of entry point of use.

229
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:47,800
Basically basically means on the tab point of entry for companies.

230
00:26:47,830 --> 00:27:00,670
House House. The one getting the most every significant one that is being port of entry system can also these a small scale system in the community.

231
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:07,300
For example if you have the. Apartment buildings.

232
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:16,390
Okay. You know, you guys, you everybody that we know that's in many places, they have the high apartment buildings like here.

233
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:23,980
Right. See all this hype? I really miss it. We put apartment building west of Washington to.

234
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:34,230
As most of the media system and basically it's pretty common practice is that two people would come downstairs.

235
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:43,720
It was forced to do that by the water, by water to get whatever and every bit so they don't really.

236
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:51,860
Now on to the one self, but it goes into the to the community level system to buy.

237
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,839
So that's the small scale system that's pretty efficient.

238
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,740
Also, it's a point of use in the in the.

239
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:12,100
In the summer. So quite a few filters they are using, for example, here because of the ceramic filters.

240
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:16,720
This is how they do and this is what they have.

241
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,839
This is the filter animals here, like the filters.

242
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:27,190
And most of these look at these elements here and they have to have water adds and then the filter, they can work directly from here.

243
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:37,460
But different ways. Sometimes they add this colloidal silver to additives to to improve the cooperation.

244
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:42,070
And then kind of simple filtration system we have.

245
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:48,950
So we have the the the the as the film of the components of the water.

246
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:54,140
And then you have a separate filter to remove the contaminants through the water.

247
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:58,490
Come out, filter it with these neutral washes to keep it.

248
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:06,550
What does what does the filter fail to do compared to what we normally.

249
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:09,900
Okay. What's the risk of still do it from doing so?

250
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:13,060
So they used to tell me also think about those.

251
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:18,250
What's that could be still there. Viruses.

252
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:24,460
Viruses. Good. It wouldn't be heavy metals.

253
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:28,770
Metals. Okay. Yeah.

254
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:35,040
So that's I mean, it's not perfect, right? So still, if you think about the children here, they don't have the disinfectant here.

255
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:37,530
So they don't really cure intelligence.

256
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:48,149
It's just liquids pass through the filters with this some membrane and they can remove all these very fine particles by a large amount.

257
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:52,080
But that's a fine paper. So the virus can still be there.

258
00:29:52,530 --> 00:30:02,310
And they they don't have the disinfectants. I mean, surely they will not be able to remove all the presence of metals, of heavy metals if they have.

259
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:08,100
And then they can also be become clogged pretty easily because this, this, this system.

260
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:18,530
It's not a barrier fragile and both. Good thing is that you maybe can be useful like Mike for three years.

261
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:28,520
Okay. And they can still be able to remove the biological contaminants and heavy metals because of coloration processor filtration process.

262
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:33,020
They'll be able to remove quite, quite large amounts.

263
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:36,860
I mean, sometimes could be 90%. I mean, depends 95%.

264
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:47,399
The point of entry system because low end filters for kids is basically now you you build this,

265
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:52,410
the water will pass through, you send filters and then they get into the house.

266
00:30:52,440 --> 00:31:00,570
That's another way they can do this. Can I mean, for example, this system, you may choose like several liters, 20 meters a day,

267
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:07,230
but this for entry and then send photos they can provide like a large amount.

268
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:16,920
Those of us speaking on to this. So the other thing is really the cooperation for Operation Powder.

269
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:29,670
So what they do, I mean, the CMOS system strategy here is us at this conference and, and using crows for example, to remove, to filter the water.

270
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:37,020
So basically you, you add to the content and then let them sit down and then use this to do the filtration.

271
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:45,810
So that's another way simply similar to this, just use different way back here or the add is the adequate guidance here for that purpose.

272
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:55,080
Okay. And the other accommodation for aggression powerfully that of the party that produced this.

273
00:31:55,380 --> 00:32:02,730
If you get up our we can see the coherence the really the the colloids that precipitate several down to the bottom.

274
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:07,850
I mean that's the what they have and think about them is sometimes could be to me is

275
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:16,830
the U.S. effectual now with the charcoal do we use this approach to cover to coagulate

276
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:24,719
and then you see the bottom of the container has some of this lump of materials that's

277
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,880
the the precipitate the on the bottom either approach really the boy the water.

278
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:36,450
Okay boy the water is pretty efficiency in terms of the you think about the contaminants.

279
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:41,300
Boy, the water is very efficient for the for the biological contaminants.

280
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:45,630
My column passive. I will not be able to remove chemical.

281
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:56,210
Okay well not be able to smoke and chemical if you have a heavy back a metal contamination American ammunition will not be able to do that.

282
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:02,270
And also that the cost of the the the energy for these properties.

283
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:13,940
So we used to do when I was a kid we used to do we use this kind of a device like close sometime in the past.

284
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:18,650
So that's when we cook. At the same time, we're boiling hot.

285
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:24,250
So this way we properly buoy the water out same time.

286
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:31,270
So the energy cost is pretty, pretty high in terms of just supporting the war.

287
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:38,300
You also use chlorine tablets as another way to basically use disinfectant.

288
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:45,230
So like you would travel for good hygiene and we use that same approach to disinfect.

289
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:50,210
But would you use the tablets and the effects for this emergency purpose?

290
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:53,990
The tablet is very useful for that purpose.

291
00:33:54,020 --> 00:34:02,270
I mean, I sometimes when there's some hierarchy on some other places, I used to buy tablets and then send to the.

292
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:09,730
So that way they can they can do the treatments themselves. Some places they don't have access.

293
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:17,390
I mean, think about it. All the simple message, people still don't have it. It's just list of resources to access to these tablets, for example.

294
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:22,960
And then when they do that, you can use bottled water,

295
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:31,310
put on the on the on the sitting and then use a solar disinfection of sunlight to disinfect some of the disinfect.

296
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:36,739
So this is what they do during the daytime and there's still the water bottle until it's actually consumed.

297
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:40,850
So this is what they do for the water out of the house.

298
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:46,360
And then they decide that. So what's the issue with that?

299
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:55,460
You're literally drinking all the plastic chemicals that are then heated from the sun.

300
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:58,850
Okay. That's what contaminates the water.

301
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:06,750
Yeah. How about a taste of war? To say class would be terrible.

302
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:14,090
So you say you'll be terrible in this and it's warm and it's terrible taste and

303
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:18,850
the effect that's also sometimes people don't really want to consume this war.

304
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:24,740
I mean, if it's only a choice. Yes, you've got to ask. Right. But but it's not really a fair way.

305
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:36,760
And this is another point of use devices that's promote, which has been promoted very widely and called POULSEN filters.

306
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:41,380
So what you can see here, they have these filters here.

307
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:50,350
They have multiple layer of the filter media, especially the sand and the gravel scrambles here, you see.

308
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:54,940
So it's similar to the, the, the, the filtration system we have,

309
00:35:55,690 --> 00:36:02,590
but they use a sense so what they do is throw water and then pass through and then you can get the can you walk from here?

310
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:04,350
Okay.

311
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:15,190
And if they can easily bureau and this is in fact a national nonprofit organization, they buy the materials from here, and then they may give the.

312
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,960
The standard, for example, in the in the locally.

313
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:29,630
And then they put them together and then they send them to the to the to each household.

314
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:36,680
And this is kind of the household devices that get the water pass through and through the end.

315
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:43,730
Again, this will not be able to solve all this problem they have, but is a really great approach to improve the House.

316
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:50,919
So this point of we use devices. Now, the other thing is really the safe storage.

317
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:57,190
We're talking about safe storage, small opening with a needs, a speaker, a small opening to allow easier,

318
00:36:57,190 --> 00:37:01,930
safe access to the water surface to object for two, three general categories.

319
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:10,840
So not only just treatment, but also the safe stories here and here, you can see what is called a self-storage view.

320
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:19,390
Relatively speaking, this is a safe storage system because you to the water to avoid contamination that's called safe storage.

321
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,590
Okay. So here is just think about small yes.

322
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:29,500
Liquids each family can use the now and how can we distribute the.

323
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:39,340
And then for us, it's considered very simple stuff. But how can you just do to me if you.

324
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:46,150
And the people still use it. Okay.

325
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:50,160
So it's not just a fall.

326
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:55,640
It's good thing for you this. As you think about it now, it's good if they use it.

327
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:03,410
I fully understand with the vaccines, you see, if we don't take the vaccine when 65% people get.

328
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:09,710
If this clever system, this new system now I distribute to the country would be more Iraqis.

329
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:19,330
Is it good for the health? You may find the rate of accessible.

330
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:24,810
Accessible access to the acceptable rate is pretty low.

331
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:31,920
Okay. It's pretty low and sometimes. And then really follow the protocol for that as well.

332
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:44,460
So there's some like intervention, for example, in the in the past stages, there's some increase in terms of the users in the system.

333
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:49,800
It's like million people, 2 million people use the household system.

334
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:58,910
These are different ways. Again, but what you can see here is it's very effective.

335
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:05,750
Okay. Very effective. This is one of the study took about the diarrheal disease reduction complaints here.

336
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:15,460
Every the ceramic filtration. Close to 50%, more than 50% of reduction of sterility.

337
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:21,620
Think about this, that 50% of your pension is already.

338
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:29,630
Seriously the high. And think about how many children died because of this diarrheal disease.

339
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:33,290
And just by simple, simple message you can save.

340
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:41,520
Half a million people. He's 85 years old because of diarrhea.

341
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:52,810
That's why I'm so. So you know it's really varies how.

342
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:57,220
Think about a simple approach how effective that simple approach.

343
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:04,780
So that's also why we say it's an emergency conditions every to have anything that gives your coast the situation.

344
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:11,630
That would be very helpful. Okay. Because here you can see just by this set of filters.

345
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:27,560
Almost 50%, more than 50% of reduction. So this is what they recommended to make a difference goes to to the point of use devices.

346
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:35,850
Semi computers both in the field depend on the use. So nominate is highly recommended for the developing countries.

347
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:43,050
So there's a lot of barriers. Okay.

348
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:48,730
A lot of burials. If diarrhea is not a disease.

349
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:57,510
Okay. That's true. Okay. There's some crazy diarrhea is not just this idea.

350
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:01,500
Okay. Effective intervention.

351
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:05,760
Uptake. Chinese costs. Suspicion of commercial products.

352
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:14,370
And that focused international efforts perceived a comfort with popular surprise suspicion of commercial products.

353
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:18,900
Anything you produce in the Western countries, they come here to do something for us.

354
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:23,400
I'm a kind of belief and also the culture acceptance.

355
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:28,820
And they don't really believe the barrier is the disease. So.

356
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:29,630
So that's.

357
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:40,549
Here is this if you are working in this sector, you try to a skill is to develop this I mean this is useful we know we can reduce all 50% of the time.

358
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:46,090
It uses a tremendous amount of steps with sufficient reduction of these diseases.

359
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:54,680
So what do you need to do? You need to focus on the use the developed, pervasive public and private especially.

360
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:06,930
We working with this existing community structure and like the nurse schools, women's groups, church groups, and that will be helpful.

361
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:07,310
I mean,

362
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:18,050
I know how many of you work for the the nonprofit organizations try to do something like this to to to volunteer in these developing countries.

363
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:27,440
I have you working with Peru. We all this is very important to understand that you have to have a policy with local people.

364
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:33,980
And the people who trust the most likely most trust,

365
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:40,940
because this effective year for Tesco to get access to the truth in Tiger Woods household and the T-shirt.

366
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:42,990
Okay, judges.

367
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:57,240
So if you think about a centralized, decentralized, fully centralized, consistent, provided, reliable water that meets water quality standards.

368
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:06,420
Again, I'm a favor. I'm mostly favorable to the centralized water system for this reason.

369
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:07,360
Okay.

370
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:15,900
For this reason, if we can do it, it's really because of the provides the reliable water ensure the same standard across all the water in the system.

371
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:24,740
And also think about the central nervous system is an important issue.

372
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:31,810
Okay. So now let's assume think about this assumes it's just the United States.

373
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:36,570
We don't really do the section on autism. So we're having.

374
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:47,070
Look we're having. So the rich people.

375
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:53,200
They'll be watching the system. Very sophisticated.

376
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:58,330
Grace. So. But then, obviously.

377
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:04,750
Socio economically disadvantaged people that don't have the resources to do it.

378
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:11,180
So apparently they were drinking less. Of her career.

379
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:16,600
One civil. That's as you can see right away.

380
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:20,260
I would have if we don't have the security forces doing stuff.

381
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:25,750
Yeah, right. So. So that's also happening is that developing countries,

382
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:35,310
you see some of these the luxury of how many goodies we give you this each each household they are point of interest system for the.

383
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:41,410
You're already in. Okay.

384
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:49,060
And again, not everyone can afford it. On the other hand, how common in our system is that we.

385
00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:58,570
Okay. So in terms of important issues, particularly public health equity, I think the central system is still the best choice.

386
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,940
Okay. So the best choice if we could do that.

387
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:07,880
But if we cannot afford that,

388
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:17,360
then decision system surely the the will be helpful to improve improve the public health because it's better than nothing.

389
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:24,010
You have a decision system and that is better than without anything.

390
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:34,810
Okay. And every just with a simple center efficient system, you can reduce the days like diarrhea for the almost 50%.

391
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:43,510
Okay. So. I think the bottom line here is really if we can build such a nice system.

392
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:47,550
Yes. Good decision system. Okay.

393
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:53,230
Through the satellite system. If we cannot, then the point of use devices is very helpful.

394
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:55,540
And in fact, in the developing countries,

395
00:45:55,540 --> 00:46:05,020
they promote the United Nations coverage or promote very heavily the description of the decentralized system point of use devices.

396
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:12,730
So again, if we want to really do the addresses to the global health, to the public health.

397
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:20,680
Once the former President Clinton came to the campus, give a commencement speech.

398
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:25,650
So if you really want to help to improve the health.

399
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:30,770
You missing the water there then? Okay.

400
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:37,680
Because that's really first essential to the public house, to the to the to the to the human rights.

401
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:42,240
But also most effective ways to improve the House.

402
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:47,760
As ever, embedded as much as ever. Much better than just the same.

403
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,950
I donate money to. Okay.

404
00:46:52,450 --> 00:46:55,660
It's much more effective than just do it.

405
00:46:56,890 --> 00:47:04,990
So I think the will provide a sense of this is most effective way to improve the health outcomes.

406
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:10,240
Which is the case, which is really the case.

407
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:22,490
The Gates Foundation used to invest pretty heavily in this area, but now they've become less interested in this area.

408
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:28,910
Instead, we just mentioned that they are very interested that the sanitation system.

409
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:34,850
Okay. The small individual sanitation system like the point is,

410
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:45,070
I think they have they try to do that so that each household can use this can all site treatments all this that's this this is with interest.

411
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:55,490
See, right now for this budget overall order, you can see here this the iteration of the basic human rights, the world.

412
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:59,780
We see the increase of the accessibility for the what do you want to source.

413
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:05,460
Okay, again, remember the interesting. You can also see the message on the same level as we have you.

414
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:14,790
It was super interesting to lives. But on the other hand, we have about 90% to 90% of people have access to the water.

415
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:19,110
But with equal population. About a billion people.

416
00:48:19,110 --> 00:48:23,160
You've probably seen the number of people that don't have access to the drinking water.

417
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:26,820
So people don't buy that.

418
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:37,680
Then there's this sustainable development goal by 2008, which everyone except for this group challenged us to do, is really very tenuous.

419
00:48:38,370 --> 00:48:45,780
But on the other hand, if we don't do that, then our house, global house says, you know, if it looks really bad.

420
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:53,220
Okay. We will be available to grill, but as a lesson for us.

421
00:48:53,940 --> 00:49:00,270
Okay. The lesson for us domestically is as now we have access to a safe water.

422
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:05,940
We have access to the water so that we can enjoy the the health.

423
00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:17,040
But if we don't do this, if we don't invest in this area, if we don't sustain this this system to a beach, I will go back to this.

424
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:23,720
What do we have something that's detrimental?

425
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:27,310
We don't want to do that. We kind of go back, basically.

426
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:33,470
So that's the lessons we can learn when we look at developing countries.

427
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:40,970
So central nervous system, I would say still the preferred option because it addresses all of the issues.

428
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:45,650
And also if you can provide a simple one to everyone.

429
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:57,810
Okay. To each of us. Okay. Thanks to the team for the performance.

430
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:08,650
And so we divide the groups this reform three groups for the group rotation and 2 to 3.

431
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:25,420
So your groups, you will have three people. And of course, the iPad is valued on the home side with.
