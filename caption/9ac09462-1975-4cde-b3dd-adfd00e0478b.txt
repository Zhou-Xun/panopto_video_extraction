1
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,540
Today in our final segment, we're gonna help you bring it all together.

2
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:17,196
We're gonna understand the third and final phase of the MI encounter.

3
00:00:17,196 --> 00:00:19,351
The closing phase, or the choosing phase.

4
00:00:19,351 --> 00:00:25,440
And we'll show you some of the specific skills that can be used during this phase.

5
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,240
So, let's refresh our memory.

6
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,120
There are three phases of a typical full MI encounter, explore guide choose.

7
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,741
During the choosing phase, which we'll talk about today,

8
00:00:36,741 --> 00:00:39,091
this is where action planning occurs.

9
00:00:39,091 --> 00:00:40,558
This is where smart goals are set.

10
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:44,892
This is where we structure the behavior change attempt.

11
00:00:44,892 --> 00:00:47,272
Just to remind you, during the first phase,

12
00:00:47,272 --> 00:00:50,140
the explorer phase were comforting the afflicted.

13
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,849
We're building explore, we're expressing empathy, we're rolling with resistance or

14
00:00:53,849 --> 00:00:54,772
obtaining a history.

15
00:00:54,772 --> 00:00:56,440
How long have you done this?

16
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,814
And we talk about some of the pros and cons of change during the guiding phase,

17
00:01:00,814 --> 00:01:02,379
afflict the comfortable.

18
00:01:02,379 --> 00:01:06,207
We try and build discrepancy between the roles goals and values, and

19
00:01:06,207 --> 00:01:09,140
the behavior change at hand.

20
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:13,322
We try to see if we can get them to commit to some small behavior change.

21
00:01:13,322 --> 00:01:17,840
And if so, we move to the third and final phase, the choosing phase.

22
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,959
This is where we established a goal.

23
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:25,103
We set an action plan, we structure the behavior change attempt.

24
00:01:25,103 --> 00:01:27,240
How do we do that?

25
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,090
Well, most importantly, we wanna build a menu of options.

26
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,471
We wanna give the person multiple ways they could tackle the problem.

27
00:01:33,471 --> 00:01:37,500
So for example, if they're interested in exercising, the menu you might say,

28
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,575
well you've mentioned you like biking,

29
00:01:39,575 --> 00:01:43,160
you mentioned you might want to walk around the pond with your husband.

30
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,840
And you mentioned that you're thinking yoga could be good for you.

31
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,003
And most of the time, you can get the menu just from natural discussion

32
00:01:50,003 --> 00:01:52,375
you've had during the explorer in the guide phase.

33
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:54,970
But sometimes you don't have enough to get three options.

34
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:58,141
When that happens, just ask the patient, what ideas do you have?

35
00:01:58,141 --> 00:02:01,040
How might you see yourself exercising?

36
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,327
And if they draw a blank, they're exhausted, or

37
00:02:03,327 --> 00:02:05,293
they're just not familiar with the area.

38
00:02:05,293 --> 00:02:09,985
You might say, well, let me give you some ideas from some of my prior clients who I

39
00:02:09,985 --> 00:02:12,270
felt had some similar issues as you do.

40
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,300
Which of these might work best for you?

41
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,340
You've got to build that menu.

42
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:19,923
Now, once you get them to choose, we typically wanna ask,

43
00:02:19,923 --> 00:02:23,088
what can you do in the next week, to move this along?

44
00:02:23,088 --> 00:02:25,845
That might include, well the bike sneakers,

45
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:28,681
I could research where there's a yoga studio.

46
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:31,655
I could sit down and chat with my husband or my partner.

47
00:02:31,655 --> 00:02:33,745
And then if there's still energy left,

48
00:02:33,745 --> 00:02:37,080
and the patient still seems to be enthusiastic and raring to go.

49
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,077
You could even ask, what could you even do today to move that along?

50
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:43,748
Now, if you feel they're getting exhausted,

51
00:02:43,748 --> 00:02:47,504
you feel they're getting a little react and back off a little bit.

52
00:02:47,504 --> 00:02:51,340
After you get the behavior change structure and the choice.

53
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,540
We recommend you summarize it.

54
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,346
It might sound something like so.

55
00:02:55,346 --> 00:02:57,197
It sounds like you're willing, or

56
00:02:57,197 --> 00:03:00,417
interested in investigating the yoga studio down the block.

57
00:03:00,417 --> 00:03:03,525
And maybe walking once around the pond with your husband.

58
00:03:03,525 --> 00:03:07,855
And you're thinking you'll get a pair of sneakers in the next couple of days, and

59
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:10,451
have a chat with him, about your exercise plan.

60
00:03:10,451 --> 00:03:12,140
Do I have that right?

61
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,878
Feel free to ask them to summarize it.

62
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:17,111
We would recommend you do that.

63
00:03:17,111 --> 00:03:21,181
If they still feel like they have energy and they're not exhausted.

64
00:03:21,181 --> 00:03:25,008
It can often be very powerful for them to generate the summary.

65
00:03:25,008 --> 00:03:29,740
One strategy we have to end the entire encounters, is the hope assessment.

66
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,571
It's quite simple.

67
00:03:30,571 --> 00:03:31,771
on a scale is there to 10.

68
00:03:31,771 --> 00:03:34,909
How hopeful are you right now that you'll succeed?

69
00:03:34,909 --> 00:03:40,040
Or, how are you feeling right now about your behavior change plan?

70
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,860
Let's talk for a second about the parking lot.

71
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:47,832
We mentioned to build a menu ideally, you populate it with things that have already

72
00:03:47,832 --> 00:03:52,340
been discussed, or alluded to by the client during the session.

73
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:56,878
We recommend that if something comes up that you think is a candidate for

74
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:00,068
the menu that you parking lot at, what do we mean?

75
00:04:00,068 --> 00:04:04,687
If during the discussion, woman says, well maybe biking, or maybe yoga,

76
00:04:04,687 --> 00:04:09,541
you can actually say to the client, you know what, let's put that on the list.

77
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:12,552
We'll come back to it in a few minutes.

78
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:15,740
But that sounds like something we might wanna talk about later.

79
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:20,671
Now remember, when we get them to commit to something be it in the next week, or

80
00:04:20,671 --> 00:04:23,137
in the next few days, if appropriate,

81
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:28,340
you're more than welcome to use a traditional behavioral smart goal.

82
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:32,076
Now that makes more sense generally for DO goals than BE goals.

83
00:04:32,076 --> 00:04:36,240
You'll probably recognize this from other coursework.

84
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,440
The smart goal includes things like self monitoring, I'll keep a diary.

85
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,706
The person can build in rewards.

86
00:04:43,706 --> 00:04:47,675
Well, I'll give myself a massage, or I'll take myself out for

87
00:04:47,675 --> 00:04:49,302
dinner if I achieve this.

88
00:04:49,302 --> 00:04:54,209
And it also can include repairing the environment so in the case of smoking,

89
00:04:54,209 --> 00:04:59,240
it might mean throwing away your cigarettes and your ashtrays.

90
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,661
Now for BE goals, the smart approach generally doesn't work as well.

91
00:05:03,661 --> 00:05:06,740
So for BE goals, you can have a more generalized approach.

92
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:11,354
So if someone says I'm gonna be more positive, or be more chill, or to give

93
00:05:11,354 --> 00:05:16,438
myself more credit, that may not fit into the smart structure as well as a DO goal.

94
00:05:16,438 --> 00:05:19,998
Such as I will quit smoking by, I'll exercise three times in the next week.

95
00:05:19,998 --> 00:05:27,640
That concludes our session on the choosing phase.

96
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:31,033
This is how we recommend that you structure the behavior change attempt.

97
00:05:31,033 --> 00:05:35,741
This also concludes the video component of our course.

98
00:05:35,741 --> 00:05:38,310
Thank you for staying with us.

99
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:43,140
And we hope we provided you with the knowledge and skills necessary to

100
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:49,227
effectively use motivational interviewing, both at work and in your personal life.

101
00:05:49,227 --> 00:05:53,420
Good luck with your MI.
