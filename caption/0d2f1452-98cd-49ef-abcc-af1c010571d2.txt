1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:11,910
Any questions about that? Right. I just want to give this presentation today.

2
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:17,520
Okay. So. So how many. How many of you watch the lectures that we're on?

3
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,800
It's a little bit. It's okay. I'm going to.

4
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:25,230
So I'm not going to repeat what's in those lectures, but I am going to go into a deeper dove on some of those.

5
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,739
So I'm not going to define what schizophrenia is for you.

6
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,340
That's on one of the lectures. So and also Ellen talks about it.

7
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:41,790
So hopefully you listen to her lecture. But what I'm going to set up today is sort of important for us to when we talk on Wednesday,

8
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:48,239
which is that we're we're going to talk through one specific way that different risk factors,

9
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:55,799
including the things that we were just talking about in terms of seasonality of birth and celiac disease,

10
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,120
relate to a different answer to how we came to that question.

11
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,500
So today I'm going to tell you about some risk factors.

12
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:13,110
We're going to talk about family history and genetics and cannabis and genetics and community genetics and immigration status.

13
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:22,409
And we're actually genetically we talked about there, but we're going to we're going to sort of what's what I think it will hopefully become apparent.

14
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:31,500
But in terms of how how one, we think about risk factors for our understanding causes us to back up because they start right so.

15
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:38,129
But what I hope you will get to take from this week as we talk about schizophrenia

16
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:43,560
is how does it physiology help us think about the causes of psychiatric disorders?

17
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,940
And I'm going to on Wednesday, I'm going to walk you through one specific example,

18
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:58,560
one specific narrative of how we have come to understand autoimmune disorders as one of many risk factors,

19
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:02,940
essentially causal risk factors for schizophrenia. And the evidence for that, how we got to that.

20
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:08,610
But no matter what we're talking about, we're talking about schizophrenia.

21
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:14,249
It's it's impossible to talk about the cause of schizophrenia without a good understanding of the

22
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:18,280
genetics or sort of understand what it means when I say there are genetic risk factors for schizophrenia.

23
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,510
So I'm going to start off by just doing a little bit of terminology.

24
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:25,559
And so for those of you who have been through biology, this is going to be a review.

25
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:34,139
But I want to make sure that we're all on the same page. So so we have about you know, when I was in your shoes, they just finished the R&D.

26
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:39,210
We're finishing up the Human Genome Project. They published the first draft in 1980, 2002.

27
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:48,750
And in the 20 years since, we've had just a tremendous explosion of understanding of how what genetic risk looks like,

28
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,070
the different ways that our gene can see, how things go wrong, how things go right.

29
00:02:53,940 --> 00:03:01,650
But the kind of where it all began was in what DNA, which is simply these four nucleic acids which organize into our chromosomes.

30
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,980
This is what we call proteins, and this is what's passed down to offspring.

31
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:11,960
DNA is composed of things called genes, and then also things that are not genes are not regions.

32
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:15,930
Right. You'll hear people call. You'll see in the literature, people say coding regions are non-coding regions,

33
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:20,040
but a gene is essentially just that region of a genome that encodes for a protein.

34
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:31,049
It can be very small regions, they can be huge. Oak wheels are just variations in specific nucleotides of a gene.

35
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:38,940
And you will also see that that is and I'll show an example of this in a second, but we chose that terminology.

36
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:48,090
While still you may have heard this in the context of like autosomal dominant recessive type stuff like that,

37
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:55,190
but that that language, that kind of Mendelian randomization or Mendelian genetics is not really what we're talking about anymore.

38
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,560
Like in terms of how we think about complex phenotypes like that,

39
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:06,219
that does Mendelian genetics does explain things like cystic fibrosis, but even then it doesn't fully explain cystic fibrosis.

40
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,290
So we now know, for example,

41
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:12,629
that there's lots of different variants that are kind of like partial variants or partially expressed or partially functioning proteins.

42
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:21,210
So it's not it's even the dominant recessive versions of levels are actually not fully dominant and fully recessive right now.

43
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:25,259
So even that is more complicated. But we're not I want to set aside all that.

44
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:30,060
That's not what we're talking about here. And instead we're just thinking about variation in the genome.

45
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,380
We all have it.

46
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:40,379
And you'll also see the terminology called a single nucleotide polymorphisms or snip, which is just a common location of variation in the genome.

47
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:51,690
So would that mean that I mean, what common means that, you know, maybe 20% of the population has like an H here instead of a T, right?

48
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:56,159
So like a very common problem. And it doesn't mean that that changes the proteins.

49
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,340
That to me doesn't mean that it doesn't necessarily mean that there's any functional

50
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:05,040
meaning to that snip that of having an A versus a T in that specific spot.

51
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:11,910
But it's just fairly common. This is going to this is going to come up in just a second when I talk to you about a polygenic risk score,

52
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:16,920
which is even more here and then a locus, all that is is just a specific place in the genome.

53
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:20,880
It might be energy might be not in a gene. It's just somewhere in the map.

54
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,950
Right. And this map is this kind of linear, linear thing. So let me just show you what I mean.

55
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:30,720
So imagine there are four people. This line here is Indic.

56
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:35,160
So again, this is these are your four base pairs created.

57
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:40,650
They each have a one side. These are these are mother and father part and these are the pairs.

58
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:48,840
But they've this is some locus in the genome. And this individual at this locus inherited a C for mom and a dad.

59
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,390
So that's what that that's what that means.

60
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:58,620
And it's just sort of showing that these individuals vary, you know, so that that's what this cartoon here.

61
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:10,630
And then what we use today in the terminology that I'm going to show you a lot of data from this type of thing today is a polygenic risk score.

62
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:18,170
And so we the human genome is composed of approximately 3 million base pairs.

63
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:24,640
So approximately 3 million. If you add up across all the chromosomes, there's 3 million TS and CS in each one of us.

64
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:33,220
Okay. So and in those in our genome, we vary according to our SNPs.

65
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:36,069
So there's different all these snips that have been marked all over the genome,

66
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:39,430
which are places where sometimes people have a T and sometimes people have an X.

67
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:48,550
And if you you can sum up all of this variation in our genomes across the whole genome.

68
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:56,950
So not any particular gene, not any particular spot within a gene, but just the whole genome of all the chromosomes.

69
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,160
And we cannot wait for those.

70
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:06,550
So, again, they just call loci, which means some of these are in a gene and some of these are not in just places in the genome.

71
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:12,100
And we just started to ask, are these are these associated with this outcome?

72
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:18,300
That's all it's doing. It's just like running a giant regression. Is this thing associated, I guess, a giant correlation matrix?

73
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:21,790
What is associated with this outcome in case? In our case, our outcome is schizophrenia.

74
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:25,630
And some of these things are more strongly related and some of them are less stimulated.

75
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:33,159
Why strongly? I mean, an odds ratio of 1.9, because that's kind of strong for a genetic risk.

76
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,970
And by weak, I mean like 1.01 because that's kind of weak for genetic risk.

77
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,730
Not so. I think nothing is deterministic. Bless you.

78
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:47,860
But we sum it all up across the whole genome, and then every one of us would have a poorly genetic risk score for schizophrenia.

79
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:54,399
Everyone else has a value, right? Either higher on this total aggregate risk score or lower.

80
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,200
Right. But you can think about it as like blood pressure. And everybody has one everybody has a polygenic risk score.

81
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,830
You may not know yours, but it exists intrinsically in your body.

82
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:06,400
And we this is how people are.

83
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:11,940
This is the tool that we are using now, especially when we're trying to understand gene environment interactions.

84
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:17,890
So instead of saying, all right, you have a T here and I want to interact,

85
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:25,660
I want to know is having a T here plus being born in a city is those two things in combination related to risk of schizophrenia?

86
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:30,610
Right. Nobody does that anymore at all. But that is what they did like 25 years ago.

87
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,579
Instead, what we say is, all right, I want to take people who are very, very high on their their total genetic risk.

88
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:39,580
And this could spread over the whole genome. It's not any particular gene.

89
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:43,120
I don't know what it means. I don't know what it is. There may not have any functional.

90
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,049
I don't I don't know if there's a functional implication of being high on this genetic risk score.

91
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:51,129
But I want to aggregate across everything because everything has got this tiny, tiny, tiny little effect.

92
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:56,320
And so the idea is like this law of small effects out of all these small effects and not only

93
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,610
interact that with like did you live in an urban city and now I want to know that relationship.

94
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:05,200
Okay. So let me pause here, because this is this is kind of critical.

95
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:11,470
Anything I think I'm more than happy to go over anything I just said again. Yes, I guess.

96
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:18,130
How do you determine what's normal? There's like so many different factors that play into.

97
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:25,540
Are you just looking at the final health outcome and an administration versus this person doesn't?

98
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:30,330
And then you go back and see all the factors that add up to each outcome.

99
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:35,229
Yes. So, yeah, so the question is like, you know, like basically, yeah, how do we generate this?

100
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:38,080
And it is a little like chicken and egg type thing.

101
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:43,450
So I basically take people who have schizophrenia and I look at all their variation in their genome.

102
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,170
And then I take people who don't have schizophrenia. It doesn't mean they're normal.

103
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:51,310
There's not a schizophrenia. Now we can talk about that. Right. But they just it's just not schizophrenia.

104
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:54,790
And I add up all their variation and then I can compare the two.

105
00:09:54,850 --> 00:10:02,020
Right? And so then that helps me identify, okay, what makes what is higher risk versus lower risk?

106
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:08,050
Yeah. So it really is starting with cases in control cases are people, schizophrenic controls or anybody else.

107
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:14,670
And in fact, most of the controls for these studies come from like if you've ever like donated blood,

108
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,570
you're probably in one of these studies, for example.

109
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:23,349
So without knowing it, because that like that's where the controls that is that people who don't have schizophrenia come from.

110
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:30,310
Most of these studies actually, like all the people that don't have schizophrenia or have like a bunch of consistencies within the genome.

111
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:32,800
Right. Or any one place. Yes. Yeah.

112
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:38,860
They'll all they'll all have a T here and people with schizophrenia all have a G here, except it's never that, it's never that simple.

113
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:46,660
Right. But that's instead it's like, well, on average, people with schizophrenia have a look a little bit more like this and then a little bit more.

114
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:52,600
And in fact, we now know that even if you sum up everything we know about the genome across all we've I mean,

115
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:56,500
you can sequence your genome in like a day, maybe even hours, right?

116
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:02,680
This is how we like got to our and RNA vaccines in like a hot minute because that's how fast the technology is.

117
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:10,520
And so even though we can do that so quickly now, when you add up all the variants that we know or that we so far know are so she was schizophrenic.

118
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:14,559
You still only explain about 10% of the genetic risk of schizophrenia,

119
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:22,389
which means that 90% of the genetic risk of schizophrenia is associated is coming from something in the genome or the epigenome.

120
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:28,360
Right. All these other things that we don't know about yet, because it has to be sort of if you think about it,

121
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,419
you have to it has to be tagged as this is something that's different among people

122
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:35,140
with schizophrenia versus this is different on people who don't have schizophrenia.

123
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:44,380
If you watch the well, I will give you the caveat that I give you on Wednesday, and I'll remind you of it.

124
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:50,110
Almost everything we know about the genetics of schizophrenia comes from Northern Europe.

125
00:11:51,610 --> 00:12:00,090
We do not have good data, much less group of genetic data on the vast majority of the world when it comes to this.

126
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:07,059
And so part of why we've probably hit the ceiling on what we're doing right now, like in terms of this polygenic score,

127
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:11,020
is because we literally are if you think about all the variation in human to human variation,

128
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:14,800
we're like we're like here, like this is what we're looking at. And like, this is what's possible.

129
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:24,790
Okay. So other questions about this. All right.

130
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:30,829
So now to get these numbers to do any of this requires huge numbers of cases and controls.

131
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:39,229
And so you get things like this is an example of these giant consortiums where basically everybody who's got DNA on participants

132
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:45,770
who have schizophrenia and also people who don't have schizophrenia are asked to basically share their data through this.

133
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:51,250
What is the psychiatric genetics consortium? And so this has got about a million people and at this consortium.

134
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:55,700
All right. That and it's like the data is publicly available.

135
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:59,000
It's right here at UMC. I think it's the university that runs it.

136
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:06,520
So but again, it's it's and you can compare this to me.

137
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:14,630
These studies are just they're enormous. And the reason they have to be enormous is because they are running literally millions of tests.

138
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:18,210
And so they have to correct for false discovery. Okay.

139
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:25,110
That is right. If you run 25 T tests, you should get a few that are statistically significant just by chance.

140
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,560
Right. That's just how that works. Okay.

141
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:34,170
So if I'm running a million comparisons, I'm going to get literally thousands.

142
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:38,400
That will be statistically significant just by chance. So I have to correct for that.

143
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:41,950
In order to correct for that, I need a huge, huge sample size.

144
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:47,490
So it's literally just a numbers game like in terms of being able to have enough statistical power.

145
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:54,690
So you hear these types of things. Okay, so that's my preamble, and I'm going to tell you about some risk factors.

146
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,350
But before I give you one more chance here. Questions about what I just said.

147
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,710
If some people don't share their data with this consortium,

148
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:08,160
did you say it's people specifically with schizophrenia or just like anyone in the general public?

149
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:11,909
Yeah, so that's a great question. So the question is around who shares their data.

150
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:16,530
So so it's it's researchers who are sharing the data of participants.

151
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:21,540
So that's first of all, so most people are not like are like donating their own DNA to their.

152
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:27,120
But so this this consortium is predominantly focused on schizophrenia,

153
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:34,949
but it also has people who have family depression, um, autism, a little bit, ADHD a little bit.

154
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:39,899
So I'm going to show you some data from here. But yeah, and then that control samples,

155
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:46,830
that is people who don't it doesn't mean that they don't get it doesn't mean that they don't have something, some mental health problem.

156
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:53,459
It's just that they don't have schizophrenia, they don't have depression or whatever they are either the control samples from these smaller

157
00:14:53,460 --> 00:15:02,820
studies or they're taken from what are considered to be largely neurotypical populations,

158
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:08,460
like people who donate blood. So that's where like the UK Biobank, which is another one of these giant consortiums,

159
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:18,600
they're they're, they're non cases are all coming out of blood donations other questions.

160
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:25,909
So now if you watched the videos online, you saw this figure,

161
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:31,940
which what is important to take away from this is that we have known for a very long time.

162
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:39,260
Perhaps one of the first things we knew about schizophrenia is that having a family member with schizophrenia,

163
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:46,880
just like basically any other health condition, is associated with higher risk of you yourself having schizophrenia.

164
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:50,390
So let me. So these are first degree relatives.

165
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:54,560
These are your parents, your siblings. These are second degree relatives or third degree relatives.

166
00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:03,030
So the first thing you can see is that if you basically once you get out of the first degree relative, the effect is quite small.

167
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:07,190
So this is the general population, just to the point where no more related than you are related.

168
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:16,310
If you look here, we see very the strong this very strong risk factor for identical twins.

169
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:23,720
What's interesting here is that these are fraternal twins whose fraternal twins share exactly as much DNA as you share with any sibling you have.

170
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:27,350
Okay. So they share about 50% of their genes identical by descent.

171
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:31,430
These are genes for same sex twins who are same sex.

172
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,209
These are twins who are opposite sex.

173
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:41,420
And you can see that same sex, even though the DNA, the both of these people share 50%, both of these bars.

174
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:44,980
So these are sisters. This is brother and sister. That's the way to think about it.

175
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:53,240
Okay. That that but what what's also important is that they're all in the womb at the same time.

176
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,620
So the identical twins and the fraternal twins are in the womb at the same time.

177
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:02,330
Okay. So because as as people are worried about this, we're going to talk about this.

178
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:03,680
We talking about maternal infection.

179
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:11,340
Events that happened in utero would, you know, would be affecting both sibling if they both joined at the same time.

180
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:17,190
But they're not necessarily going to be affecting the siblings that are not in the euro at the same time.

181
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:23,550
All right. So you see this very strong effect for identical twins. We really dropped down quite a bit.

182
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:33,060
We talk about twins, but it does seem to sort of the correlation looks a little bit stronger if the siblings are same sex versus opposite sex.

183
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:38,190
But the big effect here is that is to compare this far to this far.

184
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:42,719
Okay. But also look at the x axis here.

185
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:50,549
We only go up to about 60%. So the interpretation there would be that about 60% of the liability for schizophrenia

186
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:55,410
is something to do with family and the other 40% is presumably not family.

187
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:06,200
So that's the other thing I want you to take away from this. So that family history, some of that family history is the rearing environment, right?

188
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,310
The parents, the interaction, your family. Okay. Because that's all this meets.

189
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,379
It's just family history. But we can look at. Okay, well,

190
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:23,450
what does that mean when we look at the genes that are the levels in genes that are more likely to be showing up in people who have schizophrenia?

191
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:28,160
They don't because that's all we're doing. Right. So now this is like this big polygenic risk score.

192
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:35,120
And I'm going in to say like, okay, well, what's what is looking different monkeypaw schizophrenia versus people who don't in their DNA.

193
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:42,469
What's interesting and I know you can't read all of these, but like what's interesting is that most of when we when we look to see,

194
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:48,110
okay, what does that that snip is in this gene what does that gene do?

195
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:55,790
Most of the time, the thing that Gene does is basic cellular housekeeping.

196
00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:03,130
That is, it's not encoding for a neurotransmitter, which is what people thought for a very, very long time.

197
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:10,000
People thought that this that schizophrenia was a disorder due to, like, poor monoamine metabolism.

198
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:14,270
Like, literally, like. And that's what because that's that's what our drugs do are drugs or monoamine drugs.

199
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,700
But it turns out that's not really true. So, for example, there's very first gene up here on chromosome six.

200
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:25,000
It has to do with transcriptional regulation, which is just like taking your DNA and turning it into RNA.

201
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:28,070
That's all it does. Right? Like that gene has something to do with that.

202
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:32,510
You can also see like this is cell cycle progression, right?

203
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:36,510
So you remember the stages, the self, the cycle of a cell and you divide that.

204
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:41,110
Remember how to draw those things when you were a child. Okay. So that that gene does something to do with that.

205
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:52,790
Okay. So it's what we think about what is what is quote unquote actually going wrong in the brain of somebody with schizophrenia genetically?

206
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,870
What looks like is that these kind of like there's some core fundamental just like cell

207
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:01,700
operation housekeeping stuff that's that's a little bit like that is associated with that.

208
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:09,060
I want to call attention to how many of these genes are on chromosome six.

209
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:12,690
Chromosome six is going to come back on Wednesday.

210
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:21,120
These genes for chromosome six encodes for is the major histocompatibility complex.

211
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:27,890
I know what that is. Is your immune system.

212
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,770
Basically, it basically runs your immune system.

213
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:34,010
And it's not the only thing that runs your system, but it's one of the things that runs your immune system.

214
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:38,760
So now these but of course, these genes don't code for inflammation.

215
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:44,060
This gene encodes for component of biogenesis, of lysosome related organelle complex.

216
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:52,220
This is like cell cleanup. Okay? Like when you get junk in your cell, like it's got to clean it up through this chromatin modification.

217
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:59,150
Right. So the point is, is that there there's things that are happening, but they're they're in this these these polymorphisms,

218
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:06,380
these snips are that are occurring more often among people with schizophrenia compared to people who don't have schizophrenia.

219
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:08,210
There's a large amount of them.

220
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:14,980
A number of them are chromosome six, specifically in genes that are encoding for the major acoustic compatibility problems.

221
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:22,100
Okay. The other thing I wanted to say at the top is there are not genes for schizophrenia.

222
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:26,500
Just straight up like that. I mean, there aren't really genes for anything, but there really aren't genes for schizophrenia.

223
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:27,760
What I mean by that.

224
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:38,020
Well, what I mean is that this genetic liability, like all the stuff I just showed you here, is also shared across other forms of mental disorder.

225
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:42,700
Okay, so this is ADHD, this is bipolar schizophrenia, major depressive disorder.

226
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:52,530
This is autism spectrum disorder. And what what the Y axis here is basically like, okay, well, what proportion of the heritability in this outcome,

227
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:57,250
in this image and I know I'm using a lot of terminology here, but think about it this way.

228
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:04,600
If you have a pie and that pie is broken into, 60% is genetic risk, 40% is environmental risk.

229
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:13,090
And I'm in that 60% of the pie. That's genetic risk. This is asking what proportion of that genetic risk is due to these snips that I'm looking at?

230
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:18,520
Okay. How much of it can I explain? And these are things that are for these conditions.

231
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,919
And then these are things that are coherent abilities.

232
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:26,320
That is, what are these genes that explain schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, co-occurring in families?

233
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:37,450
Okay. So again, the idea is it's not that our diagnoses are somehow mapping on to like distinct neurobiology.

234
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:46,270
They are not mapping on two distinct neurobiology. Instead, what we see is that to the degree to which these genes are describing neurobiology,

235
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:52,330
they're sort of people who have a lot of genes that are kind of there's something going on there and the people are fewer.

236
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:58,780
And if you've got a lot, you tend to have a lot of different things going on. And it's not like it's just for schizophrenia, but it's also shows up.

237
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:03,590
The same genes are showing up in bipolar depression and autism, which.

238
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:12,250
This is just my show. You again. Yeah.

239
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:24,280
So 60% is directly related to what we think is something in the game and 40% is everything else.

240
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:31,720
Everything is not genomics. Now because we've got these genetic risk scores that are going to sum up everything else.

241
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,900
We can ask the question that we really couldn't ask before.

242
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,580
How do we actually how do these two things really work together?

243
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:47,550
Not just high risk genes, high risk environment, equal more stuff, but how is it possible that high risk?

244
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:55,290
There are other ways these two work together. And specifically the idea that your genetic risk, which must always come before everything else.

245
00:23:55,290 --> 00:24:00,359
Right. Genes are set at conception, right? Like your DNA the moment you were conceived.

246
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,640
That's it. It has not changed. Okay.

247
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:11,830
So what this is looking at is trying to ask the question, do people who have higher genetic risk for schizophrenia,

248
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:19,420
are they more likely to experience environments that we think of as being high risk for schizophrenia?

249
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:27,940
So it's not just a you have this gene and you have this environment and together they think work together to produce schizophrenia.

250
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:34,450
But these genes increase the likelihood you will experience these environments.

251
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:42,830
That that it's a strange thing to think about, but it's that this is the way very few of us, very few things in life are random.

252
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:46,890
You weren't you chose to be in this class, right? You chose to come.

253
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:49,610
The University of Michigan. I know you didn't choose your parents, right?

254
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:53,240
But like you, you chose there's a lot of things in your life that you did choose,

255
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:56,810
or at least you had some say, even if you didn't choose them outright. Okay.

256
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:02,360
And so the implication of this finding that people who have higher genetic risk

257
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:07,370
for schizophrenia are also more likely to be to experience trauma and childhood,

258
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:12,410
which trauma is also a risk factor for schizophrenia and all other sorts of psychiatric disorders.

259
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:18,950
Is that what when we think we're looking at a genetic effect because we're looking at the family,

260
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:22,910
we're actually probably looking at eight genes plus environment effects.

261
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:27,380
So that 60, 40 high I told you about 10 minutes ago we have to talk trash.

262
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,590
A lot of what I tell you about is how we have to throw things in the trash.

263
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:35,510
So and I don't mean to say throw them in the trash because we didn't learn something.

264
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:39,670
We absolutely learned something. But this is the way science works, right?

265
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:46,249
We think we know something and then you start poking at it and then when it falls apart, you learn from that experience.

266
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:53,010
And to start asking better questions and different questions. Great pause here because I'm going to switch gears.

267
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:59,910
I wasn't. So like you say, like.

268
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:06,719
Like higher genetic risk means greater or greater risk of, like, trauma.

269
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:12,209
Childhood is partly related to like schizophrenia can pass through families.

270
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:17,790
And that would be like somehow traumatizing as a child to have a parent with that condition.

271
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:21,600
Like, what exactly do you mean? So it could be that. Yeah, it could be that.

272
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:27,240
It could also be. So we don't know that the trauma that the child here is experiencing is from a parent.

273
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,250
So. So it could be that there's.

274
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:37,400
You have higher genetic risk and you live in an area that is there's more community violence and so you're exposed to it.

275
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:43,010
So. So but what it means is that it's not just a genetic effect.

276
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:51,230
That polygenic risk score is associated with a likelihood of encountering an environment that is itself a risk factor for schizophrenia.

277
00:26:51,230 --> 00:27:05,420
So instead of when people talk about gene environment interaction, you talk about genes.

278
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:11,660
You know, sort of interacting with the environment. So they they they emit you imagine something like this.

279
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:16,970
So these are people with. Low. You can't see.

280
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:24,820
Low genetic risk. And these are people with high genetic risk.

281
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:31,690
And these are positive environments and these are negative environments.

282
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:38,080
So the idea is that this is not what it would still look like this.

283
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:43,990
So what you want what this type of graph would be an example of a gene environment interaction.

284
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:50,450
Is that okay? So in a positive environment, it doesn't matter if you have high genetic risk or low genetic risk,

285
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:54,040
your culture and the y axis here is probability that you develop schizophrenia.

286
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:58,750
Okay. So in a low in a in a positive environment, it doesn't matter what your genetic risk is.

287
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:03,880
Very few people get schizophrenia, but in a negative environment or one where, let's say there's trauma,

288
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,649
the people who are more likely to get schizophrenia are people who have high genetic risk.

289
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:12,520
So this is this is like the classical gene environment interaction.

290
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:20,290
But that that that only in that world it's like this fell out of the sky.

291
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:25,660
Your genetic risk and like this was somehow randomly assigned where your environment is.

292
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:37,240
Neither is true. So what this table is showing is that there are genes that are impacting the likelihood you encounter an environment.

293
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:45,160
So there's there's high and low genes that are impacting whether you encounter a positive or negative environment.

294
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:49,210
It's a totally different mechanism. It's a it's a person.

295
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:55,150
It's explicitly saying this environment didn't fall out of the sky and your genes in fall out of the sky.

296
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:58,090
Think about it this way. How many do you play in musical instruments?

297
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:02,440
How many of you showed some interest in that musical instrument at a very young age?

298
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:07,030
How many of your parents said, Forget about it, I want you to be something else?

299
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:12,159
They probably did, though. They probably encouraged you, right?

300
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:20,230
They probably created an environment where you could take your genetic gift or genetic interest, whatever it is in music, and helped you actualize it.

301
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:27,430
All right. So that is another example of gene environment correlation, where the genes are causing a shape in the environment, your genetic,

302
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:32,860
your propensity for the piano or whatever it was the song flew right caused your parents to create a

303
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:39,849
family environment where you were able to actualize on that genetic something that would be like I mean,

304
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:43,450
that factor would be parent. Sure. Yeah.

305
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:48,399
Right. So then there's something back here, right? So there's something back here which is parental genes, right?

306
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:54,190
Because there's genes and there are people who show and we'll talk about this in a second how parents who have

307
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:02,530
fathers who have their first kid later in life are more likely to have this higher risk genetic propensity,

308
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:07,879
even though they themselves do not have schizophrenia. So, so, right.

309
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:11,830
So this is where you get like this, where you stay up until four in the morning. What is it mean?

310
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,740
The other thing I want to say real quick is so I've done studies on identical twins,

311
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:22,910
and I'll tell you, they're fascinating people, but I'll tell you just one anecdote.

312
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:31,850
So we were doing a study of identical twins that are in their forties, and they they were looking at differences in gene expression.

313
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:38,750
The twins did not need to come together to this appointment, but they often wanted to do like it was an opportunity to see each other.

314
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:44,830
Okay. So I come to the clinic and my participant for the day is there.

315
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:48,889
One of them is. And she they're supposed to come fasting to this.

316
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:55,090
She was going to do a blood draw and she's got her lunch in a straight up Easter basket.

317
00:30:55,900 --> 00:31:01,220
Like a very strange thing to bring your lunch. I mean, doesn't have the grass in it, but it is.

318
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:04,870
It's a like big handle wicker basket, you know? Can you imagine?

319
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:14,590
I'm talking like something very unusual. So I'm commenting on her, on her lunch that her sister comes in.

320
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:20,330
And I swear to God, her sister has got her lunch in the exact same.

321
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:24,940
No, it gets worse. I'm getting chills telling you this story because I know what's coming.

322
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:30,940
So I start laughing like, Oh, my gosh, I feel like how you must have planned this.

323
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:35,860
Her sister, who has just showed up, is furious. And she she says the following.

324
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:41,410
She says, I chose this because I knew there was no way you would choose it.

325
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:48,849
And then I'm like, I've never made a single decision in my whole life.

326
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:53,790
It's all my genes, right? Because these two, like this is a woman trying to do something different than her,

327
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:58,209
her twin, which is if you could live life over again, that is what identical twins are.

328
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:03,850
Right. If if you got left instead of. Right. Right. And here she's trying to make herself different.

329
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,810
And in doing so does exactly the same thing that her twin has already done.

330
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:14,400
Yes, but what's the other twin also trying to. No, no, that's okay.

331
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:24,249
I have chills telling you this story. I get them every time. So but the problem is, most of us do not have an identical twins.

332
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:27,850
Anybody can have an identical twin. No. So.

333
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:30,910
But if fraternal. Yeah. Okay. So if you.

334
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,510
So are you sure that you're fraternal? Yes. Yeah.

335
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:46,060
You're sure you two are not the twins, right. So I ask this because it's only very recently that people actually do genetic testing to confirm.

336
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:49,870
And so in our study of identical twins, we actually have two pairs that we have believe their entire lives.

337
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:53,020
They are identical and they're not. We don't tell them that.

338
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:57,350
Oh, I mean, they can find out, but they're I don't want to guess that's too much of difference.

339
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:04,990
So the point is, is that most of us don't have the living counterfactual as to what basket you would have chosen at Michael's that day.

340
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:09,280
But these women did. And so it's like you think that you're making a decision.

341
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:13,960
What actually, the thing that's making the argument would be the thing that's making that decision is the genes.

342
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:23,110
Yes. It's something that will, in fact, would be like maybe their parents always had like an Easter basket for the lunch.

343
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:29,710
Sure. But like this is a woman who's choosing an Easter basket specifically to not choose something that her sister.

344
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:35,649
So if she hadn't said that piece. So I thought that I thought it was just like, oh, what an interesting coincidence.

345
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:41,400
Maybe you shops together and like, I mean, you and your sister's siblings are more alike with each other.

346
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:45,480
Even if you don't get along, you are far more alike with each other than you are with a random person.

347
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:49,870
Right? You like this, right? Because you were raised in a household that like you use Easter baskets for lunch or whatever.

348
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:53,709
But like the the point is, is in this case,

349
00:33:53,710 --> 00:34:00,580
this was an example of somebody trying to differentiate themselves and in doing so, just demonstrated the power of genetics.

350
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:06,320
Okay. All right. So where are they going with this? Oh, right.

351
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:11,050
This is this process of like how a genetic effect can, like, actually shape the environment.

352
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:22,079
So we call that gene environment correlation. So another thing that's important to think about or to understand schizophrenia is that not all genetic

353
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:29,400
risk is two is in that they're just passed down through the parents in the way we think it is.

354
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:35,430
So remember back to like high school, whatever biology the last time you had to draw these like meiosis where you have the

355
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:39,750
cell and splits and it forms the sperm and eggs and bovine that comes out okay.

356
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:46,290
So and in that, in that cartoon example, you learn that you got half your genes from your mind, half your genes from you.

357
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:48,390
That right. That's that's a cartoon example you learn.

358
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:58,240
It turns out some of those genes you get from that particular this is also true for mom but like what we've been looking at that are called de novo.

359
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:03,090
Oh, sorry, I'm back and I've gotten ahead of myself. I'll come back to that slide.

360
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:09,540
The second de novo mutation. So a de novo mutation is a mutation that is present in the sperm cells.

361
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:14,820
In this case, are the germ cells in general. More generically, that is not present in the parent.

362
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:22,170
Okay. So that means that there is a snip somewhere in a sperm DNA that was not present in Dad's DNA.

363
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:27,340
So this is important because again, remember back to basic biology.

364
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:33,400
Women are born with all the eggs they're going to have at conception when they're born.

365
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:45,010
They have all their eggs. You don't make eggs. But men make sperm every day, and that machinery for making sperm gets a little wonky as people age.

366
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:50,740
And so that is it gets less good at finding these DNA error or mutations.

367
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:56,110
And so what this is showing you is age of dads, the age of the father, a conception of the child,

368
00:35:56,470 --> 00:36:02,830
and the number of do you know about mutations in in the sperm of that father?

369
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:11,080
Right. And and this is also showing you the relationship as that relates to having the child have schizophrenia or bipolar or schizophrenia,

370
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:17,860
schizophrenia or autism by about one year. So, again, this is another idea of a family effect.

371
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:24,219
It's coming from a parent, but it's not being passed down through DNA in the way that we typically think about it,

372
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:30,190
where it's dad had an eight year old and mom had a T and so you get A and T instead.

373
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:36,610
Dad has an eight year, mom has a T. Dad's machinery doesn't catch a new mutation.

374
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:40,450
And now you get a C here from Dad still.

375
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:48,910
But. Right. So that's and that's another way that it could because there's this factor that older fathers might say, how old is old?

376
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:59,200
So older fathers, having being in your fifties when you have your first child, is associated with greater risk of schizophrenia in the offspring.

377
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:13,440
And part of why we think this is happening is because of the machinery that manages that, the DNA replication in the germ cells.

378
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:20,970
Okay. This is also not unique to schizophrenia. So I told you there are no genes for schizophrenia.

379
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,750
There are also no de novo mutations for schizophrenia.

380
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:28,590
So this is schizophrenia, Asperger's, chb.

381
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,810
Congenital heart disease, epilepsy and intellectual disability.

382
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:37,550
That's what's coming across the x axis here. The Y axis is the incident rate ratio.

383
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:43,209
So you have a single one of these de novo single nucleotide variance.

384
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:51,670
So this is in the sperm. So this is if that is 35 versus 25, that is 45 versus 25, that is 55 versus 25.

385
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:56,089
So you can see that there's this dose response relationship the older dad is,

386
00:37:56,090 --> 00:38:01,520
the more likely it is that there are higher numbers of de novo mutations.

387
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:07,670
Okay. So there's this this another mechanism by which we sort of think that we're trying to get this family risk.

388
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:13,550
Part of this is through this mechanism, we think. But again, not specific to schizophrenia.

389
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:27,600
All right. Let's talk about Pop. So his lost in the conversation of decriminalizing marijuana has is this

390
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:33,060
conversation around the potential harms of marijuana as it relates to psychosis.

391
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:39,969
So this is an older study from 2005 and the Y axis here is the risk of that psychotic symptoms.

392
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:44,370
So remember, I you know, I asked you earlier in the class how many of you have had déja vu?

393
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:50,070
And then I told you that that was a psychotic like symptom. And to have deja vu, kind of like all the time, you know,

394
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:55,260
or like more frequently or sort of have thoughts that somebody is following you when they're not following you.

395
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:59,310
Right. These are these are examples of psychotic like symptoms.

396
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:06,080
And so what this was looking at is a predisposition, is having a family history of some sort of mental health disorder.

397
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:08,820
Right. So that's that's what these different groups are here.

398
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:15,120
And so what this showed is, well, using if you don't have a family history of mental disorder,

399
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:19,110
using cannabis is not associated with a great increase in risk.

400
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:29,310
But most people do have a family history of something. And so having a predisposition or a family history of serious mental illness and using

401
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:34,220
cannabis is associated with significantly elevated risk of developing psychotic symptoms.

402
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:43,110
This is this is a more recent study that just came out last year and showing you that what this is,

403
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:48,450
these are different types of different types of psychotic like symptoms.

404
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:54,929
So, again, these are not people who have schizophrenia. This is something less than two different psychotic experiences.

405
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:57,210
Or you could sometimes people talk about, you know, kind of.

406
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:09,120
Things like schizoaffective disorder or which is still can be still quite serious, but it's kind of like a mood disorder mix up.

407
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:13,589
The odds ratio here is are not huge. All right. So the Y axis here is odd ratio.

408
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:16,830
One is no effect, 1.5, 50% higher odds.

409
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:23,309
And you can see that most of it most of the effect is happening compared to people who've never used cannabis.

410
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:25,920
Do people have ever used cannabis? So that's the blue versus orange.

411
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:30,479
So we can always be a little nervous about that because we see this big effect here.

412
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,500
It should tell us that the people who use are different than people who don't use,

413
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:38,400
because otherwise I would have expected this to be a much more gradual increase.

414
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:45,930
The fact that this is a big, big increase makes me think there's selection into who uses I'm going to show you that selections in just the next slide.

415
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:52,680
But even if I pretend like this blue bar doesn't exist, you can see that for many of them, although not all of them.

416
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:57,960
The more you use them, the more likely it is that you experience that thing.

417
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:01,110
Of course this is quite true at the same point in time.

418
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:08,579
So we don't know, is this a consequence of your pot use or is this you're experiencing persecution and therefore you use it?

419
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:13,320
Yes, but what are those last two types of delusions?

420
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:17,790
So persecution, persecutory delusions are people are out to get you.

421
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:20,790
And an illusion of reference is you think you're Jesus.

422
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:28,590
I mean, that's not that would be like legitimate but yeah. Like the you you are you have are not.

423
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:41,760
I don't want to be like the facts of the world are not being well integrated into your vision in the world.

424
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:46,020
So the world is flat, for example, would probably qualify as a delusion of reference actually.

425
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:50,910
Like if you have that in a in a tree, what is. So I like delusions of grandeur.

426
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:54,630
Yes, that would be right. Yes. Yes. You think you're hot [INAUDIBLE], but I mean, you should.

427
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:58,500
I encourage you to also have high self esteem, right? Yeah, that would be. That would be.

428
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:07,000
So and then you can combine this across different. So this is a meta analysis.

429
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,629
These are meta analysis combined results from lots of different types of studies.

430
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:16,450
This is sort of the way that we try to understand what does the evidence tell us in totality.

431
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:21,700
You can see here. So this is just ignore that. But this is this watch.

432
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:24,069
Again, the odds ratio of one means no difference.

433
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:28,600
The people we use versus people who don't use have no difference in their likelihood of developing this case.

434
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:34,510
Diagnosis of psychosis and this is psychotic like symptoms. But you can see both of them are high.

435
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:41,320
There is an average of four. Right. Which is pretty, pretty high. We don't see that kind of stuff with most most things that are real risk factors.

436
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:48,990
Right. Just like I told you that higher genetic risk increases the likelihood.

437
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:52,320
Higher genetic research, schizophrenia increases the likelihood that you experience trauma.

438
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:57,420
Higher genetic risk for schizophrenia. It is also associated with like you will use cannabis.

439
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:06,270
So again, back to our example, it is possible that there is some actual causal effect.

440
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:10,620
I mean, you know, cannabis is a hallucinogen. Like that's how it's classified as a drug.

441
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:18,329
So it is possible that there is an actual biological effect here. But it is also the case that people who have higher genetic risk for schizophrenia,

442
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:21,570
which again is not just for schizophrenia, it's for all sorts of mental disorders.

443
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:27,809
Right. See, my earlier comment are more likely to engage in cannabis use, and that's totally consistent with this big,

444
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:33,600
big difference between the blue and the orange that there's something about selecting into using cannabis.

445
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:41,430
Right. And a selection effect is much more consistent with genes shaping your environment than an actual causal effect.

446
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:55,960
Oh, yeah. Is there any studies on whether or not legalization of it has altered that relationship at all or.

447
00:43:56,830 --> 00:43:58,440
Yeah, I mean, it's a great question.

448
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:06,820
I mean, my understanding is that the majority of people who are using someone, more people are using marijuana now than really anything ever.

449
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:14,920
I know if it's ever before, but certainly it is, it is more common than, um, nicotine use now.

450
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:23,829
My understanding is that a lot of at least the initial increase in use occurring after legalization was

451
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:30,760
occurring among older users who would have kind of been out of the risk period for developing schizophrenia,

452
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:37,010
which is really kind of early on in life. Um. It's hard.

453
00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:42,219
I have to go and not as familiar with it. But that would be my my guess is that probably not.

454
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:49,110
But because it does it. That shook me.

455
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:55,930
Do you know if the state applies psychedelics that are more associated with things like hallucinations?

456
00:44:56,670 --> 00:45:07,180
Yeah. So, I mean, so there are examples of people, you know, literally developing a psychosis that never remits from like PCV.

457
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:13,970
Like these things can destroy your brain in a relatively short period of time.

458
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:26,569
So whether that relates to things like, you know, mushrooms and other things like that, it's they're so rarely used in the general population.

459
00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:31,580
It's really actually hard to do this. We can find this because cannabis is so widely used.

460
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:36,200
And again, most of this data is coming out of northern Europe. So it's not.

461
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:42,080
Most of this I'm none of I haven't showed you a single speck of data, actually, because almost everything is coming out of other countries.

462
00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:46,130
So I think it's possible.

463
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:52,130
I think that's what people are worried about. You know, especially because most people when I start using pot, there are 12, 13, 14 years old.

464
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:57,680
So this is not this is not like a 40 year old chilling out.

465
00:45:58,030 --> 00:46:01,400
This is like a 14 year old. Right. So that's what we're concerned about.

466
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:12,960
Yeah, I'm a little bit confused about everything, but does that mean you can attribute more to genetic risk or for schizophrenia?

467
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:18,770
Genetic risk is what is causing high risk cannabis.

468
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:25,100
So you can't necessarily say like, oh, cancer causing schizophrenia, it's all tied back to genes.

469
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:28,590
So it's both. Yes. And it also means.

470
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:35,180
So let me summarize. So both it means that what you think is an environment effect is actually being driven by genes.

471
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:43,700
So it's actually more genetic. But it also means that when I tell you 60% of the risk of whatever schizophrenia is associate with genetics,

472
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:49,340
it means that actually some of that is because of the way that genes shape the environment.

473
00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:55,340
So it's both simultaneously underestimating and overestimating genetic risk.

474
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:00,090
And it's sort of and it presents us with the fact that, like people say, it's nature or nurture.

475
00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:01,520
Oh, that's a stupid question you should like.

476
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:06,380
If anybody says that, you should just say that's not like it's like we're done with that kind of instead.

477
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:12,070
But it's also not genes, times, environment, but it's Jemaine Clement or environment.

478
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:17,029
Right. But it's quite a combo thing. And no, we don't our genes don't exist outside of environment.

479
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:23,400
And our environment does not is is shaped like the environments we move through are shaped by our genes.

480
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:28,300
Very few things happen totally randomly, by chance. Very, very few things.

481
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:34,160
But instead we select into environments that make it more or less likely that certain things will happen.

482
00:47:38,210 --> 00:47:41,750
Good questions. I appreciate all the conversation. All right.

483
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:51,410
So, so think about this is like, okay, so cannabis maybe, but maybe not, you know, and then we talked about family history.

484
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:57,320
So the last thing I want to talk to you about is permanency. So I showed you this graph on the very first day of class.

485
00:47:57,320 --> 00:48:00,620
This is Paris and Times graph according to frame.

486
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:04,669
This is this is in Chicago. This is like Michigan right here. And what this graph,

487
00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:09,200
what they showed was that people who have a diagnosis of schizophrenia were more likely to be

488
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:13,520
living in the urban center of schizophrenia as compared to people who have bipolar disorder.

489
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:17,570
People with bipolar disorder were kind of spread out all over the city.

490
00:48:17,570 --> 00:48:25,490
So that is which is not what you would have expected, given, one, how closely correlated these two conditions are genetically.

491
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:32,959
And second, the fact that like access to care is going to be shaped by where, you know, who has access to things.

492
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:37,100
So you would have expected these things to be patterned similar, but they're not.

493
00:48:37,370 --> 00:48:46,010
And this finding that specifically being born in an urban environment is associated with higher risk of schizophrenia.

494
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:49,490
It's been found repeatedly.

495
00:48:49,850 --> 00:48:53,120
Again, most of the state is coming out of Europe. So this is out of Denmark.

496
00:48:54,110 --> 00:48:57,290
So this cap, this is basically where you're born in Copenhagen.

497
00:48:57,590 --> 00:49:01,310
Were you born outside of Copenhagen? And then whatever other towns are in Denmark.

498
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:06,790
So you have a product of the US public education system and we know you're living in the capital.

499
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:11,360
So so this is this provincial town is the reference group here.

500
00:49:11,870 --> 00:49:13,730
This capital is way up here. Okay.

501
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:22,580
So this is what this is showing is how where are you living at these different ages and your likelihood of developing schizophrenia.

502
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:29,000
And you can see there's this big effect. This is being born there and it essentially just sticks with you your whole life.

503
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,620
So if you're born in an urban area, which is why I asked for this report in cities, don't worry.

504
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:36,979
All right. This one actually is only this is not a huge order. It is not ratio to.

505
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:49,190
Okay. So but that that finding that there's this big mean effect at the at birth this is going to come back when we this is why this is important.

506
00:49:49,310 --> 00:49:57,340
Okay so. Now you're saying, okay, free. But now are you going to tell me that the genes for schizophrenia are associated with place of birth?

507
00:49:57,550 --> 00:50:02,380
Right. Because I've just told you, I've just showed you all these examples of genes are shaping environment.

508
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:05,650
Well, people have actually looked at it. So this is.

509
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:11,629
The polygenic risk score for people. Their place of birth.

510
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:15,410
So where are you born? So? So values greater than zero.

511
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:22,500
The higher genetic risk of schizophrenia. Okay. Values lower than zero means less genetic risk for kids.

512
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:24,500
Okay, so that's the way to think of it.

513
00:50:25,370 --> 00:50:34,520
And so you do indeed see that as we move out to more rural areas, that genetic risk for schizophrenia goes down.

514
00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:38,240
Okay. But again, genetic risk for schizophrenia was set at the moment you were conceived.

515
00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:49,330
Okay. So then the question is, does the finding of Harmonicity as a risk factor for schizophrenia fold up or is it explained by polygenic risk score?

516
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:52,860
And the answer is it is not explained by polygenic risk score.

517
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:57,320
So this is the the the probability.

518
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:02,780
This is your apologetic risk score and predicting place of birth, comparing their capital to rural areas.

519
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:07,489
We go, this is completely unadjusted. This is adjusted. This is the model we want to look at.

520
00:51:07,490 --> 00:51:10,580
The odds ratio is 1.09 confidence bound to include one.

521
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:15,649
Okay. So what that means is that your probably generic score for schizophrenia,

522
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:21,800
which was set the moment you were conceived, does not impact the place of your birth.

523
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:33,950
So that finding that higher urban city is associated with risk of schizophrenia at birth is not a reflection of this genetic risk score at birth,

524
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:39,260
but makes these more complicated. So what about where you live at 15?

525
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:44,810
Because now at 15, you've potentially had some impact on where you live, right?

526
00:51:44,990 --> 00:51:48,770
Maybe not fully. Right. Obviously, you still probably living at home with your parents,

527
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:56,870
but and it turns out that your polygenic score is related to whether you live in a city age 50.

528
00:51:59,070 --> 00:52:01,440
So some so some of this effect.

529
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:09,360
But of course, we don't think most people actually not most people everyone believes that schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental disorder.

530
00:52:09,390 --> 00:52:19,170
That is this is something that early, early life, both in utero and genetics in the way that we've described that is through fathers mutations,

531
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:26,720
through probably general scores, by early life environments that we think are driving risk of schizophrenia, not things close in time.

532
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:32,070
You can compare that to something like depression. Most depression is caused by negative life events that are occurring in the six

533
00:52:32,070 --> 00:52:36,240
months prior to the development of the onset of the condition for schizophrenia.

534
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,790
Even though it doesn't onset until people are in their twenties,

535
00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:47,640
it's likely to emerge that that that path of higher risk was likely started very, very early in life.

536
00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:55,860
So even though it's not expressed until later in life. The implications are genetic risk does not explain the relationship being urban,

537
00:52:55,860 --> 00:52:59,610
the city at least at birth or especially at birth and risk of schizophrenia.

538
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:05,010
So that we think is still a real risk factor and people still don't really understand what that is.

539
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:10,559
Why that is at all that people have looked at.

540
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:12,810
This is comparing people's amygdala,

541
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:19,590
which are a part of your brain that processes fear and how that differs for people who live in an urban area versus a rural area.

542
00:53:19,590 --> 00:53:26,790
And the idea that people's brains are a little bit more kind of the amygdala is a little bit more reactive if you live in a city.

543
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:30,900
Again, this is just one small study of 32 people. I'm just putting it out.

544
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:34,710
There is like people are trying to understand mechanisms like we do not know.

545
00:53:34,830 --> 00:53:38,910
We do not know what's going on. They are.

546
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:44,919
The last couple of things I'm going to tell you, and I'm not going to have time to talk about it today, but we will talk about it later in this class.

547
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:51,700
Is that is something that all of this work, all of this work I'm showing you in the next three slides is from Europe,

548
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:57,340
because we do not have studies like this in the United States because we don't have the

549
00:53:57,340 --> 00:54:01,780
kind of big data linkage systems that you need in order to do this in the United States.

550
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:08,109
And so this blue line here is an odd ratio of one that is no difference.

551
00:54:08,110 --> 00:54:17,350
Comparing the risk of schizophrenia and these different groups, the blue bar are people who are have a are from the Caribbean or North Africa.

552
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:23,680
Right. So these are people who have migrated to the UK or Europe from the Caribbean or North Africa.

553
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:34,090
The Green are people who are coming from Asia. The purple are people who identify as having some sort of mixed background or mixed ethnicity.

554
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:42,340
White are non-British, white ethnicity. So this is migrating from, I guess, whatever, Denmark to England.

555
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:48,760
These are everybody else and this is just in. Then this is that same data, but now it's a rate by place of birth.

556
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:52,420
So were you born in the Caribbean or Africa? Were you born in the Caribbean?

557
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:56,560
There's these different charts mean different things. Okay.

558
00:54:56,830 --> 00:55:03,909
But what you can see is that particularly for people who are from the core, who are black and are of and have migrated to,

559
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:08,860
in this case, the UK from the Caribbean or Africa have very, very high risk.

560
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:16,930
So this y axis here is it estimated incidence rate ratio, the smallest one here is in order is the incidence ratio of three.

561
00:55:17,170 --> 00:55:22,480
The highest goes all the way up here to 16. This and each one of these is a different study.

562
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:30,040
So the the finding that that people, particularly people from those who are not white,

563
00:55:30,310 --> 00:55:36,100
migrate to predominantly white areas like the UK have higher risk of psychosis.

564
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:39,730
We don't have a good understanding of why this is happening.

565
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:45,280
There are some interesting studies that and this is where I'll show you this and then I'll give you the summary slide.

566
00:55:47,070 --> 00:55:55,130
This is showing you. This is not in Europe. This is in. God bless the Netherlands.

567
00:55:56,120 --> 00:56:00,290
So these. This is this is one part of some city in the Netherlands.

568
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:08,180
I can't remember which one. And the darker, the darker the color them, the higher proportion of non-Western immigrants there are.

569
00:56:08,230 --> 00:56:12,980
And most of the immigrants to Denmark are coming either from or trying to to Amsterdam or coming from

570
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:20,000
Suriname or other parts or certain some parts of the Caribbean and North Africa and the Middle East.

571
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:26,510
Okay. So that this this is a neighborhood that has is of high, if you think of it as like an immigrant enclave here.

572
00:56:27,230 --> 00:56:31,250
And then this is the incident race ratio of psychotic disorders.

573
00:56:31,610 --> 00:56:38,599
And what you can see in this first area here, that living in an area where there's a lot of immigrants is associated with lower risk

574
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:42,860
of psychosis compared to if you lived in an area where there were very few immigrants.

575
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:47,839
Look at this one here. And the argument here that people are starting to explore is,

576
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:53,899
is this around essentially experiences of discrimination and also a lack of social

577
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:59,450
capital that you would get by living in a predominantly Dutch area if you were not touch?

578
00:56:59,630 --> 00:57:04,550
Okay. So and I'll leave you there. We'll talk about this more next Wednesday.

579
00:57:05,150 --> 00:57:09,980
The summarize by saying the last 20 years have been this tremendous progress and clarifying factors.

580
00:57:10,670 --> 00:57:16,530
And but it also helps us understand environmental risk factors and how they work.

581
00:57:17,630 --> 00:57:25,480
Okay. So this will make sense on Wednesday. So I'm going to hope that we have time for one more thing.

582
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:30,330
People ask me.

583
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:32,240
All right. I'll stay for a few minutes. I'll see you on Wednesday.
