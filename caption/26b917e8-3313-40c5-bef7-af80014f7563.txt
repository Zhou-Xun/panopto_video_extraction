1
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:14,840
Really important, and I can't stress enough the issue.

2
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:25,570
The balance between protecting the public good, improving the population health without unduly restricting individual liberties.

3
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:32,140
Remember, we're dealing in an era of pretty intense distrust of government.

4
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:41,920
The public resent government officials who tell them how to live and what kind of choices they need to make.

5
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:47,920
Individual stakeholder have moral claims to choice to personal freedoms.

6
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:57,130
Something so obvious to public health practitioner and vaccination is less obvious to individuals who

7
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:03,210
have what public health practitioners are rightly convinced are inappropriate scientific understanding.

8
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:10,600
The role of vaccines in causing autism with the parents obligation to protect that child health.

9
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:20,350
We have a fundamental conflict between the health care system of treating individual patients relative to keeping the population healthy.

10
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:29,980
How do we integrate those two? And finally, there's an important overlay of religious freedom and freedom of conscience.

11
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:38,589
Public health practitioners tend to focus more on the broad population health and

12
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:45,040
tend to limit their focus on individual conscience and potential religious freedom.

13
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,510
Those issues are not likely to be resolved at the local level,

14
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:58,209
but you need to be aware of them as a guiding ethical debate that's ongoing and

15
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:03,760
will affect certain aspects of the policies that you want to develop in an act.

16
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:08,980
Keep in mind that population health differs from medical care.

17
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:19,120
Population health focus on the upstream determinant medical care focused on clinical treatment for individual patients.

18
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:29,830
As a result, each of these has different ethical standards and a well-developed bioethical framework for clinical care.

19
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:41,410
And I alluded to earlier how far less developed set of criteria for public health ethics will come back to that in a couple minutes.

20
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:48,370
But keep in mind that paternalism is applicable to both realms.

21
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:54,700
For years, physicians have been charged with making paternalistic decisions for their patients.

22
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:05,980
Now, public health practitioners aren't charged with making paternalistic concern about what individuals can do or not do in their private lives.

23
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:12,790
Both forms of paternalism are facing limits and push back from the public.

24
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:23,590
We know that when we're thinking about public health ethics, that there are real differences between biomedical ethics and public health ethics.

25
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:29,860
For one thing, the public health sector is accountable to the public.

26
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:34,080
It must make decisions transparently.

27
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:39,210
There is a process for that in issuing regulation.

28
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:45,390
You have town hearings and an opportunity for the public to comment.

29
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:51,360
And a matter of sustaining trust in the community.

30
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,459
The public health system must be transparent and also fair.

31
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:01,440
Policymaking is an essential value in public health ethics.

32
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:11,430
If the public perceives that decision making and fair, then the going to be a lack of trust and good example of that.

33
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:18,630
Then the recent Flint water crisis, where in Flint, rightly, in my opinion,

34
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:26,910
confused the policy making under the state imposed emergency manager and thing fair.

35
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:40,350
Nina Simone, emergency manager, Maine. Led to the lead poisoning for Flint children and adults and two outbreaks of Legionella disease.

36
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:47,100
Why? Because it wasn't open and transparent and there was no fairness in the community.

37
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:53,010
The higher were subordinated to fiscal realities.

38
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:58,830
The public health wasn't protected. There was no fairness in the process.

39
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:07,950
Thus, the role in government is very different from the role in the private sector and the attributes of a town.

40
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:14,580
Public Health Ethical Framework for bioethics will be different from that of public health ethics.

41
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:24,210
However, I guess that earlier there are some macro level public health issues that all public health practitioners need to confront.

42
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:30,990
Resource constraint. You simply won't have enough money to address every public health problem.

43
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:39,690
Therefore, how you allocate resources becomes a source of tension, but also some opportunity.

44
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:48,870
And that's where the role of policy analysis come in, because you have to make tradeoff because you have limited resources.

45
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:55,890
Your allocation decision must be based on a fair and transparent process.

46
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:05,460
Hence the important policy analysis and third public health deal with social and economic determinants of health.

47
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:13,830
These are large ethical issues. How do you address housing, sanitation, food and the like?

48
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:22,770
You can't you can alleviate some of them by allocating resources to the main problems,

49
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:30,690
identifying where these problems prevent the the greatest threat to the population

50
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:36,900
health and how you how can you allocate resources to them in a way that is fair,

51
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:43,890
open and transparent? There are also micro ethical issues that you need to think about.

52
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,880
What's the role of private partnerships and collaboration?

53
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:54,190
Inevitable. You want to and need to collaborate with the community.

54
00:06:54,490 --> 00:07:00,370
But it important that the private not overwhelm or crowd out the public.

55
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:06,410
Going back to the resource and transparency.

56
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:12,320
If you allow the private to soon the public, it won't be transparent.

57
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:20,310
How do you set priorities? What's the moral and ethical decision making in priority setting?

58
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:28,730
Once you set your priority, how do you collect and use data in a way that leads to effective decision making?

59
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,610
And you have to keep in mind the potential political and legal constraints.

60
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:43,640
Even where you think one policy approach is more ethically appropriate from a public health perspective than another.

61
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:54,110
In the end, it's really important to remember that you're operating on a set of values and assumptions in the public

62
00:07:54,110 --> 00:08:01,700
sector that then drive public health ethics in a way that's very different from the private sector.

63
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:07,139
Private sectors focus on. On bioethics in the public sector.

64
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:10,970
And we have to be concerned about the fairness of process,

65
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:18,320
the underlying values of public health such as that, and addressing the determinants of health.

66
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:32,000
The need to be open and transparent and all time will name would result in successful policies to improve the public health.
