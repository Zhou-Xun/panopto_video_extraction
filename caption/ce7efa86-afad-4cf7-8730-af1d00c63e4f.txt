1
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:09,150
You know, we went over some algebra last time.

2
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,820
So we were, you know, standard part of the other section.

3
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,440
Well, I just wonder if you guys have any questions about the algebra.

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:27,570
You could actually go over the number again if there are any questions here or there using matrix notation to control things.

5
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:42,360
Just wonderful, humble pause for a minute and see if there are any questions about respect for the Queen.

6
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:56,370
Okay. So the algebra, I think in itself is if you spend ten, 20, 30 minutes, you should be able to follow them because they are matrix algebra.

7
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:03,110
So you have based on all the facts we listed from from the motor vehicle that you are measuring.

8
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:08,670
But again, here, I want to emphasize the the reason that we are doing this.

9
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,980
If you look at the look at other results, we actually show, you mean, let's start from here.

10
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:21,240
So one result we showed was that you lost that.

11
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,940
They use navigation here we show that they use foundational data is equal to or greater.

12
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:39,870
So this is one important problem we have. We showed the reason that this is important is that this is.

13
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,890
This shows the video as major, the least squares major.

14
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,890
This is unbiased examinations equal to the truth.

15
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,930
So again, why do we care so much about unbiased on business?

16
00:01:51,960 --> 00:02:05,110
Why do we why do we want to show this healthy? The reason is that, again, if you think of the statistics as this is this is a fundamental idea.

17
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:10,710
So if you keep taking sample from the population, if you keep something from the Malaysian,

18
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:16,200
then for each sample you take your able to calculate the state a hat.

19
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:25,120
Like for example, if you're a sample size is 500, then for each 500 individual you take from the population you're able to calculate is based on fact.

20
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,610
Of course, for each sample you take,

21
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:35,010
this beta hat is not going to be equal to exact not exactly the same as the true

22
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:40,140
variant because there is always going to be some random noise to be some randomness.

23
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,820
So the beta how the based on any particular data that is now going to be discussed.

24
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,630
However, if you keep doing this, if your accused keep taking samples,

25
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,460
then if you take many, many samples, then for each sample you calculate a bit ahead.

26
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:03,210
Then on average, if you keep doing this, on average, this variation means on average, rather on average.

27
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:10,140
But we will gather this data back. So if you recall his ground we have showed before.

28
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:17,170
So if you. As a if you make his grab of this better.

29
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,860
Of this better hat than the center.

30
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:28,310
I like this. This is the beta hat.

31
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,700
That's right. So the center is actually beta. So the center around beta.

32
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:39,560
Thank you. So this is done. So at least I mean, we know that.

33
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:45,829
And for this estimate, or at least a square estimate or at least we know that if we keep taking samples,

34
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:52,490
then on average we're getting this data back and this is the importance of this property on business.

35
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:57,070
So another property we showed was the variance on calculating the virus.

36
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:02,360
The virus of error had is equal to in the. Yeah. And we found that is equal to this time.

37
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:11,000
So this is also important because now again, if we go back to the history, if look at this, this is from here.

38
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:21,980
Now the virus does qualify. How, how what are the spread is where this is the square estimate.

39
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:28,100
So so on average this this is going to follow normal dispersion leader.

40
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:32,839
However, this is going to follow a normal as usual. And for this normal this fusion, of course,

41
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:40,760
is important to know how how much variation there is for the estimate of like what you repeated to take your samples.

42
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:47,540
There is going to be variations across this different different different data has estimated dividing this different samples.

43
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:53,450
And then there's this virus that sort of quantified the variation across this different samples.

44
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:59,990
So this is the reason why we want to know that Ruby areas a better hat.

45
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:08,500
And we just found out that there is a bit of happiness. This is not the reason that we are doing just two things.

46
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,240
And then while this is actually where we listed the slide where we stopped last time,

47
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:20,690
then the beta happened, that is where estimated or has some of normality probability.

48
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,620
So it is optimal in some sense. It is the best in some sense.

49
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:30,770
Now, let's take a look at in what sense it is the best. So here is our model, right?

50
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:39,110
Linear regression model and we assume it's not Asian is equal to zero in every individual there is on average.

51
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:48,500
Is this a see muscular parasite matrix? And here, notice that we do not assume the normal distribution assumption.

52
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:53,420
We only assume these values and the error is zero and the variance of that is equal to zero.

53
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:57,920
Squared times comes out of that matrix.

54
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:05,750
Then under such assumption in beta had we know the beta had at least our at least a square estimate.

55
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:10,940
Right. So beta had achieved the minimal variance among linear device passengers.

56
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:20,690
Let's take a look at what this example with us mean. So first of all, we are looking at linear as majors.

57
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:28,340
So here linear as majors, linear is in the sense that this as majors are linear functions of the response one.

58
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,580
We have shown this. In.

59
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,940
Now tell about this one. Just like a regular.

60
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:50,330
So if you look at this list square as major, you see that this matrix involving X, this is a cost of the matrix.

61
00:06:50,750 --> 00:07:00,829
As we mentioned, this is because X we treat X as take. So this is just a matrix of numbers between suffix numbers and this y.

62
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:04,790
Why? This is our response. This is rather remember.

63
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:12,680
Now, if you look how this is, I said that one mathematically means that this b the head is a linear combination of this response y.

64
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,860
So each component of Peter had to be the hands of actor.

65
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:21,210
If you look at each element of beta hat, is that a linear combination of this one?

66
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:26,060
This is what we mean by linear as major. So it's a linear combination of the response way.

67
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,270
Of course, there are into the many combinations you can construct, right?

68
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,750
You can construct anything combinations. So for example, let's consider if if Y is less, y is equal to.

69
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:44,420
Better to write it on the next slide.

70
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:53,120
Okay. So let's say why, for example, let's say if Y is equal to this library's equal to the Y, one,

71
00:07:53,130 --> 00:08:00,860
y, two, three, three, three individuals, and then I can construct any linear combination.

72
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:05,899
I get this right. For example, y one plus two, y two minus.

73
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:10,750
You know what? This is one particularly non-Asian and a four.

74
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:15,920
And of course, I can use this linear combination to estimate.

75
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:24,290
But let's say I made a better one. The slope by, let's say I estimate that they don't want to be equal to this particular linear combination.

76
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:30,690
I'm just making of an example. Let's say your your you can definitely use this.

77
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:33,839
Whether this is a good estimate or not, that's a different sorry.

78
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:38,190
Right. But you can definitely use this to estimate better.

79
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:43,500
What if somehow you just believe this about this? This is the way you're going to ask me to be one.

80
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:48,270
And this is linear. Linear has made her a better one.

81
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:58,650
And as you can see, then you can never change the you know how many coefficients there are into the many ways of of of of service.

82
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:04,919
That linear combination of this one and each such linear accommodation, you can call it an estimate, are better off again.

83
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,819
Well, whether that's a good estimate or bad, that's that's a different story.

84
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,460
But you can you can definitely use that to estimate better.

85
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:22,440
And then if we put all these linear functions of the response white together, that's all the linear s matrix and linear,

86
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:28,930
at least a square s meter is definitely among these s majors because we have shown that we are.

87
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:32,250
This grass meter is a linear combination response y.

88
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:40,830
So this is where s meter is within this class, within the linear functions of the response enhanced meter.

89
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:47,340
So that's what we mean by linear as matrix. And then the linear I'm biased as major.

90
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,840
So. Libya as a leader.

91
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:56,790
If you construct an arbitrary, linear as major, it may not be unbiased.

92
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,660
But now we are looking at as a major step towards linear.

93
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:05,370
And I'm biased as we already.

94
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:14,100
Now, Ernie seemed a lost means now. But you're asking me on average is equal to the truth.

95
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,870
So this is. A modest means.

96
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:26,570
And so then if you just restrict the attention to all the linear and biased ask matrix.

97
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:31,730
Okay, so this is a still a kind of large class of ass majors.

98
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:37,340
If you ever restrict ourselves to this large class of asking me to leave here, my boss has made her.

99
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,480
But it turns out that this leaves the square as major.

100
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:47,680
Well, incidentally, one member of this class, I mean, your boss has made her, and it turns out that,

101
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:51,740
you know, achieve the minimal variance if you cowboy is variance is the minimum.

102
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:57,920
If it's if it's the smallest amount. This class of Olena understands meters.

103
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:07,220
This is a desirable priority because again, so if we go back to this huge round here.

104
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:20,370
Now given as majors. Devoleena Abbas asked majors because they are Hamas, so they all center around his true have and all the people as major.

105
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:27,860
They will have different liberation. You have different mattresses. And of course, now we would like to have the housemaid her.

106
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:30,450
We will have to use that meter has the least variation.

107
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:41,400
Right because because if you keep taking the sample, give her samples and as we mentioned, there will be variation across the different samples.

108
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:46,560
When you ask me to ban but we will I tell you not to have to use the has made her

109
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:51,330
a better hand that does not a better way to match across this different samples.

110
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:58,170
So then that means that the the as a matter that concentrates around more concentrated around.

111
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:05,310
That's the ask major we realize we use and it turns out that this beta had at least a square meter.

112
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:15,450
Exceeds the minimum guarantee. So indeed, we look at it differentiate ourselves to the class of linear bus adds meters meters.

113
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:21,240
Lisa's grass meter is the one that we should we should use has the least of errors.

114
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:29,610
So this is the interpretation of obviously that it shows the optimality of this.

115
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:39,870
This is where as major and this is referred to as that to the best means in your advised as major or or so for any other.

116
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:50,160
And indeed I had prime for any other idea about as major as this varies is smaller smaller than or equal to its the minimum that has the movements.

117
00:12:55,170 --> 00:13:05,370
Okay. So but here on to another point I would make is that it has the minimum varies among the linear I'm biased to asymptotes.

118
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:15,510
So sometimes although in this course we we will not talk too much about that, but we will see definitely see more about this in the other courses,

119
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:21,090
especially in sex, until there is a very bias in our history of where we construct different asymmetries.

120
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:25,469
So here we are looking at all Marcellus majors as a measure.

121
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:32,940
We want to be as a meter to on average not to center around the truth of and Amazon

122
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:38,879
as majors we want to find in the world has at least a year but sometimes we are

123
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:45,180
able to further reduce the variance by allowing the estimate are to be slightly too

124
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:51,590
biased so that the description of the the his crown does not center up anymore.

125
00:13:51,970 --> 00:14:05,020
But then by. And so suppose I have one as major.

126
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:17,100
But as the matter centers around data and the truth about that and it has this variation.

127
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:27,260
And suppose I have another as major. Let's say it's.

128
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,820
It has much smaller areas, but it doesn't.

129
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,000
Well, but unless they feed on it somewhere here, it's not in the center.

130
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,420
This is the center. But a beta, let's say is five people in the center.

131
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,840
But it has a is more concentrated around the center.

132
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:48,170
It's in this case, it has slight bias and is slightly biased.

133
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,020
However, its variance can be much smaller.

134
00:14:52,460 --> 00:15:01,380
And in this case, sometimes we might be we might prefer to estimate her instead of this Abbas estimate, or that has a larger variation.

135
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:09,530
And because this one is more accurate, if you if you if you want to use this as a matter of to estimate the true data,

136
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:17,480
that is always well, it's not always but but but there there is a criteria on a which no leader alone will tell about that.

137
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:23,819
So under which this this as a meter is closer for beta because when you look at of the first ask,

138
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:27,350
maybe this has made some data satellite TV or some data,

139
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:32,360
you know, some beta had no way to elaborate for the right one because there is a longer narration.

140
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:41,990
But if we're for this one for this one here, I mean, although they mean that there is a variation, one variation is much smaller.

141
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:45,980
So this is the so-called bias variance tradeoff.

142
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:56,160
So sometimes we might we might have been willing to have a slight of bias as major, but assuming a much smaller variation by smaller veterans.

143
00:15:56,590 --> 00:16:05,840
And then in that case, under some other criteria, having slight a bias may not be a bad thing.

144
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:10,280
So in that case. Now, if we allow the.

145
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:18,380
Estimated to be slightly biased, then this Peter Hatch may not be the optimal anymore.

146
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:23,000
They might be more because they have larger veterans and they have larger veterans.

147
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,960
So you could afford to reduce the veterans by by allowing the presence of some biased.

148
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,670
So that's a that's another that's the one point I would like to make.

149
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:39,260
So this better attack is actually the best about linear.

150
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:48,470
I'm biased as matrix on the business side. So first linear biases matrix and this is the so called gossamer call theorem.

151
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:56,020
Any questions about this? al-Maliki results.

152
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:17,319
Okay. And then another overriding result is, well, if we assume now Epsilon follows a normal decision,

153
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:21,880
now we are assuming the normal distribution and making the normality assumption.

154
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:28,630
Then the ASA as well, at least the square as a meter is actually the so-called maximum likelihood as major.

155
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,250
And this concept here,

156
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:37,690
while in this course we we don't have time to really rigorously talk about what are the likelihood is what a maximum height of last meter is.

157
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:42,580
And this is a formal cause that we are going to see in say so true of so and so.

158
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,290
But let's not worry too much about this.

159
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:51,330
But the point is that, okay, so now we are making the normality assumption and we are still looking at the hand,

160
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:54,370
which is the new square meter in this case.

161
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:58,720
Now, after making this stronger assumption, normality assumption,

162
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:03,850
while we are of course we are adding this normality assumption, we are we are making stronger assumption.

163
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:13,720
After making this stronger assumption, assuming comes from follow this normal, then Peter Hedge becomes the so-called humility, the uniform minimum.

164
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,980
There is unbiased estimate and you are ambiguity.

165
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:22,120
Yeah, this is our concept that we are not going to power too much here.

166
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,880
But you will see this is so true.

167
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:37,870
But the point here is that now the optimality becomes even stronger because we are making a stronger assumption of normality becomes more general.

168
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:43,180
So now we are looking at almost as major, not necessarily linear anymore.

169
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:52,290
So this major as well. Now we are looking at a larger class of asymmetries, a larger class in the sense that this has two meters deep.

170
00:18:52,510 --> 00:19:02,950
We only need to be analyzed. This is not material from this American can can be nonlinear has to be the hat and of all this within

171
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:08,290
this larger class I've asked majors like these as majors are only I'm biased by natural linear.

172
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:16,510
I'm on this larger class of as majors. That beta hat is already optimal in the sense that it has the minimum variance.

173
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:23,230
I still have a minimal variance and the uniform of the minimum,

174
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:29,950
whereas this uniform is naturally it refers to one for any beta value, for any true better value.

175
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:34,150
This beta happens you knew about is as the minimum varies.

176
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:40,140
So again, while we do not need to worry too much about the formal definition of due

177
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:45,640
ambiguity because this is a concept we are going to talk a lot in six or two.

178
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:54,760
But at the point, the point of this result is that if you are making a stronger assumption, having the normality assumption,

179
00:19:55,150 --> 00:20:03,100
then you are able to extend to the reality, making a stronger conclusion about that optionality.

180
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:08,670
So now the the as major new square meter is has the minimum variance among

181
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:14,080
all are biased as majors within a larger class of asymmetrical that becomes.

182
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:36,290
Okay. And again, of course, after driving this speaker hat, after getting this bit of hash, not if we calculate this X better hat.

183
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:41,220
Now we can use this to estimate why this is.

184
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:53,400
Ask me the amount of water. Or in other words, this is the 52 minute recall that the mean of water is at speed in the mean of wise expanse.

185
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:58,420
And of course, if we plug Peter had into this, we get the feel of me.

186
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:02,510
This is the estimate that we know of, of why.

187
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:05,690
And if we put a wipe while we put a hat on it,

188
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:14,840
just to indicate this is estimated about an estimate just like similar to better we put a hat on how well better communicated is

189
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:21,920
an estimate and a value for data and similarly we put a hat on Y indicates its estimated value for what I feel about over one.

190
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:29,090
Now Peter, how do we know that it's equal truthfulness or at least whereas nature it has this expression.

191
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:33,320
So if we replace a hat by this expression.

192
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:54,670
Then. If we simply call this matrix, if we combine this everything in front of why we call H given, then we call it h matrix.

193
00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:02,500
Then the y hat is simply equal to h times y and this matrix.

194
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:06,890
H h. This is the so-called hat matrix.

195
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:12,070
If you read literature, a linear regression model, you will see this name quite,

196
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:20,800
quite a lot and had a matrix we call it has matrix because I mean, so because the ask me the matter y hat is given by h y.

197
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:30,160
So. So if you multiply y by h, then you simply add a you get a hat and simply put a hat on on y on top of one.

198
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:35,280
So that's why it's called a hat matrix. Now the had a matrix.

199
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:40,300
If we look at a matrix, they had a matrix is again by M matrix.

200
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,370
The reason is that here.

201
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:53,620
Yeah I think it's always especially if you are gonna see linear regression using using the matrix the data for the first time.

202
00:22:53,620 --> 00:23:01,540
I think it's always a good practice to to make sure that you know what the dimensions are for different uses.

203
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:12,520
So that's here we have x times x transpose times x inverse x transpose, right?

204
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:16,719
So the x is the design matrix and we know that is our matrix.

205
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:26,110
And by P the national right. So N is the number of subjects and PS the number of Valence X is AVP matrix.

206
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:34,240
So X transpose that is this is P by n matrix and the x is again in by p matrix.

207
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:42,040
So that and stressful time x that's going to be a P by the P matrix in the middle.

208
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:47,200
If you have images taken of an inverse, of course you still get a P by a p matrix.

209
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:55,270
So this matrix here, this this is a P by p matrix.

210
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:05,890
Then Extras post. This is a piece by Matrix.

211
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:18,230
So you have a imbibe XI matrix multiplied by p by the images in the middle and then multiplied by another image.

212
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:25,729
So in the end you have a in a matrix, and that's the dimension of the matrix.

213
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:38,299
That's in the matrix. And this actually makes sense because we know that while h here we just run out of age is in

214
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:45,350
to end in the images and a Y we know that it is a n dimensional vector because why is that?

215
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:50,959
Is that actor compromises for the responses from the individuals?

216
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,940
Raisa is a callback. So it's an by one vector.

217
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:59,120
So this way ahead of them is also n by one vector.

218
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:03,050
It's just a defeated mean for each of the individuals.

219
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:08,710
So indeed, you can see that a dimension which is match on that on both ends of the equation.

220
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:18,740
So this is a triangular dimension. Well, sometimes it's a very easy, very quick way to check in whether there are any errors in your calculation.

221
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:26,450
Because if you miss a transpose or if you if there are some some mistakes and errors in the calculation,

222
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:30,230
in the end, sometimes the matrix dimension do not match anymore.

223
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:40,160
And so this is a very easy, very clear way of checking whether the calculation is cracked as to check whether recognition or match.

224
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:45,950
So this is matrix. This is an end by end matrix.

225
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:51,080
And it only involved the X, the desired matrix.

226
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:56,000
So it's all involve the covariance. So it's a six.

227
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,690
It's not random. Okay.

228
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:14,180
This is not the hearing loss inside. I am using the Microsoft Edge to show the slides so that, you know, it's it doesn't show as.

229
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:20,060
As as a as a as a as a slight.

230
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:26,030
Well, the reason is that it is much easier for me to write write on this slice.

231
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:31,030
Okay. So now you Homer, too.

232
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:40,760
I think you guys have shown that age is symmetric with a matrix is symmetric, and either important by symmetry,

233
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:46,530
we mean that symmetric means that age is equal to age transports and item hope.

234
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:56,030
Potent means that age is equal to eight. A square is still equal to age, and a soul is a production matrix.

235
00:26:56,040 --> 00:27:00,770
And later. In a few minutes, we are going to make it clear what we mean by production.

236
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:13,370
But age is a production matrix. And then if you look at I minus age, our bodies age is also symmetric and item older.

237
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:18,930
This is very easy to show was we show that age is symmetric and important, that it's very easy to show.

238
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:23,570
Ionization is also seen as a component and thus a progression matrix.

239
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:33,570
Okay. And then when age comes X is equal to x.

240
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:40,440
This is very easy to see because age is equal to because age is equal to x.

241
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:44,970
X transpose x inverse that x principles.

242
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:50,660
This is edge. If you multiplied by X.

243
00:27:54,190 --> 00:28:00,070
Well, here you have a X transporter, max, and here you have the inverse of x transport of x.

244
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:04,540
So the Kessler and these two are canceled. So what is lab is simply this x.

245
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,940
This is very easy to to see.

246
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:19,540
And then because h x is equal to x, now we can subtract X on both sides or you can move this x to the left of the equation.

247
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:23,680
Then you have another matrix minus x equals zero.

248
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:30,780
And that's simply subtracting a major exhaust from both both from both sides.

249
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:38,760
And then you can take the transports market here, you the transports on both sides of this equation.

250
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:44,880
So if you take transports, you have here, you have a matrix multiply by another matrix X,

251
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:50,430
you take a transport, then you have X transpose multiplied by the transpose of this matrix.

252
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:57,600
But this matrix is symmetric, so the transports interest itself and equal to the transpose of zero.

253
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:08,940
And here are just simply taking in this stop here, you map here, we're simply taking the principles of both sides of the equation.

254
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:14,549
So once we got here, this is equal to it.

255
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:19,020
Or then if we multiply both sides by Y.

256
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:28,800
So this implies that this is equal to zero.

257
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:43,570
Well, the reason is, is that those earrings actually written out of their energy.

258
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:49,690
So the left hand side here this mobile left by why that it gives us.

259
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:56,440
This guy, I'm simply multiplying this guy by by one.

260
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:05,740
And then if I want to have a run his by y right hand side, this is a zero vector of course multiplied by anything still gives us zero.

261
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:11,780
And that's this this zero over here. Of.

262
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:17,270
Okay. And then now I simplified this a little bit.

263
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:28,820
And this multiplied by what then? If we look at this per documentary as product and then I want this item to multiply by Y and that's this Y here.

264
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:34,850
Then this age multiplied by this y as y as we know.

265
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:43,990
Right? H times y is gives us. Y at. Okay.

266
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:50,970
So this is just a, you know, directly. Calculating this this matrix part.

267
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:56,100
Now we know that Y minus y had a this is why this is absent that.

268
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:07,020
What? Why had his hour fitted me and why minus my hat is just our estimate of absolute absolute.

269
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:12,180
So in the end, we see that. Yeah.

270
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:19,650
This is this residual. Does this look familiar to you guys?

271
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:27,360
This equation. We have we have seen this.

272
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:34,870
So this is actually the normal equation, the equation that we saw to estimate EBITA to estimate here.

273
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:44,280
It's recall that when we set the well, we use a certain form here.

274
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:06,099
Yeah, we call that. As I see it Steve is defined by this is the end result of square and the least the square

275
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:12,700
as major by definition is of grass meter as to minimize the sum of these residuals,

276
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:17,229
the square of the residuals, and a we minimize the sum of square residuals.

277
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:20,920
We have to take the derivative in a set of 30 equal to zero.

278
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:25,320
Right? That's how we estimate the beta drop beta happen.

279
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:34,899
And then if we want to throw all the algebra in the middle as well, we use matrix notation to, to to do the calculation.

280
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:43,000
Right, we do the calculation. In the end, we found that the derivative is actually equal to this guy.

281
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:47,650
So then this equation becomes the so-called normal equation, right?

282
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:54,700
But by solving this equation, we got a beta hat. That's how we estimate a beta, that's how we estimate our maintenance.

283
00:32:55,870 --> 00:33:00,070
And if you look at this equation, you know that.

284
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:08,640
It's time to speed ahead. This is simply why happened. And the y minus y hat.

285
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:16,010
That's. That's sibling.

286
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:25,120
And that equal to zero. Right.

287
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:33,420
So this is the exact equation that we we just saw, you know, in a in a in a in a slide in the later slides.

288
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:42,060
So in other words, we have seen this equation that at the X transpose and absolute had equal to zero.

289
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:48,840
That's exactly our normal equation. Now we are just getting back to a normal equation.

290
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:52,060
So you.

291
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:01,370
And this is this evolution is exactly the same as before.

292
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,910
So this is not normal. This is the equation that we solve.

293
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:14,210
So well. Previously we solved this equation together, get a hat, and now they're just saying that without a better hat.

294
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:18,300
I mean, if we have to have this equation, of course we have to have this equation.

295
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:24,230
You have to think of how we saw that. So we have this normal equation.

296
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:30,250
Now there is a dramatic interpretation of this normal equation.

297
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:37,260
That's the reason why we call this age matrix of production matrix of a national matrix.

298
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:45,180
So there is a for linear regression, there is a geometric interpretation of linear regression at least, at least square meter.

299
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:50,610
And now let's take a look at what the geometric interpretation is.

300
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:53,970
This involves so-called projection.

301
00:34:57,150 --> 00:35:06,270
I mean, for I mean, for some of us, a lot depends on our familiarity with the linear algebra, our kind of so-called connection.

302
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:16,230
Some of us may find this easier to love. This is an easier way of looking at any of the algebra or almost any linear, linear regression.

303
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:25,410
And some of us may think this is a slightly less intuitive, less obvious than, you know,

304
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:33,930
just us going through the algebra, just looking at a B squared from a from a from the point of view.

305
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:41,459
But anyway, so now we are we are looking at this. The point of this slide is to provide alternative interpretations,

306
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:47,790
alternative way of looking at linear regression reasons for regression from a geometric point of view.

307
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:56,610
To suppose we have two actors X and Y or x and y, here is vector y, here is that the x?

308
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:02,550
But then the progression of vector y on to x,

309
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:08,219
the production you can imagine you have a you have a light coming coming from you

310
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:14,610
have a light coming from loosely and then you produce this match or y onto this,

311
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:26,730
this line. The lines span by the backdoor x so you have a light matching the Y background to this and that's thus called a so-called production.

312
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:34,170
So the production of Y until X is actually given by this given by y hat.

313
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:39,230
That's the Y half here. This is this is actually y hat. This is large.

314
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:53,149
This factor is last. Well, the reason that this is the production because mathematically the production model of the production,

315
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:58,850
all two X that is actually well is an actor living in a space standby.

316
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:03,470
So it becomes a subtle constant modify by this slight tracks.

317
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:15,590
So you know we for we do not have the time the luxury to get into details like a better detailed algebra or definition of linear space,

318
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:23,600
linear, you know, production. But here, let's just and use our intuition to understand this.

319
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:33,620
So here why had the production of why all the space spent by X that's why had got leaves in this space of X.

320
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:38,120
And so it's as you constant multiply by this X.

321
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:43,160
That's what the parameter in my head is. And then in order to find this production.

322
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:50,840
But but let's say now, let's say if you look at different factors living in this space, let's say here you have.

323
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:57,960
If you look at the deferred deferred cost of a.

324
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:03,360
Then this guy and this guy.

325
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:07,580
These are y minus the corresponding eight times x.

326
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:12,810
So suppose, I suppose this vector here. This vector here.

327
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:21,810
This is this is A of X and then this is Y minus A of x.

328
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:31,770
I can't. It's. Y minus mix.

329
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:45,150
And in the production, the production, the Y hand has the probability that the residual Y minus A of x should be minimized.

330
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:53,760
We should choose the scalar. We should choose a a have such that the one minus y hat and this is the absolute term.

331
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:58,680
This is the absolute. So the norm of absolute, the level of absolute.

332
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:04,080
The stature should be minimized. That's when the well that's how the position is defined.

333
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:14,040
Again, just imagine there's there is light coming from this direction right perpendicular to the space spent by X and that's how of how intuitively,

334
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:17,369
what do we mean by prediction of light projection?

335
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:24,910
Go back to white on the face of X and then of course go back to the projection cards,

336
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:31,770
vote what the corresponds to the level that you know this left here.

337
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:36,090
The residual should be minimized as completely minimized.

338
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:48,690
So that's why we need my prediction. Okay. So after minimizing this, it turns out that this is a hat that's given by this.

339
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:59,120
This is what I have is. Then let's keep it that let's not worry too much about the algebra behind.

340
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:03,290
Well, this is what I had is. So, in other words, the production.

341
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:07,730
The Y hat is given by. It's given by this guy.

342
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:19,180
End of the adversarial, the residual term then becomes perpendicular or orthogonal to the space spent by axis.

343
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:24,310
So absolute becomes orthogonal to this. Okay.

344
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:32,290
And then. Well, that's a protection for vector.

345
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:35,680
Now here that is NYPD.

346
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,469
So a matrix matrix. Yeah.

347
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:48,940
Is the number of individuals empty is the number of values then the production of the vector y onto the column space of x is given by this guy.

348
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:56,499
So this is the reason why you had a matrix is a production matrix.

349
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:09,580
So essentially it's predicted where you estimate the Y how well estimated this y user y hat you're predicting the Y on to the column space spend by x.

350
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:14,940
Let's take a look at another joke about this.

351
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:19,890
This graph may make things hopefully make things easier to interpret.

352
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:24,810
So now suppose the x that is our matrix has only two columns.

353
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:28,860
Of course, in general that is our matrix have as P columns.

354
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:33,479
But let's let's save for four for our purposes, let's say for interpretation.

355
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:39,570
But let's just say that it has two columns. So it has as one and as true as two columns.

356
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:46,439
This two columns span the space, the shaded area on the floor here, write this.

357
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:52,860
This is the space. Spend x one extra you can consider.

358
00:41:52,860 --> 00:42:02,180
It's actually the floor. The floor and that's that's spent by two dimensional action in our three dimensional space.

359
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:11,830
It was started by two dimensional matter and a that's, that's surrounded by X1 XStream and now I have a vector Y that's actually one.

360
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:21,029
You just imagine there is a bigger Y here in a three dimensional space, but our little product was Y until this A4 spread by x,

361
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:32,670
one x and then, well, by projection we mean that the level of abs from here becomes smallest.

362
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,049
Or in other words,

363
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:45,930
here the this residual needs to be orthogonal to the to the to the plane two to allow space spend more time with one X And by minimizing that,

364
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:53,640
okay, by minimizing that. So we find better hacks to minimize the distance between y and y hat.

365
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:59,530
So this y hat is actually the production position y until the space man has one installed

366
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:09,030
by minimizing the absolute that means enter the absolute has to be orthogonal to this,

367
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:13,230
to this, to this, to this plane, to this.

368
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:19,140
While anything on this on this plane, anything on this list in the space spanned by x1x.

369
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:25,680
So in particular it is orthogonal to the design matrix because these are matrix of these

370
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:33,250
are the two columns that that of course lives in the space span by the two columns of x1x,

371
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:42,060
right. So, so in other words, the residual in the end, the residual has to be orthogonal to this column.

372
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:47,970
These are matrix. That's exactly how we find this.

373
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:54,890
How you write this made a hat. So that's the linear combination of excellent X to that.

374
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:02,790
It gives us y hat an exclusion. Excellent answer gives us 1yy have such that the answer is actually orthogonal.

375
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:10,860
That is, the residual is orthogonal to the space standpoint columns and matrix.

376
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:18,510
Okay. So this is well, this again gives us the normal equation.

377
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:23,520
So the residual has to be orthogonal through the column space of X.

378
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:30,570
This is a geometric two point of view how, how the better hat is derived.

379
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:38,340
So the better hat is derived by minimizing the abstract or by finding the absolute that is orthogonal,

380
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:43,830
that is orthogonal to the, to the column space of X, which is on matrix ax.

381
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:54,159
Okay. So this is a just well, if you look at this whole thing, this is just providing us an alternative way of understanding this.

382
00:44:54,160 --> 00:45:02,340
The Square has made it from a geometric apostrophe, but for me, as is purely algebra, it's purely a linear algebra matrix, however.

383
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:11,190
So we've minimized the sum of square, the end result squares, and we take a derivative of South Jersey equal to zero to solve that equation.

384
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:24,800
But here this two slice, just trying to give us alternative interpretation of the normal equation from a geometric production polynomial.

385
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:34,860
And so it's because it's for this reason that the H matrix, the H matrix is, is called the production matrix.

386
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:40,679
Right. So that's why we here we we mentioned it's h is actually a progression matrix is

387
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:48,900
predicting is a production of the Y the response Y onto the column space spanned by X.

388
00:45:54,290 --> 00:46:03,150
Any questions? Okay.

389
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:07,110
And then. Now the conclusion is that.

390
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:19,770
So here, of course, this these are matrix X and of the Y back to I mean from this it's easier to see from this from this cleft, right.

391
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:32,820
So the x the x matrix and the, the one that I had a actor and of x matrix, I the two columns of X, they are all on this plane.

392
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:37,500
This plane is by the column called the backdrop x.

393
00:46:38,310 --> 00:46:42,610
So these are on the floor on this plane. So this absolute.

394
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:46,560
That's that's that's the sky over here. That's orthogonal.

395
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:56,370
Orthogonal to this one. And then this absolute hat is orthogonal.

396
00:46:56,370 --> 00:47:07,350
Then it must be orthogonal to both X and y hat, because both X and y hat that are they are they are they are believe in this in this plane here.

397
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:11,549
And so so absolute because absolute is useless out for this plane.

398
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:16,709
So everything has to be orthogonal to anything living in this plane.

399
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:28,050
And then because both what X and Y have been in that sense, all have had his orthogonal to both and that was all kind of orthogonal to x.

400
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:37,710
This is just our normal equation, like this is equal to zero, this is our intrusion and this is had orthogonal to y hat.

401
00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:43,410
So that is the the inner part on this two is equal to zero plus.

402
00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:51,970
Right. Okay.

403
00:47:53,500 --> 00:48:00,909
Again, I mean, here that's we actually wrote down the dimension explicitly so because it's again,

404
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:07,150
it's always a good idea to keep track of to keep track of the dimension of all the measurements,

405
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:14,180
because, again, this is a very easy way through to check whether there is any error or calculations.

406
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:21,040
So so the transpose of these images is free by hand and absolute.

407
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:26,380
And this is in by what? In any one factor.

408
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:38,200
Okay. Any questions about this whole discussion so far?

409
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:54,830
Okay. So, I mean, yeah, maybe, you know, let's just finish this slide real quick and then we will take a break.

410
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:02,280
So for what? Hash. Now, this is the feed of the mean for the feed.

411
00:49:02,330 --> 00:49:07,700
The mean, if we calculate, is excitation. Oh, there is a very easy way of counting a lot.

412
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:17,240
This is very easy to calculate of because y hand is equal to h times y as we mentioned.

413
00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:23,569
That's that's that's why we call it h. I had a matrix so y minus H multiplied by H.

414
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:26,780
That's simply putting a hat on top of one.

415
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:42,800
So y had is equal to h times y, but h we know that it is equal to x transpose times x h equal to x times x principal x inverse times x transforms.

416
00:49:43,610 --> 00:49:53,840
Right. So h is a constant matrix. So then of course we can pull it out of the excitation because it's just a matrix of numbers.

417
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:58,930
It's a constant matrix. So it becomes h times. Things manage on one.

418
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:06,570
And for his foundation. Why? We know that it is equally true and transparent.

419
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:15,480
So that this becomes a change times from things that I don't know why that is Alzheimer's then.

420
00:50:17,370 --> 00:50:20,670
And then we know that, hey, times X is just equal to X.

421
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:26,360
This is because eight times eight times x is equal to again.

422
00:50:28,510 --> 00:50:38,950
How X transpose this is age that times x y is not by Y adds that here this guy and the inverse of this

423
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:47,290
and cancel this to a matrix measures as cancel what is left is just this x so this is equal to x.

424
00:50:48,340 --> 00:51:00,670
That is why here in this multiplication we combine h and x that we get x just a single x left x timestamp.

425
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:13,640
So if you look out of this, well, this me and these that leggings foundation of y hat which has an equal to X time span.

426
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:23,159
So the other thing I have is that I'm biased for evaluation.

427
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:26,640
Of what? Ask.

428
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:38,860
So again, this shows that, well why hatch if we use why hatch the feed in the mean as an estimate of the true response the

429
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:48,300
true response why that is an unbiased estimate of the food is based on agency as individuals.

430
00:51:49,030 --> 00:51:57,919
Okay. So we will stop here. We will have to take a seven minute break from the of these.

431
00:52:02,270 --> 00:52:16,160
Now this is a toy example. This is an example where we consider X, it's just equal to, you know, this X one box and Microsoft,

432
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:24,050
they're just considering while this is a toy example where you'll have to call ups, the plane is fed by this.

433
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:31,340
Call him back. Now, if you have more columns, do X likely.

434
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:35,240
I mean, of course, in practice that's always has more than two columns.

435
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:43,790
So you've got more than two column than this plan here. Now, then we do not have a way to make a plot in a three dimensional space.

436
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:47,930
But this plan here we'll be spending by all the column factor of X.

437
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:57,080
If you have P columns and you have this and this, this is a plan he repeated in the space of P.

438
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:02,390
Yes, yeah. Dimensional space is a span by this P columns.

439
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:05,050
But anyway, so my point is that this is a toy.

440
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:15,950
And now if we think about this more intuitively, let's, let's forget about all of these a mathematical expression in this graph.

441
00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:26,360
Let's just think about this intuitively. So you have an X that has p holes that's in p p variables, she call it including liners.

442
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:33,500
And we have peacocks and you have a Y, you have a response Y from individuals.

443
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:45,270
So linear regression. What linear regression does is that it it's wise to use the P columns of x, the P variables to explore.

444
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:48,670
Or why there. And that's that's what we are trying to do.

445
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:59,940
So you you observe the response. Why? Now you are trying to explain the response by using this coverage, by using, for example, your response.

446
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:03,340
Why is is is wait people's wait.

447
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:10,210
Right. And the the the acts you're trying to explain weight by people, age by people.

448
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:14,710
That's a gender about people's, you know, college played by all these terrorists.

449
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:24,909
Sandra, of course, intuitively, without any mathematics in general, if you just think about this intuitively, intuitively,

450
00:54:24,910 --> 00:54:36,310
when we tried to get the best explanation of why using this two columns of X, they intuitively we should actually be the best.

451
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:42,870
The best explanation should occur when the distance between my response Y and

452
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:48,669
but the from my my space then by the column factors of X whether this is be the

453
00:54:48,670 --> 00:54:54,340
smallest and that that's what we get out of the best explanation using that X to

454
00:54:54,340 --> 00:55:01,770
explain and it's that intuition behind the true major geometric interpretation I.

455
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:10,479
So we are trying to use the columns of mass to best explain why and by explaining why in the larger you know,

456
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:16,330
the distance between y in a space spend by the x that's the smallest.

457
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:22,240
So the absolute hat is the smallest is orthogonal to the columns is a mass.

458
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:32,770
That's just a few words I like to add about the general population.

459
00:55:34,150 --> 00:55:40,300
Okay. So we have shown that an explanation of why that is equal true at speed.

460
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:46,929
And so y hat is I'm biased. I asked Major what other response now what about of the variance?

461
00:55:46,930 --> 00:55:53,650
Oh, I promised that we will make announcement about the exam statements.

462
00:55:55,500 --> 00:56:02,760
This is super important. So I unloaded a few slides here.

463
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:08,250
This is one announcement on remodeling. Let's.

464
00:56:14,470 --> 00:56:36,340
Maybe I should come. Okay to study.

465
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:41,919
To prepare for the exam where you want to focus on our own experience.

466
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:46,360
We have all the slides, the homework and the pass the exam.

467
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:55,030
So for passing exam we will upload a sample example from the past three years from 2019, 2020 to 2021.

468
00:56:55,330 --> 00:57:00,100
So you guys can together with the with a solutions on you guys can take a look at

469
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:04,120
those sample exams we are going to post online after the first of this lecture

470
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:08,290
so guys can take a look at what type of questions are expected of you expect to

471
00:57:08,290 --> 00:57:15,759
see in our exam and then the exam the coverage will be modules a through module.

472
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:21,890
Even home are three actually we posted on.

473
00:57:23,910 --> 00:57:34,200
And for hobo three, well over three will be posted for.

474
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:38,280
I think so. Yeah. So about. Oh what a solution.

475
00:57:39,090 --> 00:57:44,480
Three solution we propose to right after the deadline. So for homeless three we will not accept later submission.

476
00:57:46,670 --> 00:57:55,620
And in the exam there will be no question asking you to write article is not need to worry about writing an article in the exam.

477
00:57:55,980 --> 00:58:02,160
But but it's very likely that it will give you output from arms and asking guys to interpret the results.

478
00:58:08,510 --> 00:58:15,860
And for the well, we will have a review as a mechanism. That's Tuesday, that's a review session and the exam is next Thursday.

479
00:58:16,550 --> 00:58:24,260
So for that, for the review and exam, likely we will have lunch in the auditorium.

480
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:27,630
So we will have the exam because we have two sessions. Right.

481
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:32,720
So, so the lecture, our library is in this room, but for the review session and the exam.

482
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:37,760
So we need we think is probably better to ask you to, to have to hold on in the same,

483
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:44,680
in the same room so that you guys have got an exam for exactly the same information about the exam review.

484
00:58:45,410 --> 00:58:47,540
And also it's easier to apply for the exam.

485
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:55,669
So literally, I, we just checked and it does have the capacity to know to accommodate all of us for students from the two sessions.

486
00:58:55,670 --> 00:59:09,770
So, so like we will make a formal announcement later, but likely we will have the review session and exam both so the, the room for the other session.

487
00:59:11,870 --> 00:59:20,520
But we will make a formal announcement later on campus. And also this is a in person and a closed note, a closed book exam.

488
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:30,270
So you are allowed to bring one piece of paper like this, you know, standard like a standard copy this paper.

489
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:38,910
And then you can write folders on both sides and whatever you want to write on both sides of, we can bring on one piece of paper.

490
00:59:39,030 --> 00:59:43,920
And also you can have a basic calculator like not super fancy ones,

491
00:59:44,370 --> 00:59:51,210
but it's a basic calculator because you're going to need a calculator to calculate the ratio like Pista does to you,

492
00:59:51,210 --> 00:59:55,560
for example, and things like that. So just on some basic calculator.

493
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:07,440
Well, no laptop computer and well, in your in your answer,

494
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:13,660
you should provide all the steps that leads to that, at least to the final, you know, the final number.

495
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:21,810
So for example, user account relating a piece that has a personal statistic form by result of two colleges to colleges,

496
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:27,560
then you should show the two numbers as a. And eventually the final final number.

497
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:31,260
Then also rather than skipping the steps in the middle.

498
01:00:31,870 --> 01:00:37,380
So there will be a Democrat is assigned to for the major steps.

499
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:42,390
So make sure that you show all the necessary steps leading to your final, final miles.

500
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:51,090
And also during the exam, while there's no collaboration during the exam, a lot of guys aren't encouraged to collaborate,

501
01:00:51,450 --> 01:00:59,070
too little sign it together to prepare to have study groups to study together.

502
01:00:59,190 --> 01:01:03,720
But during the exam, you have to basically complete, exact, complete control.

503
01:01:04,050 --> 01:01:11,129
So there is no collaboration of any type of collaboration allowed during the exam and also during the exam.

504
01:01:11,130 --> 01:01:15,360
Please turn off your cell phone and remove your headphones.

505
01:01:22,830 --> 01:01:26,010
And to get a full credit, you must show all of your work.

506
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:33,870
I mean, it allows for the for the things that are provided in class or for the results that are derived that we have derived in class.

507
01:01:34,050 --> 01:01:37,910
You can use them as as as as as facts as a result.

508
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:42,719
But otherwise, you will have to show you how to derive something.

509
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:45,320
You have to show the sense of the problems.

510
01:01:47,250 --> 01:01:59,280
And if you miss the steps we're supporting as a school, we now receive four grants, and in total there will be four or five questions.

511
01:01:59,370 --> 01:02:01,530
So we haven't made an exam yet.

512
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:11,550
So at this moment, we do not know exactly how many questions we have on the one hand or five questions, and each question will have multiple parts.

513
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:16,350
So the questions there will be questions on true or false statements.

514
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:23,220
So we will provide some statements that you will do you will say you would have whether they're true or false.

515
01:02:23,790 --> 01:02:27,690
These are mostly conceptual questions.

516
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:35,370
And also there are data analysis and interpretation questions and another theory questions and so on.

517
01:02:35,790 --> 01:02:45,240
And I think after we posted a simple example from the past three years, you guys will have a better idea what questions to expect.

518
01:02:50,730 --> 01:02:57,450
And the questions they will be similar to the materials covered in our lectures, in homework and pass the.

519
01:02:58,510 --> 01:03:06,950
But of course, not exactly the same. And while for some classroom, this is just, you know some some note eight months.

520
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:18,430
So something you might want to keep in mind. So if you got a stock at one particular positive, maybe you want to skip that in the rest of the class.

521
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:23,470
Is that of, you know, just a sliding format of time on a particular part of the classroom?

522
01:03:26,550 --> 01:03:31,740
Okay. Those are some announcements. So any questions?

523
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:40,450
Okay. And a further review session.

524
01:03:40,470 --> 01:03:45,780
I mean, we Masumi and I, we as the Google prepare things to review.

525
01:03:46,110 --> 01:03:49,600
On the other hand, if you guys think that, you know,

526
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:58,450
there are certain topics that we should emphasize or we should spend a little bit more time, just feel free to let us know.

527
01:03:58,470 --> 01:04:01,850
You can you can send me a souvenir, send me an email.

528
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:08,100
Um, just the topics that you want to emphasize a little bit more in a session.

529
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:16,290
You will be happy to do that. But it was Sumi and I, we will prepare your post as well for the review session.

530
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:27,990
Okay. So that you guys can actually download this announcement and take a closer look out of this announcement later.

531
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:37,820
Okay. And then let's go back to our election materials.

532
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:44,680
So we actually calculated the mean of y.

533
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:47,990
So what about the appearance of my hat?

534
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:51,170
Now, last count, the appearance of y hat.

535
01:04:54,650 --> 01:05:06,080
The culmination of years of my head is also quite easy because y had is given by h types y h and had matrix times one.

536
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:21,740
And we know this and this is a fact from Model D, so here is an increase of constant M and a run vector Y.

537
01:05:22,730 --> 01:05:32,719
Now the various of eight times y is equal to a times that there is a y, times a transpose right.

538
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:44,510
In our case here H is just matrix a entries recall that h h is x times x transpose x inverse times x transpose.

539
01:05:45,410 --> 01:05:52,940
This is what age is. Our age is our constant matrix h because again we treat the matrix as fixed.

540
01:05:54,320 --> 01:06:00,470
And then by applying this result we have eight times the variance of Y times a transpose.

541
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:14,540
And in the periods of why we have assumed interest.

542
01:06:14,730 --> 01:06:21,650
Exactly. Displacement. Yeah, maybe.

543
01:06:21,950 --> 01:06:30,300
Yeah. Let's just look at it here. So for the well, we I'm assuming the atmosphere is equal to this, though of course,

544
01:06:30,340 --> 01:06:38,210
that there is a wise also equal to this because again, as times made and this is constant of this does not contribute to the virus.

545
01:06:39,050 --> 01:06:44,120
So that's our assumption. So the virus of Y is C must wear pumps either matrix.

546
01:06:48,870 --> 01:06:53,520
That's what we have here. So the variance on why is C squared times the order of the matrix.

547
01:06:56,950 --> 01:07:01,930
And of the Cinema Square. Then to see my square.

548
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:05,380
This is a constant. It's a scheme. It's a.

549
01:07:05,380 --> 01:07:11,350
It's a number of skaters. So, of course, we can move it to the front of everything because it's just not resistive.

550
01:07:12,580 --> 01:07:17,520
And then what is left is here we have seen a square stage.

551
01:07:18,430 --> 01:07:23,800
Now times are that of the matrix. But I know the matrix multiplied by anything is does not change.

552
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:33,640
So. So we have now we have a transpose of the edge times h transpose.

553
01:07:34,870 --> 01:07:40,320
This is equal to. H is equal to. And so we don't need to.

554
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:44,590
But we could we could have gone wrong. Let's do it.

555
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:52,179
This is actually sort of showing that a H matrix is an important right.

556
01:07:52,180 --> 01:07:56,740
So this is H matrix times, h matrix transpose.

557
01:07:57,370 --> 01:08:04,090
Now I'm showing this actually, I'm showing that H is an important way to transpose that's.

558
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:13,890
The principles of H. This is equal to X.

559
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:22,430
Here I just cover this whole thing down. But then the principles of this second big matrix, the transpose.

560
01:08:22,790 --> 01:08:32,240
Now, if. If we take the principles of product, we need to reverse the order so that we have here we have X transpose, then transpose.

561
01:08:32,260 --> 01:08:37,600
That's actually two seven times x transpose x equals.

562
01:08:37,730 --> 01:08:42,290
Because this matrix in the middle, this is symmetric. And then times x transpose.

563
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:58,490
Okay. And again, if we look at. If we combine the two the two acts in the middle.

564
01:08:58,700 --> 01:09:08,450
So this can cancel with one Imus. So what is left is x x transpose x numerous times x transpose.

565
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:11,990
And this is exactly incorrect information.

566
01:09:16,310 --> 01:09:25,520
So that's why here we have sigma squared times h so he says this this shows that it's measuring an important age transport,

567
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:31,700
age times, age transpose AC with age. That's the definition of an opponent of pensions and politics.

568
01:09:33,110 --> 01:09:38,330
So we found that the bearers of Y and that's actually equal to see my squared times h.

569
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:53,790
And then if in addition, if we assume apps will follow normal distribution.

570
01:09:55,800 --> 01:10:01,619
Now the previous one, we calculated the mean and a virus. Well, we can do that when we count the mean of what I had.

571
01:10:01,620 --> 01:10:07,020
And there is a y hat. We didn't actually assume the normality assumption.

572
01:10:07,170 --> 01:10:14,160
I sold us the calculation of this and this does not require the assumption that had some following normal discussion.

573
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:24,750
But it is now. If now we are assuming absolute follow this normal as usual, then it turns out that this y had also followed normal this option.

574
01:10:26,860 --> 01:10:32,620
Well, this is the reason is that if Amazon followed all of us, that is why we'll follow this.

575
01:10:33,250 --> 01:10:38,050
Because why is equal to Expedia a plus answer to why we follow the normal solution?

576
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:44,890
Now, why follow normal the solution than any linear combination on why you follow normal the solution.

577
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:55,120
That's the reason why. You know, if you assume Amazon vulnerable as usual, then what happened is followed normal as usual.

578
01:10:55,150 --> 01:10:58,270
Now we have already calculated the mean out of the virus,

579
01:10:58,450 --> 01:11:05,800
so why had a much followed the normal dispersion with the same mean and the same errors as calculated before?

580
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:26,020
So that's the properties of the properties.

581
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:29,280
Why have the 52 meet meeting?

582
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:37,360
Now let's look out of absolute. Yeah, absolutely.

583
01:11:40,590 --> 01:11:51,639
Okay. So for Armstrong, I think it's probably better if we do something instead of is that all the steps are given on the next slide.

584
01:11:51,640 --> 01:12:01,330
But I think it's probably better if we do some writing to slow down a little bit depending, again,

585
01:12:01,330 --> 01:12:11,640
depending on how familiar you are with making sounds things is this calculation is may be worthwhile if we slow down a little bit.

586
01:12:11,710 --> 01:12:15,970
So this is about Armstrong. How do we call that Armstrong flat?

587
01:12:16,030 --> 01:12:19,720
That's actually equal to system.

588
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:24,160
That's equal to Y minus H, times y.

589
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:39,720
The reason is that while Abdul-Ahad is also had is equal to one minus y hat and a white hat is equal to eight times what?

590
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:50,110
Then, of course. Why? Well, this is equal to II minus eight times Y.

591
01:12:56,640 --> 01:13:02,940
And again, let's be super clear what are the dimensions are for this different missions and so and so this

592
01:13:02,940 --> 01:13:10,080
is my one that this this is the vector from the individuals and this is and by one another.

593
01:13:10,650 --> 01:13:15,840
Why, of course, the response factor is in by one and y hat is also in.

594
01:13:18,510 --> 01:13:26,490
So this is if by one in my one on this page matrix, as we mentioned, this is embodied in matrix.

595
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:33,300
This is anybody. And this one is also in my one.

596
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:45,560
And so this identity matrix here, although we didn't make it explicit about this identity matrix, this is a FEMA in the matrix.

597
01:13:48,290 --> 01:13:51,950
And H is about N and Y is in my.

598
01:14:01,310 --> 01:14:04,370
Right. These are these are the dimensions of this different which.

599
01:14:04,830 --> 01:14:09,710
Okay. And then.

600
01:14:09,950 --> 01:14:14,300
Well, to counter this is valid. If you are not using that A here are minus H.

601
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:19,000
This is a causal matrix so we can move it out of the examination.

602
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:24,290
So we will have I minus h times these values on y.

603
01:14:34,390 --> 01:14:37,600
And this. And then we know that.

604
01:14:40,190 --> 01:14:46,700
He's not even one. That's X, Hans-Peter. That's what I expected his alliance to be.

605
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:56,210
And then. We look at this part of.

606
01:14:58,290 --> 01:15:02,610
This is minus eight times X ten times better.

607
01:15:07,470 --> 01:15:16,310
Okay. But adds times what if times X we have a calculated it's x itself, right?

608
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:24,870
Yes. If you are so a time x that's equal to age is equal to x times accidental x inverse touch and it transforms.

609
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:33,820
That's what H is. And then if you multiply this by X here, this will cancel with this.

610
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:41,190
So this is equal to x ever is equal to x.

611
01:15:41,340 --> 01:15:46,740
So of course, this whole thing now is equal to zero zero times being able to do.

612
01:15:54,920 --> 01:16:03,380
So now what we have shown is that an examination of the residual that's equal to 000.

613
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:10,130
So the ad returned. So the ad, right? Absolutely is the ad.

614
01:16:10,250 --> 01:16:18,110
So the estimated average household carries the estimate of the average estimated residual that while that's on average, that's you know, it's eight.

615
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:25,450
Done with the next slide. It's just on the same calendar.

616
01:16:27,340 --> 01:16:32,440
So that's the one that I thought about Verizon absolutely.

617
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:44,080
Tapping into the various the various is equal to look at how it is able to I by this age comes what.

618
01:16:51,100 --> 01:17:02,830
I know there's a time slot. And then if we call this matrix here, the Matrix A that if we apply this result at the bottom,

619
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:13,000
it becomes I minus h times the variance of y and I minus h presents.

620
01:17:26,060 --> 01:17:35,510
And this very is why we know that is Sigma Square site comes ideologies that's based on our assumptions it's the same a square comes of the matrix.

621
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:42,180
Now see, my square is a scooter, so we can put a cinema square in the front.

622
01:17:42,580 --> 01:17:43,900
So that's the square.

623
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:55,240
Then times are in minus H, the times are done in the matrix in the middle, while which has no effect that times are minus h transpose.

624
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:11,679
Okay. And then we know that age is item potent and I minus age is also an important thing.

625
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:14,200
You should bring homework to me.

626
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:24,460
So then because it is either potent so y minus h times the transpose of minus h i still by minus h you have see my square.

627
01:18:37,140 --> 01:18:40,530
Okay. So that's the virus of Abdul Haq.

628
01:18:46,300 --> 01:18:49,800
Well, that's just slightly accomplished because I was kind of the.

629
01:18:50,300 --> 01:19:07,040
And we did. And now again.

630
01:19:07,060 --> 01:19:13,020
So if we just calculate the IS foundation accounts, then there is no need to assume.

631
01:19:13,470 --> 01:19:16,440
No, no. Your assumption. We do, I assume absent from normal discussion.

632
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:28,200
But if now we also assume the future, then this absolute hat will also follow normal distribution.

633
01:19:29,190 --> 01:19:36,600
Because again, it's here, it's this linear combination of the Y and a Y, followed by the following distribution.

634
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:44,540
So it comes from how we follow normal distribution. We have calculated of the mean and of the various events.

635
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:51,150
That is usually the absolute hat. This is normal with this mean and the standards.

636
01:20:09,130 --> 01:20:13,539
So that's the, you know, the some properties of the residence.

637
01:20:13,540 --> 01:20:20,840
Actually, I don't have any questions about this calculation, the duration of this through his knowledge and their interests.

638
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:43,660
Okay. So if we look at what we have done so far, we have derived the properties of how.

639
01:20:48,110 --> 01:20:51,580
Let's try to summarize summarize a little bit of what we've done.

640
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:56,150
Starting from later. Next, next. Last lecture.

641
01:20:57,200 --> 01:21:01,040
So we derived. Okay, we'll go from here.

642
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:05,300
I mean, while we did quite a bit algebra, I use a matrix notation.

643
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:14,120
Use a matrix notation of. Yeah, let's try to summarize a little bit maybe starting from maybe start from zero.

644
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:27,949
Right. So here as we introduce the matrix notation, we write we write a lot of mobility in a region in this matrix four as well.

645
01:21:27,950 --> 01:21:38,480
We did that now after that, after writing it in a matrix four, then we try to find that is the square estimate.

646
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:51,800
Now the way we we do that is while we minimize the sun or sample squares, while we take the original areas of with the Salvator and we saw zero.

647
01:21:52,970 --> 01:21:57,980
And then we actually, you know, there are some algebra, there is some algebra involved.

648
01:21:58,550 --> 01:22:04,770
But in the end, we are able to find that particular diversity of the sun.

649
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:10,690
There are some squares that's not gives us the normal equation, etc.

650
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:17,410
Now solving the normal equation, we actually then this is what has made her better happy.

651
01:22:17,780 --> 01:22:21,380
That's what we like. One thing what one of the things we did.

652
01:22:21,590 --> 01:22:26,990
So that's by minimizing the horizontal squares we find a square as or beta hat

653
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:34,970
and after that we actually derive some properties up of the square has a major.

654
01:22:35,130 --> 01:22:43,849
Yeah. So basically what we did was we calculated the mean of the action and we found that 52 how do these variations equal

655
01:22:43,850 --> 01:22:53,630
to the actual and also we calculate the variance on B that we found that the variance of beta is equal to this guy.

656
01:22:55,650 --> 01:22:59,770
Right. So we drive about a half. And then we calculated the mean.

657
01:23:03,790 --> 01:23:06,910
And then what we did was.

658
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:10,260
Okay. So we talked about sort of normality.

659
01:23:10,270 --> 01:23:15,430
Well, some of that in property of the better half that we calculated.

660
01:23:18,070 --> 01:23:21,880
Now we study the property of the field. We made a hat.

661
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:29,460
So we calculate. We calculated its mean. We found that an expansion of beta hat is equal to.

662
01:23:30,610 --> 01:23:36,130
Is equal to. You expect you don't beat ahead. It's just that you control at speed and true meaning of life.

663
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:44,050
And a similar we calculated the variance of y hat. And then for the residual we do the same thing.

664
01:23:44,290 --> 01:23:47,290
So we calculated the expansion of the residual.

665
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:51,880
We found it's equal to zero and we calculated the variance of the residual.

666
01:23:52,780 --> 01:23:56,350
And we found it is in this particular matrix.

667
01:23:56,770 --> 01:24:00,730
But. So that's what we did.

668
01:24:00,940 --> 01:24:08,830
What we have done so far about particle regression has been we retrieve the model we use in visual notation,

669
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:17,770
we express the final intervention using matrix and then when we derive the beta hat, using is a square.

670
01:24:18,670 --> 01:24:20,440
By setting majority of people who zero,

671
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:28,720
we find a normal equation and we study the property of beta how to by getting this mean by covering these variance.

672
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:33,520
And then we argue that it's optimal in certain sense.

673
01:24:34,390 --> 01:24:44,530
So we have the called zero zero so arguably the of analogy and then we study that of course we also

674
01:24:44,530 --> 01:24:49,960
talk about geometric interpretation and then we study the property of why had an absolute hat.

675
01:24:50,410 --> 01:24:55,960
So the fitted residual basically we calculate the use that agency in a couple of variances.

676
01:24:57,010 --> 01:25:02,809
So that's what we have done so far. Now, of course,

677
01:25:02,810 --> 01:25:15,020
in the viruses you recall the virus of beta had this actually equal to sigma squared times x transpose x inverse and it involves this Sigma Square.

678
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:22,159
Now, Sigma Square is I know, of course. So in order to use this result, we have two estimates.

679
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:29,120
You must, with the width estimate, assume a square is almost exactly the same as the first symbol.

680
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:37,220
Linear regression has made this by dividing aerosol sample squares by is corresponding to our freedom.

681
01:25:39,290 --> 01:25:46,970
Those areas almost where distrust of the inner product of the residual sum of squares, of absolute ice have some parts.

682
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:57,320
But the do we're afraid of now changed a little bit the the graphene now becomes yeah minus P because we are talking about multiple linear regression.

683
01:25:57,710 --> 01:26:10,260
So there are P betas for simple linear regression for for simple linear regression that people are afraid of is equal to error those two, right?

684
01:26:10,310 --> 01:26:17,330
Because for sumo linear where we only have intercept mean a zero and a slope only have one covariate.

685
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:23,630
But for multiple linear regression for multiple linear regression,

686
01:26:25,070 --> 01:26:33,410
the d where freedom is equal and minus P because we have intercept beta zero plus p minus one covariance.

687
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:39,620
This is the difference between simple question.

688
01:26:40,850 --> 01:26:48,740
But after we had estimated this Sigma Square, then we can estimate this virus a little hacked.

689
01:26:49,700 --> 01:26:55,050
Let's keep in mind this matrix. Okay.

690
01:26:55,800 --> 01:27:08,459
And if you look at this matrix, this is Angela and by P by pediatrics probably matrix because he would say that had his pet PD National Beta,

691
01:27:08,460 --> 01:27:10,370
his PD major beta had its PBA 19.

692
01:27:10,860 --> 01:27:23,490
So the various variants covariance matrix, this is if you buy a matrix and then if you look at this matrix, you will see that.

693
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:29,380
On the diagonals. You have years of beat up.

694
01:27:29,470 --> 01:27:41,020
One loses 3 to 0 at the estimate and then you have beta and you have XI minus one.

695
01:27:43,830 --> 01:27:50,240
That's a match on the virus just indicated. This is an estimate, but I'll make it easier without this.

696
01:27:50,860 --> 01:27:58,370
Just. Just look at awareness. Just look at various of all the better hats.

697
01:27:59,150 --> 01:28:06,710
So on diagonal, we have the bearers of all the better hats and the of diagonal.

698
01:28:06,710 --> 01:28:10,010
For example, here this injury element.

699
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:19,510
This is. Peter I and Banerji and Banerji.

700
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:27,410
This is not you know, I just got out of this matrix.

701
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:31,400
So this various covariance matrix, this is p boxy matrix.

702
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:33,380
So this is P by P matrix.

703
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:44,960
So all of the acronyms we have all the variances of the eight eyes of of diagonals, we have the convergence between Did I and Benjie.

704
01:28:54,760 --> 01:29:02,650
Okay. And then just like simple linear regression for multiple linear regression, our interest.

705
01:29:04,670 --> 01:29:07,460
Can also be formulated as hypothesis testing.

706
01:29:07,490 --> 01:29:17,960
So for example, let's say that now you are fitting a model where the response Y is people's weight and the you have,

707
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:25,669
let's say three covariates in the model you have got age you have is y is equal

708
01:29:25,670 --> 01:29:36,830
to weight and then x1 I say is hx2 let's say is height x three is gender right?

709
01:29:38,570 --> 01:29:44,300
Let's say three covariance and a similar to simple linear regression.

710
01:29:45,650 --> 01:29:50,000
We are often also interested in hypothesis testing.

711
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,130
In this testing have others in the sport.

712
01:29:52,820 --> 01:30:03,260
So for example, we are interested in testing whether age has the effect of weight adjusting for height and gender.

713
01:30:03,890 --> 01:30:10,180
And this is my friend, so adjusting for the other covariates, whether it has a problem for the outcome.

714
01:30:10,580 --> 01:30:20,240
In other words, we are passing relevant beta corresponding to age, whether that's true or resilient and against.

715
01:30:20,450 --> 01:30:21,829
Well, alternatively,

716
01:30:21,830 --> 01:30:32,530
as a society alternative that is not to and we can pass this for any of the p bands we can test testing the first slope or for any other valence.

717
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:46,290
And on the test the statistic is still the same as before is beta had beta, you have whichever collaborative data you're testing.

718
01:30:48,110 --> 01:30:52,580
One of this is true value minus is true on minus than on.

719
01:30:52,900 --> 01:31:00,050
The losses in this case is zero. It's a -0 divided by the center.

720
01:31:00,050 --> 01:31:08,870
And that's the t statistic that under all term oh sorry under model is it's this follow T distribution.

721
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:13,039
Now that you were a freedom here, we need to pay attention to your freedom.

722
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:18,800
This is L.A.P.D. or freedom. So previously it's allowed us to write for a symbol in your world.

723
01:31:19,220 --> 01:31:36,190
Minus one. Now it's on PD or freedom. So this is this follow Tejas fusion and this is the reason why this capital T this testosterone to this fusion.

724
01:31:36,670 --> 01:31:42,310
The reason is that here again we are for now, we cannot get into the details.

725
01:31:44,260 --> 01:31:48,410
But the reason is that, first of all, the beta had to follow the normal decision here.

726
01:31:48,430 --> 01:31:53,499
This is what we derived from the ground, the property of beta.

727
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:57,489
How do we find is found over this fusion? And another reason is that,

728
01:31:57,490 --> 01:32:06,730
as some of us were areas almost square divided by single square to follow Chi Square distribution and then Beta had an AC must wear hat.

729
01:32:07,390 --> 01:32:14,740
These two are independent and based on all these facts we are able to show that this t the

730
01:32:14,740 --> 01:32:20,410
capital t this ratio in a follows such a tedious fusion with the minus PD or freedom.

731
01:32:21,910 --> 01:32:28,000
But but we will leave that to later because this will be shown later.

732
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:38,950
But anyways, the main point here is that this tells us that the key is still follow this fusion just with a degree of even more freedom.

733
01:32:39,310 --> 01:32:44,469
Yeah. Most people feel. Again.

734
01:32:44,470 --> 01:32:48,580
This is your fate. I mean, this is due to the now we are estimating key parameters in the model.

735
01:32:48,580 --> 01:32:52,930
So we have been a zero beta one. How Peter minus one.

736
01:32:58,120 --> 01:33:03,910
So then how about those testing that's best just passed the stress test.

737
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:07,810
While that's testing, whether the case is covariant.

738
01:33:07,950 --> 01:33:13,780
Right. This is the chemical that covariate has a effect on the response.

739
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:21,490
A why? After controlling the other covariates, after adjusting or controlling for the other scenarios.

740
01:33:21,640 --> 01:33:31,160
Because now we're doing much more. So this is testing whether the kind of covariance, for example, age looks equal to one in this age,

741
01:33:31,610 --> 01:33:36,800
whether age has a effect on weight after adjusting for height and gender.

742
01:33:40,190 --> 01:33:43,630
He. So yeah.

743
01:33:43,640 --> 01:33:48,410
So the past is mostly the same as before, but I think it depends on your freedom.

744
01:33:48,980 --> 01:33:56,760
And also the interpretation is slightly different from before now because people will passionately affect something else.

745
01:34:03,350 --> 01:34:13,640
Okay. Any questions about what you'd asked? Yes.

746
01:34:14,210 --> 01:34:16,820
When we look at the test statistic that we're using,

747
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:22,280
we mentioned that the change is based on the number of covariates that you're including in your model.

748
01:34:22,700 --> 01:34:28,430
Does that mean that we're incentivized not to add meaningless covariance to the model?

749
01:34:29,420 --> 01:34:39,050
Well, yeah, this this is a great question. So absolutely we do not want to add like randomly at covariance into the model.

750
01:34:40,550 --> 01:34:46,830
You know, especially nowadays, if you look how a deal is and well, we could easily have hundreds of covariates in a data set.

751
01:34:46,940 --> 01:34:51,210
Right. Hundreds of variables have it, so be it.

752
01:34:51,240 --> 01:34:57,460
It's not a good idea to throw them all into the same model because a do have them.

753
01:34:57,590 --> 01:35:03,290
We may lose substantially more power in terms of estimating all these parameters accurately.

754
01:35:04,040 --> 01:35:12,190
So we do not want to throw too many variables into the model and later talk about actually on the next slide or maybe was later room,

755
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:18,650
talk about something related to that later will tell about the model selection

756
01:35:19,190 --> 01:35:24,740
that is choosing how to select the some variables to to be included in the model,

757
01:35:24,950 --> 01:35:26,330
not including everything.

758
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:36,370
So remember in module eight we mentioned the so called four were that were stabilized an action right so that's that's actually related to this

759
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:48,290
that's a way of preventing including too many variables in the model because because no matter what our model is approximation to the novel truth.

760
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:55,039
Right we do not believe that weight just depends on age, height, gender in in a perfect linear way.

761
01:35:55,040 --> 01:36:03,360
Right? So no matter what our model is just approximation and some variables they have,

762
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:08,000
they are more relevant to the response of some cold areas that no less relevant.

763
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:16,190
And if the model includes too many variables like variables that are not also relevant to the response,

764
01:36:17,060 --> 01:36:23,780
then we are at the risk of not being able to estimate of the data well enough,

765
01:36:23,780 --> 01:36:32,450
because our data you are has a limited sample size and you do not have too much information to estimate every single beta good enough.

766
01:36:32,990 --> 01:36:39,170
So that's one consideration that we may not want to go too many queries into that same model.

767
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:52,330
Any other questions? Okay.

768
01:36:54,070 --> 01:36:58,960
And then we have the symbol for symbol linear regression.

769
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:02,740
We have the so-called coefficient of determination, the R squared.

770
01:37:03,160 --> 01:37:06,300
We are able to decompose the total variation,

771
01:37:06,310 --> 01:37:19,270
the total sum of squares like this in total as the sum of squares explained by the regression model and the sum of squares not explained.

772
01:37:23,470 --> 01:37:35,380
An aerosol sprayers and a similar we can divide the rs2 that's the sum of squares win by the regression model divided by the total sum of squares.

773
01:37:37,330 --> 01:37:44,620
So the other words are square is again the proportion of the variation,

774
01:37:44,660 --> 01:37:51,830
one that can be explained by your regression model, by the people that rates it.

775
01:37:51,910 --> 01:37:56,470
This is what r squared means, and then one minus R squared.

776
01:37:56,890 --> 01:38:04,360
This is the total variation in the response y that cannot be explained by your regression model.

777
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:11,610
So this is almost exactly the same as before.

778
01:38:11,730 --> 01:38:16,440
So we are able to decompose the sample square and then we've had a similar defined square.

779
01:38:16,830 --> 01:38:22,950
And Prosper has the same interpretations before. And again, our square is between zero one.

780
01:38:24,390 --> 01:38:34,590
So our square are equal to zero. If we have a perfect linear association between Y and X and there is no error, there's no error.

781
01:38:34,590 --> 01:38:40,470
No. Rudman. So in that case, our square is exactly equal to one.

782
01:38:41,790 --> 01:38:51,390
So in other words, what we have showed such a result, even if every point Z like here a just consider one case.

783
01:38:52,050 --> 01:38:59,340
So if every datapoints you observe fall exactly on this line, perfect on this, like there's no variation from this line.

784
01:39:00,330 --> 01:39:11,580
There is no deviation from this line. Then the our square is equal to one on the other extreme, on the other end.

785
01:39:12,030 --> 01:39:23,189
The other extreme is that if none of these covariate x explain or whatever it is we lose, we are what we are was only the other betas.

786
01:39:23,190 --> 01:39:27,900
They are equal to zero. So x we are looking at if they have nothing to do with it or what.

787
01:39:28,890 --> 01:39:32,190
In that case, now that our square is equal to zero.

788
01:39:32,250 --> 01:39:36,270
Because, because. Well, because there is no variation.

789
01:39:36,270 --> 01:39:41,670
What that can be explained by rats, because we are in the environment that's not even ranked.

790
01:39:41,910 --> 01:39:51,180
That's another extreme in that a case R-squared is equal to zero. But in reality, most of the models fall between those two.

791
01:39:51,900 --> 01:39:54,030
As all the competitors you are looking at.

792
01:39:54,270 --> 01:40:03,660
We can't explain some variation in Y, but a data, all of it in one large square is typically between zero and one.

793
01:40:09,490 --> 01:40:14,600
So that's our work the same as before. But for our square there is.

794
01:40:18,710 --> 01:40:27,020
So for our square there's some drawback because our square does not take the number of calories, including the model, into account.

795
01:40:27,720 --> 01:40:31,340
And this makes our square not ideal in application.

796
01:40:31,820 --> 01:40:44,520
So now we are we are at a time. So we will start that here in our next factor will probably go back to 20 some.
