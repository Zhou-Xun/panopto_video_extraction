1
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:57,060
Yeah. But.

2
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:15,370
All right. Good morning. So today we will finish the discussions on causal inference problems and.

3
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:22,750
We will do that with. Two biases that.

4
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:32,410
Fall under a general umbrella of biases called collide their stratification biases.

5
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:38,060
So this is what we have done. Formation, bias, confounding.

6
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:41,930
And this is where we are today.

7
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,910
Right. So this is an outline of the discussion.

8
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,040
First, we'll talk about validity with respect to.

9
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,880
It's two hives in general.

10
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:05,720
And then we'll the first into selection bias and then into over adjustment bias.

11
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:17,120
Okay. So the first part of the discussion pertains to the difference between internal and external validity.

12
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:24,260
Might have mentioned this perhaps in passing, but is is helpful to do it formally.

13
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:29,330
So let's see. Internally, the internal unity of a study.

14
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:36,479
Is its ability to produce an unbiased estimate in the study population.

15
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,750
Meaning. There is no measurement error.

16
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,940
There is no confounding. There is no selection bias, etc.

17
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:51,879
I guess we probably went through these when we talked about randomized trials and the

18
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:57,220
fact that typically randomized trials are conducted in super selected populations.

19
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:04,090
But if the randomized trial is properly conducted, the estimates from the trial are not biased.

20
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:09,560
There is still internally valid. Right now.

21
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,320
What is the problem in that situation?

22
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:21,130
Well, the problem is that that estimate may not represent the effect of the intervention in a different population that is not super selective.

23
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:25,749
So that brings us to this concept of external validity, I guess,

24
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:36,730
as opposed to internal or external validity refers only to the transport ability or generalizability of our estimate,

25
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:43,840
the ability to apply estimates from one study to other populations.

26
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:52,040
So again, in many randomized trials. They may have high internal validity,

27
00:03:52,520 --> 00:04:03,770
but they may or may not have high external validity because their estimates in the trial may have been produced in a population that is very special,

28
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:08,000
very selective, and they may not apply to the populations.

29
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:15,690
The same. Can be the case in observational studies.

30
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:21,910
You may have a very well-conducted observational study that.

31
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,230
You have taken care of confounding as much as you can have used great.

32
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:40,290
Um, uh, instruments of measurement have no selection bias, but perhaps your estimates are still not transportable.

33
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:44,060
You may have low external value. Right. Okay.

34
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:52,830
That concept of external validity can be still better illustrated with this issue of the

35
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:59,730
hierarchy of populations when we approach a population to study to make causal inference.

36
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,400
There are actually a number of limits.

37
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:16,080
The first one is the most general possible level, the level to which we would like to apply our results to in the broadest possible.

38
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:25,800
Uh, way. And that population is called the target or the external population.

39
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:31,260
So is the population again, to which we hope our results may be generalized.

40
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:47,310
In the late 1970s, some investigators at the Channing Lab at Harvard wanted to study the effect of oral contraceptives on the risk of breast cancer.

41
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:54,630
So for that, they thought that their target population should be all women.

42
00:05:56,170 --> 00:06:00,790
Perhaps somebody can say, well, perhaps all women in the US, but.

43
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:11,350
That was the idea. The next population to consider is the source population or the source base.

44
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:18,280
And this would be the population from which practically one could intend to sample.

45
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:25,800
So going back to the. Study of oral contraceptives in breast and breast cancer.

46
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,300
These investigators realized that a helpful.

47
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:38,940
Population to practical example from could be that of nurses registered nurses.

48
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:47,500
Why? Well, because at a time when we registered nurses would have.

49
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:52,690
But first of all, they are part of the target population because they are women.

50
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:59,960
Right. Again. There could be also, of course, meant that at the time, you know, they would restrict that to.

51
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:11,079
Female registered nurse. Because they are registered, they have addresses, and at the time there was an Internet or social media.

52
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:16,930
So they would have to approach these women pretty much by by mail or by phone.

53
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:22,030
So they needed that type of information and for sure that would exist in this group.

54
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:35,770
Um. So again, logistically and practically, this would be a helpful definition of a population that could be approachable for a start.

55
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:43,320
The next level is that of the eligible population. The eligible population is the intended sample.

56
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:55,820
How does it differ from the source? Population differs from the population in that you do have to apply what's called eligibility criteria.

57
00:07:56,170 --> 00:08:02,770
Right. You cannot. I do not know how many registered nurses could have there been at the time.

58
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:12,190
May be, you know, 500,000. And you cannot possibly register them all, recruit them all in your study.

59
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:19,550
You have to apply eligibility criteria to make this sample compatible with the aims of Eurostat.

60
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:30,640
So, for example, the population needs to be at risk of the outcome and needs to have a reasonable chance of having a distribution of exposure.

61
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:42,840
So, you know, in this case actually is a good example if if you are going to conduct a study on oral contraceptives and breast cancer.

62
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:48,440
Should you? Very good numbers.

63
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:54,100
You know, the religious women who renounce having sex.

64
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,649
No, that that would be a poor choice, right.

65
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:07,800
Because the distribution of exposure will not allow you to really see a possible association with oral contraceptive use.

66
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:12,149
I guess most of them likely will probably not be oral contraceptive use.

67
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:22,690
So you will not have enough variability in exposure, right? So that type of decision is the one that differentiates these two population lives.

68
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:31,940
So in the in that study of oral contraceptives, they, for example, chose married registered registered nurses.

69
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:43,000
Why, Mary? You have to think with the mind of the 1970s.

70
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:51,670
Yes. And. Right.

71
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:57,260
So I guess this probably has to do with the distribution of exposure again.

72
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:05,530
Right. Oral contraceptive use, I guess among married people, there may be more of a distribution meaning.

73
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:11,130
Some people who may be on oral contraceptives, some others who may want to conceive.

74
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:14,640
Right. Yes, Maria. Because mentioned.

75
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:29,790
No. Is is is about assumptions about distribution of oral contraceptive use.

76
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:35,250
Because. I guess there's anything among married people.

77
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:42,270
There are some who are trying to conceive. Right. So people who are trying to conceive probably are not taking oral contraceptives.

78
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:50,760
But there are others also among married people who are not trying to conceive and they may be trying to avoid conception.

79
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:57,360
So they may be on oral contraceptives. So you may have, you know, a fair distribution of proportion of both.

80
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:02,560
What would happen among non-married? Nurses or women.

81
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:07,780
Are they likely to be trying to conceive? No.

82
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:13,000
So what? What type of exposure will be underrepresented in the.

83
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:22,150
And married. We? The ones that are not taking oral contraceptives.

84
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:26,620
Right. Okay. H.

85
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:36,140
Yeah. She also has to do in this case. With risk of outcome.

86
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:42,470
Why wouldn't they enroll nurses who were.

87
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:49,510
20. Get locals.

88
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:53,490
They have lower risk of breast cancer. I mean, they still have risk, but.

89
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:04,000
They would have to wait for a long time. They would have to follow, you know, younger people, the younger the people in their cohort,

90
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:08,470
the longer they would have to follow them for the outcome. Right.

91
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:19,040
No. They had to be living in 11 states. And that's probably that was a logistic decision,

92
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:24,630
I guess you know there helps the made work better in those states or they were close I guess

93
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:32,580
they needed to reach them personally or maybe the registers were more complete in those states.

94
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:41,140
Registers for nurses. And obviously that they had provided contact information to the register of nurses.

95
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,530
Okay. Now the next level is the actual study population.

96
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:54,650
So what they do is they send. Questionnaires to everybody in the eligible population asking them to participate.

97
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,740
Right. To become part of this court. But guess what?

98
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:08,640
Obviously, not everybody responded to the questionnaire or responded positively to the questionnaire.

99
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:11,860
So at the end, only a proportion of women were involved.

100
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:17,220
And that's, again, the study population. Um.

101
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,980
But there is another limit. Which is that.

102
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:26,570
Not all these people made it to this stage of.

103
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:33,300
Data analysis. So that's the last level.

104
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:37,870
Um. I'm sorry. So dark is not. Oh, no.

105
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,530
You can still see. Oh, yeah. Okay.

106
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:51,660
So the subset of people who made it to this last stage are those who fulfilled conditions related to the specific study question.

107
00:13:52,590 --> 00:14:00,120
So what if some women did not answer the question on oral contraceptive use?

108
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:09,960
They are enrolled in the study population, but they won't make it to the analysis because the exposure data point is simply missing.

109
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:19,970
Right. They may have also missing information on important covariance.

110
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:25,830
So again, they will not make it to the very final moments.

111
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:33,459
So in this particular example, again. Um, they couldn't have missing values to make it here.

112
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,380
And they also needed complete follow up.

113
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:49,710
If some women dropped out of the study after two years without having any chance of getting the outcome and without any reasonable observation period,

114
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:57,090
then they wouldn't make it here. So what's external validity?

115
00:14:57,210 --> 00:15:07,170
Well, external validity is the ability of this study to produce an estimate here that can be transported all the way here to the external population.

116
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:18,570
Whether the relative risk ratio or incidence rate ratio that's produced here can be applied to this population.

117
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:22,560
If that's the case, then the studies externally valid.

118
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:32,700
It is a precondition for a study to be externally valid to be first internally.

119
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:39,610
So if your study has poor internal validity, it cannot possibly have good external validity.

120
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:45,210
I mean, it's. You really? All right.

121
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:52,920
So with this introduction, then we can discuss now selection by selection based selection biases,

122
00:15:52,920 --> 00:16:01,140
an association created as a result of the process by which people are selected into the analysis of an epidemiologic study.

123
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:11,670
Was the consequence of selection bias. The association between exposure and outcome in the analytic sample differs.

124
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:18,040
Four subjects who were included in the analysis. And for those who were not.

125
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:31,810
How does that happen? Selection bias can actually happen at any stage of the research process.

126
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:40,490
It can happen at the level of design if the investigators choose the wrong criteria to select participants.

127
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:46,990
The example of the. Months in a cohort study of oral contraceptives.

128
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:53,400
Participants factors that influence participation.

129
00:16:54,320 --> 00:17:02,220
You know, if people who are more or less likely to get the outcome for some reason are more or less likely to participate.

130
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:11,680
Factors that affect remaining in the study, meaning retention.

131
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:19,209
So again, you may be able to recruit everybody that you want to follow, but after a month or so,

132
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:23,080
unfortunately, you'll have people who would say, you know, I had second thoughts.

133
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:29,110
I'd rather not. But once they were enrolled in the study, if they leave, that's going to be a problem.

134
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:34,629
Potential source for selection, bias or decisions at this stage of data analysis.

135
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:39,160
And this is better illustrated later on with the structural definition of selection bias.

136
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:46,990
So it can occur in all possible study designs.

137
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:52,850
And we will go through some examples of a few of them by a study signed on.

138
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:58,540
What are the mechanisms? So again, this is sort of.

139
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:04,350
Important. Can selection bias happen in randomized trials?

140
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,890
Yes. Is is is here.

141
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:20,010
And we look at the mechanism, the way in which it happens in randomized trials is different from the way in which it happens in observational studies.

142
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:29,570
All right. Let's say cross-sectional surveys, you know, NHANES or any big the issues survey.

143
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,110
How can selection bias happen there? What are the mechanisms?

144
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:40,700
The most frequent are. Due to sampling are our nonparticipation.

145
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:44,810
So due to sampling you are intended.

146
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:51,110
We those representatives are with service. The idea is that sampling needs to be random and needs to be representative.

147
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:56,180
It can be very complicated. There are there are you know, there are specialists.

148
00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:03,110
There are people who devote themselves to study how to best sample people.

149
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:08,910
From a know big target population to reach a representative sample.

150
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:13,800
So many things can go wrong during that process. A very complicated process.

151
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:17,799
Because if the sample has to be representative,

152
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:27,610
then every person more or less needs to at the end have a weight that's proportional to the number of people they are actually representing.

153
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:36,010
Each person represents more people. If.

154
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:43,860
This certainly has to do with an outcome and the doubt in the outcome is subject to survival factors.

155
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:53,909
May recall these when we talked about prevalent cases in the case of case control studies, but it can also apply to cross-sectional survey.

156
00:19:53,910 --> 00:20:03,870
So people who have a disease that's fatal, quickly fatal may not make it to when the investigators are sampling.

157
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:14,919
Or volunteers, selection of volunteers. So, you know, these experts in sampling might say, okay, we need to select these people.

158
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:19,300
Here are the phone numbers or the email addresses or the Twitter hashtags, whatever.

159
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,530
Go call them. But guess out of all of them.

160
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:31,360
Who's going to say yes? Usually I tell people who maybe are health conscious.

161
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:37,570
Right. Because out of altruism, they may want to participate in research studies.

162
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:43,150
That people who are health conscious, are they really representative of a large target population?

163
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:56,870
I don't know. Right. Um, and then due to nonparticipation means, you know, you may receive emails, letters, calls, tweets.

164
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:03,720
I just keep. Respectful, quiet at best, or to just delete them.

165
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:13,440
Right. Now in cohort studies, there are two main mechanisms.

166
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:22,370
One is non-response. Meaning you invite people to participate in your study and they decide not to.

167
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:28,249
So again, the people who finally make it are those who have certain characteristics that may be

168
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:33,710
related to exposure and outcome and may not be the same as the general population.

169
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:41,280
We will see an example of what one that's called healthy volunteer bites later.

170
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:53,780
The other mechanism is attrition, which is differential loss to follow up in exposed and unexposed, which is also related to the outcome meaning.

171
00:21:55,860 --> 00:22:04,170
Okay. General people in your cohort study, but then some decide to stop participation, to quit.

172
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:10,990
And turns out those who quit. May be more likely to be in one exposure group.

173
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:16,190
And at the same time may be more or less likely to develop the.

174
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:25,580
So let's say in studies of in of the effect of medication and.

175
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,760
HIV infection.

176
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:41,370
So people who are more severely at a more at a more advanced stage of HIV disease may be more less likely to remain in the cohort because,

177
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:46,830
you know, it may be difficult for them to attend the clinic visits, etc.

178
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:58,730
And then because they are also sicker, they might be getting, let's say, medication that's more aggressive and might have more side effects.

179
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:04,450
And obviously, taking the medication or not might make them more or less likely to develop the outcome.

180
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,620
Let's say that. Right.

181
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:16,670
So that might also be a force to lead them to drop out because they have adverse effects and they don't feel like going to the clinic.

182
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:23,110
And then your sample will end up biased. Attrition.

183
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,210
Um, this is an example, you know, a real life example.

184
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:39,290
It could go very quickly. It's a very famous study of the role of birth weight on risk of death from heart attack.

185
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:53,950
And it was conducted in England, the source population where boys who were born alive in six districts in a region of England, you know within a.

186
00:23:55,180 --> 00:24:03,710
Period. Um, but a large number it is like 8% of them died during childhood.

187
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:09,120
Was dangerous being a kid at the time. In England then.

188
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:13,269
So obviously if. If they died during childhood, they wouldn't make it to adulthood.

189
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:19,110
To. You have a chance of having a heart attack.

190
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:31,230
What do you think? Do you think the birth weight of kids who die in childhood is the same of the kids who did not die or the.

191
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,240
Birthweight of the source population. Probably not.

192
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:45,690
Probably not the main cause of of infant and child mortality, historically and still everywhere in the world is.

193
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:57,170
Okay. Well, not quite, but something that causes low birth, which is preterm birth.

194
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:01,550
Preterm birth is the worst thing that can happen to a baby.

195
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:08,920
That and preterm birth is is a very common cause of low birth weight.

196
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:13,550
So, you know, that's one selection factors.

197
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:18,660
Had these kids not died, you know,

198
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:25,820
if they were low birth weight and birth weight has an effect on what if they were preterm and preterm has an effect on cardiovascular disease,

199
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:30,200
would they have the same risk of cardiovascular disease as kids who did not die?

200
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:40,540
No. So you have. They excluded non singleton births, meaning twins and triplets.

201
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:44,780
How is the birth weight of twins and triplets compared to the other is less right.

202
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:53,710
And was the risk of cardiovascular disease of twins and triplets compared to that of singletons.

203
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:09,520
Any cardiovascular allergies. Well, I guess they got lucky here because it's the same.

204
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:16,030
But it wasn't known at the time. It was. It became known maybe some eight years ago.

205
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:36,090
Um, boys. Then they excluded kids who did not have weights at all their ages and who did not have ID to crosslink with the mortality data.

206
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:44,880
Um, so who do you think are the people or the kids who don't have enough information to be cross-linked with mortality data?

207
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:51,230
They're probably lowercase or be living very isolated areas.

208
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:59,420
Right. And you bet they are going to have a different. Birth weight and a different level of risk for cardiovascular disease.

209
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:08,810
Right. So at the end of this service, population 17, 464, they only.

210
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:13,690
Analyzed. 5600.

211
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:17,360
So is almost is just about a third. Less than a third.

212
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:24,510
So the study also became famous as a famous example of selection bias.

213
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:34,180
Even though it gave Origin to a whole new chapter of research but is still very contested.

214
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:39,760
Right. Case control studies?

215
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,810
Well, I think we went through these. Right. So the main problem.

216
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:49,010
In case control studies is inadequate selection of controls.

217
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:52,500
Right. So violating the.

218
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:59,100
Requirements for adequate selection of controls will result in selection bias and they are welcome.

219
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:03,930
The selection of controls is not independent of exposure status or is not.

220
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:08,730
The controls are not from the underlying population that gave rise to the cases.

221
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:13,420
That's the key mechanism for selection, bias and case control states.

222
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:20,410
Now, when you take only a sample of controls and a sample of cases from your study base.

223
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:27,260
You may also run into selection bias and the mechanisms are more or less the same.

224
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:37,220
Like. If you select cases not independent of exposure status.

225
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:42,320
Or if cases represent differential retention from the underlying code.

226
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:47,820
So if you select cases, let's say at the end of follow up using cumulative sampling.

227
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:54,030
But there were cases that maybe had died before because of.

228
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:00,060
They were prevalent cases or they were lost to follow up before they actually had a chance to become cases.

229
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:06,570
Right. So you can have selection bias, both due to selection of controls and cases.

230
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:11,780
Controls the most frequent because you always have to take a sample case is less

231
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:15,560
frequent because many times you select all controls of all cases available.

232
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:22,960
But when you have to take samples of cases, it might also have. No randomized trials.

233
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:31,300
So again, selection bias can happen in randomized trials, but it can only happen after randomization.

234
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:37,770
Why? Because before randomization nobody is exposed.

235
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:51,170
And that's also the reason why. Having a super selected population in a randomized trial doesn't immediately imply.

236
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:57,860
Selection bias. You may have a super selected population.

237
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:06,710
But before randomization, there is really no possibility of having selection bias because nobody is exposed.

238
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:16,620
So the probability of participation is not related to being exposed or not.

239
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:22,850
Nobody knows. On which arm they are going to be placed.

240
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:30,950
So selection bias in a randomized trial can only happen due to differential loss to follow up.

241
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:38,680
Or differential complaints. I think you know what, just to follow up means, right?

242
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:46,420
They don't make it to the administrative end of this that you know what lack of compliance is, right.

243
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:56,540
They don't take what they were assigned to. So what you might still need to connect here is this word differential.

244
00:30:57,290 --> 00:31:02,540
What do you think differential means? At.

245
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:11,520
Get. Was differential here.

246
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:25,680
Yes, Hannah. Right?

247
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:30,030
Yeah, it varies between exposure groups,

248
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:38,640
meaning perhaps in people randomized to receive active treatment compliances

249
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:44,790
less than in people randomized to receive less if that means differential.

250
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:57,700
Half of it. The other half really means it also needs to be differential with respect to the risk that those people have of.

251
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:05,440
The outcome. So people who get lost to follow up or people who decide.

252
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:10,680
Not to comply with what they were saying to have.

253
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:20,470
A different risk of the outcome than people who remain in the study were people who continued complying with the intervention.

254
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:24,720
So it has two parts that the differential is.

255
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:39,999
Right. So for there to be selection bias, again, these problems lost to follow up or lack of compliance have to be both related to treatment,

256
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:46,300
meaning they need to be different between treatment arms and have to be related to the outcome.

257
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:54,130
Meaning the people who have those problems have a different probability of outcome than the people who do not have those problems.

258
00:32:54,820 --> 00:33:02,410
Right. Any questions on that? Then selection bias happened in a randomized trial.

259
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:08,330
Yeah. You know, and I am being obnoxious about something.

260
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:15,600
There are reasons for that. All right.

261
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:25,150
Okay. So now. Let's move to the structural definition of selection bias.

262
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:30,230
What does structural mean? You remember. Mention that at some point.

263
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:33,470
Structure. Structure the next.

264
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:39,469
Yes. That's what the structure is. So great to get there.

265
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:44,330
First, I need to remind you of a little bit of notation of that notation.

266
00:33:45,410 --> 00:34:00,360
So recall. Conditioning on a collider or on a descendent of a collider opens a path that was nicely closed by the collider and non causal.

267
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:09,740
So if you have this structure here. Thus they have a causal effect on why?

268
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:15,610
No, because there is no direct path from a into way.

269
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:28,130
R a and y statistically associated. No, they are not.

270
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:33,740
Why? Because the only path they are connected through is closed by C, which is a collider.

271
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:43,910
It has two arrows colliding into. A And why are both causes of C?

272
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:57,510
Would you agree with that? Okay. So if we do this, if we condition on see let's see if you go and collect data and in your analysis you stratify.

273
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:07,560
The Association of A and way on C before stratifying your cumulative incidence ratio was what?

274
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:15,990
What is the cumulative incidence ratio between A and C on this that you can tell?

275
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:21,760
But as the value. One. Yes, Lindsay.

276
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:27,050
Excellent. Yes. Just go for it. Yeah, proactively. Why is it one?

277
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:33,130
Because there is no association. We said that like three times. Right. Okay.

278
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:38,450
But if you stratify, guess what?

279
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:42,810
In the stratum C equals one.

280
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:50,549
The Association is not may not be one in the stratum of C equals zero.

281
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:53,550
The Association may not be so in at least one of this.

282
00:35:53,790 --> 00:36:05,310
The Association will not be one. If this that is true we situation represents the truth.

283
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:12,190
The which you might win since Rachel represents it through one day I'm stratified or the stratified.

284
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:26,260
The administratively. So these are the type of decisions that people sometimes could make at the level of the analysis that might give them bias.

285
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:31,980
Right. So conditioning on C opens these baths.

286
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:39,879
And if this were the dog and let's say you didn't have they don't see but you had they done

287
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:46,990
is which is a broke see this and then of see and you happen to you know condition on as.

288
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:53,770
Guess what? You do the same. You introduce my yes,

289
00:36:53,770 --> 00:37:01,840
you open up this part because conditioning on a descendant of the collider would do the same as conditioning on the collider itself.

290
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:11,060
Okay. Now here is the structural definition of selection bias.

291
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:17,420
And it is really handy because there are only maybe a couple of relatively rare exceptions where

292
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:23,870
this structural definition does not apply in that that's not only in the more advanced courses,

293
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:29,629
but but for for now, really, if you were to learn this, it would be very helpful.

294
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:33,290
Really. You ready? Okay.

295
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:44,090
Let's go through the election bias and all biases that arise from conditioning on a common effect of two variables,

296
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:49,760
one of which is either the exposure or a cause of the exposure.

297
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:53,750
And the other is either the outcome or the cause of the.

298
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:59,710
Bit of a mouthful, but. After you read it.

299
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:03,380
Maybe some. 14 times.

300
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:13,370
Okay. Let's really again, maybe just let's all biases that arise from conditioning.

301
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:16,670
So it involves conditioning. Right on what?

302
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:26,320
On one variable. And that variable has to be a common effect of two other vials, meaning that variable must have two arrows into it.

303
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:36,190
Now, what are those two arrows coming from? One has to come from either the exposure itself or from because of the exposure.

304
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:41,700
The other arrow has to come from the outcome itself or from because of the.

305
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:48,750
Okay. Was that a little bit more digestible?

306
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:52,040
All right. So.

307
00:38:53,850 --> 00:39:03,000
Let's let's go through examples and this should become clearer and we can go back at least in the beginning, to the structure definition to check.

308
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:08,219
So this is a case control study of postmenopausal estrogens.

309
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:13,470
Does the exposure of a and EMI myocardial infarction heart attack.

310
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:22,080
That's the outcome way. Controls were selected among patients with a hip fracture, which is represented with the letter F.

311
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:30,570
And we know from causal knowledge that postmenopausal estrogens protect against hip fracture,

312
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:39,810
meaning hip fracture is less likely to happen in people who take, I guess, mostly women.

313
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:43,380
Postmenopausal estrogens is a causal effect.

314
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:51,800
Protective of. All right. So how would we represent this or that?

315
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,140
Let's say here we have the exposure and the outcome.

316
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:03,070
Right. And there is going to be a selection.

317
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:07,180
Very. Which let's let's see here.

318
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:12,160
I guess originally this is because it's always going to be a collider so it's represented we'd see.

319
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:17,860
And in case control studies, there is always a civil.

320
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:22,870
That represents selection into the case control system.

321
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:30,460
Sea is always a binary variable. Dichotomous has only two possible levels.

322
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:39,700
One or zero C will take the value of one in people who are included in the Case Control study.

323
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:45,700
It will take the value of zero in people who are not included in the case control system.

324
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:57,950
So after the fact, when we already have our case control study C will always be conditioned on.

325
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:03,360
Via a mechanism. I explain in 10 seconds.

326
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:11,430
I mean, I didn't mean to make a bad joke then, which is called restriction.

327
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:21,900
You recall that restriction is when we restrict our study to people with only one value of a value.

328
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:30,100
So obviously because. To do this study, we have to include everybody.

329
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:34,810
Everybody who is including this study will have a value of one on this key variable.

330
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:43,470
Therefore, everybody is going to be. We are restricting to C equals one and C is going to be conditioned to always.

331
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:56,080
There is always going to be an error between having the outcome and being selected into the state.

332
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:05,320
Right. Because if you have. The outcome that defines being a case, you are going to be recruited into the state.

333
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:09,680
So having the outcome causes. Recruitment into the study.

334
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:19,670
Selection into the study. Now the controls in this case were chosen among people with a hip fracture rate, which is here,

335
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:26,480
meaning how your hip fracture also causes being called into participating in the study.

336
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,820
In fact, all controls have a hip fracture, right?

337
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:43,169
So I'm using sine decks here. And then postmenopausal estrogens protect against hip fracture.

338
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:47,970
So there is an error from a into if you know it's a protective effect you.

339
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:54,880
The question is, is there selection bias on this that?

340
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:07,780
Let's check the structural definition. Is a bias that arises from conditioning on a common effect.

341
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:12,550
So we are conditioning on. See? Right. You see a common effect.

342
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:19,170
Okay. Yeah. Of two variables. Right. In this case, what are those variables?

343
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:25,920
Y and F. Okay. So one of the two variables must be.

344
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:33,040
The exposure. Or a cause of the exposure.

345
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:43,000
F represents the exposure because it has a causal effect on if.

346
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:48,500
And the other must be the outcome or of course, of the outcome.

347
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:56,510
Why? So Z is a common effect of the outcome and the exposure.

348
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:06,600
So there is selection bias. Yes. Okay. Now I brought here.

349
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:19,260
A potential. Effect of the bias on the direction of the odds ratio.

350
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:28,410
But I'm not going to dwell on this and I'm not going to quiz you on this because this is extremely difficult to predict.

351
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:35,280
Um. So it depends on many things.

352
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:42,390
But in this case, it is possible that unexposed controls be.

353
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:51,720
Over percent. Because controls are less likely to be exposed since.

354
00:44:54,610 --> 00:45:00,840
Weight controls are. More likely to be exposed or less likely to be exposed.

355
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:13,710
Controls have a hip fracture. Exposure is postmenopausal estrogens and they protect against hip fracture.

356
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:17,670
So are controls more or less likely to be exposed?

357
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:25,670
Modern. So if that were the case, you would get an odds ratio that.

358
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:32,180
Further from the null, meaning you will see a positive association.

359
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:38,690
You might conclude that. Postmenopausal estrogens protect against.

360
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:45,220
I lost my percentage of his cause and M.I.A.

361
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:52,940
When in reality, they don't. What you are seeing is a spurious association because you condition the neglect.

362
00:45:55,170 --> 00:46:01,500
Another case control study. I think we went through this in the case control studies session.

363
00:46:01,830 --> 00:46:06,790
Smoking is the exposure that COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

364
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:11,130
The controls are patients with other respiratory diseases.

365
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:17,810
If. Including lung cancer and smoking causes lung cancer.

366
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:22,760
So we know smoking causes COPD.

367
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:28,889
Right. The outcome. And COPD causes selection into the study,

368
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:36,270
which is conditioned on the controls are people with respiratory diseases, which causes relating to the study.

369
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:40,270
And guess what? Smoking causes respiratory disease.

370
00:46:40,310 --> 00:46:44,860
Right. So is there selection bias?

371
00:46:44,890 --> 00:46:49,510
Yes, we are conditioning on a common effect of the exposure and the outcome.

372
00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:58,200
And if you were to try to guess. What would be the problem here on this?

373
00:46:58,230 --> 00:47:05,010
Two way to table. It is likely that you have an overrepresentation of exposed controls, right?

374
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:13,430
These are the controls and they are more likely to smoke. If that were the case.

375
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:23,140
The odds ratio represented this. Effect would be less than it really is.

376
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:32,400
It would be viewed as a thinly. Look, we also went through this study of coffee intake.

377
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:40,410
The exposure and pancreatic cancer controls were selected from patients seen by the same doctor for their GI problems,

378
00:47:40,410 --> 00:47:48,450
like was a five year old reflux disease, which is F and doctors forbid coffee in people with GERD.

379
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:51,520
Right. So you have exposure and outcome.

380
00:47:51,540 --> 00:48:03,810
Let's say there is no effect selection into the studies conditioned on and GERD and the outcome obviously cause inclusion in the study and GERD.

381
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:09,150
Um. Is related or causes less coffee intake.

382
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:16,530
Is there selection bias? Well, we are conditioning in a common effect of the outcome and a cause of the exposure.

383
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:31,240
And if you were to try to guess the direction of the association, the bias may be you would have an overrepresentation of unexposed controls.

384
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:37,620
Because these controls are less likely to be coffee drinkers because don't care for body.

385
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:42,710
Like. And you might see.

386
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:50,470
A harmful effect of of coffee on pancreatic cancer, when in reality there is not.

387
00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:58,500
This bias is called. Barack's son's bias.

388
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:04,570
Barack's bias. Uh. You probably read it in your.

389
00:49:08,090 --> 00:49:13,110
But. Is typically.

390
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:20,310
The bias that occurs when you use. Hospital controls.

391
00:49:29,090 --> 00:49:35,629
Okay. I think this might be the last case control study example folic acid supplements in early pregnancy.

392
00:49:35,630 --> 00:49:41,270
That's the exposure and fetal heart malformations is the outcome.

393
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:46,040
In this study. Only life born babies were included.

394
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:51,890
And why do you think that? Do you think that's.

395
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:59,200
Like a. Beginner's mistake or.

396
00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:12,030
What is your opinion on? Doing a study like this among only life born babies.

397
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:23,640
Isn't it? You might.

398
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:34,020
Right. Let's say by not including. Stillbirths.

399
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:38,140
Right. Okay. Yes. You made me some that.

400
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:43,590
Had a malformation and died in utero because of the malformation.

401
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:47,760
But. Is this study?

402
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:53,260
Sort of. Terrible war is unavoidable.

403
00:50:55,310 --> 00:51:00,380
Well, no. I mean, you know, the the thing is.

404
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:08,130
The question is, why could you not include all stillbirths?

405
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:21,690
Because stillbirths are really not. Examine for.

406
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:27,270
Heart malformations. You'd have to conduct an autopsy and.

407
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:36,270
That's usually not the case. So it's kind of an unavoidable design specific situation.

408
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:40,830
So he's not like he's not a beginner's mistake. Just what?

409
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:45,490
Well, you have to work with know, a prenatal privilege, I guess.

410
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:50,800
But indeed, suppose there is no effect.

411
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:55,750
But they had effect late into selection.

412
00:51:57,010 --> 00:52:01,030
This is inverted because of what Lindsay was saying.

413
00:52:02,330 --> 00:52:08,480
Having a heart defect might kill the baby before the baby can make it into the study.

414
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:20,170
Right. And let's say folic acid could have an effect on selection and survival of the baby through other mechanisms other than heart malformations.

415
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:31,340
Uh, but obviously you will have a selection bias here because you are conditioning on a common effect of the exposure and the outcome.

416
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:40,170
And the potential direction of the bias could be due to a an overrepresentation of ex-post controls.

417
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:46,250
You may see an apparently protective effect of folic acid on.

418
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:55,490
On the heart effect when there is really no. Here is an important note again on the direction of bias.

419
00:52:56,660 --> 00:53:09,350
You cannot use the same. Procedure that we went through to anticipate the direction of confounding using the signs you remember.

420
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:17,530
We multiply the signs. To find out if there is no effect with it.

421
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:21,250
You will see a positive and an inverse association.

422
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:26,980
If there is an effect with that, you will see an attenuation or an exaggeration.

423
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:31,640
You cannot do that. With selection bias.

424
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:36,710
We had a, I guess, a. Um.

425
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:42,700
Well, in an interesting situation last year, one of our GSA was, uh.

426
00:53:44,090 --> 00:53:48,160
You know, thinking about this. And.

427
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:57,450
And she came up with. It turned out well, she worked out some examples, and these, uh, these worked.

428
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:04,729
She she actually could anticipate the. The direction of selection bias by using the design products.

429
00:54:04,730 --> 00:54:08,000
And we were very excited really and.

430
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:16,309
And um, well, we were thinking of maybe putting together a little methods paper and so on,

431
00:54:16,310 --> 00:54:26,870
but after working more and when we got more serious and also discussed with people and it we found in a situation where it doesn't apply.

432
00:54:28,190 --> 00:54:39,770
So that invalidates the whole idea. So, you know, it was kind of disappointing, but oh, it was still a great exercise and I'm very proud of it.

433
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:46,100
So, um, I guess the bottom line though is, is you can't really not, not use that.

434
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:55,220
You would have to do. If you want to anticipate the direction of selection bias, you would have to do simulations,

435
00:54:55,220 --> 00:55:03,650
sensitivity analysis, you know, trying many different strengths and magnetism, association, etc.

436
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:06,840
All right. How about cohort studies?

437
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:10,280
Okay. Well, this is is this is heavy stuff.

438
00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:16,910
Cohort study of antiretrovirals, HRT and AIDS.

439
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:23,630
The outcome HRT side effects lead to loss to follow up again because people may feel

440
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:28,250
so sick from the side effects that they don't feel like making it to the clinic.

441
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:31,250
Right. Immunosuppression.

442
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:34,790
Which is, let's say in this case, unmeasured variable.

443
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:44,990
You leads to both AIDS and loss to follow up, which is there is going to be the condition don't work because only people.

444
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:51,390
Not lost to follow up, meaning those who remain in the study were included in the analysis.

445
00:55:52,020 --> 00:56:00,929
So these might be a bit more complicated, but it still illustrates selection bias might be from maybe from Renan and Robbins's reading.

446
00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:06,270
So here is 8880.

447
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:13,350
Is inversely related to not to follow up the not lost to follow up meaning.

448
00:56:15,410 --> 00:56:19,440
If what if you take Elvis, you will be lost to follow, right?

449
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:27,660
And immunosuppression is obviously related to AIDS and is also related to not being lost to follow.

450
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:35,020
This variable is conditional because the analysis is restricted to people who are not lost to follow up.

451
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:40,130
People who remained in the study. Is there selection bias?

452
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:45,220
Well, you are conditioning in a common effect of the exposure and a cause of doubt.

453
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:50,170
So yes, there is. Selection bias.

454
00:56:50,170 --> 00:56:58,299
And again, this is a possibility you might have an under-representation of exposed cases.

455
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:09,130
And if that's the case, you might see a. Apparent protective effect of year on age when there may not be any.

456
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:15,650
Right. So this is differential loss to follow up bias.

457
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:25,580
So lots to follow up is different between exposed and unexposed and is different with respect to risk of the outcome.

458
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:30,250
Between the people who are out and the people who remain in this day.

459
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:38,730
Okay. This is a nice example of a mutation IP mythology study of saturated fat intake.

460
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:43,410
The exposure in relation to coronary heart disease. Delko.

461
00:57:44,410 --> 00:57:46,210
Was conducted among volunteers.

462
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:58,530
Which is the selection variable and having a family history of coronary heart disease, which in this case is unmeasured you one leads to volunteering.

463
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:06,370
Does it make sense? Having a history of coronary heart disease leads to volunteer in a study of coronary heart disease.

464
00:58:07,210 --> 00:58:18,250
Yeah. Hey, you know, if if your ancestors have died of something, you may be interested to know and to help people learn why.

465
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:27,930
Right. And also having a healthy lifestyle leads to volunteering.

466
00:58:30,030 --> 00:58:37,140
Because people are interested again in knowing more about data than health.

467
00:58:37,770 --> 00:58:41,670
So volunteering again is the conditioning variable.

468
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:46,920
We have outcome and exposure. Having a family history leads to volunteering.

469
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:57,210
Having a healthy lifestyle leaves volunteering. And having a family history obviously leads to the person eventually getting.

470
00:58:58,310 --> 00:59:08,900
The outcome. And I guess you will also agree that having a healthy lifestyle may have something to do with saturated fat intake.

471
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:17,500
Whether or not it kills you. I guess maybe you guys from the station may have more.

472
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:23,340
Up to date. Knowledge on discourse is very highly contested.

473
00:59:26,530 --> 00:59:30,720
Um. No. Is there selection bias?

474
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:40,290
Well, we are conditioning on a course of the outcome and a cause of the on going effect of those and a common cause of the exposure.

475
00:59:40,290 --> 00:59:46,640
Right. And if you were to try to anticipate the direction you might have.

476
00:59:47,710 --> 00:59:50,980
And overrepresentation of unexposed cases.

477
00:59:53,350 --> 01:00:03,550
So people with coronary heart disease, but who really did not have high intake of saturated fat because they were, you know, healthier today.

478
01:00:05,770 --> 01:00:11,950
And you might see a protective effect on that is really, as you can see, no effect of a on weight.

479
01:00:14,070 --> 01:00:18,170
And this is an example of volunteer bias. I'm.

480
01:00:20,890 --> 01:00:23,980
This is the classic example of.

481
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:28,810
Healthy volunteer. Bye. So it's the study of depression.

482
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:32,900
That's the outcome in relation to occupational exposure.

483
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:40,130
A. You know something in the work environment conducted in people who are at work.

484
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:44,490
So being at work is this election level exposure, politics, not being at work.

485
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:51,270
And the underlying health status which is unmeasured in this case predicts both the outcome and being at work.

486
01:00:52,650 --> 01:01:01,380
So you have the outcome depression, you have your exposure to something, you know, like a toxicant or something at the workplace.

487
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:05,610
And being at work is this election level. So this is going to be conditioned on.

488
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:14,149
The occupational exposure leads to not being at work because people might be sick from it.

489
01:01:14,150 --> 01:01:18,680
And we say, you know, not too may not be well enough to show up to work.

490
01:01:19,790 --> 01:01:25,049
And the underlying health status causes depression. This case?

491
01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:30,810
Well, you know, I guess inversely. And it also causes being at work.

492
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:37,819
So here we are, conditioning on a common effect of the exposure and a cause of the outcome.

493
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:45,710
And there is selection bias. And as I said. This is an example of healthy work advice.

494
01:01:46,970 --> 01:01:50,180
And finally, an example from a randomized trial.

495
01:01:51,410 --> 01:01:56,240
Zinc supplements a given to infants and recurrent episodes of malaria.

496
01:01:57,450 --> 01:02:01,220
Why? Let's analyze their protocol.

497
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:08,880
The recall, excluding noncompliance. That can cause selection bias.

498
01:02:11,710 --> 01:02:15,430
Metallic taste of zinc leads to noncompliance among.

499
01:02:16,740 --> 01:02:24,890
Babies. Assigned to the active treatment arm and malaria infection worsens.

500
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:34,390
The perception of a bad taste. Has anybody gotten malaria infection and is not fine.

501
01:02:35,170 --> 01:02:39,590
Did you get falciparum? Oh, yeah.

502
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:48,259
So I've also got it once. Um, so here is the, here is the potential that.

503
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:53,840
So the exposure is zinc and the outcome is malaria episodes.

504
01:02:55,610 --> 01:02:59,450
Compliance is actually the variable condition done.

505
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:06,919
Zinc leads to less compliance. Being assigned to zinc and having malaria also leads to less compliance.

506
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:14,910
And we are here. Conditioning on a common effect of exposure and outcomes.

507
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:18,490
So there is obviously selection bias and you might see.

508
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:23,800
An apparent protective effect on zinc, on malaria, when there is really no.

509
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:32,650
All right. So what are some advantages of this structural approach to selection bias?

510
01:03:33,890 --> 01:03:36,890
That so that some of you into sleep. But.

511
01:03:38,410 --> 01:03:44,020
Well, it helps you choose. The best analytic methods.

512
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:50,910
So again. You need to be careful with the variables you.

513
01:03:51,930 --> 01:03:56,730
Enter in your model. You should not enter just everything because you have it.

514
01:03:57,870 --> 01:04:04,710
You might enter in the model a collider that might open up one of those non causal paths.

515
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:12,090
So it really during a dag can inform the best way to analyze your data.

516
01:04:14,450 --> 01:04:16,310
And then at the level of these saying, well.

517
01:04:18,110 --> 01:04:26,840
You can decide which variables that might be related to selection you should collect information on because actually it might be possible.

518
01:04:27,110 --> 01:04:35,420
If you cannot avoid selection bias, it might still be possible to correct for it if you have the right variables available.

519
01:04:40,430 --> 01:04:52,760
Another helpful thing of the structured approach is that if you are reading this study and you suspect selection bias or during your training,

520
01:04:53,090 --> 01:04:58,330
somebody has to retain an exam to check whether there might be selection bias there.

521
01:04:59,070 --> 01:05:03,590
During it, that might exactly tell you whether or not that can be the case.

522
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:12,850
This will probably pass over.

523
01:05:16,370 --> 01:05:21,110
We see. Yeah.

524
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:27,480
So, you know, this this one is really, again, more of a practical kind of.

525
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:35,850
I think when you are evaluating a study for selection bias.

526
01:05:35,850 --> 01:05:40,780
So these are the questions that you should ask. But again, I will probably biased.

527
01:05:41,590 --> 01:05:48,520
So what do we do with selection bias, avoid, if possible, at the level of design.

528
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:52,510
But many times it is not possible to avoid. So.

529
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:58,750
Again, these are the situations when it is really not possible to avoid.

530
01:05:59,550 --> 01:06:09,290
So, again, the important thing is. To collect information on variables that might help you close.

531
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:19,100
That open path. Through the method that we discussed last time.

532
01:06:19,670 --> 01:06:25,130
Inverse probability weighting. I guess a week from a week ago.

533
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:31,620
You can use invest probability weighting to correct for selection bias if you have the right variables.

534
01:06:34,250 --> 01:06:41,920
All right. Any questions on selection bias? Is it?

535
01:06:51,910 --> 01:06:54,940
What would that look like when there is no selection bias?

536
01:06:55,420 --> 01:07:04,900
There is no conditioning on a common effect of two variables, one of which is the exposure because of the exposure of the other is the cause of death.

537
01:07:06,370 --> 01:07:13,020
No conditioning on such fire. Oops.

538
01:07:13,230 --> 01:07:17,250
Now over at Jasmine Baez, this is sort of the other child of that family of.

539
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:22,530
COLLIDER'S certification by ISS. But that's really.

540
01:07:25,010 --> 01:07:32,329
It has a different structure where the only bias is conditioning on an intermediate variable or on a

541
01:07:32,330 --> 01:07:40,190
descending proxy of an intermediate variable when estimating the total effect of an exposure on an outcome.

542
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:44,270
You remember the types of effects we could estimate. Total effect.

543
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:48,770
Direct effect. Indirect effects. Okay. So we are talking about the total effect.

544
01:07:48,890 --> 01:07:55,670
Suppose we have a study to determine the total effect of birth weight on adult blood pressure.

545
01:07:56,360 --> 01:08:00,679
And we have. One intermediate variable, a mediator,

546
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:12,260
which is the BMI in adult because birth weight leads to higher BMI in adulthood and higher BMI leads to a adult blood pressure.

547
01:08:14,370 --> 01:08:21,560
So if we go ahead and again enter everything in the model just because we have, you know, what they help.

548
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:26,910
So. This is over a jasmine bias.

549
01:08:32,470 --> 01:08:38,880
This is another example from from being able to be military for that to be military.

550
01:08:38,890 --> 01:08:46,180
So we have smoking is the exposure and the outcome is having a spontaneous abortion.

551
01:08:48,220 --> 01:08:52,810
There is an in measure variable, which is an endometrial abnormality that has.

552
01:08:54,470 --> 01:09:03,860
Caused prior abortions, you know, repeatedly. So if we condition on having a prior abortion recall,

553
01:09:04,730 --> 01:09:09,920
doing something to it is an proxy of everybody says if you do, we're doing it to the variable itself.

554
01:09:10,370 --> 01:09:13,610
We would also be encouraging over at Jasmine Bates.

555
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:22,160
Go back to these. That would be simpler and tell me, what do you think the expected direction of the bias should be here?

556
01:09:27,370 --> 01:09:30,969
So let's say that this is a complicated example.

557
01:09:30,970 --> 01:09:40,170
Let's say there is a positive. There is really an inverse, but let's say there is a positive effect of birth weight on adult blood pressure.

558
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:44,770
And you condition on an intermediate level.

559
01:09:47,590 --> 01:09:52,150
Will you see a lower. Uh.

560
01:09:54,000 --> 01:10:18,300
Quality ratio or a higher quality wins injuries. What does your intuition say?

561
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:43,900
If you block a path, if you block a coastal path. Yes.

562
01:10:43,910 --> 01:10:47,020
And I didn't wish. Yeah. You should see the nation.

563
01:10:47,170 --> 01:10:51,100
You should see less of an effect because you are removing variability.

564
01:10:53,380 --> 01:11:02,780
From this, Beth. Right. Now what if there is a direct effect of a young way and we want to estimate it?

565
01:11:02,780 --> 01:11:08,280
So let's see. What if we have? Smoking in pregnancy is the exposure.

566
01:11:08,790 --> 01:11:12,960
Neonatal mortality is the outcome and birth weight as an intermediate level.

567
01:11:12,970 --> 01:11:18,960
But we know that there could be a direct effect of smoking on mortality.

568
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:29,140
And we want to estimate this. How do we do that? Well, if we want to estimate the direct effect, it would make sense to.

569
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:37,520
Condition on the intermediate right. That would be okay if if this is exactly the situation.

570
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:42,160
But. What happens if we have?

571
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:49,660
A placental gene which is unmeasured that causes both birth weight and mortality through other parts.

572
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:54,340
What have we done? Well done. Air conditioning on a.

573
01:12:02,020 --> 01:12:08,380
Yes. Yes, we have opened a non consult but because in this that I was actually Collider Right.

574
01:12:08,770 --> 01:12:18,520
And we have just gone without knowing that this path was there, we conditioned on it and look, we opened this non causal path so we have caused bikes.

575
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:28,610
So if you have to. If you want to estimate the direct effect, you have to do something else,

576
01:12:28,730 --> 01:12:37,220
which is actually now a very active area of research, which is called causal mediation analysis.

577
01:12:37,730 --> 01:12:46,270
So you have to lay out some. Set of assumptions and you have to use slightly different methods to avoid this.

578
01:12:49,070 --> 01:12:52,330
Okay. All right.

579
01:12:53,380 --> 01:12:57,420
There is some fans, which is really not a biomedical, unnecessary adjustment.

580
01:12:57,430 --> 01:13:09,430
So let's say you want to estimate the causal effect of a young here and this, that, and you have all these variables C one through C five.

581
01:13:10,740 --> 01:13:18,990
On this drug, adjusting for any of these variables, conditioning on any of these variables will not cause bias.

582
01:13:20,380 --> 01:13:21,220
Generally speaking,

583
01:13:21,220 --> 01:13:32,680
will not cause bias but is unnecessary because they don't do anything to improve or to close any non causal bias between a and light.

584
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:37,710
Right. What might happen is that.

585
01:13:39,470 --> 01:13:44,850
Adjusting for some might make you lose precision.

586
01:13:44,870 --> 01:13:48,410
And finally on Wednesday, we'll talk about precision.

587
01:13:50,850 --> 01:13:54,780
Although sometimes adjusting for some of them might improve your position.

588
01:13:55,980 --> 01:13:59,730
Like this. Depending on the scale of these.

589
01:13:59,740 --> 01:14:03,840
Like so. But. The message, I guess,

590
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:13,650
is that adjusting for any of these C one through C five variables on this that is unnecessary and just it will not introduce bias.

591
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:17,740
It is not necessary. Okay.

592
01:14:19,430 --> 01:14:24,470
So in general, think of the time sequence of events in your causal system.

593
01:14:25,990 --> 01:14:29,770
Ignoring what happens after the exposure in time.

594
01:14:31,350 --> 01:14:35,970
Variables that happen after the exposure may be the safest approach.

595
01:14:36,850 --> 01:14:40,300
Do not conditions on them. Do not throw them in your model.

596
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:46,850
If you're interested in the total effect of a young woman, typically what most people are interested.

597
01:14:52,830 --> 01:14:56,850
Okay? Mm hmm. I have a fascinating example here.

598
01:14:58,370 --> 01:15:05,090
This was a study, you know, sort of high profile study published in circulation.

599
01:15:06,180 --> 01:15:11,360
Do you know about the. The prestige of that general circulation.

600
01:15:12,670 --> 01:15:17,480
You see it like blosser. BMC. Nice.

601
01:15:17,490 --> 01:15:21,120
B B good. Very prestigious journal.

602
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:28,200
And the study was to examine the total or to estimate the total effect of maternal

603
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:35,220
diet during pregnancy and blood pressure of the offspring at age 12 years.

604
01:15:36,670 --> 01:15:48,260
So here are a few questions for you. Should we adjust the total effect of maternal diet during pregnancy for birth weight?

605
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:56,570
Just quickly drew a dog in your heads. No.

606
01:15:56,750 --> 01:16:14,719
You could lie. Well, I guess the answer is correct is no.

607
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:21,450
But but the reason perhaps is different. Exactly.

608
01:16:21,690 --> 01:16:26,010
Birthweight happens after in time that are during pregnancy.

609
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:34,940
Meaning it could be an intermediate level. Right. About the height of the offspring at age five years.

610
01:16:35,210 --> 01:16:42,200
Should we adjust for that? No. Why? Same reason. How about blood pressure of the mother at delivery?

611
01:16:43,330 --> 01:16:49,139
Should we adjust for that? Probably unnecessary.

612
01:16:49,140 --> 01:16:54,330
A. Or maybe intermediate. Right. It happens after the exposure.

613
01:16:55,110 --> 01:17:00,500
Right. Unless it is closely related to blood pressure before.

614
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:05,320
Pregnancy. But that's actually unlikely the case.

615
01:17:06,590 --> 01:17:10,840
How about offspring diet in adolescence? Should we adjust for that?

616
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:23,910
Yeah. Christopher. But was the relation of offspring diet in adolescence with.

617
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:28,559
Maternal diet during pregnancy. When does it happen?

618
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:39,080
In time. Well this happens at the offspring date in adolescent happiness after they during pregnancy.

619
01:17:39,950 --> 01:17:46,710
So why are we. How about offspring diet at age five years?

620
01:17:51,050 --> 01:17:54,800
How about socioeconomic status of the mother before pregnancy?

621
01:17:55,690 --> 01:18:02,840
Yeah, that makes sense. How about this economic status of the mother when the offspring is 12 years?

622
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:09,590
No. About sex of the offspring.

623
01:18:21,910 --> 01:18:25,540
Is is sex caused by by diet during pregnancy?

624
01:18:27,780 --> 01:18:33,430
Any evolutionary anthropologist in the room. You know, we don't know.

625
01:18:34,150 --> 01:18:41,980
Very, very early on. It might have something to do, perhaps very, very, very little at the population level.

626
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:48,490
Maybe something is okay to assume it does not. But six.

627
01:18:49,830 --> 01:18:53,970
Might affect blood pressure. Right the outcome in the offspring.

628
01:18:54,690 --> 01:19:03,030
So it could be one of those C four variables and again it's unnecessary at Jesmyn but from a statistical

629
01:19:03,030 --> 01:19:10,200
perspective a few people might say is not completely wrong and it might in fact be acceptable.

630
01:19:11,950 --> 01:19:17,920
Okay. And I was asking sort of obnoxiously all these questions and because.

631
01:19:18,670 --> 01:19:21,970
Guess which variables were adjusted for these people?

632
01:19:24,210 --> 01:19:30,400
All of them. All of. And in the paper there are an even.

633
01:19:32,150 --> 01:19:36,100
And adjusted estimates present. Everything you have is.

634
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:42,720
Maintenance from a model adjusted for maybe two or three or four or five or all of them.

635
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:47,860
So it's pretty much impossible to conclude anything from.

636
01:19:48,750 --> 01:19:55,270
No. By the way, always present and adjusted estimates on your papers all.
