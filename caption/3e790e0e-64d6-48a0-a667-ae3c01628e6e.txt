1
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:13,280
We are going to get going here now. I want to point out the lecture today, I have two lectures for today.

2
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:22,850
One is on anaerobes and one of the talks that I put together for a presentation a couple of years ago and.

3
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:29,450
It really goes through a lot of the problems with antimicrobial resistance. And detect detecting it in the laboratories.

4
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:35,300
And so I really wanted to go through that so so that you all would be aware of really

5
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:40,010
the extent of the problems that we have with antimicrobial resistance in Michigan,

6
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:47,750
across the United States, worldwide, whatever. So I thought it gave a little bit better explanation of what some of the issues were.

7
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:56,640
So we're going to get going first on if I can find it on here anaerobic.

8
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:04,480
And I don't know why I can't make this full screen, but we'll try.

9
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:11,320
Here we go. OK. Had Rose. We all have them everywhere in our body.

10
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:16,990
However, if there were there places where they normally exist, they're not a problem.

11
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:21,610
So when they get into those places where they don't normally exist, that we have a problem.

12
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:26,620
OK, so some general characteristics of anaerobic bacteria.

13
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:32,500
Once again, the presence of oxygen, if it's a strict anaerobe, it kills the organism.

14
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:40,360
But there are many facultad of anaerobic or anaerobic that can use that can stand a little bit of oxygen and it doesn't kill them.

15
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:48,910
Some of the organisms that we call anaerobic bacteria are actually micro air filling, but they're lumped in with the anaerobic.

16
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:52,200
So once again, they're part of our normal flora.

17
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:59,570
OK, so it's when they get into a place where they're not supposed to be, when we have problems with them.

18
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:05,320
And so some of them prefer the GI tract.

19
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:12,100
Some of them prefer the urinary tract. Some of them prefer the oral area or the respiratory tract.

20
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:16,540
But when they get in someplace where they're not supposed to be, that's when we have problems.

21
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:21,930
And so if you go to the book, I think it's at the end of this table up,

22
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:31,470
but a table that tells which ones are soil and which ones like other environmental areas, and they can be acquired by different routes.

23
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:39,730
And so when there's an accident or someone is injured and say you organism

24
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:45,130
that's normally in the throat or in the respiratory tract gets into the blood,

25
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:52,840
that's when that organism doesn't belong there and it can sit at home and say, I'm going to grow and I'm going to do whatever I want to do.

26
00:02:52,840 --> 00:03:00,550
OK, so that's what we have problems with anaerobic bacteria or other organisms that should are part of our normal form,

27
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:07,660
but get into a place where they shouldn't be. So most of these organisms are not transmitted person to person.

28
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:16,300
It's our own flora, except clustered in difficile, which can cause huge amounts of problems in nursing homes,

29
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:22,810
long term care in hospitals and any place that a person is somewhat compromised,

30
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:31,090
but not totally, but is given too many antibiotics and knocks out the normal flora.

31
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,630
So we go to the next slide, if I could.

32
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:44,170
And so we have a table here on this table numbers this the lectures that I use were set up using an older version of and Scott.

33
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:47,890
So the same table is in the book that if you have a book that you use is in there,

34
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:54,220
but it might be in Chapter forty five, forty six, something like that, the chapter numbers will be different.

35
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:59,860
So here we have incidents of Arabs as normal flora because they are part of our normal force, if you will.

36
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:04,240
The first one Bacteroides. OK. Does it belong in the skin?

37
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:09,580
No. Could have been able to retract well, sometimes kind of plus minus in the intestine.

38
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:16,360
Definitely. OK. Vagina, yes. What about future Fusobacterium?

39
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:23,860
Yes, we find it in the upper respiratory tract and in the intestine could be in the urethra, the urine also.

40
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:28,360
But when it gets into a place where it should be, it can set up an infection.

41
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,000
So take a look at this type of a of a table.

42
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:38,960
I'm not asking that you memorize every single column and every single row, but look at some of the more important bacteria that we talk.

43
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,730
I mean, look at the bottom on here, Propionibacterium, it's on.

44
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:48,640
The skin can cause infections. It sure can if it gets someplace where it shouldn't be.

45
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:56,350
So we even see bloodstream infections where the major organism is a is now that would not happen in a patient,

46
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:59,950
a person who has normal functioning immune response.

47
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:08,220
But if you get an immunocompromised patient or someone who's got a lot of other things going on, yes, it can cause problems.

48
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:20,100
Let's go to the next slide. So here we have how do we acquire anaerobic infections and diseases and this is just what I've been talking about.

49
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:25,290
So if you look at contamination of an existing wound or a puncture by objects that are

50
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:30,310
contaminated with toxic genetic cluster idiom that you have a key step on a nail,

51
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:35,010
that's exactly what they're talking about. As horrible as that sounds, stepping on a nail.

52
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:43,800
That's how you would perhaps acquire Clostridium today, and that is certainly something that we don't want to have at all.

53
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:50,130
And that's what vaccines are for. The next one down is botulism.

54
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:58,680
Now, if you're working in a hospital situation, if you get a somebody says, Hey, I think we may have a case of botulism here.

55
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:04,770
Public health is going to be in right away. They're going to help get the atmosphere for the patient.

56
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:11,520
They're going to help with testing for the organism. Because clinical labs do not test for clustering and botulism.

57
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:19,110
They may say there's a Clostridium species in the specimen, but it would be up to the state health lab to say Yes, it is a botulism.

58
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:28,350
Let's see what kind of toxin it's producing. OK, so we all work together on these types of issues.

59
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:36,190
What about person to person spread? Really, the only cluster idiom that spreads person to person is difficile.

60
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:42,290
Next slide. So I've already talked a little bit about pathogenesis of these diseases,

61
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:50,990
they think the animals can cause a wide range of different types of infections, but remember they have to be in an anaerobic environment.

62
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:54,830
So if it's an open wound on your skin, probably not.

63
00:06:54,830 --> 00:07:03,540
Or maybe they're with some other bacteria, but certainly the staff of the strep or E. coli that gets in there are going to be much more important.

64
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:12,230
And of course, because it says here, most infections are a mixture of Arabs and facultad of Arabs, and those would be the Turks.

65
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:19,040
So cultures specimen appropriately obtained, transported properly,

66
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:28,190
and we'll go through some of that and the and what we need to do in the laboratory so that you get the answer that you need.

67
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:39,260
So next slide, if I can get it to move. OK, here we have another table pathogenesis and spectrum disease for Arabic bacteria.

68
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:43,970
So we'll just look at the first one Clostridium perforations, which I'm sure all of you have heard about.

69
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:49,280
Gram positive. Anaerobe it whenever you find it, it's serious.

70
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:56,690
OK? It is. It always has to be taken seriously. Produces several virulence factors which you can see, or several actual toxins,

71
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:02,570
of which the alpha toxin is the most important and causes destruction of host cells.

72
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:05,990
But there are other toxins that it produces. Also, what does it cost?

73
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:14,960
Causes gas gangrene if it is allowed to progress without surgical and antimicrobial therapy.

74
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:20,480
Patients will lose limbs or even lives. It is always taken seriously.

75
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:31,220
Life-Threatening infection. The toxin destroys muscle, it destroys tissues, and it's always following a wound, an accident.

76
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:36,080
You know, some kind of an accident where somebody gets scraped up and gets a wound that gets infected,

77
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:42,850
the organism within the environment or on the person, it just got in the wrong place.

78
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:51,070
Nobody talked about botulism. Always, always taken seriously. If you go to the next slide, then we have said Clostridium difficile.

79
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:54,820
And until we have a long career, 37 year career.

80
00:08:54,820 --> 00:09:00,250
But when I started my career, we didn't take Clostridium difficile wasn't hardly known.

81
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:10,060
And now, with the profuse use of antibiotics, many of which are not necessary, it has become much, much, much more important.

82
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:15,040
And we see it much more often. He produces a couple of toxins, toxin and toxin.

83
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:22,510
B easy to remember, a toxin is an endotoxin toxin b as a cytotoxic.

84
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:31,870
It can be treated, but it's much more easily treated if it's caught early on or if the if its patient is not given too many antibiotics,

85
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:40,030
which knocks out the gut flora and does not allow this organism to proliferate can cause a pseudo membrane.

86
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:48,040
Can cause a lot of debris. Can cause destruction of the intestine, bleeding, you name it.

87
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:54,400
It's it's bad. It's bad. So we're always on the lookout for a cluster of difficile and how to diagnose it.

88
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:59,950
We don't do culture for it anymore. The two culture takes too long. You have to do it in strict anaerobic conditions.

89
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:07,390
Now, a number of molecular assays that are excellent there, and there are even some rapid antigen type tests.

90
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:11,080
But if they're negative, you have to go on and do a molecular test.

91
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:19,840
So every just about every license lab has a molecular assay for Clostridium difficile actin, a mighty species we don't see too often.

92
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,890
But when we do, we always work.

93
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:29,470
But unfortunately, they're not too difficult to treat because they don't have a whole lot of antimicrobial resistance for it to my size,

94
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:35,320
but they can cause a lot of destruction. Let's go on here.

95
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:41,410
Let we get down to another general that I'm sure you've heard about Bacteroides,

96
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:48,460
of which Bacteroides fragilis is definitely serious whenever we identify it.

97
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:53,950
The other, we don't see the other species too too often, except maybe your politicos.

98
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:58,240
We do see some Prevotella and Porphyromonas, but mostly there are just along for the ride.

99
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,700
They don't cause that much disease. But if we get down to Fusobacterium, yes, it's white right up there.

100
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:11,650
In that top tier of that, they can cause a lot of disease, a lot of destruction and death.

101
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:23,980
So the pathogenic mechanisms, they have capsules they form and they have endotoxin, they have succinate acid, they destroy tissues.

102
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:37,750
And going on here. So now, most importantly, we can't do anything in the laboratory if we don't get the right specimen handled appropriately.

103
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:44,930
They get rejected if they're submitted in an inappropriate manner. So.

104
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:51,440
It doesn't have to be submitted in anaerobic transport, which is not the same transport as, say,

105
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:59,710
for a throat swab first base where, OK, anaerobic transport is different, it doesn't have the oxygen in it.

106
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:06,640
OK. Yeah. If it's a swab as well, basically we don't like swab specimens for anaerobic infections anyway,

107
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:13,090
but we if it's a deep tissue and they use a swab in the or something instead of sending us tissue or fluid,

108
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:22,570
we will work it out and put a disclaimer on it. But um, so if it's a swab and it gets sent down and regular transport,

109
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:29,500
if it gets to the lab in the tube system within just a few minutes, it's going to be OK if it's ours.

110
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:41,450
It's not going to be OK. Much better to collect an appropriate specimen, put it in anaerobic transport and send it the way it should be sent.

111
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:50,930
And I have to tell you, there's not a lap around that likes to reject specimens because they're inappropriately submitted.

112
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:55,520
But we all know that it's a much larger problem if you work it up,

113
00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:02,630
even though it's submitted in an inappropriate manner and you don't get the answer that the doctor's looking for delays,

114
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,670
appropriate therapy patients may die.

115
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:12,170
There may be an inappropriate inappropriately treated so best to always follow the instructions from the laboratory for submitting specimens.

116
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:15,470
And if you don't know what to do, please call the lab.

117
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:20,630
Nobody will ever question you. Nobody was ever say, I've told you this before.

118
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:25,070
Just You want to do it right. You want to do what's best for the patient.

119
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:33,980
And that is getting that sample to the laboratory in the appropriate manner so that nothing dies out.

120
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,890
OK. So for anaerobic infections,

121
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:45,920
I mentioned swabs about what's really better is a biopsy or in the tissue biopsy or a needle biopsy because there's more specimen to work with.

122
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,300
Swabs really are not great because sometimes they dry out, they can get contamination.

123
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:56,420
Now, do you all know the difference between a regular swab and a FlucT swab? Has anybody ever told you that?

124
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:09,140
OK, well, regular swab is like a Q-Tip, and the fibers are glued on to the stick, and sometimes that glue is toxic to bacteria.

125
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:21,950
So most labs have gone to using flocked swab flow CKD swabs, where the fibers are molded to the swab stick.

126
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:29,510
But there's no glue involved. OK, and so you don't have that potential toxicity.

127
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:34,460
So putting a specimen with a swab is okay for some things.

128
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:41,060
If it's looking for the anaerobic anaerobic infection, something from surgery, we really want tissue or fluid.

129
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:44,960
We don't need this much of it.

130
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:49,670
We need this much of it so that we can do an Arabic and an anaerobic culture.

131
00:14:49,670 --> 00:15:02,900
But it must be submitted in anaerobic transport if it's a stool specimen looking for cure for +210 difficile obviously an anaerobic organism,

132
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:16,040
but those can just be submitted in the regular Kari Blair, which is what we use for all stool samples, whether it's aerobic culture or C. difficile.

133
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:27,260
So here's some examples of different types of transport media, obviously, these with the snipers on the top or for to be injected with the specimen.

134
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:31,520
But anything that you can put the specimen down into or the swab down into,

135
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:36,380
and it stays in the transport media while it's being transported, that will work.

136
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:43,520
And I will never say that one company is anaerobic transport is better or worse than in other companies.

137
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:49,920
So. So great statement here.

138
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:56,520
The ubiquitous nature of animals, they're everywhere, they're everywhere on our body, they're everywhere.

139
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:05,310
But you can look, can even can have a very negative effect on a routine culture and can lead to misleading results.

140
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:11,670
Because if you isolate a an animal with bacteria, the physician said, Oh, we really need to treat this,

141
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:17,460
but you overlook because the overgrowth by one organism over another, you may overlook an organism.

142
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:25,200
So you have to be very careful about how you work things out. So we've got acceptable specimens and unacceptable specimens,

143
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:30,930
and here we have two charts on the left is clinical specimens suitable for anaerobic

144
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:36,840
culture and on the right are clinical specimens unacceptable for culture?

145
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:44,340
So let's look at the unacceptable ones first. Let's start with the bottom.

146
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:52,860
Urine is not a good specimen for an anaerobic culture, because we know they're animals that live on the surface of the urethra tissue.

147
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:59,180
Same thing with vaginal or surgical specimens, urethral swabs, throat swabs or any open skin wound.

148
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:08,550
OK, this is an anaerobic infection. A potentially anaerobic infection is to be collected from a site that has a lack of oxygen.

149
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:13,320
So here's our list of generally unsuitable now.

150
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:23,970
I will not say that this list is 100 percent correct because in any patient, at any time, something could happen and it is a good specimen.

151
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:28,410
But for the most part, those are not good specimens if you go to the left hand side.

152
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:35,520
We have a list of good specimens, is a lot of tissues on here bronchial washings and other fluids from the body CSF de Cuba.

153
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:42,990
This ulcers, which are full of bacteria and you all know what to Hubertus Ulcer, is like a bed sore.

154
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:48,990
OK, so you can go down the list and these are all good specimens generally.

155
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:55,110
There's always going to be exceptions, though, and whether you're working in the laboratory,

156
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:58,140
working in infection prevention or working in infectious diseases,

157
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:06,960
whatever it is, there's always going to be exceptions and you talk it over with the care provider or the laboratory, whichever it is.

158
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:13,380
Yeah. And come to an agreement about what you're what it would be appropriate.

159
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:23,290
OK. Going on. So here we go, specimen collection and transport, and we have special techniques for posterity.

160
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:31,700
OK. Whether it's difficile or Clostridium infection of tissue, so if it's food poisoning, you suspect we're all specimens for food poisoning.

161
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:35,920
Does it matter whether it's Clostridium or not, they're going to go to state public health lab?

162
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:40,690
OK? The clinical labs in the hospitals do not do food poisoning.

163
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:49,090
OK, so it always goes to the food poisoning specimen would go to the state, must stay refrigerated at 4°C.

164
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:58,630
And if you suspect botulism from the patient's history, from the patients, how the patient is acting, how the patient is looking and so on.

165
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:07,060
Please, please, please put that on the test request suspect Clostridium botulinum because you will save a lot of work.

166
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:11,500
You may save someone's life in the laboratory.

167
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:18,130
Then we have Clostridium difficile colitis, which unfortunately is very common, requires liquid or on form stools.

168
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:25,360
Labs will not work it up if the stool is formed. That is not diarrhea has to be a diarrheal stool.

169
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,590
And here we're looking for a detection of the toxin. We're not looking to identify the organism.

170
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:36,700
We're just looking for the toxin. A number of different tasks that can be molecular assays that can be culture assays.

171
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:42,700
They can be immuno acids. A lot of different assays for Clostridium difficile.

172
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,700
Yeah. At Beaumont, we used a two step testing process.

173
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:56,480
We screened with an EIA for the common antigen, which is the G H and the toxin, and then we confirmed it with a toxin specific test.

174
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:07,280
Going on to the next slide. Well, okay, so we can't just use our routine blood, chocolate and EMT or or other gram negative auger.

175
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:14,060
We've got to use special media that is kept under anaerobic conditions for anaerobic

176
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:19,190
cultures and needs to be fed freshly prepared or less than two weeks old.

177
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:26,090
And it needs to be. If you're buying commercially produced media, it's pressure reduced so that oxygen is not in there,

178
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:30,590
and the packaging keeps the oxygen out until you open up the packaging.

179
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:39,850
Most places keep their anaerobic media in an anaerobic refrigerator in the anaerobic chamber.

180
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:47,080
So here are some common anaerobic media we've got anaerobic blood sugar can be prepared as you see,

181
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:51,610
but it's it's reduced them to get all the oxygen out.

182
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:57,250
I mean, it's not fair to the media for isolation of a wide variety of different anaerobic bacteria.

183
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:05,170
We have baby batteries by less filling, and it's sort of a differential for a battery's fragile x group.

184
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:12,460
If it's growing and has a brown precipitate around the colonies, that's presumptive identification of batteries prejudice.

185
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:15,970
We have Elk v legs, Kanneh-Mason Bank Bison Blood Auger.

186
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:23,740
It's a Brousseau logger base with some antibiotics in it, and that's selective who are prone to tell him that what is species thinking?

187
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:28,870
Once again, if you're looking inside the body and may be in a deep wound,

188
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:34,540
you might could have a lot of different bacteria there because it's a very common in the body.

189
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:40,120
So this would help us narrow down the organisms that you have to look at.

190
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:50,200
Then we have paper or anaerobic phenyl ethyl alcohol logger, and that is selective for inhibiting and 10 gram negative bacteria.

191
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,500
It also inhibits the swarming of some Clostridium species,

192
00:21:53,500 --> 00:22:01,260
so you can actually work with single colonies and not worry that one organism has swarmed over another organism.

193
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:09,190
But we have egg yolk culture that's very common. It's nonselective, which means just about everything will grow on it.

194
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:17,020
You can, but you can determine less of the nose and lips activity, which is important when you're looking for Clostridia and Fusobacterium.

195
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:27,700
OK, and then Cafe, which is used for Clostridium difficile selected for Clostridium difficile.

196
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:31,830
Going on to the next slide. Okay. How we process these questions.

197
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:37,870
Well, if you're looking to do a culture for anaerobic bacteria,

198
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:47,260
you should process them in an anaerobic chamber if you process them aerobically as soon as the plates are inoculated,

199
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:57,100
they have to go into a anaerobic environment. OK, so you and take the specimen out of the transport tube, swab it or distributed on as many places.

200
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:05,830
Necessary Arabic plates would go into a CO2 incubator. Anaerobic plates are going into an area where we can compare most places.

201
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:11,380
Almost all labs that I'm aware of due there are set ups for anaerobic bacteria in an anaerobe chamber.

202
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,940
I've got a picture of one here.

203
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:22,420
So you can put your arms in and gloves and use gloves, or just try to just put your arms in and you can work that in the aerobic chamber.

204
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:29,290
There's the gas mixture in there, which is 90 percent nitrogen, five to 10 percent hydrogen, and then the rest is CO2.

205
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:33,220
So you have that anaerobic environment so you can open up the play to do whatever work.

206
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:36,430
You're not going to kill off any anaerobic bacteria.

207
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:44,650
And then if you have a computer in there or your incubator has that same gas mixture in it, the bacteria should grow very well.

208
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:51,100
So the next slide, I hope yes, this is one type of an anaerobic incubator anaerobic chamber.

209
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:55,480
So I don't know that you can see it, but they do have a small incubator in there,

210
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:59,960
but you put your hands in through the gloves and you can work in there.

211
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:06,940
Your media stays in there. You put your media in every few hours so that you don't run out of media and it stays in there and it's there.

212
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:09,940
It's all reduced for when you need to use it.

213
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:17,350
And then if anything, that's in a tube can be kept long as it's kept tightly because you can incubate it in a regular incubator.

214
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:21,070
If it's a plate, it needs to go into an anaerobic incubator so you could take him out of there.

215
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:26,530
If there's not, you don't have a big enough anaerobic incubator in there and put it into a separate anaerobic

216
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:35,320
incubator where you can have Mingus factors that incubate them that way in a regular incubator.

217
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:41,830
So here's an example of someone working in the anaerobic chamber, you can see her hands are in gloves.

218
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:45,910
So see over here. Yeah, and she's got the media over here.

219
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:54,460
She's got rare. She's got everything in there that she could possibly need. And then this is an anaerobic system.

220
00:24:54,460 --> 00:25:00,640
This is the anoxia that system, and it's just one of several. I'm not pushing this over some other type.

221
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:06,670
But just as an example, so you inoculate your place, you put them into the anaerobic jaws,

222
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:13,600
you hook them up to this piece of equipment and it keeps putting in fresh anaerobic atmosphere.

223
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:19,060
So it keeps them in a state where, where, where you can use that easily and they'll grow easily,

224
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:23,380
and then you can put the whole system because it needs to be incubated.

225
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:29,400
But the whole system and unique, bitter.

226
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:37,650
OK, so with them, yeah, and it will be played with general let them grow for 48 hours before we open up the jars.

227
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:42,330
And then what do we see or smell when we open up the jars?

228
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:49,680
I don't think the word foul or odor is strong enough. They stink, but that's where they are.

229
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:53,940
If you see sulfur granules, that might be an to analyzes of.

230
00:25:53,940 --> 00:26:03,330
If you use the specific media for Prevotella or Porphyromonas, you may see fluorescence if you put the plate under a long, wavy light.

231
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:08,300
So that would tell you it's a appropriate for most.

232
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:15,320
So that's for macroscopic exam, and these are what the silver brain might look like if you were to gram stain it,

233
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:19,370
so a sulfur brand we might see with an actual mice's infection.

234
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:24,530
There is a silver granule and you can see all the polyps around it.

235
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:28,970
They're not happy that that sulfur Grandal is there going on.

236
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:33,380
And here's an example I said Prove it, teller Porphyromonas will fluoresce red.

237
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:38,240
Here's an example if you have this medium and you put it near a fluorescent light,

238
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:44,540
it wolf the risk and you can say, Oh, that's private, tell for a notice and the medical students are standing by.

239
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:51,110
You will see first. You know that.

240
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:56,610
So I've already talked a little bit about direct detection, a I mean, give you some more here so we can do antigen detection.

241
00:26:56,610 --> 00:27:06,620
But, you know, antigens antigen detection does not detect it at all as a low enough number as a molecular assay.

242
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:16,960
OK, so it's more like a first or first level, so we can do it via a molecular to detect C. difficile, which is the most leads to an antigen first.

243
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:22,010
If it's negative, so go ahead and do a molecular process work very well.

244
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:29,420
It just depends on how much toxin is present, which test will be will be used to detect it.

245
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:33,740
Also very important for direct detection is the gram stain.

246
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:40,190
I've talked a lot about the gram said. I cannot overemphasize how important it is.

247
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:46,790
It really gives you the first impression of what might be important in this infection or not an infection.

248
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:50,600
You can tell this bacteria. You can tell if it's white blood cells.

249
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:57,330
If the patient's immunocompromised, there may not be hardly any white blood cells, but you may see a lot of bacteria.

250
00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:00,050
So gravity is tremendously important.

251
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:05,510
And also very important is that everybody in the lab does it the same way because if they don't do it the same way,

252
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:10,240
the results won't be uniform across the entire spectrum.

253
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:16,600
So if you see a mixed morphologies gram positive consequence of the drugs gram negative rods gram negative crossing that

254
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:25,600
may indicate an anaerobic infection because so many more bacterial Morfa types may be involved in an anaerobic infection.

255
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:34,240
So if you have a positive gram stain and a negative culture, it could indicate a problem and that problem might be poor.

256
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:39,740
Transport was transposon, was transported in the wrong kind of transport media, or it took too long to get to the laboratory.

257
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:51,280
It could be too much exposure to air during processing when you put that specimen on the media and streak it out, putting in costumes and so on.

258
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:58,000
The anaerobic system could fail. We've had that happen before, and it means that you need to get probably a new anaerobic system for that out.

259
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,240
Too old, hopefully not bad media because you need a quality control.

260
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,760
All your media, or maybe even an inhibition by antibiotics patient was put on many,

261
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:12,380
many antibiotics very early, and you're not going to be able to grow whatever's there.

262
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,370
Yes, go ahead.

263
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:22,760
So let's talk a little bit about her gramps that I just mentioned the most important gram positive organisms anaerobic Clostridium is number one.

264
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:26,840
OK, Clostridium big gram positive rod.

265
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:34,010
Not those little narrow, thin thanks to the mice's gram positive maybe branch.

266
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:38,270
So you could see him come off like that. And sometimes they're even beaded.

267
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:45,050
OK, but if you see a thin branching gram positive, I think I put on a license and then Propionibacterium.

268
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:53,900
And these are just there's nothing unique about Propionibacterium, except they make these clusters of cells called burden bird's nest.

269
00:29:53,900 --> 00:30:00,590
And if you see that you do say, Hey, maybe that's a piece or something.

270
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:08,480
OK, going, I know this is Fusobacterium and it is a gram negative fairly long back to him with pointed ends.

271
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:14,510
And so if you see that maybe a few bacteria in this cut in this specimen and the ones

272
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:19,160
that are being shown here to you are primarily from a culture because we see no other,

273
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:24,620
they're pure. There's no white cells and so on. So this is Fusobacterium.

274
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:30,860
The next one is a Clostridium gram positive short rods.

275
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:40,310
Now can we call a cluster? You know, all we can say is good or positive drugs.

276
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:48,340
And then here we have a ton of bases, and it is lots thinner, maybe a little a lot longer than a plus trillion.

277
00:30:48,340 --> 00:31:04,090
And what you can see the brand there. And when you see something like this like this or over here, gram positive rods branching things to the mice's.

278
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:13,180
So now we've got Graham saying we have set of culture and as usual, what do you some nonselective media and some selective media.

279
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:19,570
So nonselective will be blood, who will be an articulate over of the media.

280
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:26,440
Might be Bibi Lite can be PR. There's a wide variety of different types of media that can be used.

281
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:31,270
And some of the media that you select depends on where the specimen originated.

282
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:41,410
OK. Incubation conditions Thirty five to thirty seven degrees for at least 48 hours before you

283
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:46,690
open up the plates in an anaerobic atmosphere so you don't look at them in twenty four hours,

284
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:54,430
you don't expect any result at twenty four hours. Now I will tell you that the laboratories do try the microbes do and try and maintain that.

285
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:59,590
However, if our friendly ID physicians come down and say, Please,

286
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:04,210
I dont know what to do with this patient, can't you just take a quick look at this culture?

287
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:12,550
They may take it into an anaerobic chamber, open it up and say, This is what I'm saying, but I can't do anything else until 48 hours.

288
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:15,550
So after 48 hours, you can open up the plates on the bench,

289
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:20,320
not in the animal chamber and do whatever work you need to do on them and put them back in the inner tube.

290
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:24,550
But not you can't open them up to air before 48 hours.

291
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:33,820
The appearance of the colonies will vary depending on the kind of media that they're growing on, and I've gone over this a couple of days ago.

292
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:44,500
So what do we how do we identify them? So we first we look at the primary culture plates and we look to see, are they mixed infections?

293
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:48,790
Are there Arabs and Arabs present? And we don't know what.

294
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:53,620
By the time we open these up at 48 hours, we'll know what's going on the Arabic culture.

295
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:56,320
We'll have some idea what's going on, the Arabic culture.

296
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:03,040
So sometimes we use dissecting scopes to look at very small colonies on the plates because a lot of the animals don't grow very fast.

297
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:10,150
Some of them grow pretty rapidly, but some of them don't. We can look at and identify different Morford types.

298
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:16,180
So a long gram positive rod versus a short fat gram positive rod.

299
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:20,920
If they're both president equal numbers, we should probably identify both of those.

300
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:28,030
So it just depends how much is on the plate and the type of specimen that it's coming from.

301
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:37,510
So gram stain subculture, if you subculture, you're going to subculture both to aerobic and anaerobic culture media because we know that Arabic,

302
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:46,200
that turkey &lsquo, anaerobic, we think of all the inner bacteria. So and you can also do pyramid plate for anaerobic bacteria,

303
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:53,110
anaerobic Bon Iver with antibiotic discovery that Kanneh-Mason catalyze a disc of vancomycin that is going to close the disc.

304
00:33:53,110 --> 00:34:00,070
And this susceptibility to these three drugs can be used for identification, but not for susceptibility,

305
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:08,290
because they're not being set up in a standardized manner with a standardized inoculum, and they can also do a tolerance test.

306
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:16,690
Are these true anaerobic bacteria? So if we subculture and chocolate already incubated in CO2, do they grow?

307
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:22,060
Do they grow a very small amount? Do they grow the same amount as our anaerobic media?

308
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:30,030
So we look at that for air talent? Yes.

309
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:36,220
Let me say before I go any further, I'm hoping by the end of the term, I can lecture without a mask on just saying,

310
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:42,490
OK, I'm going on with presumptive identifications, so be fragiles, be fragile.

311
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:48,940
Screw this number of organisms and be fragile. This group very, very important pathogens.

312
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:54,610
But if you grow them on baby bio batteries, bile is still in water.

313
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:59,890
Some of them will hydrolyzed the escolha masculine in the media and turn black.

314
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:06,280
And that helps you identify them. And then we go down to Prevotella and Porphyromonas.

315
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:10,630
They stink foul odor as strong if they stink.

316
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:16,180
Many of them are pigmented, black or brown or red, and so the residents may even fluorescent.

317
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,910
I think I saw that before and then Fusobacterium.

318
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:25,450
If you look at the graphs in that Stephin Gram negative rod with pointy edges, and when you see that you could almost say,

319
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:29,680
Hey, I think that's probably a fusion of bacteria, but we have to go on and identify it.

320
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,550
And these oftentimes fluorescent chartreuse color also.

321
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:45,400
So anybody who said micro is boring to talk about, OK, so more presumptive identification potential plus produce plus radium is always a pathogen.

322
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:51,490
Always, always, always. You can never ignore it. So it forms spores. It is.

323
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:59,050
Lecithin is positive on your government, which means that the colony grows and it produces kind of a sediment in the in the media and you can see it.

324
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:04,660
And if you put it on blood on it oftentimes preventions that often has a double zone of hemolysis.

325
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:09,310
So it has an alpha hemolytic zone and a baby hemolytic zone.

326
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:16,150
And then at 10:00 am I see there are the gram positive rods at branch and they don't make any spores definitive.

327
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:29,100
I'd call it off. MALDI-TOF is my friend. OK, susceptibility testing, it's not done routinely for Arabs.

328
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:34,420
OK, you need different types of culture, media, different systems for anaerobic bacteria.

329
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:40,510
Of course, they need to be incubated anaerobic like so many labs do not do anaerobic susceptibility,

330
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:46,090
then send it off to a reference lab that does do anaerobic susceptibility testing.

331
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:54,400
So but it is necessary to do it to determine patterns of susceptibility to new agents as they come on the market,

332
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:03,190
and also to know what the susceptibility is of organisms in your area of the country that you or your city or wherever you draw your specimens from.

333
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:11,950
Geographic area We can assist in patient management, but we really no known the resistance patterns.

334
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:19,880
For many, important anaerobic bacteria are known, so we know if we have a beef right, it's going to be resistant to this class of drugs.

335
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:24,190
We have an active license. It's going to be resistant to this class of drugs.

336
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:29,320
So what we can do at that first general identification of the genus that helps the

337
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:35,320
physicians tremendously to know what type of antibiotics to put the patient on.

338
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:40,900
So also is it has the patient been treated with animals previously, particularly recently?

339
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:45,340
Now how serious is that infection? If it's a brain abscess, it's going to get treated.

340
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:53,050
If it's a surface wound, well, let's clean it up and see what happens. So it just depends on the type of infection it is.

341
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:58,250
There's a prosthetic device. That prosthetic device has to be removed.

342
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:06,710
OK, so susceptibility testing we could do after dilution where you have the antibiotic,

343
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:16,160
a different antibiotic dose in each plate, which takes a long time to make up, but you can test several organisms on each plate.

344
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,220
You can do a macro broth dilution in tubes.

345
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:28,160
You can do microbe broth solution, make or try to trade, or you can do retest for labs that don't generally do susceptibility.

346
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:32,000
Testing for anaerobic bacteria that eat is the way to go.

347
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:39,920
Because if they just need a quick can I treat the patient with this drug, they can make a sterile suspension,

348
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:45,110
put it on standby for me and drop that ether strip and in 48 hours to do the interpretation.

349
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:56,300
And they would be able to tell. But that doesn't give them a whole range of drugs, which you would need in case it is not susceptible.

350
00:38:56,300 --> 00:39:13,040
OK. Let's go on. So an exam type question, which patient samples acceptable for anaerobic culture throat swab, voided urine, cough, sputum or CSF?

351
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:20,560
Dog, dog. Yes, you are right. Anyone have any questions about that?

352
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:32,230
So this will have an explorer, won't they? And we don't see many urine and you're urine infections with anaerobic hospital,

353
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:36,820
no in want deep deep specimen, OK, because it's been that's coughed up.

354
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:41,670
It's going to pick up all the bacteria all the way up the respiratory tract and CSF.

355
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:51,300
I would hate to see a CSF, but it is if it is acceptable for anaerobic culture.

356
00:39:51,300 --> 00:40:04,820
Another one. What are some initial indications of an anaerobic infection?

357
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:10,040
No one. But what if it's not on the outside?

358
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,840
You can't smell them.

359
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:20,570
Could be a lot of swelling, could be a lot of white cells because of what the patient has, how the patient was injured, if there was an injury.

360
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:30,060
So there's a lot of things that that need to be determined, but smell is a good answer.

361
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:37,450
And that's it for Arabs. It's impressive that right? Yeah.

362
00:40:37,450 --> 00:41:17,610
Yeah. Absolutely. OK, we're going to take a couple of minute break here while I stop this one and start the next one.

363
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:27,410
OK. OK.

364
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:37,100
This is called The ABCs of Gram Negative Resistance, and this is a talk I put together a couple of years ago because there were so many people in and

365
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:52,020
around southeastern Michigan and other places who didn't know a lot about antimicrobial resistance.

366
00:41:52,020 --> 00:42:04,580
So. CDC said hospitals are the major source of antibiotic resistant infections, and that is absolutely correct.

367
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:11,600
There are more than two million people in the United States get drug resistant infections annually.

368
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:20,690
About 23000 will die and they are becoming the infections are becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics.

369
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:28,520
When Dr. Tom Frieden was head of CDC is not head of CDC anymore, but when he was, he said he was on CBS News.

370
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,020
And he said if we're not careful,

371
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:36,740
the medicine chest will be empty when we go there to look for a lifesaving antibiotic for someone with a deadly infection.

372
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:41,360
If we act now, we can preserve these medications while we continue to work on lifesaving

373
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:47,510
medications and just reading that gives me pause here when I think how difficult,

374
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:56,660
how resistant some antibiotic, some bacterial infections are and nothing is left to treat some of.

375
00:42:56,660 --> 00:43:09,150
So we have become too lean. So there was a report several years ago by the Infectious Diseases Society of America, IDSA reported an article.

376
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:17,510
Bedbugs need drugs. And what they talked about in this article was new pathogens and increasing resistance are appearing.

377
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:23,240
New classes of antimicrobials with novel mechanisms of action are and are urgently needed.

378
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:31,250
We needed him yesterday. We need him last month. New approaches to increasing the effectiveness of traditional antimicrobials are urgently needed.

379
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:38,960
We are failing as a country, as a society, as a nation worldwide.

380
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:49,180
We are failing in this area. So this is all day, but hasn't gotten any better resistant strain spread rapidly.

381
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:56,160
Look at this from 1980 to 2000. Look at what happened to the nurse in the blue circles.

382
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:06,630
And it has not stopped very which are the library squares that have gone up and for acquittal in resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa has gone up.

383
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:14,920
And this this is just touching the number of bacteria that are antimicrobial resistance.

384
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:23,460
So this chart goes in the other direction, new systemic antibiotics approved by the FDA.

385
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:34,480
Look at that. The numbers have consistently gone down because one of the major reasons and I'm not against the drug companies, believe me,

386
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:43,220
is that they can't make enough money on new antibiotics because of the amount of testing that has to be done before they can be brought to market.

387
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:50,290
But people are dying. So this is just a charge CDC put out.

388
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:53,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah. CDC was an emerging infectious diseases.

389
00:44:53,860 --> 00:45:04,780
It has gotten worse. You can see if you look at the United States, the worst problem is in the northeastern part of the country.

390
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:10,930
I am proud to say that where I'm from in Nebraska, they don't have as much of a problem.

391
00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:16,720
But there aren't as many people either, except for about two cities, Omaha and Lincoln.

392
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:22,450
In Michigan, we do have a problem with drug resistance, as do all the states around us.

393
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:30,260
And if you go to other countries, look at South America, their problems are even worse as our problems in Europe.

394
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:34,460
So why do we test for bail at Macy's? OK?

395
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:39,080
The break points that we use, which are being revised constantly,

396
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:46,100
do not accurately or reliably detect the new beta lactamase and new beta lactamase are showing up all the time.

397
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:55,460
So while we may have susceptibility that says if you have a mistake greater than two, it's resistant.

398
00:45:55,460 --> 00:46:01,520
But what about new beta lactamase is what they can do. So we have a problem with our breakpoint.

399
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:08,300
We have a problem with crack therapy. People want to put patients on therapy before they have the susceptibility.

400
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:15,990
Infection control needs better information to control infection spread throughout institutions.

401
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:25,930
More on be liked, Mrs., we have a number of different kinds of lactamase as we have a penicillin cephalosporin ace carbapenems carbapenems,

402
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:33,660
our last great drug group are drugs. We have broad spectrum beta lactamase, an extended spectrum bill and MRS.

403
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:39,780
So the ones that we generally detect with already are blocked. Most test in the laboratory.

404
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:52,590
SBL but it may not detect all these. OK, so here this chart, I have shown it so many times.

405
00:46:52,590 --> 00:47:00,270
These are just the common bailout places in the bacteria. And you can see Class A, Class B, Class C in Class C that I've already talked about.

406
00:47:00,270 --> 00:47:05,910
And I think I've already shown you this. This chart here in Bush did it years and years and years ago,

407
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:11,100
where broad spectrum beta lactamase is on the left, which are in class in Isbell's are in class.

408
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:23,700
They also Class B's in the metallic be the left masses in class here, the axes in Class D or the axis.

409
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:29,220
So how do we detect? Why am I talking about this, we need to detect emerging resistance.

410
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:38,880
So the gram negative bacteria have the most diffuse types of resistance to antimicrobials.

411
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:44,820
So we see new resistance types in Acinetobacter baumannii Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

412
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:49,710
Then we have our Isbell's, which are all over the place with our bacteria and then the carbapenems.

413
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:57,740
Most serious, last great group of drugs. And we've got resistance to it.

414
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:04,150
So why are they spreading? Well, the list goes on and on.

415
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:09,700
They might be part of the resistance, might be acquired by a plasmid that's being spread.

416
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:18,430
There can be antibiotics, selective pressure. So and there can be suboptimal detection in the laboratory.

417
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:22,150
We're not always right. Unfortunately, we would like to be.

418
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:28,600
So look at this first one in that group carbapenem, I see, is maybe in the susceptible range.

419
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:33,260
So even if it is resistant, it might be reported as susceptible.

420
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:43,570
Now CSI is working to try and resolve this issue, but it may take many more years of study before it can be taken care of.

421
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:51,620
The SBL test may be positive, or they may be negative breakpoint tests, maybe in that they may not go down far enough.

422
00:48:51,620 --> 00:49:02,940
They may not have the right ethic to actually detect the breakpoint for some drug bug combinations, and you can just see expert systems maybe poor.

423
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:09,210
Test interpretation really requires vigilance, and yes, I like to do things automated on equipment.

424
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:15,090
You can do so much more with less personnel and so on. But it's not always right and you have to have technologies.

425
00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:23,220
And I love the technologists in all the labs. I think they're fabulous. They work so hard, but they can't pick up everything that says, I mean, real.

426
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:28,380
Look into this little bit further. They're too overworked. So we need better systems.

427
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:32,610
And then once again, there's no standardized way to detect an APS-C or an Indian one.

428
00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:41,930
There's absolutely no standardized way. So some definitions, what is a narrow spectrum beta lactamase,

429
00:49:41,930 --> 00:49:51,400
it's active against gram negative or gram positive bacteria only, and that drug narrow spectrum would be penicillin.

430
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:56,170
Broad spectrum beta lactamase agents are active against Gram negative gram positives,

431
00:49:56,170 --> 00:50:01,780
and this includes ampicillin, the first and the first generation suffered several forms.

432
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:05,790
Severe storms have about four generations.

433
00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:15,660
So what are extended bailout extended spectrum beta like to agencies have enhanced activity against gram negative and gram positive bacteria.

434
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:22,080
They are active against the third and fourth generation cephalosporins. They carboxylic Naruto penicillins.

435
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:26,220
So we're getting more specific here and better activity.

436
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:29,520
And then the FDA is an extended step on the elections.

437
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:37,830
These are enzyme produced enzymes produced by gram negative bacteria that destroy certain of the extended spectrum beta lactamase agents,

438
00:50:37,830 --> 00:50:42,210
including the third generation cephalosporins, so they can destroy the first,

439
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:47,310
second and third generation surface for which only leaves the fourth generation.

440
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:55,380
There may be another mechanism that destroys more generations, such as the enhanced selective type of resistance.

441
00:50:55,380 --> 00:51:06,800
So then we have extended spectrum beta lactamase. And these are necessary for ESBL producing organisms.

442
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:11,600
So these are the ESB producing organisms are the antibacterial ACA in particular

443
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:18,890
E. coli clip feel and particularly Klebsiella pneumoniae and produce parabolas.

444
00:51:18,890 --> 00:51:27,110
Now there are other others in the in the in the recreation center, back in general, back there and we know all these songs that are filled.

445
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:36,100
They can certainly have these resistance factors, but they don't have this commonly as E. coli club and produce mirabilis.

446
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:42,580
So other less common SBL producing organisms are Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

447
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:46,930
Fascinating bacterial mani, which is very it can be very, very, very difficult to treat.

448
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:54,100
I've seen so many isolates that are not susceptible to anything.

449
00:51:54,100 --> 00:52:03,060
And then less common, Eremos had dropped the Burkholderia cepacia, which is very resistant also and very old color.

450
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:08,550
So here are main families, obviously, although I'm not asking you to memorize these main families or the sub families,

451
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:12,870
but I'm just showing you how common they are. So just look at the boxes.

452
00:52:12,870 --> 00:52:18,660
There's two families in the boxes the choose the the tents, and there's three two different types of those.

453
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:31,600
So if you go to the Thames three and four, there's 160 different types of east deals that they can cause.

454
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:37,870
So all of this large group of extended spectrum beta lactamase is the terms and the ships.

455
00:52:37,870 --> 00:52:42,610
I appreciate them are plasmid mediated. What is the importance of that?

456
00:52:42,610 --> 00:52:49,060
Their plasmid mediated they give that resistance can jump around, can be spread from one organism to another organism?

457
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:54,310
Very. It's like an STD. Just think of that plasmid spread like an STD.

458
00:52:54,310 --> 00:52:59,170
OK? They can also have clawbacks. You totally can have a K-1 plasmid.

459
00:52:59,170 --> 00:53:05,470
It's a chromosomal below act based, and it can also be found in the other bacteria shown there in the next one center.

460
00:53:05,470 --> 00:53:07,900
Back to Sara Sidner in our political system,

461
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:16,450
a huge cause of diarrhea and wound infections by various species in the previous five years that we have examined,

462
00:53:16,450 --> 00:53:28,000
KCTCS stands for separate taxing, which is a very good third generation cephalosporin, except that there is an SPL that will destroy the drug.

463
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,590
So it's term derived from chromosomal enzymes.

464
00:53:30,590 --> 00:53:38,320
There's over 65 different types of C checksums, and they're present in antibacterial across the spectrum within our bacteria,

465
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:41,860
AKC origin also and the programmer's multifamily.

466
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:54,690
And that is another very, very, very difficult bug to treat because it is so resistant and so many of our CRF patients have senator from a small area.

467
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:59,400
Then we have the RCMP also in hydrolyzed. OK, Cicilline and Darren Clarke Cicilline.

468
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:07,330
And those are the Oxy. Those bills are in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter.

469
00:54:07,330 --> 00:54:17,070
So. What happens with the all media resistance?

470
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:25,060
This is going to work. Know it's not working, OK, so we're if it's easy all media resistance, it can affect the penicillins.

471
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:32,830
The cephalosporins and the beta lactam beta lactam inhibitor combinations, some of them may be affected.

472
00:54:32,830 --> 00:54:38,770
Some of them may not be. The inhibitor generally stops the resistance.

473
00:54:38,770 --> 00:54:45,730
And what it's supposed to be doing here is a click. It's supposed to be showing you which ones are resistant, but it's not going to happen.

474
00:54:45,730 --> 00:54:52,450
So, but when you come down the list, the Mountbatten's work better than the beta lactam inhibitor.

475
00:54:52,450 --> 00:54:59,200
Combinations of beta lactam inhibitor combinations work better than just the beta lactamase alone without the inhibitor combination,

476
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:09,570
and then the carbapenems are at the top of the line and they should take care of the sudmalis and asked me to hopefully.

477
00:55:09,570 --> 00:55:11,340
So here we go, a little bit better.

478
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:20,730
What happens with the SBL immediate resistance, if you've got any ESBL producing organism, everything in people be worthless against that organism.

479
00:55:20,730 --> 00:55:25,560
So your chemicals and your sulfur spawns except for severe accident or soutphommasane.

480
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:34,170
And the fourth generation stuff going forward, the combination Badylak Dental will work, but you've lost as train now.

481
00:55:34,170 --> 00:55:42,210
OK, if we go down to outcome of serious bill infections when treated with a third generation self was born.

482
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:51,150
And this is showing you the mercy of the organism and the failure rate and how many died within 14 days of bacteremia.

483
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:55,410
And this is a study published in the journal for Micro several years ago.

484
00:55:55,410 --> 00:56:03,030
Unfortunately, it has not gotten much better. OK, so the theme I see was eight hundred percent failure on six patients.

485
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:09,180
Thirty three percent died. If the message was for two thirds of the patients were resistant, none died.

486
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:13,800
Something of their mercy was to. None of them died within 14 days.

487
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:17,820
If it was less than one, 18 percent died.

488
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:23,580
Two out of 11 died within 14 days of bacteremia. And this is this was Dr. Parrish.

489
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:25,630
And just looking at he was a Hopkins.

490
00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:35,100
I really don't remember where he was looking at what happened with this group of patients and then published those results.

491
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:44,310
So which drugs can be used reliably against the ESB are producing antibacterial carbapenems usually work very, very well.

492
00:56:44,310 --> 00:56:51,890
There are more side effects and they're more expensive. But if it's a person's life, either you've got the infection, you're going to treat it.

493
00:56:51,890 --> 00:57:01,980
Use carbapenem. You mean Panamerican 1.10 or possibly some of the combination drugs might work so potato, perhaps as a case in target cycling,

494
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:08,160
but not for price Morales and maybe even earlier kind of, but suffered suffer pain will not work.

495
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:14,620
Generally, when you go to the third generation or fourth generation, several several 70mm is a fourth generation cephalosporin.

496
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:25,110
You think that should work on your inner bacteria, but it does not work on in on Proteus mirabilis.

497
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:30,990
And so if we go on to the next slide detection of air skills, there's three ways to detect the Isbell's.

498
00:57:30,990 --> 00:57:35,820
We can do screening tests and then confirmatory tests for a positive screen.

499
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:42,060
We can just do confirmatory tests or we can just lower the break points.

500
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:48,870
So some of the Beatles lactamase won't be active unless their activity is induced, so they may test is sensitive,

501
00:57:48,870 --> 00:57:56,820
but in the presence of the antibiotic for a period of time, they start producing the enzyme that breaks down the drug.

502
00:57:56,820 --> 00:58:01,480
And then of course, it fails.

503
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:12,350
So most labs have gone to screening tests and confirmatory tests because just lowering the break points is not good across the board.

504
00:58:12,350 --> 00:58:21,440
So screening your screen, there's less work and it's less expensive, but the advantages and disadvantages are sensitivities less than 100 percent.

505
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:28,130
We're looking for high level sensitivity. We have delayed confirmation and you report those positive screens.

506
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:32,720
There's no confirmation on whether or not you should report a positive screen.

507
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:37,310
So screening is not the best way to go.

508
00:58:37,310 --> 00:58:44,000
So the question also comes up, why is it important to do special tests and follow these complex rules for reporting Gillespie as well?

509
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:51,830
Bottom line is we want the right answer out there. We don't want to put out the wrong answer and patients fail.

510
00:58:51,830 --> 00:58:53,870
So in vitro tests may be misleading.

511
00:58:53,870 --> 00:59:04,160
They're not always right, and we may have to do some some kind of confirmatory working, it may say susceptible in the MRC test.

512
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:10,790
But when you put the drug in the patient with that infection, it may not work. There are many types of spills.

513
00:59:10,790 --> 00:59:14,600
Many people don't know this. There's many, many different types. If there's a chance.

514
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:20,240
One hundred thirty types of the Thames 50 at least 50 of the shelves in the city of Sands at least 30.

515
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:23,240
But I bet that number is greater than 50 now,

516
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:29,390
and there can be treatment failures in the worst of courses with bacteria or a central nervous system infection.

517
00:59:29,390 --> 00:59:35,480
When the patient is treated with the third generation cephalosporin, that should work and the patient fails.

518
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:38,990
And then, of course, just to make life more interesting,

519
00:59:38,990 --> 00:59:48,870
there can be no serial outbreaks due to highly resistant organisms such as the ESB, all producers.

520
00:59:48,870 --> 00:59:58,230
So how do we test, for instance, there to be elected basis? Well, we need to test every coli, every Klebsiella and every produce around us.

521
00:59:58,230 --> 01:00:02,700
When we see it, we have to test it for the SPL. That's the national guideline.

522
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:11,220
We can do a screen test to detect decreased susceptibility to the extended spectrum drugs and we can do.

523
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:15,840
Then we confirm that with a phenotypic test. And that's it.

524
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:22,470
Can you restore the beta lactam activity by giving a beta lactamase inhibitor such as clever like acid?

525
01:00:22,470 --> 01:00:28,860
So when you combine flatulent of gas with a beta last year, the Kivalina acid stops,

526
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:37,560
blocks the beta lactamase and the drug taking can can be used by to kill the bacteria so you can test it with and without the drug,

527
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:47,230
with and without fighting like acid and see if it's a phenotypic confirmation of a beta lactamase or SBL presence.

528
01:00:47,230 --> 01:00:54,850
Going on. So how do we report spills? This is the rule, and it hasn't changed since 2015.

529
01:00:54,850 --> 01:01:01,180
Strains of E. coli Klebsiella species and produce mammals that produce ESB of any

530
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:06,160
clinically resistant to therapy with penicillin surfaces for the rest of them.

531
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:10,960
Despite apparent in vitro susceptibility to some of these agents.

532
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:19,120
So what do we do in the lab? We report confirmed ESB are producing strains as resistant to the drugs shown here.

533
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:31,920
All penicillins, all surface forms and as tritium. What about Beatle Lycans editor to?

534
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:40,980
So there's some drug combinations. We know that the weapons will not work and we just report them as resistant.

535
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:47,890
Even if the test is susceptible in the patient, they may fail. So that would be from the penicillin ampicillin carbimazole.

536
01:01:47,890 --> 01:02:00,780
And there's also an epsilon and Type-R and the cephalosporins that are shown, as well as as three and the only more bacteria.

537
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:05,320
There are some that we don't don't just Ed resistant.

538
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:14,710
And then we follow Suicide Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute reporting rules for the and we don't automatically call them resistant.

539
01:02:14,710 --> 01:02:19,420
If it's a beta lactamase producing, we test them and see whether or not they are actually resistant.

540
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:25,030
And we also test the Baitul active inhibitor combinations that I was talking about before that the drug,

541
01:02:25,030 --> 01:02:36,180
plus the beta lactam inhibitors, see if it removes any resistance. If that's the case, that drug is useful in the in vivo.

542
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:45,720
So if we go on there, we have the phenotypic confirmatory test and we can test the beta lactam shown here with and without

543
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:51,930
problematic as it applied to let it pass and once again removes or blocked that beta lactamase activity.

544
01:02:51,930 --> 01:02:58,390
So we test self attacks. Even then, self attacks in the pipeline of assets of testing, self testing with five gallon of gas and.

545
01:02:58,390 --> 01:03:15,290
And if the turbulent acid restores the resistance and restores the ability of the drug to block the growth of that organism, then it is an SPL.

546
01:03:15,290 --> 01:03:24,260
And once again, as documented in CSI. So here's a feel example of a confirmatory test positive for this field.

547
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:34,110
So do we have of testing, but that zone is would be considered measured across the center of the dust resistant.

548
01:03:34,110 --> 01:03:41,360
And here we have several taxane, which are very with a very small drug when we are globulin of acid to the disks.

549
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:44,390
So the second is each one with quite a lot of gas.

550
01:03:44,390 --> 01:03:50,610
You can see that the zone becomes much larger and these zone sizes are documented in the classified document.

551
01:03:50,610 --> 01:03:58,110
What you have to have for susceptibility and these are both susceptible and these are both resistant.

552
01:03:58,110 --> 01:04:09,990
So that's a confirmatory test for Isbell's. You can also do with an excess strip, so you don't have to do so much with discs.

553
01:04:09,990 --> 01:04:17,010
We are self-testing even self-testing with Kabul. And I guess you could say there's absolutely no zone of inhibition here with the self-testing.

554
01:04:17,010 --> 01:04:21,240
But when you add the club, you want to ask you get an emcee and you read a where it crosses the strip,

555
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:36,670
which would be right there at one microgram paramount. So and various companies have confirmatory tests, ESB panels and so on.

556
01:04:36,670 --> 01:04:42,160
So now let's talk about what also says about Klebsiella E. coli and protest matters.

557
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:46,840
And if you think about who tells the laboratory what to do, it's basically not CDC.

558
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:51,220
It's the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute in the College of American Pathologists.

559
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:55,990
College of American pathologists inspect the laboratories that the guidelines

560
01:04:55,990 --> 01:05:00,790
for how to do testing come from CLSA and the various manuals and all that.

561
01:05:00,790 --> 01:05:08,740
It's all coordinated through CSI so we can test the minimum inhibitory concentration for self-protection attacks,

562
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:13,780
even self-testing plus or minus equivalent if, as we've been talking about.

563
01:05:13,780 --> 01:05:20,860
And we need to see if we're doing an NYC test. Three doubling deletions decrease with either drug.

564
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:28,120
So if we have an NYC of eight six eight micrograms per mil of self-testing to inhibit or produce necessary,

565
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:34,270
either inhibit growth or just never necessary size zone and we are glad you're at eight.

566
01:05:34,270 --> 01:05:40,750
You get one microgram per now. So three doubling deletions one to two two to four four to eight.

567
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:44,620
That's three doubling dilution. So that is positive.

568
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:53,380
We can do that with a disc test also, and we have to see at least five millimeters on the increase with the final added.

569
01:05:53,380 --> 01:05:58,720
And so how do we report these SBL positive drugs?

570
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:04,900
You automatically built into your computer system, report resistance.

571
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:09,850
If it's still positive, they will be resistant to all penicillins.

572
01:06:09,850 --> 01:06:16,810
All selfless pawns in history, Anam and seal aside, periodically tweaks the guidelines,

573
01:06:16,810 --> 01:06:22,270
and so in 2010, they changed, they lowered the break points and that changed this somewhat.

574
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:33,160
Now we also have a different type of an SB I'll call the K1 and K1, if hyper produced, can cause a false positive SPL confirmatory test.

575
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:36,490
So now you even if you do have to have a K1, you won't be.

576
01:06:36,490 --> 01:06:45,460
It may not get an accurate all confirmatory test. Generally, the K ones do not hydrolyzed of testing.

577
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:51,730
So if you've got a positive self-testing test may have any SPL present,

578
01:06:51,730 --> 01:07:01,080
but a negative test is suggestive of Typekit production of the K1 enzyme, and I mentioned the K1 enzyme on a previous slide.

579
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:06,730
It's a type of an SBL.

580
01:07:06,730 --> 01:07:15,760
Then, of course, the list of types of these bills goes on, we have see them spells and these are common in many countries across Europe,

581
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:23,650
South America, the United States, in Asia and in many states. It may be very difficult to detect such testing.

582
01:07:23,650 --> 01:07:32,740
Most labs rely upon them as a fourth generation suffix for usually very active doesn't work well with exam spells.

583
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:33,910
So many misses there.

584
01:07:33,910 --> 01:07:41,650
Even if it's resistant, NRC might be less than one, so the patient might be given a drug thinking, Oh, this is going to work great, and then it fails.

585
01:07:41,650 --> 01:07:49,360
And the seven p.m. I see what should be close to, such as the more often greater than sixty four.

586
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:54,520
So we have problems with this enzyme, the CCTVs type enzyme.

587
01:07:54,520 --> 01:08:00,220
It can rapidly hydrolyzed sulfur taxing but not surprising,

588
01:08:00,220 --> 01:08:08,710
and many physicians may think that those two drugs are unless they're infectious disease that's in those two drugs are clearly use one.

589
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:12,830
You can use the other, whatever label for it. So.

590
01:08:12,830 --> 01:08:19,910
If it's a city exam, the organism will be better inhibited by Taser backed him than by five demented or so back 10.

591
01:08:19,910 --> 01:08:25,350
So you want to find a drug that's combined with Taser back to his doctor?

592
01:08:25,350 --> 01:08:34,010
And also when you're doing this susceptibility testing, these may not confirm with a suicide approved confirmatory test.

593
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:42,250
So what you should do is report these as resistant to self testing.

594
01:08:42,250 --> 01:08:58,680
So then. Let's go to Nancy's. And this is a molecular class based on amino acid sequences and then divided on functional characteristics.

595
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:05,670
These are AdBlock Plus C. Yeah, I'm not going to go into different angle classes if you want to know Google it.

596
01:09:05,670 --> 01:09:11,850
They're resistant to bail out masses and resistant. Excuse me, they're resistant to bailout mace inhibitors.

597
01:09:11,850 --> 01:09:24,420
And they hydrolyzed 10 and oxygen, which are two very, very good second generation be left in many, many organisms will produce Apsey a low level.

598
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:31,140
But if there was something that induces it, the enzyme to be yeah is induced.

599
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:43,510
It may produce it at a very high level you to. So inducible AFC bailout, Macy's, remember the words space?

600
01:09:43,510 --> 01:09:55,790
OK, Serratia marcescens. Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Providence, those are your peas, acrimonious Citra back to Florida II and Intravacc two species,

601
01:09:55,790 --> 01:10:01,210
those are your space organisms and they have inducible Beetle Act bases.

602
01:10:01,210 --> 01:10:10,150
Now you can also find them in Harmony and Morganelli, but the other ones are much more important.

603
01:10:10,150 --> 01:10:17,630
So in the space organisms, these are the drug classes that are generally resistant to these, the cephalosporin.

604
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:26,490
So the first, second and third generation cephalosporins suffices as three and penicillin in the combination drugs.

605
01:10:26,490 --> 01:10:28,680
And it's easy for me to stand here and say it,

606
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:38,210
it's much more difficult when they're trying and physicians are trying to find a drug to treat a patient that's got a critical infection.

607
01:10:38,210 --> 01:10:49,380
So what happens with NFC mediated resistance? Anybody know?

608
01:10:49,380 --> 01:10:55,110
And that carbapenems left, that's it. If it's an embassy.

609
01:10:55,110 --> 01:11:04,890
And that's serious, that's really serious. And some patients cannot take the carbapenems.

610
01:11:04,890 --> 01:11:08,650
Which leaves them with nothing to be treated with.

611
01:11:08,650 --> 01:11:18,490
So how often does this resistance emerge if there's an inducible beta lactamase and a third generation self was born is used?

612
01:11:18,490 --> 01:11:23,200
The risk is 20 to 25 percent, so four of your patients may fail.

613
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:28,900
The risk is higher in if the infections in the respiratory tract.

614
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:36,490
If the patient has neutropenia or if the patient has cystic fibrosis, then it's always much more serious if patients cystic fibrosis.

615
01:11:36,490 --> 01:11:53,400
The risk is lower if it's a urinary tract infection. So this is a sample, am I see from E. coli, which is a probable AMC producer, plasmid mediated?

616
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:59,970
And you look at the drugs that we would normally release the beta lactamase ampicillin resistant.

617
01:11:59,970 --> 01:12:07,860
All of these are resistant. No, excuse me. The first four episodes of a loss of testing and the vaccine are resistant to tasas resistant.

618
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:10,710
The patient may be able to be treated with 17.

619
01:12:10,710 --> 01:12:21,910
Cipro or independent doesn't leave much for a patient, especially if a patient has some sort of allergy to some of the drugs.

620
01:12:21,910 --> 01:12:27,010
And that tipped Taser and Missy is very, very high. I would not use that.

621
01:12:27,010 --> 01:12:38,320
So you're basically left with Cipro and any independent.

622
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:41,770
So what are the issues with plasmid mediated Dempsey?

623
01:12:41,770 --> 01:12:46,690
Well, anything that's plasmid media can be transferred much more rapidly than chromosome remediate.

624
01:12:46,690 --> 01:12:51,610
That's the first thing. So you may be a false susceptibility.

625
01:12:51,610 --> 01:12:57,490
Multiple types of drug resistance detection is always an issue.

626
01:12:57,490 --> 01:13:02,140
Infection control is going to go crazy with this if there's an outbreak in their institution,

627
01:13:02,140 --> 01:13:08,680
or are you going to semi outbreaks to patients who have these two patients on the same bug is an outbreak.

628
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:14,290
And then if the organisms also produce Isbell's, what will you treat with this?

629
01:13:14,290 --> 01:13:20,920
There is a lack of antibiotics, especially then of carbapenem resistant shows up also.

630
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:22,840
And then the resistance can, of course, be induced.

631
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:31,450
So if you've got a patient you're seeing or you're being conference on a patient that has plasma needed Dempsey,

632
01:13:31,450 --> 01:13:36,370
they can very easily also produce the Isbell's.

633
01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:47,200
And the organism may be carbapenem resistant, so it does not lead very much to treat within the bay the leftovers of antibiotics.

634
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:50,320
Then there can be higher level embassy production,

635
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:59,530
and that may occur if there's a mutation causing repression can occur when the organism is exposed to an inducing agent,

636
01:13:59,530 --> 01:14:05,650
causing resistance to be induced. This may be temporary or may not be temporary.

637
01:14:05,650 --> 01:14:14,860
It may be reversed by removal of the inducing agent, but you don't really know what that inducing agent is to get rid of it.

638
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:23,110
And it's really not a huge problem to list. The patient is treated with two big electrodes, one that inducer and one's a substrate for AMC.

639
01:14:23,110 --> 01:14:27,190
That's the ideal situation for resistance. You've got both of them.

640
01:14:27,190 --> 01:14:32,850
You've given both of the patient material up there.

641
01:14:32,850 --> 01:14:41,220
And we have to talk about repression, the repression that this means that are repressed occur spontaneously.

642
01:14:41,220 --> 01:14:48,600
We don't do anything to prosecute. But clearly their frequencies are shown about one in 10 of the six to 10 of the nine cells.

643
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:54,450
They may be subpopulations of the entire bacterial population that's present in the patient.

644
01:14:54,450 --> 01:15:01,770
So if they cell population, you knock off the susceptible ones, you're only left with this, this population.

645
01:15:01,770 --> 01:15:10,630
And so there can be therapeutic failures. And the therapeutic failures maybe may be to the second and third generation surface for the US to enter

646
01:15:10,630 --> 01:15:25,560
as unions and then to make things even worse or inducers may be good selecting for me such and mutants.

647
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:39,790
So how are you selected? So news can emerge randomly, as was shown in the top, a picture to show up one cell and maybe 10 to the seventh.

648
01:15:39,790 --> 01:15:43,030
But if we kill off all those susceptible cells, what are we left with?

649
01:15:43,030 --> 01:15:51,310
We're left with resistant cells, and even if there's only one resistant cell, it can multiply and multiply and multiply.

650
01:15:51,310 --> 01:15:59,300
And then you have a population full of resistant cells.

651
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:11,030
So we have here the AFC and potential good verbal or if you're giving the patients the FOXTON and they're also on a drug that has coagulated in it,

652
01:16:11,030 --> 01:16:17,260
they can become inducer. But if they're on sale back down, it's a poor inducer.

653
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:21,260
If you go down the list and look at Amy Panopto, it's variable.

654
01:16:21,260 --> 01:16:26,690
If it's a given with Seth Mandel, maybe I just may not be.

655
01:16:26,690 --> 01:16:30,320
But if it's given with, as you know, it's not not good.

656
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:40,130
And so that's how you interpret this chart with ampicillin, if it's given this sit on board variable the result.

657
01:16:40,130 --> 01:16:43,770
But if you give ampicillin with the fourth generation surface, fauna will not.

658
01:16:43,770 --> 01:16:52,480
That probably will not be successful. And then we come to me in selection.

659
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:54,520
You get a good selection of mutants,

660
01:16:54,520 --> 01:17:06,360
if there's such a thing when the patient is given second or third generation bioweapons because it kills off the other,

661
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:15,940
the other, the other organisms and good fighters are also has trained up poor such as mutants or the carbapenems because they're much more effective.

662
01:17:15,940 --> 01:17:28,350
The second license being much more effective, effective the first and fourth generation cephalosporins than the penicillin.

663
01:17:28,350 --> 01:17:33,610
So now we haven't said too much about ABC. KFC is difficult.

664
01:17:33,610 --> 01:17:41,260
There's really no serious I recommended method to say that it's present in an organism or a group of organisms.

665
01:17:41,260 --> 01:17:47,590
We have indicator organisms that make us think that apsey type resistance might be present.

666
01:17:47,590 --> 01:17:51,250
So Problemo doesn't produce chromosomally mediated eczema,

667
01:17:51,250 --> 01:18:00,730
but it may produce one from non chromosomally mediated proteins and relisten salmonella the same.

668
01:18:00,730 --> 01:18:09,200
E. coli can occasionally hyper produce chromosomal apsey, but doesn't happen that often.

669
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:22,240
Our big problem with these is incredibly small frozen rabbits and salmonella.

670
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:29,830
So how do we detect if seas we can look at the resistance pattern or the susceptibility pattern,

671
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:38,170
if it's got an intermediate or resistant intermediate type of resistance or for resistance to the FOXTON,

672
01:18:38,170 --> 01:18:48,030
or if it demonstrates hydrolysis to the foxes in then different assay, it's probably an ABC producer.

673
01:18:48,030 --> 01:18:56,490
So if we compare, if these bills are two main type of resistance patterns in the beta lactam drugs that

674
01:18:56,490 --> 01:19:03,750
the bills are inhibited by flatulent eight employees are not inhibited by five.

675
01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:07,830
If we look at the different cephalosporins and whether or not they're hydrolyzed

676
01:19:07,830 --> 01:19:14,490
the first to third generation serious ones are hydrolyzed by ESB all producers.

677
01:19:14,490 --> 01:19:20,070
They are also hydrolyzed by U.S. producers. But you go down to suffer accident and suffer taxing.

678
01:19:20,070 --> 01:19:27,060
ESB producers can be inhibited by the accident or or teacher.

679
01:19:27,060 --> 01:19:34,560
But if organisms that have apsey the SAF accident or 17:10 doesn't do anything against them.

680
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:42,750
And then of course, there's the fourth generation suffers four and 17 and it is inhibited.

681
01:19:42,750 --> 01:19:46,650
Steel producers are inhibited by that bacteria produce.

682
01:19:46,650 --> 01:19:56,440
The AFC are not inhibited by that. So there is a screening test for AMC.

683
01:19:56,440 --> 01:20:01,990
It determines if an organism can produce an enzyme that hydrolysis of oxygen.

684
01:20:01,990 --> 01:20:05,560
It's very easy to do. You make a suspension of your organism.

685
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:14,020
You have to make sure you are susceptible to the carbapenems, corrosive and susceptible to carbapenems because it's the suspension of your organism.

686
01:20:14,020 --> 01:20:20,830
It requires a separate plate. No. Twenty four hours probably can't get reimbursed for it, but it's going to help with therapy for the patient.

687
01:20:20,830 --> 01:20:26,890
And so you do. You drop your desk and you you look to see whether or not you drop your platinum disc.

688
01:20:26,890 --> 01:20:33,400
And you look to see whether or not it's susceptible or not the organism is susceptible or not.

689
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:46,050
If it idolizes the surfactant destroys the source of oxygen, that's ABC.

690
01:20:46,050 --> 01:20:53,430
So then you visited your ABC confirmatory test, the ABC does test that I just talked about, but can AMC be inhibited by the like?

691
01:20:53,430 --> 01:20:55,140
I said, I've never done that test.

692
01:20:55,140 --> 01:21:01,080
Or we can do a multiplex PCR, which is, I think, the way to go because you do one test, you don't have to do multiple tests,

693
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:12,300
one after another after another to a multiplex PCR for susceptibility testing, and that should include the ABC detection.

694
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:16,560
So, but here's how you would do that.

695
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:22,260
Here's a safe oxygen disk who played as it played is inoculated.

696
01:21:22,260 --> 01:21:26,460
You have the fox in the disk. You have your test organism on a disk right next to it.

697
01:21:26,460 --> 01:21:31,110
And this is your equal ATCC two five nine two two. Just a lot of it.

698
01:21:31,110 --> 01:21:43,730
If you get an indentation here around the disk that has your organism on it, you know your organism is producing is destroying the drug, but one here.

699
01:21:43,730 --> 01:21:47,510
And that's the ABC desk test.

700
01:21:47,510 --> 01:21:57,020
So how would you report that resistant to first, second and third generation surface forms, even if they're just as susceptible?

701
01:21:57,020 --> 01:22:04,160
You have to report them as resistant, and it would be a good idea to put a comment on that susceptibility.

702
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:11,480
You have detected or something to that to that effect. That is a basic empathy test.

703
01:22:11,480 --> 01:22:13,130
There are many different types of lapses,

704
01:22:13,130 --> 01:22:19,760
and you really have to do a variety of molecular tests to detect the presence of those other types of abuses.

705
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:30,350
But this is the beginning plasmid mediated empathy. Then we go to carbapenems is so off, we've knocked out the beta lactamase.

706
01:22:30,350 --> 01:22:38,250
Next and last great class of antibiotics as part of his. And.

707
01:22:38,250 --> 01:22:50,140
There's a gorilla had to put that in. So the the competitive compromises are a molecular class carbapenems as they're inhibited by curvilinear

708
01:22:50,140 --> 01:22:56,770
to varying degrees and not only the same male carbapenems are not their preferred substrates.

709
01:22:56,770 --> 01:23:03,550
And there are several several different types of carbapenems as KPC, 5:58, M1 and so on.

710
01:23:03,550 --> 01:23:08,920
There are also molecular groups molecular, molecular, probably pin races.

711
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:13,780
We also have molecular Class B carbapenems, and I really think these are much more serious.

712
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:20,080
These are the metallo beta lactamase since they are dependent upon a Diabaly Karen cation,

713
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:27,880
which is the zinc they are inhibited by Keeler's, such as EDTA and carbapenems are their preferred substances.

714
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:36,800
They love to eat carbapenems or destroy carbapenems, and that some of the current films are standing for any perram threads.

715
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:41,890
One through twenty three events, one through 12, ESPN's one in the list will just go on and on.

716
01:23:41,890 --> 01:23:50,570
Every year the list gets larger. So then we also have molecular class, the Carbapenem Aces.

717
01:23:50,570 --> 01:24:01,220
These are also poorly inhibited by coagulate, they're not inhibited by EDTA and carbapenems are not their preferred substrates.

718
01:24:01,220 --> 01:24:05,660
And you may have heard of some of these oxa types axis twenty three point twenty seven,

719
01:24:05,660 --> 01:24:14,550
40, 50 and so on, and 23 through 27 are very common, as is 15 55.

720
01:24:14,550 --> 01:24:22,200
So then we have something you may have heard about KPC Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenems,

721
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:28,860
it occurs in clenbuterol but may also occur in other organisms such as Colorbox and Toka center back,

722
01:24:28,860 --> 01:24:34,500
referring to in the eyes of the other bacteria or interactive species. E. coli, salmonella and Shigella.

723
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:38,250
There's racial, excuse me, and there can also be found in the mouse region also.

724
01:24:38,250 --> 01:24:48,140
So this is unusual in that it's found in both oxidase negative and oxidase positive organisms.

725
01:24:48,140 --> 01:24:56,480
So key, because this is horrible, confer resistance to all by the LATimes Arms, extended spectrum,

726
01:24:56,480 --> 01:25:03,650
several squadrons Mountbatten's confidence if it is a KPC producer, none of the bailout terms will work.

727
01:25:03,650 --> 01:25:11,660
And because it is plasmid mediated, there's a significant threat for spread.

728
01:25:11,660 --> 01:25:17,750
They have not only plasmids but are factor. So the block KPC gene is located on a plasmid.

729
01:25:17,750 --> 01:25:22,250
And you know what it's like to do the like to jump around to different organisms.

730
01:25:22,250 --> 01:25:31,790
So it often occurs with other resistance genes such as for SPL, for Panopto, fluoroquinolone resistance and aminoglycosides resistance.

731
01:25:31,790 --> 01:25:44,120
So if a patient gets an KPC bearing organism, it will make therapy very, very difficult and it will make.

732
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:54,890
Infection prevention is incredibly important so that this organism is not spread to any other patients.

733
01:25:54,890 --> 01:25:59,960
So we go to the classic carbapenems as these require searing to be active.

734
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:06,110
The hydrolyzed ampicillin and some of the sulfur spawns more rapidly in the process.

735
01:26:06,110 --> 01:26:11,740
You can also hydrolyzed this train, and there aren't very many of these that can hydrolyzed as treating them.

736
01:26:11,740 --> 01:26:18,260
They're limited by the taste of action and carburetor, but not as well as the Isbell's are.

737
01:26:18,260 --> 01:26:22,250
So we don't see very many of these, but we may see them.

738
01:26:22,250 --> 01:26:27,290
They may pop up from time to time of the classic carbapenems system.

739
01:26:27,290 --> 01:26:39,470
Then we have just made things worse, KPC beta lactamase is the first KPC was reported in 2001 that was now discounted but has been discounted.

740
01:26:39,470 --> 01:26:46,670
Is it getting late here or there has now been this kind of new way of keeping Rs two through six?

741
01:26:46,670 --> 01:26:51,710
They are worldwide, not just in the states shown here, but certainly here in Michigan.

742
01:26:51,710 --> 01:26:57,350
They're also across the world in Columbia, France, Greece, Israel, Scotland, China and so on.

743
01:26:57,350 --> 01:27:02,030
I've only got a few more slowly. I've got 20 more slides. Why don't I finish this next time?

744
01:27:02,030 --> 01:27:03,480
Just the last 24 hours or so?

745
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:10,500
OK, I just wanted to make sure that you all knew what a great problem anti-microbial resistance is, and it's not going away.

746
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:15,800
And we all need to be cognizant of it and do everything we can to make sure that the appropriate testing is being done,

747
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:21,770
the appropriate infection prevention precautions are used and appropriate therapies just also.

748
01:27:21,770 --> 01:27:27,820
OK. Have a nice evening. I'll see you on Wednesday. OK.

749
01:27:27,820 --> 01:27:39,829
65.
