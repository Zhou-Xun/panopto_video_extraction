1
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:52,900
Mr. Oh, yeah.

2
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:10,700
Yeah. I mean that's you know. And then I think you posted the whole.

3
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:17,800
Yeah, I just. But whatever.

4
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,810
Yeah. There are a lot of.

5
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,070
So. Okay.

6
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:44,340
All right, let's get started. Um, just kind of summing up where we are in the big picture.

7
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,599
We're going to we had a little bit left over from lung pathology today,

8
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,489
so we're going to finish up some particulate related lung pathology and then

9
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:57,530
we'll do just the structure function portion of the nervous system lecture.

10
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:08,330
Okay. And then that'll bring us next week on the 18th to the last part of our systems pathology based section of the course,

11
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,180
which will be nervous system pathology. So we're going to kind of look at some examples of that.

12
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:25,520
Then we have Thanksgiving yay week off. And then so that lecture on nervous system pathology will end the material that will be on your final.

13
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:31,870
On the second there is class, we're going to I'm going to show you some other slides,

14
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:36,440
some some might be from organs we've covered, some might be from other organ systems.

15
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,080
So you can practice a little bit recognizing some of the basic pathology processes that we've learned.

16
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:46,010
But looking at it perhaps in a tissue that might be less familiar to you.

17
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,280
So again, a little bit of practice getting back to basic pathology.

18
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:57,350
So that'll be on the second. But nothing, none of the like new organs or new stuff I show you that day will be on the exam.

19
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:05,910
It's just kind of a fun day to practice stuff. And then the final, as we said before, will be on the ninth, which is on canvas, still open notes.

20
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:14,749
It's likely a little bit more straightforward than the midterm in terms of, you know, for structure function,

21
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:19,400
you have to understand what the structure function is is pretty straightforward in terms of studying.

22
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,510
And then the pathology, as I think I said last week, the pathology examples,

23
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:31,670
I'm giving you our example, not the exact same image, but examples of things we've learned in class.

24
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:33,589
So like for long now we're doing long.

25
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:40,969
Last week we talked about acute alveolar damage that was diffuse alveolar disease with the fibrin clots and Hyland membranes.

26
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:41,750
We learned that.

27
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:50,270
We learned about the the response or the initial response to injury of the numerous sites we learned about type two new site Hypoplasia.

28
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:57,870
Today we're going to learn about pigments and particulates. So we know a pretty well-defined set of lesions.

29
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:05,480
So on your final but the most important thing, if you're seeing a pathology side is to recognize the tissue and then you go down your short list.

30
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,830
Okay. Is this an acute process, chronic process? What are the things that I've learned?

31
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:18,680
And then as far as pathogenesis, I will do something like, okay, give me an example of one toxicant that could cause this lesion.

32
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:27,770
So questions like that. The question I think I mentioned this before, people always get worried that if you mess up at the beginning,

33
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:34,580
does that mean you lose all the points for those questions, like you misidentify the organ or you misidentify the process?

34
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:39,500
No, that is not the case. So if you misidentify the organ, you're going to lose some points for that.

35
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:45,559
But I'll kind of follow you down your rabbit hole. And at least as you're internally consistent with what you think it is, you know,

36
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:50,570
you could describe acute inflammation in a different organ and you'll still get points for that.

37
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:57,080
If you misidentify the process. So the process you got is wrong, you'll lose the points for that.

38
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:02,900
But then if you give me a toxicant, that would cause the process that you described.

39
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:08,120
Like if you think fibrin is fibrosis and you're describing something that causes fibrosis,

40
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,270
as long as you're internally consistent, I'll give you points for that.

41
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:20,390
What I won't do is if you use the word salad approach and you just write down all the lesions that you ever learned in the lab and all the agents,

42
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,440
because that just tells me that you're good at regurgitating stuff.

43
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,519
That's the slide and putting it on a piece of paper. So it has to be internally consistent.

44
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,000
You have to get off the fence and make a choice for what you think this is.

45
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:35,690
You can't just list everything that we learn in class. Does that make sense?

46
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:42,170
Okay. Yeah. So let's do.

47
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:53,820
Okay. So we did actually do this one last week, but just to kind of get us back into the mindset.

48
00:05:54,030 --> 00:06:00,060
So we did first acute damage to alveoli, something that kills the type one.

49
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,470
Yeah, type one. Tumor sites that we talked about Reisen as an example of that.

50
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:09,150
We had that lung that had destruction of the type one new sites.

51
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,510
It had destruction of the capillaries.

52
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,620
There was a demand, some hemorrhage in the lungs and some fibrin because of that destruction of the capillaries.

53
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:23,700
And then we presume that the macrophages clean that up and we wanted to know what would happen to the alveolar lining after that.

54
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,720
So then we had that type two new site, Hypoplasia Lung. Do you remember that one?

55
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:35,040
So that was an example of oxygen toxicity. But I said you could see that with any type of damage to the type one Numa sites.

56
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:40,620
And so now kind of following our pattern, we're moving towards things that cause more chronic damage in the lung.

57
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:48,840
And so we're going to do some particulate toxicology. So I showed you this slide, which is a human lung, and we've talked about how it appears to,

58
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:54,510
I tell you the word consolidation, where you're filling the alveolar spaces with to make them look solid.

59
00:06:55,230 --> 00:07:00,510
And I can't prove who did it, but someone correctly pointed out that there was nodular consolidation here.

60
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:04,290
So we have little circles everywhere. There they are section of lung.

61
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:07,410
There are multifocal nodular areas of consolidation.

62
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:11,940
And so we wanted to see what those were. Oops, go back.

63
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:16,980
So this was the edge of one of those nodules. There's the sort of big consolidated ball.

64
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,670
And then here's the area where you can still see that it's long, but it's alveoli.

65
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:23,880
But there's some busyness going on as far as cells.

66
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:33,600
So looking at the consolidated area, we saw that there were some cells, there are a lot of cells present here and they're kind of organized in layers.

67
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:36,390
Here's a nice, spindly one. Some of them are a little bit fatter.

68
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:41,280
And then we have all this pink stuff also kind of all symmetric, organized in layers.

69
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,730
But this is pretty cellular mixed in with this pink stuff.

70
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:48,810
And then we also have these black aggregates.

71
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:53,100
And we said that this this was fibrosis.

72
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:58,530
So these are consolidated areas that consist of proliferating fibroblasts.

73
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:02,760
And obviously you can't really see it's a still image the cells are proliferating.

74
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,140
But we know that in the normal lung this shouldn't be that many fibroblasts.

75
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:15,180
So this is essentially a hyperplasia of fibroblasts. So these fibroblasts have proliferated to generate this number of cells.

76
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:21,359
So we have increased and you could write that as just increased fibroblasts, if you prefer, increased fibroblasts.

77
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:27,689
And then these are mesenchymal cells in a collagen. So all this extracellular pink stuff is collagen.

78
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:32,670
Those increased collagen, which we know is scar tissue is fibrosis.

79
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:38,880
So that's our cycle, the sort of end stage of repair where you can't in this area regenerate the epithelium.

80
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:45,540
So we have some fibrosis and then adjacent to that in the part that still looks a little bit like normal lung.

81
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,760
We have a lot of things that we've seen before.

82
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:55,349
We have alveoli here and these are our friends, the pulmonary macrophages doing their job that goes off to it.

83
00:08:55,350 --> 00:09:01,679
So tossing things that shouldn't be in the airways. So there's some maybe there were some edema before.

84
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:09,210
These guys have a lot of particulate matter in them. So we have macrophages, we have areas and this is a good one here.

85
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:13,500
We have areas where the interstitial is expanded.

86
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,860
So there's like a band you can even see that there's an alveolar anymore and

87
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:22,709
there's scattered inflammatory cells that sort of peppery look through that area.

88
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:26,370
There's interstitial inflammation. This isn't a great slide.

89
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:33,360
There's a little bit here. This should be an alveolar, but it looks a little bit like the airway cells.

90
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:41,880
So this is type two site hypoplasia. Remember we said if we have alveolar damage, then the the initial response is the type to new sites.

91
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:48,000
And so it causes and the shorthand term is that call it bronchial or ization of the alveoli because

92
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,910
they look a little bit more like airways that so we have all those things oops increased alveoli.

93
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,590
So if we're doing our sentences there are also increased alveolar macrophages.

94
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:07,140
There is areas of type to numerous side hyperplasia and then there's increased inflammatory cells in the interstitial.

95
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:12,970
Okay. So this is kind of happening at the periphery of those areas where there's fibrosis.

96
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:23,670
Yes. Because you can see the shape of those cells that, you know, it's type two or because of where like what structure they should be for.

97
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:29,050
Well, it's because of the shape. So like and because of where I am.

98
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,140
So I'm trying to is so messed up, it's hard to find.

99
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:40,330
This is maybe a little bit more it's still too thick, but this is maybe a little bit more what I would expect around it alveolar those flat cells.

100
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:46,600
So if I expect to out and it's better if I'm on the full slide, I can sort of see where I am.

101
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:53,530
Like I expect there to be alveoli out here. Okay.

102
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:59,530
I don't in that area, if I'm seeing there's way too many bronchioles here, then it's not actually a bronchus.

103
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:07,750
It's the the alveoli are starting to look more like bronchioles, but it's because there are those plump polygonal type tube in the sides.

104
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:15,250
Okay. That makes sense. And I'm just kind of as we get more towards the final, the anxiety levels start to raise.

105
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:26,440
So if I were to show you an image like this in the context of class, I would kind of do it in this stepwise thing.

106
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:36,400
So I'd show you something small, something getting a little bit bigger, and then as far as identifying individual things, oops, stop it.

107
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:42,340
I'm going to show you I'm going to zoom in on a thing like this.

108
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:46,390
You know, I've shown you the stepwise things. I'm going to show you this. What are these?

109
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:54,040
You know what I'm saying? So, like, I'm not going to show you a single slide and try to have you come up with all of those four things the fibrosis,

110
00:11:54,460 --> 00:12:00,730
the alveolar macrophages, the heparin, human side, hyperplasia, kind of all just from looking at the slide.

111
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:05,440
That's, you know, ultimately pathology is. But we haven't had enough time to give you enough.

112
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:13,540
I practice to do that. So I'll focus. You'll have to interpret in the big context, like understand what all these pieces put together is telling you.

113
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:20,050
But as far as identification of an actual lesion, I'm going to try to stick it in the middle of the picture somewhere and say, what is this?

114
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:24,130
Does that make sense? Okay. All right.

115
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,680
Where were we? So we're doing we have all these changes.

116
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:34,630
And then we noticed that many of the macrophages had this black particulate stuff in it, speckles throughout it.

117
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:42,910
I think Amber pointed out this is probably particles and suggested carbon black, which it most likely has some carbon black.

118
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:50,110
But also in here, which we know based on the organization of the fibrosis.

119
00:12:50,110 --> 00:13:01,000
Also in here are particles of silica. So my, my, my pathology sentence there was brown to black pigment, extracellular lee and within macrophages.

120
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:08,320
And then I have a question mark. What is that? If we were on a microscope to view that slide with polarized light,

121
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:13,570
we could find out that those little particulates actually contain crystalline material.

122
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,450
And we know this because when we viewed it with polarized light,

123
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:22,180
it would refract the light back at us and make it these shiny areas flashing back at us in the microscope.

124
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:35,260
And we talked about how silica, silica and its various forms can cause can be one common particulate that can cause this for fragile appearance.

125
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:41,470
And so if you have the most harmful form of silica, which is silicon dioxide,

126
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:47,080
this is the substance that's most fiber genic, most damaging to the lung.

127
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:53,050
And those appear in tissue as small reflect refracted particles.

128
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:59,709
And usually they're going to be situated very close to those nodular areas of fibrosis because they tend

129
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:06,700
to create sort of nights of inflammation that just builds up and you get you get inflammation first.

130
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:12,939
And then when you can't fix that because the particulates remain, you get fibrosis and then like an onion,

131
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:16,840
you just keep getting this reaction spreading out further and further from retinitis.

132
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:25,940
Okay. Silicates, which are essentially the salts of silicon and oxygen.

133
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:31,819
So a little bit different chemical formula, those tend to form also can be in long tissue.

134
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:38,020
They form larger, more kind of irregular refractory particles by themselves.

135
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:41,360
Like if you were to take a laboratory animal and just like very,

136
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:48,529
very pure inhale particulates either of silica or various forms of silicates by themselves.

137
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:55,909
Silicates are less fiber genic, you know, depends on the source that you read, not fiber.

138
00:14:55,910 --> 00:15:03,200
Genic is kind of the dogma that you know and pathology you're often taught this little that a debate about that but in

139
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:12,830
practice in the field these inhale particulate matter that's heavy and silicates versus silicon dioxide is less fiber genic.

140
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:19,600
That said, understanding in the real world, it's rare that you would just be inhaling one form.

141
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:23,750
So usually you're going to have a mix of silicates and silica,

142
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:32,630
and the degree of pathology that it's caused can be sort of related to how many of the finds, how much of that inhaled.

143
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:37,700
So inhaled material contains silica versus silicates.

144
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:49,040
So in the field, the manifestations of inhaled particulates vary quite a bit depending on the composition of what's in that particular mix.

145
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:58,560
Okay so silica nodular areas of fibrosis and that Mr. Number there.

146
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:01,830
So this was that particular case in terms of processes.

147
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:10,530
The most obvious was that fibrosis. Adjacent to that we also have inflammation, which is mostly macrophages and someone decides.

148
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:17,909
So it's not neutrophils, not like that acute thing that we had with the rice in case so that had macrophages and neutrophils.

149
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:26,910
This has macrophages and lymphocytes. We have kind of a repair response going on with type two lymphocyte hyperplasia and then we have those pigments.

150
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:33,120
So the general word, the general word for pigment deposition in the lung,

151
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:39,690
pneumo meaning lung and then Cono says is referring to the pigment deposition or the particular deposition.

152
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:47,970
So pneumoconiosis is a pathology word for the general, general particulate matter in the lung, it's usually pigmented.

153
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,850
And then it was important to remember the nodular location of this fibrosis.

154
00:16:54,990 --> 00:17:00,390
So this was our reminder side for annoying things in pathology that sound alike but are completely different,

155
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:10,290
which is pretty critical here because if you were to call this lung fibrin like the race in case that's just wrong, like there's nothing.

156
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,690
I can't give partial credit or anything for that.

157
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:18,840
Just remember, I know these things sound the same, but fibrin is the end product of the clotting cascade.

158
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:23,100
That means you've had vascular damage, you just clotting. So it's a very acute response.

159
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:30,780
It's going to get cleaned up by macrophages later. Fibrosis very, very different is increased production of collagen by fibroblasts.

160
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,870
It's a chronic thing. Okay. Different things.

161
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:39,179
All right. I'm going to say something else about that, but I can't remember.

162
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:43,050
It was. Okay. That's just the reminder side about that.

163
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:51,659
I'm going to show you another pattern of fibrosis, also with a pneumoconiosis lesion.

164
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:55,590
And then we'll just talk in general about how that distribution pattern helps us.

165
00:17:56,430 --> 00:18:04,440
So this also is a human lung and it also has areas of consolidation, but the distribution looks a little different.

166
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:11,430
And I tried to pick ones that are as different as I could. Obviously, there can be some overlap, but the distribution looks a little bit different.

167
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:15,300
So we have some more coalescing areas of consolidation.

168
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:24,870
And although it's a little bit hard to recognize it in this low magnification field, this is like a little bit larger bronchial.

169
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:32,969
But all the little aggregates tend to be around bronchioles and then it's sort of coalescing or spreading.

170
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:37,290
And then we have kind of a band here that's at the at the edge of the lung.

171
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:42,750
So I don't really talk about this verbiage when I explain structure,

172
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:46,950
but the membranes that are covering the outside of the lung are called the pleura.

173
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:53,460
So our pattern is both para bronchial or para worm peeler.

174
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:59,530
So around little mini airways just kind of wherever. And they're all through the wall here, here, here, here.

175
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,140
So that's suggesting that something is being inhaled that's making it all the way to those bronchioles.

176
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:08,220
And this is very key sub plural.

177
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:16,080
So here's another bronchial that's kind of strange. We have something that's inhaled and then we have pathology.

178
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,040
All right. Also all the way out at the periphery, away from the airways.

179
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,490
So it's kind of somehow the pathologies jumped from here to here.

180
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:29,520
So we have if we if I had a sentence for this, there's consolidation, multifocal.

181
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:36,750
And then if I were to zoom in, you can see it's around bronchioles and it's also this is very important at the sub pleural area.

182
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:41,470
And this is a little bit like coalescing. See, it's kind of becoming one thing here.

183
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:49,050
So those are all consolidated areas. So there is a little bit higher magnification looking at the sub pleural area.

184
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:57,360
And this is looking in one of those areas which has some similarities to that fibrosis I showed you before.

185
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:03,480
So we have lots of sort of spindly looking cells. We have lots of pink stuff outside of the cells.

186
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:09,600
So that's our fibrosis again. So we have fibrosis, we have scattered cells here.

187
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,310
Those are just that, just scattered cells hanging out here.

188
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:19,860
That's just inflammation. So we have and this is all interstitial now that's expanded.

189
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:23,880
So we have interstitial inflammation. Let's see what else we have going on here.

190
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:29,430
What does this look like? I'm here to do maybe.

191
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,340
Are those type one human sites and to name a site.

192
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:43,330
So we will that type tuned in to say hyperplasia. And then we have this crazy thing, weird thing.

193
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:49,750
We haven't seen much of this before, but we have a cell that has a lot of different nuclei and it has brown linear material in it.

194
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:54,190
Okay, so the other guy had kind of brown to black speckles.

195
00:20:54,430 --> 00:21:00,850
This guy has linear material. So here's another image shows a little bit better.

196
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:11,580
This is a multi nucleated cell and it's trying its darndest to phagocytosis this thing, which is a linear pigmented object.

197
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,290
And this is way bigger than a single macrophage.

198
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,870
A single macrophage can't do it.

199
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:24,730
And so the macrophages actually form these working together, form these multi nucleated cells as they're trying to engulf this thing.

200
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:32,499
Here's another multi integrated social. So you can't really see a pigment in it, but these are formation of multi nucleotide giant cells,

201
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:39,010
which are forms of macrophages that are trying to phagocytosis, something that's too big for an individual cell.

202
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:42,610
And so this fiber, everybody probably knows that this is by now.

203
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:50,020
What's this fiber? This is it's an asbestos fiber. So it has a long linear aspect ratio.

204
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:55,270
It's a long fiber compared to the speckles that we showed before that you would see with silica or with carbon.

205
00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:04,510
So in terms of more morphology, the morphology is almost the same.

206
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:09,040
The morphologic diagnoses are the same. We have fibrosis just like we did in the first thing.

207
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,140
We have inflammation, which is chronic,

208
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:15,760
just like we did in the first thing we have time to do to center for pleasure, just like we did in the first thing.

209
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:23,200
And we have pneumoconiosis, but we have linear particulates and the distribution, very important is different.

210
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:28,690
That makes sense. So the same basic lesion, different type of particulate.

211
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:39,879
Yes. So my other question about the aggravated phagocytosis here, I thought when when the macrophages go to eat asbestos fibers,

212
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:43,959
sometimes they're like break apart because, you know, they yes.

213
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:50,140
Trying too hard. But you don't see any of those like cell debris anywhere here.

214
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,250
Well, then they become debris. So then they're from there.

215
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:57,520
The other matter like this could be macrophage debris for all we know.

216
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,330
But they they they're going to eat. Yes. They become debris themselves.

217
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:05,530
And that actually is also one of the major mechanisms for this chronic inflammation,

218
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:11,770
because macrophages come, have a go at it, fail and break apart and then there's more debris.

219
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:14,500
Here comes some more macrophages and the cycle starts again.

220
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:21,940
And that can even happen in the carbon black example because even though it's not very fiber genic,

221
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:25,060
there's only so much carbon that macrophages can take in.

222
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:28,060
So one of the downsides I'm going to show you image of that in a minute.

223
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:35,229
One of the downsides of like carbon exposure is that continuous cycle or macrophages just eat up a ton of it.

224
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:37,090
So if you have a high environmental exposure,

225
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:42,190
they're going to break apart that more macrophages are going to come and you get kind of a source of chronic inflammation.

226
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:49,240
Yes. Is there a property of the asbestos besides literally just size that makes them makes it so difficult?

227
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:55,750
Like makes it so. Yes. And it also relates to where the distribution is.

228
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,910
So I have a side talk about that later, but maybe it's good to talk about it now, this big thing.

229
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:09,610
So okay, so you're inhaling this linear thing and at its at its finer aspect, it's very small.

230
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:13,810
It can make its way down into deeper chambers of the lung, but it's like a needle.

231
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:20,920
So when it gets to the bronchial, where things are switching to, like the alveolar ducts and the alveolar sacs,

232
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:25,750
which are very thin walled structures, imagine it's like a little pine or something lodged in there.

233
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:31,150
It actually precedes not like up to here, it's gone down the airway,

234
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:36,790
but in the thin walled alveoli, it actually punctures through the walls of adjacent alveoli.

235
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:44,020
And sort of like if you get a splinter working its way to the top of your skin, it works its way throughout.

236
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:51,730
It's going this way. It works its way through all the alveoli until it gets to the thicker tissue at the edge of the lung and there it stays.

237
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:58,600
So the sub pleural distribution relates to that sort of alveolar to alveolar direct

238
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:03,490
puncturing of the asbestos fibers and then they stay here and form a chronic irritant.

239
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:07,870
So there's like two main areas of accumulation in the lung for asbestos.

240
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:12,760
Like first they're going to hit the bronchioles and there's a lot of inflammation there.

241
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:20,620
That's also where some of our main metabolizing enzymes are trying to give a go and are being stimulated by all those reactive oxygen species,

242
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:24,850
but then it's just going to kind of tunnel through and get to the sub pleural area.

243
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,020
So in this context, like specifically for the lung anyway, it really is a physical.

244
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:34,030
Like it's the physical properties of it. Make it. Well, yes.

245
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:39,430
I mean the physical properties and then the biologic response, I guess.

246
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:46,840
Yeah, the physical properties convey. Yes, the physical properties convey where the pathology is though compared to silica.

247
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:51,100
Who gets here and then kind of accumulate.

248
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:58,150
It's being inhaled. So it's going to hit the bronchioles first and then the macrophages are going to accumulate in that area.

249
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:03,870
So silica, those nodules tend to start wherever there's a bronchial and just spread out from there.

250
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:12,300
But silica can't go. It's just a particular it can't go a tiny particular can't go toe and through asbestos can take that right that exists.

251
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:17,560
So yeah, the and that's true really of any type of particulate toxicology,

252
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:25,959
the physical properties of the material like both it's kind of mechanical shape and its chemical

253
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:31,150
composition have a huge impact on what the pathology is regardless of the organ system.

254
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:36,130
And the other really difficult thing about particle toxicology, especially with the chemistry parts,

255
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:41,139
the physical properties of the particle as you see it like in the lab or the environment,

256
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:45,280
can be very different from the physical properties once it enters the biologic system.

257
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:50,740
So like near tangent here, but it's cool nanoparticle toxicology.

258
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:53,920
So like people do a lot of in vitro work with nanoparticles,

259
00:26:53,920 --> 00:27:01,290
put it with different cells and like look for inflammation or getting through a membrane because they're so tiny.

260
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:08,080
A lot of that kind of falls apart when you look at in-vivo accumulation of nanoparticles,

261
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,870
whether you're injecting them or particular thing with ingestion.

262
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:18,339
And a lot of the predictions that you have in vitro can be very difficult to translate what happens in vivo, because in the biologic systems,

263
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:23,649
a lot of times those nanoparticles aggregate and now you no longer have a nanoparticle,

264
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:30,400
you look at some larger size particle, so it's going to behave differently than an ultrafine particle would in vitro.

265
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:35,770
And then also I think about the GI tract, think about the complexity of that chemical environment,

266
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:41,050
especially if you have like a kind of active surface to the nanoparticle.

267
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:44,470
There's going to be chemistry taking place on the surface of that particle.

268
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:49,720
You get this protein corona that's made up of everything that's in your GI tract or the lung.

269
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:57,910
And then it becomes like another thing that you ingested or inhaled, that a lot of what happens to it is dictated by that protein corona.

270
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:01,569
So like especially nanoparticle toxicology, right?

271
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:07,209
Any particular toxicology, that translation between what happens in vitro and in vivo can be very difficult

272
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:11,890
because of how complex the chemical and the physical environment is in vivo.

273
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:16,780
So I don't know, I got off a little bit tangent there, but it's quite interesting stuff.

274
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:21,339
Okay. So we have the subfloor distribution related to asbestos.

275
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:27,430
We have the same morphologic diagnoses, except this is why it's very, very important.

276
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:32,920
Like even if you didn't know that this was asbestos, you didn't know those facts about the distribution.

277
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:40,750
The important thing here is to recognize that even though those are the same processes, the distribution is different.

278
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:45,520
And particularly silica is a little bit easier because when you have those nodules,

279
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:50,260
if you throw a polarized light on it, it tends to have a lot of silica particles that you can see.

280
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:56,650
Asbestos can be sneaky and those fibers can actually break down into smaller pieces over time.

281
00:28:56,950 --> 00:29:03,220
And you might have to really hunt on a light microscope to see that, and you might not see these fibers at all.

282
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:09,220
So like that one tends to be the distribution is really kind of your clue as to what the origins might be there.

283
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:14,860
So how does this how do we get from that inhaled particulate to fibrosis?

284
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:22,450
So we inhale something that's an irritant in some way due to its physical properties, its chemical properties, some sort of irritation.

285
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:26,560
That's going to do two things. It's going to affect the epithelial cells.

286
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:33,190
So it might either just physically impact them or it might be taken up or end of cytosine into an epithelial cell.

287
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:37,360
And then our friendly neighborhood macrophages are going to try to send an airway.

288
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:40,960
They're not going to want that there. So they're going to try to phagocytosis the particulates.

289
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:44,590
And that is going to they're going to engage in what they do.

290
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,660
That's going to activate an INFLAMMASOME They're going to be trying to destroy this material

291
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:53,950
that's really crystalline material that's very difficult for macrophages to break down.

292
00:29:54,460 --> 00:30:00,820
So they're going to have to become activated in terms of the inflammasome and then the epithelial cells too will become activated.

293
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:09,580
And we have our acute inflammatory cytokines produced, which is going to send a signal to other inflammatory cells.

294
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:13,600
Here we have a source of irritation. Here's our same old story, source of inflammation.

295
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:20,290
So now we have other inflammatory cells come in and both the original cells and these cells are going to do their thing,

296
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:22,390
generate reactive oxygen species.

297
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:29,710
So now we have a little area where there's increased oxidative damage and that in and of itself, in addition to the irritant, is going to cause.

298
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:33,580
Damage to the epithelial cells. So there's a whole vicious cycle going on here.

299
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:40,510
It's an inflammatory process and we know that inflammatory processes evolve over time.

300
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:45,589
It's going to switch more towards healing phase or a repair phase.

301
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:50,540
So we're going to get our switch to a for at least some of those macrophages.

302
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:54,219
It's going to switch more towards the repair phenotype and also the epithelial cells.

303
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:58,630
So we're going to make TGF beta. We're switching our inflammatory response.

304
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:08,500
The TGF theta is our pro extracellular matrix pro repair cytokine because remember that from our regeneration and repair lecture,

305
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:13,240
so it's going to recruit fibroblasts to proliferate in the area.

306
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:18,910
They're going to do what they do, scar down. So there's our fibrosis trigger.

307
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:24,729
And then the other thing that can happen that we didn't really talk much about before is that in certain context,

308
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:33,160
if there's enough damage, TGF beta can not only recruit things that are already fibroblasts, it can actually induce some epithelial cells.

309
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:40,389
It's kind of bizarre to undergo a transition to a mesenchymal cell and hand-waving over that a little bit.

310
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:44,440
There's a lot of debate over whether that's a de differentiation process,

311
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:52,899
like to take a mature epithelial cell differentiates and somehow becomes a mesenchymal cell versus working on a tissue stem cell

312
00:31:52,900 --> 00:32:00,520
that still has some toner potency and could go either way towards a differentiated epithelium cell versus a mesenchymal cell.

313
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:05,950
But the net effect from a pathology standpoint is that we replace areas that should be covered

314
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:14,260
with epithelial cells with more mesenchymal cells and increase deposition of extracellular matrix.

315
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:22,930
Okay. So that's that whole complicated chronic cycle of damage and it has a huge consequence, I mean, has a huge consequence in any tissue.

316
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,430
But think about the liver.

317
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:33,010
In that cirrhotic liver, all the areas of that liver, you know, within a lobular, these were kind of, you know, it's just uniform hepatocytes.

318
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:39,780
So as long as I have enough intact hepatocytes and globules, I can still do some liver functions.

319
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,969
The lung has airway spaces.

320
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:51,700
So if I'm filling in airway spaces and areas of air exchange with fibrosis, that's going to massively impact my ability for the lung to function.

321
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:58,570
I mean, the liver will get impacted as well, but it has a little bit more leeway before it's going to have as much functional impact.

322
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:05,900
Okay. This is just the word slide describing what we just the pictures that I just gave you.

323
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:10,910
That's just a word format. Oh, and one other thing to remember.

324
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:16,490
We have those pro-inflammatory cytokines and then later I say it's which is the TGF beta.

325
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:24,139
Remember that this the stage for that is that even in the very earliest stages of inflammation because the inflammatory process,

326
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:27,320
you know, if you think about it, that the body knows it's going to have to clean up this mess.

327
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:33,560
So the pro-inflammatory cytokines already kind of wake up the epithelium and let them know

328
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:37,190
that they're going to have to get activated and reenter the cell cycle and proliferate.

329
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:45,049
So the whole thing is geared towards getting cell proliferation later and the direction that takes, you know, our acute damage.

330
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:51,740
If we just have destruction of type one tumor sites, which are epithelial cells and activation of the type twos,

331
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:56,269
we don't have that chronic inflammatory component and we don't have that chronic

332
00:33:56,270 --> 00:34:01,280
irritant that remains there in the tissue pushing us towards this fibrosis thing.

333
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:07,920
Okay. All right. And then this was the carbon black or the coal dust example.

334
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:11,180
And this is a real world examples. It's not like a pure lesion.

335
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:19,920
This actually probably is a silica nodule. But the black stuff, the darker black stuff is typically carbon when you see that in tissue.

336
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:28,320
But because, you know, in the real world you have mixtures of exposures usually, you know, kind of be a mixed picture.

337
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:35,040
So like the main but this is an image that you might see, you know, with like black lung disease.

338
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:44,130
But the the main generator for the fibrosis is usually silica, but this sort of black pigment and if I were to zoom in there,

339
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:48,330
there's macrophages is often genera is typically generated by carbon.

340
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:53,430
And if I zoom in, here's a macrophage, you can see it sitting out there.

341
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:59,339
All of these black things are macrophages. You can't really tell anymore because there's so much carbon black in them that the

342
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:03,570
nucleus itself is being obscured because the cytoplasm is full of that pigment.

343
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:14,280
So this is what you might have a pair of brown color inflammation or accumulation of pigment lead in macrophages around the bronchioles.

344
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:19,380
Okay, so that's really common and actually to a lesser degree,

345
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:25,409
a much lesser degree if you even if you just live in a city, I mean, even to some degree where we live here.

346
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:28,650
But if you live in a big city and there's a lot of kind of air pollution,

347
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:35,040
you're going to still have some degree of this intricacies, of this carbon accumulation around your airways.

348
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:42,270
Maybe you're not going to get like the silica nodules, like some in mining industry might.

349
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:49,080
But this is pretty common as kind of a background at a low level in anyone who lives in an urban environment.

350
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:56,420
Okay. So there's our general term for particulate deposition in the lung pneumoconiosis.

351
00:35:56,810 --> 00:36:03,080
And then if you can figure out what the main driver for the pathology is, you can actually be more specific.

352
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:06,740
So pneumoconiosis, general term for all the things I just showed you.

353
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:15,440
And then if I see those nodules, if I'm talking about a kind of process, the most likely type of pneumoconiosis is silicosis.

354
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:22,340
And again, it's driven by the distribution. The asbestos, one that some pleural distribution, asbestosis.

355
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:30,050
And then if it's just carbon or predominantly carbon without either of these distributions, the fibrosis, that's cancer causes.

356
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:35,030
Okay. So if you see those terms, those are just types of pneumoconiosis.

357
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:45,800
And then the distribution, as I said, can really point you towards what's driving the pathology in an individual lesion.

358
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:54,830
So coal dust or carbon black as the major component is not very fiber genic by itself, but accumulates in the lung.

359
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:58,100
And then this is just showing your macrophages full of that carbon black.

360
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:06,290
And basically, this is like a higher magnification. You get that black pigment and a little ring of macrophages around the respiratory bronchioles.

361
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:09,980
Okay. So it's mostly per bronchial or inflammation.

362
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:20,990
Silica we talked about accumulates particulates and then you get sort of a layered onion like ring of fibroblasts extending out from the bronchioles.

363
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:29,270
You end up with these nodular areas of fibrosis that are just expanding outward and then asbestos and it's vital.

364
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:38,930
Like Journey gets fibrosis around the bronchioles but also at the very edges of the so you can get a some plural distribution.

365
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,230
Okay. So knowing those different distributions is important.

366
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:55,579
This is just another asbestos slide showing you as you get these kind of individual rings forming, they can start to coalesce.

367
00:37:55,580 --> 00:38:01,060
And then you have like little areas of air trapping. So you end up with this sort of honeycomb like structure.

368
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:06,070
So you have a little bit of area of air and then this fibrosis and then it hits the next area of fibrosis,

369
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,540
you get almost like honeycomb cells forming,

370
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:17,420
but they're small areas of air or expanded bronchioles and then fibrosis filling up the interstitial space and especially at the edges of the lot.

371
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:21,890
So this is a kind of a classic honeycomb of the lung that you can see with asbestos.

372
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:26,020
So this is pretty obvious in lesser, um,

373
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:36,590
like lesser exposures to asbestos get really problematic to distinguish even from some like non some other biology of the lung.

374
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,790
So there's a condition called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,

375
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:51,080
which is likely an immune related condition where the fibroblasts really start proliferating without a known inciting cause.

376
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,860
So idiopathic fibrosis is like a very strange disease.

377
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,560
It tends to start in midlife.

378
00:38:56,570 --> 00:39:03,170
It actually has a really high incidence in women and it doesn't necessarily correlate like with smoking or anything like that.

379
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:06,470
People will just all of a sudden and do it well, not all of them, but over time,

380
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:10,760
develop pulmonary fibrosis, start to have an immune related component.

381
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:16,370
And a lot of people believe that there are environmental influences on its development that we don't really understand.

382
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:24,830
So we can't really point to one environmental cause. But people start developing pulmonary fibrosis, you know, much like what we talked about.

383
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:32,270
And in the early stages, there can be overlap in the distribution between both silicosis and especially asbestosis.

384
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:36,290
So this is kind of a multifocal fibrotic process.

385
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:45,230
One of the differences is that in that condition, like I said, people think it's a primary proliferation of the fibroblasts for unknown reasons.

386
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:51,709
So you have these little areas of of proliferative fibroblasts that form kind of a it's

387
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:57,080
kind of a low cellulari nodule and this becomes a sort of advancing front of fibrosis.

388
00:39:57,530 --> 00:40:00,229
So for the pathologists, they call them fibrotic foci.

389
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:06,500
And you're looking for sort of at the front of the lesion, these advancing fronts of proliferating fibroblasts.

390
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:10,160
You don't see that with asbestos.

391
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:18,920
So that's one way as a pathologist, you can distinguish these conditions, but you can have both occurring at the same time.

392
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:24,950
And the reason why that gets problematic for people who have asbestos from workplace exposures.

393
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:28,940
So there are a lot of programs because obviously that causes significant disability.

394
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:33,470
There are like compensation programs if you have a known workplace exposure.

395
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:39,920
But to qualify for those compensation programs, you have to have someone certifying that your lung disease is caused by asbestos.

396
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:44,660
And it could be years before. Right, that you were exposed to asbestos.

397
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:51,680
And as I said, it can be it breaks down to a very small substance in the lung.

398
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:58,640
So you're not a lot of times you don't see asbestos fibers in the lung, even if the antecedent reason was asbestosis.

399
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:04,220
So there are actually histologic grading schemes that try to assess, you know,

400
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:09,770
which lung patterns are more likely to be due to asbestos and which are not, which gets really problematic,

401
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:14,000
you know, not from a pathology standpoint, especially from a like sociological standpoint,

402
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:19,160
because what hinges on that is whether a person can qualify for asbestos driven benefits.

403
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:26,270
The side view and the pathology take home is that there's a lot of overlap between,

404
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:33,110
you know, asbestos inhalation and some naturally occurring phenomena.

405
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:37,670
And in the real world, you can actually have multiple phenomena existing at the same time.

406
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:44,419
And that gets really complicated to kind of piece out, okay, this is an extra case that will not be in our exam.

407
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:47,000
This is another potential effect of asbestos.

408
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:54,710
And here we're way out at the periphery, along with some consolidation, but nowhere near what we saw before when we're showing one section.

409
00:41:55,190 --> 00:42:02,180
But what you do notice is that there's proliferation on the surface of the lung on that pleural surface.

410
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,170
Right. So some proliferating cells there over time.

411
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:13,300
So I have a proliferative process of the Mizo the illegal cells.

412
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:20,979
So mesothelioma cells are a type of cell that's covering the outside surface of the lung and here it should just be flat.

413
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:24,970
I should hardly notice them, but instead, like,

414
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:31,000
they should normally look a little bit more like this instead of this crazy proliferation of mesothelioma cells.

415
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:37,240
Here they are a little bit like that type to new site hyperplasia, but we're way out on the periphery of the lung.

416
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:42,850
So this, as I'm sure you probably guessed, is mesothelioma,

417
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:50,710
which is a neoplasm of those viso filial cells that are normally a single flat or single layer on the outside of the lung.

418
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:55,030
This one that I showed you is kind of papillary mesothelioma,

419
00:42:55,030 --> 00:43:04,089
where it's it's just looks like a tree almost on it's just on this outside portion that these can become invasive into the lung itself.

420
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:11,410
So there's different patterns of mesothelioma, but the underlying pathology is a neoplastic proliferation of measles cellular cells.

421
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:16,000
And this is another reminder for morphologic diagnoses for a neoplasm.

422
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,410
It's just the name of the neoplasm. There's no you don't say mild.

423
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:23,590
Get a little mild touch of mesothelioma, nothing to worry about.

424
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:29,500
The modifiers don't really make any sense anymore. So it's a it's a just the name of the neoplasm.

425
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:33,100
Certain tumors of it's not clear from the name of the tumor,

426
00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:40,330
you would add a modifier that benign or malignant if you can determine this from the histology, but it's basically just the neoplasm.

427
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:48,960
Okay. But I'm not going to show you again a neoplasm on your exam because it gets a little complicated because the histology gets so distorted.

428
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:56,440
This is a reminder. Well, this is related to the asbestos pathology we talked about before.

429
00:43:56,460 --> 00:44:01,170
So we talked about asbestos fibers penetrating through the alveolar walls and

430
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:05,790
reaching the periphery where they form a source of chronic inflammatory stimulus.

431
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:09,810
So that guides are that drives our fibrosis accumulation.

432
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:14,520
But the other thing they can do there, the measles live cells are sitting right there.

433
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:19,800
Their epithelial cells like like we talked about before, but they're on the plural surface.

434
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:24,840
And the asbestos fibers also form a chronic irritant from these Ophelia's cells.

435
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:29,580
So now they have an in almost acting like a tumor promoter, there's an increased rate of proliferation.

436
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,440
The mechanism,

437
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:42,060
the specific mechanism of carcinogenesis for mesothelioma cells is still a little debated and probably multiple of these processes are in play.

438
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:48,990
So, as I said, can act as a tumor promoter because you're just irritating the medial thallium and they're replicating more frequently.

439
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:56,220
So then our general rule, every time you a cell divides, it has a potential for a spontaneous mutation to occur.

440
00:44:56,610 --> 00:45:05,220
So that's one mechanism. There's also got to be kind of a unique type of mechanism, some because of the linear aspect of it.

441
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:12,990
It's thought that perhaps the linear fibers can mechanically disrupt the mitotic spindles when those cells divide.

442
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:19,350
So you're essentially you're essentially like creating a chromosomal defect by messing up the mitotic spindle.

443
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:28,290
I think that's based on in vitro assays with asbestos fibers, and that would be a real difficult thing to prove in vivo.

444
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:32,790
But that's one potential mechanism. And then another one is that through?

445
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:37,200
I don't think that the steps of this are really well, really well worked out.

446
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:44,609
But there's also evidence that asbestos can alter epigenetic methylation patterns and so can alter gene expression,

447
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:49,440
not by causing mutation necessarily, but by altered epigenomic profiles.

448
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:51,900
So a lot of different mechanisms,

449
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:59,820
but certainly it's definitively shown that asbestos is also in addition to being a pro fibrotic agent of carcinogenic risk.

450
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:09,780
So finally over. Yeah, this is your reminder slide or review slide of stuff in the lung stuff too.

451
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:12,210
No, in the lung. As far as pathology.

452
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:20,040
So remember we showed that first side of the race in about acute damage, that the virus has some description of that there.

453
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:24,030
And you'll have to know the pathogenesis of one toxicant that can cause that.

454
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:32,520
And remember, pathogenesis starts with the agent goes through the chemical or mechanical pathway, and it ends with the pathology that you see.

455
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:38,670
Look at that last part. Okay. We talked about type two tumor site hyperplasia, which is the repair phase.

456
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:45,540
We talked about pulmonary fibrosis. And I gave you a lot of different distributions related to particular toxicology.

457
00:46:45,810 --> 00:46:51,330
So understanding the difference between levels and then this was a reminder about the sound

458
00:46:51,330 --> 00:46:57,810
alikes that would trip you up here and you don't need to recognize the neoplasm mesothelioma.

459
00:46:58,410 --> 00:47:02,700
Yeah. Is it fair to say fibers, firings of scab, of fibrosis in the scar?

460
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:09,900
Think about that for a second. And, yeah, fibrin is a clot.

461
00:47:10,910 --> 00:47:22,160
So yeah, I'm like on the outside, the Legion is a little bit more than that because it's also sort of the dried epithelial debris, I guess you'd say.

462
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:26,780
Okay. Fibrin. And there's fibrin in there.

463
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:35,540
Underneath there. But fibrin very specifically is the protein product, the foundation of the clot in a vessel,

464
00:47:35,990 --> 00:47:39,580
because you don't want that hemorrhage to continue using our block it up with a solid structure.

465
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:48,140
So it's a clot. Okay. I mean, I wouldn't describe it as, you know, it's scabbing inside of your body.

466
00:47:50,090 --> 00:47:55,760
And I mean, yeah, like a scab. I think more of this on the surface of the epithelium.

467
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:02,840
So it's a combination of like dead epithelial cells, inflammatory cells, and then underneath that is a clot.

468
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:12,410
But the scab which the pathology word isn't as sure as CAGR,

469
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:21,200
a scab can actually persist longer than a fibrin clot because like the scab persists into the granulation tissue phase because it's kind of covering.

470
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:29,300
And then like when you're a kid, the 50 times you peel that off, all of a sudden it's healed all the granulation tissue underneath.

471
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:34,310
All right. Sometimes the things we talk about that's really interesting.

472
00:48:36,110 --> 00:48:40,790
Childhood memories. All right. Let's take a little break and then we'll do just neuro structure function.

473
00:48:49,290 --> 00:49:01,490
Yeah. That's what. I think it's good for the government.

474
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:05,590
I think it's the right thing. It's like a target for everybody.

475
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:10,530
You're going to have your diagnosis and this one competition for.

476
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:19,590
Oh, yeah. Oh, my God. Just think about what I just did.

477
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:23,550
Right. Yeah.

478
00:49:23,590 --> 00:49:28,410
So I. My God.

479
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:38,470
You know, so is like three different collections that are standing in line.

480
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:43,590
Yeah, like, I don't want to sit there, like I've said.

481
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:53,630
Just heard you. There's a lot of them there.

482
00:49:53,950 --> 00:50:03,700
I guess I should say, like if you had something to like, I'm just like pull ups, you know, like, oh,

483
00:50:03,830 --> 00:50:10,840
you know, maybe I didn't read the garbage section and I just didn't know that I saw that today.

484
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:19,090
I was like, I was like, Oh, I see. The other guys like that are official myself because I was actually, you know,

485
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:25,980
I was an extra and there's a lot of that person type thing I think that oh yeah, yeah.

486
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:31,740
So I just remember just like all.

487
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:37,370
And probably they'll be fine in my actually finals.

488
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:44,670
So I don't know how in my body I can see that for myself.

489
00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:56,890
I think when you're when you're in your belly that you are just based on like those three guys there.

490
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:02,910
Yeah. So I didn't say I wasn't aware of that.

491
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:11,220
Right. Of course, you know, that was the same thing. I knew that because of is and to other people that he was no longer.

492
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:28,800
Yeah, actually, I think just just to make sure that we didn't have like some of them are actually one of them are working for.

493
00:51:35,730 --> 00:52:00,120
Yeah. I just heard about this from. I just had a busy working hours, cause it's a like you can work together.

494
00:52:00,390 --> 00:52:06,570
Yeah, yeah, I can do that. Do you have your first two potentials?

495
00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:37,860
Okay, wait. Let me bring. You know.

496
00:52:38,110 --> 00:52:45,430
I like to think so, yes.

497
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:57,470
Yes. And then. Yes, I guess that yeah, I do try to do so like again, we have an option to do a couple of.

498
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:03,520
Yeah, because my parents are taking us this weekend.

499
00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:07,130
I have to start the day after that semester.

500
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:11,420
I'm gonna get this. I'm like, I don't want to do that.

501
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:15,290
That's very good. Yes, that's I had heard that.

502
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:20,000
And it was because I don't know who's going to teach it next.

503
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:26,180
Yeah, I suppose. Yeah. I was planning on taking it to the streets is pretty.

504
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:32,000
Okay. Like, um. This is more like house.

505
00:53:34,190 --> 00:53:45,620
But instead it's pretty much what you want is just a lot of regression analysis and it's time do this

506
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:58,549
thing called databases literally organized essentially some of the material that is not used to tell you.

507
00:53:58,550 --> 00:54:02,030
How was that? I just I was going to take this next year.

508
00:54:03,110 --> 00:54:06,390
I'm sorry.

509
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:19,490
This is more I think I just it's this, you know, it doesn't matter that it is hard,

510
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:29,720
you know, like for all medical services, we have to like it is all Chinese because.

511
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:42,730
The person. Yeah. Yeah, there's smoke, and that's like an orgasm.

512
00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:54,920
Yeah. I mean, so. Mostly because I have three boys already, which is a lot of three.

513
00:54:54,990 --> 00:54:59,150
And then I have to stop.

514
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:04,610
Yeah, I start falling asleep.

515
00:55:05,370 --> 00:55:09,290
Oh, yeah? Yeah. Just seeing this, I don't know.

516
00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:18,320
Let's start with you and what's happening in the streets in times.

517
00:55:18,350 --> 00:55:23,940
So you'll be treated last living and.

518
00:55:25,390 --> 00:55:30,280
Which I. Yeah, you're right. Oh, sorry.

519
00:55:33,590 --> 00:55:36,880
Yeah, I said I.

520
00:55:38,490 --> 00:55:45,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

521
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:50,640
It's like it it's true.

522
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:58,580
And it's the European experience.

523
00:55:59,370 --> 00:56:07,810
We had some your introduction to taste.

524
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:15,530
It's really a very high class in our lives that are just really frustrating because it's so annoying.

525
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:21,710
So that shows that. Yes, because for me it's well, it's a surprise.

526
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:30,780
It's it's like I guess. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

527
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:34,650
Know it's not exactly true.

528
00:56:34,650 --> 00:56:38,040
It not so that you can really change.

529
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:41,520
It's like I'm like this so stupid.

530
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:50,670
As long as I keep my feelings and you think about yeah, yeah, yeah.

531
00:56:51,090 --> 00:56:54,930
I mean, yeah.

532
00:56:55,200 --> 00:57:01,280
But to me it's like they're not to try to, you know, so it's a good like, like surgery,

533
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:10,379
the usual lectures between one and then they come by and after a few minutes don't stop.

534
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:17,250
Yeah. And Yes. And then decide this class and I think that's a good combination.

535
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:25,100
So all the other industrial action or something is something like because of this job.

536
00:57:25,830 --> 00:57:35,870
And then I have only the lectures and she's been working.

537
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:41,550
I was all this. You know, and I think you.

538
00:57:46,090 --> 00:57:57,650
That's not what you would. Yeah, that's right.

539
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:08,020
These young guys. Yeah. Studies like this in general.

540
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:19,600
I like the idea that you have even more face to face and you won't have that.

541
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:26,780
It's just that there's more.

542
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:32,410
They try to be that. But there's one thing I want to talk about.

543
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:46,620
Running back to my. Because you have no idea how these are different.

544
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:50,160
There has been plenty of work to be done.

545
00:58:52,650 --> 00:59:01,800
My feeling is just that our lives are just really going.

546
00:59:04,650 --> 00:59:10,930
Like his undergraduate that he's really mad about.

547
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:16,050
Guys, let's start wrapping it up so we can finish on time.

548
00:59:17,070 --> 00:59:20,100
Yeah, whatever you want, you know.

549
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:24,300
But definitely not. Essentially, I don't know, like so many years.

550
00:59:24,450 --> 00:59:29,830
What? You didn't yesterday. Yeah, but I.

551
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:34,230
I really don't. Okay. All right.

552
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:42,000
So we're going to switch gears first, along with our minds forward.

553
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:46,650
I'm going to do the nervous system, just the structure function portion today.

554
00:59:47,610 --> 00:59:54,360
So there's not a lot there's a little bit at the end, but there's not a lot of histology actually in this lecture as I'm concentrating a little

555
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:59,370
bit bigger picture on just the kind of organizational structure of the nervous system.

556
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:08,580
The nervous system, because all the cells or the cells are composition of interacting tracts.

557
01:00:08,970 --> 01:00:13,230
And so understanding the sort of bigger picture organization of the nervous system is

558
01:00:13,230 --> 01:00:20,400
particularly important in understanding how a pathology lesion is going to affect the organism.

559
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:26,519
So next week, when we talk about neuropathology, we're going to actually see a little more histology.

560
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:33,240
Then I'm going to walk you through like what all those all the basic processes look like in the nervous system.

561
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:40,260
But the important thing to understand about the nervous system is even though the pathology can look kind of the same in different areas,

562
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:44,940
the manifestation for the organism pivotal depends on where it occurs.

563
01:00:45,390 --> 01:00:48,420
So is it in the brain? Is it in the peripheral nervous system?

564
01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:56,400
Is it in a particular area of the brain? So the clinical symptoms of nervous system pathology are related, are very related to location.

565
01:00:56,970 --> 01:01:03,360
So like if you start studying neuroscience or if you go into clinical neurology,

566
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:10,620
a lot of what you spend your time doing is localizing things because of the nervous system being so interconnected.

567
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:13,980
The clinical findings kind of point to where the damage is.

568
01:01:14,250 --> 01:01:18,900
So we're going to understand at a very kind of overview level, what is that organization?

569
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:30,120
Okay, so starting pretty basic, we know that the nervous system can basically be divided structurally into a central and a peripheral nervous system.

570
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:36,090
We know that the central nervous system is comprised of the brain and spinal cord.

571
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:40,500
Forget about the spinal cord sometimes of yours, where people think that's part of the peripheral nervous system.

572
01:01:40,650 --> 01:01:43,710
It's not the central nervous system, the brain and spinal cord.

573
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:49,920
And then the peripheral nervous system are essentially nerves, what we call nerves.

574
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:58,619
Right. And the nerves essentially are the zonal tracts of neural cell body.

575
01:01:58,620 --> 01:02:06,630
So if you look think of a nerve in the periphery, like with your object, that's basically a long aggregation of external tracks.

576
01:02:06,990 --> 01:02:10,020
So they're the information highways of the nervous system,

577
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:16,799
and they're going to be bringing information to nerve cell bodies that are either

578
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:22,230
located in the brain or spinal cord in the central nervous system or their highways,

579
01:02:22,230 --> 01:02:25,470
bringing information away from those areas to the periphery.

580
01:02:26,610 --> 01:02:34,829
Okay. It's not like we only have neurons in the brain and spinal cord, but that's a major site for the nerves,

581
01:02:34,830 --> 01:02:39,330
the neural cell bodies that are feeding into and out of these zonal tracts.

582
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:46,800
We also have nerves in the periphery. Instructor is called ganglia, which are little aggregates of neural cell bodies.

583
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:53,700
But then the nerve, the nerves, what we're calling nerves clinically are axons extending from those cell body areas.

584
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:57,959
Okay. So we're going to think about like these are very specialized cells with long processes.

585
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:03,870
So that governs some of the larger picture structure. So there are structural and structural divisions.

586
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:11,520
And then you can also think of them in terms of functional divisions. So the nerves, the axonal tracks that I just talked about, give me heading,

587
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:18,390
bringing sensory information to the central areas or sending motor information to the periphery.

588
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:20,790
Okay. So that's one functional division.

589
01:03:21,870 --> 01:03:31,410
And then with respect to the motor pathways, the type of information that's being conveyed to the periphery also is another functional division.

590
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:38,880
So motor outputs can be part of the somatic or the autonomic nervous system.

591
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:42,179
So these mean there they have structural counterparts,

592
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:50,999
but these are functional divisions and the somatic nervous system is the functional division that controls voluntary activities.

593
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:56,400
So it's going to go to skeletal muscle like your peripheral muscles to control your voluntary activities.

594
01:03:57,780 --> 01:04:02,610
And autonomic nervous system controls involuntary activities.

595
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:07,010
So as output on other. Nerves. It has outputs of smooth muscles.

596
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:14,840
So those are functional divisions. And then the autonomic nervous system, which is control of involuntary activities,

597
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:21,410
has still further functional divisions that relate to the type of involuntary activity that's being controlled.

598
01:04:22,430 --> 01:04:31,160
Okay. So you can think about the type of involuntary activity as being related to sympathetic stimulation or parasympathetic.

599
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:38,450
And the kind of shorthand way of understanding those sympathetic stimulation is related to a fight or flight response.

600
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:47,090
So you're increasing body activities like heart rate, maybe dilation of your pupil that you might need to get away from something scary or

601
01:04:47,090 --> 01:04:53,660
something threatening and parasympathetic stimulation controls rest and digest responses.

602
01:04:54,110 --> 01:04:59,269
So that would be like increasing salivary secretions, increasing activity in the GI tract,

603
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:05,570
which is actually a special offshoot of the autonomic nervous system called the enteric nervous system, which that autonomic function.

604
01:05:06,020 --> 01:05:12,020
But parasympathetic activities downplay the activities that you needed to run

605
01:05:12,020 --> 01:05:16,280
away from something and they're more for body internal maintenance functions.

606
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:20,480
Okay. So structural things and functional divisions.

607
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:27,260
So here again is another way of looking at those structural divisions, just kind of showing you brain and spinal cord is the central nervous system.

608
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:33,260
And then all the peripheral nerves, which are zonal tracts that are mediating, that are.

609
01:05:33,740 --> 01:05:40,490
Think of them as information highways mediating inputs between the CNS and the external or internal environment.

610
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:49,290
So this is the decision making area. But in order to receive information or convey it outside of that, you need the peripheral terms.

611
01:05:50,660 --> 01:06:01,070
Okay. Here are is again an illustration of those functional divisions of the peripheral nervous system divided between voluntary functions.

612
01:06:02,330 --> 01:06:08,450
And then there's a little caveat here. So I said the somatic nervous system controls voluntary functions,

613
01:06:08,450 --> 01:06:15,140
and I depicted that as information coming from the central nervous system to the skeletal muscle.

614
01:06:15,710 --> 01:06:19,970
Not all of that information. Like I get a stimulus from the environment.

615
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,030
I don't know. I touch this. It's hot. Well, that's a bad example.

616
01:06:23,030 --> 01:06:30,349
I want to pick that thing up. So I look at that, and then my brain decides what I'm going to do, sends a motor output.

617
01:06:30,350 --> 01:06:39,290
I move my hand to pick this thing up. If this was not my first example, that doesn't have that message, doesn't have to go all the way to my brain.

618
01:06:40,010 --> 01:06:46,549
There are actually reflex arcs so my sensory nerves can go through my through the periphery to my

619
01:06:46,550 --> 01:06:53,730
spinal cord and then arc back to motor neurons in my spinal cord to tell my hand to be taken away.

620
01:06:53,730 --> 01:06:57,020
So that's a faster arc, doesn't have to go all the way up to the brain,

621
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:04,850
but that still is considered kind of a somatic response because it's still going to innovate skeletal muscle to tell me to move my hand away.

622
01:07:05,210 --> 01:07:10,680
I have no higher cognitive processing necessary, though, to know to do that, but it's still a motor.

623
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:18,050
Okay, so but voluntary functions are motor reflexes, so mostly affecting your peripheral muscles, okay.

624
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:24,020
As opposed to the autonomic nervous system, which is mostly going to impact smooth muscle.

625
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:28,460
Right. Remember, we had smooth muscle mass that controlled our involuntary functions.

626
01:07:28,910 --> 01:07:38,660
So things like heart rate perspiration. And then this is a good example of the muscles of the iris in your eye, sera, the colored part of your eye.

627
01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:47,570
Your iris is actually two circles of muscle, so it has a circle of muscle on the inside that can actually cause people to constrict.

628
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:52,280
And then it has a circle on the outside that can actually cause the people to dilate.

629
01:07:53,060 --> 01:08:00,170
And so the output, the two output arms of the autonomic nervous system differentially innervate those two circular muscles.

630
01:08:00,470 --> 01:08:08,270
So if you have parasympathetic stimulation, you know, after Thanksgiving or sit back is going to eat or whatever you do,

631
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:13,190
and that's going to cause the people to constrict, decrease the amount of light coming in.

632
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:17,479
You're not as interested in getting information from your environment versus sympathetic stimulation,

633
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:22,160
which is going to pull that muscle back out to dull, smooth muscle.

634
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:30,710
Yes. So the autonomic nervous system I've talked about mostly in terms of motor output,

635
01:08:31,220 --> 01:08:36,410
it does receive sensory input, but that's going to go to the control centers in the brain.

636
01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:44,390
Okay. So the sensory input that's going to feed autonomic response comes from chemo receptors like in the viscera.

637
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:51,140
So if you're eating certain types of food, you're going to have a chemical signal and that's going to send signals back to the central nervous system.

638
01:08:51,180 --> 01:08:53,330
It's going to give an autonomic motor output.

639
01:08:54,020 --> 01:09:03,920
And then there are also sensory relays in the brain stem itself that mediate autonomic outputs, and that is mostly in charge of integrating in.

640
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:09,490
Formation from the outside and coordinating the x, the x, the motor response.

641
01:09:10,110 --> 01:09:21,220
Then here are our major outputs. I don't mention it very much, but one sort of branch of the autonomic system is the enteric nervous system,

642
01:09:22,420 --> 01:09:27,970
which has some reflex arcs in the nerve in the gut itself,

643
01:09:28,780 --> 01:09:36,550
and is a combination of sort of local ganglia and local your local arcs and chemo receptors.

644
01:09:36,590 --> 01:09:42,220
So I don't have time to go too much into it, but essentially it's another sort of branch of that autonomic function.

645
01:09:44,250 --> 01:09:49,440
Okay. So this is the overview of the structural aspects of the autonomic system.

646
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:54,330
So we said it's involuntary functions. There are two main output systems.

647
01:09:54,870 --> 01:10:03,510
So first, the sympathetic are the fight or flight responses, the central nervous system control.

648
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:12,990
So the original cell bodies that taken this information, that taken this information and are going to send a motor output for the sympathetic system,

649
01:10:13,830 --> 01:10:21,719
the freeze that oh I should back up all the motor outputs for the system involve a presynaptic neuron or a cell body in a certain area,

650
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:28,410
sending out an axon that synapses on another neuron and then that goes through the target organ.

651
01:10:28,650 --> 01:10:33,180
So there's two neuron, essentially two neurons involved in these outputs.

652
01:10:33,570 --> 01:10:38,160
And where they are differ is between the sympathetic or the parasympathetic system.

653
01:10:39,390 --> 01:10:43,220
So for the sympathetic system, the presynaptic neuron,

654
01:10:43,230 --> 01:10:51,450
so the first neuron in the chain have nuclei in the thoracic and lumbar portions of the spinal cord, sort of the mid portions of the spinal cord.

655
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:59,640
And then their presynaptic neuron is relatively short and actually goes and sends signals to ganglia.

656
01:10:59,710 --> 01:11:07,380
So these are collections of neuron cell bodies that are located in a structure that parallels the spinal cord.

657
01:11:07,390 --> 01:11:11,520
But it's not in the spinal cord itself. That's called the sympathetic trunk.

658
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:17,340
It's just a collection of nerve cell bodies in a sympathetic trunk.

659
01:11:18,030 --> 01:11:25,200
And that's where the presynaptic neuron synapses are to a second neuron, which is the post synaptic neuron.

660
01:11:26,010 --> 01:11:29,430
And then that is going to go and sit onto the smooth muscle.

661
01:11:29,430 --> 01:11:33,420
That is that is its target of two neurons.

662
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:37,980
These are in the mid portion of the spinal cord and then hit the sympathetic trunk.

663
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:46,890
And at both of those synapses, the major neurotransmitter that's sent across at both of those synaptic areas is acetylcholine.

664
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:51,180
It's kind of at the very bottom here. You can't see it very well.

665
01:11:51,180 --> 01:11:55,710
Acetylcholine. It'll be on your slide in the lecture.

666
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,620
Okay. So it's sympathetic fight or flight.

667
01:11:59,610 --> 01:12:06,170
The parasympathetic system, the originating cell bodies for the posts, for the presynaptic neurons are in different locations.

668
01:12:06,180 --> 01:12:11,850
They are in the brain stem and also in the sacral spinal cord picks up higher and lower.

669
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:24,210
And then they, in contrast, have a long presynaptic neuron and its synapses on a postsynaptic neuron that's near or actually in the target tissue.

670
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:32,760
So there are like more kind of dispersed in the periphery. Oops, I didn't stop me when I misspeak.

671
01:12:32,850 --> 01:12:38,040
What did I do wrong with the synaptic? With the sympathetic one the postsynaptic is for?

672
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:41,630
Yes. Just stop me and I'm on a roll.

673
01:12:42,870 --> 01:12:47,550
So that is very, very wrong. That means the postsynaptic neuron.

674
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:49,820
So that's an important difference. Something different on the slide.

675
01:12:49,830 --> 01:12:56,580
So I don't know why I screwed it up, but the postsynaptic neuron utilizes norepinephrine, which is an excitatory neurotransmitter.

676
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:01,810
So that's going to tell the body to dilate the pupil, increase the heart rate.

677
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:07,170
It actually inhibits things like digestive activity that's getting you ready to run.

678
01:13:07,350 --> 01:13:12,929
Okay. I'm really disappointed I screwed that up. Norepinephrine different every other one.

679
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:16,790
So that makes it easy to remember. Every other one is acetylcholine.

680
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:23,709
Some sense. Maybe that will make it easier to remember since I did it wrong.

681
01:13:23,710 --> 01:13:26,830
But I did that for you.

682
01:13:29,770 --> 01:13:34,490
Oh, the generosity. Okay, so the.

683
01:13:34,510 --> 01:13:37,680
Okay, so different locations, right? For the cell body.

684
01:13:37,690 --> 01:13:44,860
So you can already imagine that the clinical manifestations, like if you have injury to the spinal cord,

685
01:13:46,060 --> 01:13:54,660
pivotal need depend on where that injury can be located and especially in terms that these systems have a little bit of yin and yang to them.

686
01:13:54,670 --> 01:14:01,070
So the activation of one tends to inhibit the other. So you can have things like if you have injury, I mean,

687
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:09,370
if you have injury high in the brainstem sometimes that you don't survive that because that has critical functions for respiration of your heart,

688
01:14:09,370 --> 01:14:15,370
for the heart. But if you have injury to the parasympathetic system, you kind of end up with unopposed,

689
01:14:15,370 --> 01:14:22,120
sympathetic input and you can actually have sort of hyper responses of the sympathetic system that reflect this injury.

690
01:14:22,510 --> 01:14:26,860
So again, without getting into too much of the weeds where the location is,

691
01:14:26,860 --> 01:14:34,570
where the location of damages peverley effects, how nervous system injury manifest manifests.

692
01:14:36,190 --> 01:14:38,679
So like if you're doing for those of you interested in med school,

693
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:46,629
a lot of your time in neurology or neurology like the kind of academic portion of it or when you're learning is learning of a

694
01:14:46,630 --> 01:14:56,500
patient shows this signs where in the nervous system is the lesion likely to be okay so that was autonomic nervous system,

695
01:14:56,500 --> 01:15:06,159
brain structural divisions. So it's kind of a weird color coded diagram of a human brain versus a rodent brain,

696
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:10,840
obviously not to scale, but kind of color coded for the analogous structures.

697
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:18,160
So in mammals, a lot of most of the mammalian brains have essentially analogous structures.

698
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:24,550
But depending on which portions of the brain are more important for a given species and depending on the anatomy of the animal's head,

699
01:15:25,690 --> 01:15:31,150
it's going to look a little bit different. So like a rodent, you know, as a very kind of stretched out head.

700
01:15:32,020 --> 01:15:36,610
So its brain is a little bit more flat versus a primate where everything's very upright.

701
01:15:37,570 --> 01:15:43,840
The cerebral cortex is sort of sitting on top of the spinal cord rather than the sort of straight shot that you see in a rodent.

702
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:47,379
But it's color coded, so you can kind of see the analogous areas.

703
01:15:47,380 --> 01:15:54,070
And in a human there is more surface area to the cerebral cortex, to the higher processing center.

704
01:15:54,070 --> 01:16:00,660
So it's felt to give it that surface area because you're limited by the skull, it's folded into these silicone gyri okay.

705
01:16:01,030 --> 01:16:08,469
In a rodent, they don't have those little kind of. GYRI They won't listen to the phallic or a smooth cerebral cortex, but it serves the same function.

706
01:16:08,470 --> 01:16:11,560
They just don't have to do as complex activities.

707
01:16:12,310 --> 01:16:21,160
Okay. So the brain itself obviously has two hemispheres that comprise the cerebral cortex through the main higher processing center.

708
01:16:21,220 --> 01:16:26,170
So it's the green thing in both species and this is sort of cut in half.

709
01:16:26,170 --> 01:16:30,990
So like if this were intact, we would just see the cerebral cortex covering everything inside.

710
01:16:31,540 --> 01:16:39,610
But it's cut in half. To show you a couple of things, there's a junction of white matter between the two sides of the cerebral hemisphere.

711
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:43,270
So there's the corpus callosum, which is pink here.

712
01:16:43,430 --> 01:16:46,540
It's actually white in an actual image.

713
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:51,100
And that's kind of a highway of information between the two sides of the cortex.

714
01:16:51,580 --> 01:17:02,140
Okay. Exchange of information. I'm actually kind of an aside an interesting point is that it's not 100% necessary to have that junction.

715
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:10,120
There's actually some for people who have epilepsy, which is a pathology where there's x cytotoxicity of neurons.

716
01:17:10,330 --> 01:17:16,600
So if abnormal excesses of neural activity in neurons in one area that can spread to other areas in the brain.

717
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:25,450
So people are very severe forms of epilepsy where a seizure starts in one hemisphere and can spread to the other and can be very debilitating.

718
01:17:25,450 --> 01:17:32,650
One kind of radical treatment for those that are not responsive to pharmaceutical control is actually to sever the corpus callosum.

719
01:17:33,550 --> 01:17:38,800
And the the benefit of that is that it can't spread to the other hemisphere.

720
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:43,270
So it tends to not let you have those seizures, or at least less severe.

721
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:50,680
But there are certain kind of processing deficits that if you're just talking to a person, you wouldn't notice.

722
01:17:51,130 --> 01:17:58,000
But you can measure, like showing that there was awareness in one hemisphere and not the other, but it's not necessary to have that communication.

723
01:17:58,490 --> 01:18:01,959
The other kind of weird thing about that is that I'm not insignificant.

724
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:09,490
Number of people genetically can generally have some defects of the corpus callosum, so maybe not complete,

725
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:18,760
but they either have a deficient or a hyperplastic corpus callosum, or in some cases it's absent and that can become manifested in certain ways.

726
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:20,050
But a lot of times you wouldn't know.

727
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:27,460
Unless you put someone in a situation where they can only get input from what to one hemisphere and then the other hemisphere is not aware of it.

728
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:36,010
It's kind of put aside. So corpus callosum is the white matter junction between hemispheres and then the brain stem

729
01:18:36,010 --> 01:18:41,670
itself has another has a structure at the top that's referred to as the DI and Cephalon.

730
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:46,840
Just in terms of how it forms during development. And that's sort of like a stem.

731
01:18:47,170 --> 01:18:53,260
It's actually easiest to understand if you look at the rodent brain, that sort of is bluish structure here.

732
01:18:54,850 --> 01:19:01,580
The top of it is the thalamus, which is a structure that modifies output of the cortex.

733
01:19:01,630 --> 01:19:10,090
I'm going to talk about that in a section in a second. But the thalamus modifies cross-talk with the cortex and modifies cortical output.

734
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:12,760
That's the light blue thing here, sort of at the top.

735
01:19:13,420 --> 01:19:20,860
And then the next structure, the dark blue thing is the midbrain, sort of a junction between the brainstem and the thalamus.

736
01:19:20,860 --> 01:19:28,990
And then the other is sort of various shades of blue are part of the brain stem, the pons and the medulla leading to the spinal cord.

737
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:38,980
These areas of the brain tend to control more autonomic functions, so they're the site side of the parasympathetic output that we just talked about.

738
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:46,450
The pons is actually a relay structure between the cerebral cortex and the cerebellum, so it's coordinating information between those two.

739
01:19:46,570 --> 01:19:48,280
It has respiratory centers in there.

740
01:19:49,060 --> 01:19:56,980
The medulla oblongata coordinates information between the upper portions of the brain, between the brain, the spinal cord.

741
01:19:57,100 --> 01:20:03,040
It's also a relay center and again, control of involuntary functions.

742
01:20:03,310 --> 01:20:06,490
So in this brain summary of the brain, there are sleep centers.

743
01:20:06,910 --> 01:20:13,600
It's the emesis center. So it has chemo receptors for vomiting or for like when you're dealing with nausea,

744
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:18,580
there's emesis centers in that area and it also controls things like heart rate,

745
01:20:19,900 --> 01:20:26,830
respiratory rate and general state of awareness, like a week, weeks, sleep cycles.

746
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:36,069
So that's kind of involuntary functions of the brain. Also in this sort of stem, we have other structures near the thalamus.

747
01:20:36,070 --> 01:20:42,070
We have the hypothalamus, which is kind of pink at the bay at the back of the thalamus here,

748
01:20:42,940 --> 01:20:47,980
which controls also kind of automatic functions like body temperature.

749
01:20:48,550 --> 01:20:52,450
It has some endocrine functions as well and then an offshoot.

750
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:58,990
So in the rodents, that's just at the base of the brain. So they've kind of taken this thalamus and turned it this way.

751
01:20:59,770 --> 01:21:05,259
So it's sort of like this because everything stretched out and kind of connected to.

752
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:12,579
But extending actually below the base of the brain is the pituitary gland that has a lot of crosstalk with the hypothalamus.

753
01:21:12,580 --> 01:21:16,990
So there's the pituitary gland. It's very endocrine, illogically important.

754
01:21:17,470 --> 01:21:26,290
So it has functions like producing hormones that affect growth rate and other endocrinology functions, other hormones that affect the adrenal gland.

755
01:21:26,860 --> 01:21:33,280
So it's an endocrine function for the most part. The other structure it's really hard to see here is the pineal gland.

756
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:37,660
It's like a light yellow structure between the cortex and the cerebellum.

757
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:43,270
So the rodents, it just sits there right between the cortex and the cerebellum in the human, it's in the same location,

758
01:21:43,270 --> 01:21:50,169
but things have been twisted around, so it's deeper in the brain, but the pineal gland is related to your circadian rhythms.

759
01:21:50,170 --> 01:21:56,200
So responding to light cycles. So again, kind of endocrine illogic function.

760
01:21:57,640 --> 01:22:02,200
And then we have the hippocampus which supposedly looks like a seahorse,

761
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:11,649
but I've never really been able to see it just kind of a curved structure like a see I guess in both the human and human and other mammalian brains.

762
01:22:11,650 --> 01:22:15,610
And that's one of the major areas for long term memory.

763
01:22:16,030 --> 01:22:22,630
So there's a lot of neurons that develop with potentiation structures or interfaces that are related to memory.

764
01:22:22,870 --> 01:22:30,190
So the hippocampus important for learning. And then at the base of the brain, we have the cerebellar cortex.

765
01:22:30,820 --> 01:22:33,250
So cerebral cortex with the two cerebral hemispheres,

766
01:22:33,250 --> 01:22:40,030
cerebellar cortex is in the back of the brain and this structure is involved with coordination and balance.

767
01:22:40,420 --> 01:22:44,230
So it's going to modify some of the motor outputs, some things happen more smoothly,

768
01:22:44,470 --> 01:22:49,600
and it also helps with your proper receptive awareness of where your body is in relation to the outside.

769
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:58,300
And then the spinal cord has areas of gray matter and white matter, so it has neurons and zonal tracts.

770
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:04,030
So it's kind of both an offshoot allowing neurons to be closer to the side of action.

771
01:23:04,030 --> 01:23:11,950
So that's where those reflex arcs come into play. And then the white matter provides a highway of information to get to the distal

772
01:23:11,950 --> 01:23:17,649
partitions of the body and to feed into the periphery the ventricle system,

773
01:23:17,650 --> 01:23:19,960
which is not shown well in this diagram I'm going to show you.

774
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:29,180
A separate diagram of the ventricle system are spaces in the brain that contain fluid, cerebrospinal fluid that acts as a buffer for the brain itself.

775
01:23:30,050 --> 01:23:34,850
So the cerebral spinal fluid circulates through the ventricle systems and around the brain.

776
01:23:35,780 --> 01:23:39,140
Brains contained in the cranium, hard structure.

777
01:23:39,380 --> 01:23:44,630
And so you don't and it's very sensitive tissue, so you don't want it to be buffeted by injury.

778
01:23:45,470 --> 01:23:55,280
So it provides a more fluid buffer. And it also is a means of transmitting or conveying metabolites or nutrients that the brain needs to other areas.

779
01:23:55,670 --> 01:24:00,660
So ventricle system will look in a moment. Okay.

780
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:05,320
So the cortex itself, if you're looking at a growth image of the brain.

781
01:24:05,820 --> 01:24:08,940
So there's this kind of slice through the brain looking straight at it.

782
01:24:09,270 --> 01:24:15,150
You can get the sense that there's a difference in color, right, between the outside of these small kind gyri.

783
01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:21,930
I know it's kind of washed out on here. And then you have sort of what looks like the stork of a tree coming from the inner portions.

784
01:24:22,350 --> 01:24:27,510
So there's our cortex and the medullary areas, the inner areas.

785
01:24:28,020 --> 01:24:37,200
So the cerebral cortex is the site of most of the neurons in the in the brain and in development.

786
01:24:37,260 --> 01:24:40,950
This is a neuro epithelium layer, layer that becomes folded.

787
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:44,849
And the organization of neurons, even though it looks like they're all just thrown on there,

788
01:24:44,850 --> 01:24:48,480
they're actually in a very organized layer, a set of layers.

789
01:24:48,930 --> 01:24:55,170
So from the outside, if I were to take this section and look at it, histologically just in that outer portion of the cortex,

790
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:59,560
I have different layers that are a number here of neurons that have different functions.

791
01:24:59,580 --> 01:25:02,700
There's interactions between the layers and that organization.

792
01:25:02,700 --> 01:25:06,210
That structure is important for normal brain function.

793
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:14,070
So like some nerve. Neurodevelopmental defects stem from a failure of migration of these layers during development.

794
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:17,160
So if you have disruption of that nice ordered layering,

795
01:25:17,460 --> 01:25:26,160
you could have either cognitive deficits or you can have functional deficits and maybe some exciter toxicity, like some mechanisms of epilepsy.

796
01:25:26,430 --> 01:25:30,450
So even though it looks like just random distribution, there's actually a layering to it.

797
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:34,580
So that's the gray matter and all look sort of yellow here.

798
01:25:34,590 --> 01:25:43,170
But essentially it's a darker matter on the outside. And the gray matter essentially is the area of greater concentration, like nerve cell bodies.

799
01:25:43,470 --> 01:25:47,880
That's where the cell bodies are in the gray matter, and then the axons are the white matter.

800
01:25:48,690 --> 01:25:54,930
So the white part comes from the fact that most of what you're seeing is the myelin covering for the axons.

801
01:25:55,080 --> 01:26:00,840
So it's kind of lighter, softer material. And this is information going to and from the cortex.

802
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:05,220
So in the brain gray matter and the outside white matter on the inside.

803
01:26:07,350 --> 01:26:15,680
We talked about at the top of the stuff, one, we have the thalamus and also in the dying stuff alone, we have structures called basal ganglia.

804
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:21,990
So ganglia in the nervous system means a collection of nerve cell bodies.

805
01:26:22,530 --> 01:26:26,910
Another word that you'll see in reference to the nervous system is nucleus.

806
01:26:26,940 --> 01:26:33,370
You got to be careful here. So caudate nucleus, it doesn't mean a nucleus like we talk about in a cell.

807
01:26:33,630 --> 01:26:37,080
Here it's referring to a collection of neural cell bodies.

808
01:26:37,660 --> 01:26:41,160
Okay, so when people talk about certain nucleus structures in the brain,

809
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:46,590
like something like nuclei or something, the nucleus is referring to aggregates of cell bodies.

810
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:52,830
It's just the same word that they're using in a different context. It's not like one giant nucleus of a cell or anything.

811
01:26:53,970 --> 01:27:00,360
Okay. So the basal ganglia are structures that are outlined in this confusing diagram.

812
01:27:00,540 --> 01:27:04,890
They're in different areas, but they have an interconnected and coordinated role.

813
01:27:05,970 --> 01:27:09,810
So it's everything in blue here is comprised of a lot of different.

814
01:27:10,110 --> 01:27:14,970
I have it listed. Yeah, a lot of different aggregates of neural cell bodies.

815
01:27:15,450 --> 01:27:23,730
So there's the caudate nucleus. There's the pyramid and the globus pelvis, which are together referred to as the striatum.

816
01:27:24,090 --> 01:27:28,020
And there's the substantia nigra and the of nuclei at the bottom.

817
01:27:29,220 --> 01:27:39,600
So all together, basal ganglia and their job is actually to provide stimulatory or inhibitory modification of cortical outputs.

818
01:27:39,930 --> 01:27:44,460
And they do this through the thalamus. So what happens?

819
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:47,550
The cortex gets sensory information from the environment.

820
01:27:48,390 --> 01:27:58,260
So processing occurs and it makes a decision it's going to have a motor output cortex insecure needs some input from deeper structures in the brain.

821
01:27:58,770 --> 01:28:04,860
So it's going to communicate with these deeper structures and whether they give stimulatory or

822
01:28:04,860 --> 01:28:11,310
inhibitory signals is going to dictate the strength and the kind of nature of that cortical output.

823
01:28:13,110 --> 01:28:18,390
The information going back to the cortex default happens through the thalamus.

824
01:28:18,930 --> 01:28:24,300
And the one good way to remember this is the thalamus, sort of like a supervisor, and it's overenthusiastic.

825
01:28:24,420 --> 01:28:29,910
So its default pathway is to be excitatory to reinforce the cortical motor output.

826
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:38,400
So the default pathway, the thalamus is like you go cortex to your motor output to reinforce it in an excitatory way.

827
01:28:39,420 --> 01:28:43,140
The basal ganglia have all these arrows. You don't need to know all the interactions.

828
01:28:43,490 --> 01:28:48,450
The basal ganglia, through a complicated series of interactions with one another and with the thalamus,

829
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:52,950
can either reinforce that default output of the thalamus or inhibit it.

830
01:28:53,940 --> 01:28:57,180
Okay. So the basal ganglia is more modulatory in its output.

831
01:28:57,510 --> 01:29:04,060
It reinforces or inhibits. Of the lament output, and that's how the cortex cortical motor output is influenced.

832
01:29:06,160 --> 01:29:17,800
So the default excitatory impulse from the thalamus to the cortex is the hyperkinetic pathway of cortical motor output.

833
01:29:18,910 --> 01:29:21,960
You can think of it as the hyperkinetic pathway.

834
01:29:21,970 --> 01:29:28,840
You can think of it as giving a go signal. Go ahead. And particularly, it's important for initiating voluntary movement.

835
01:29:29,470 --> 01:29:40,420
So go grab that thing. I need that interaction and I need an excitatory stimulus from my thalamus to really make the motor output initiate,

836
01:29:41,980 --> 01:29:48,130
to inhibit that pathway and give a stop signal. That's the hyperkinetic pathway back to the cortex.

837
01:29:48,430 --> 01:29:52,480
And that is important as I get closer to my goal and I want to stop.

838
01:29:53,080 --> 01:29:56,500
So I need to have that output to stop my hand moving forward.

839
01:29:57,160 --> 01:30:02,550
Okay. So that's the hyperkinetic pathway. And so I'm not for this.

840
01:30:03,070 --> 01:30:08,650
The particular things that control that are very complicated and we're not going to learn them for this class,

841
01:30:09,010 --> 01:30:15,280
but it involves different systems of neurotransmitters, some of which are excitatory, others are inhibitory,

842
01:30:15,730 --> 01:30:20,500
and interactions between the various nuclei or the various regions of the basal ganglia,

843
01:30:21,970 --> 01:30:30,370
the substantia nigra or ones that the substantia nigra is also part of the basal ganglia and it produces kind of a not completely unique,

844
01:30:30,370 --> 01:30:32,890
but a different neurotransmitter called dopamine.

845
01:30:33,460 --> 01:30:41,310
And dopamine net effect is typically to reinforce the goal or the hyperkinetic pathway and to inhibit the stop.

846
01:30:41,620 --> 01:30:49,200
So that's the normal function of don't you know, your question of this is complicated, but yeah, this is all complicated.

847
01:30:49,210 --> 01:30:57,940
And so yeah, oversimplification but is like involuntary jerks are those mediated through this basal ganglia coordination?

848
01:30:58,360 --> 01:31:02,319
Like when you're just sitting there like do that. Yeah. You're just like your arm shooting forward.

849
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:08,710
I know this is like not sure that's actually a really good I well, I mean, cause that can't be,

850
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:13,600
it can't be a reflex arc per se, because it's not a response to environmental.

851
01:31:14,140 --> 01:31:18,040
But I don't actually know. Some of it is. I'll leave that up to you can look that up.

852
01:31:18,040 --> 01:31:22,989
I don't know if that's like a glitch of the basal ganglia or if that's just like a it could be.

853
01:31:22,990 --> 01:31:27,700
Some of the other things too probably does involve the basal ganglia in some way.

854
01:31:27,700 --> 01:31:31,209
I just don't know if the originating stimulus is through the basal ganglia.

855
01:31:31,210 --> 01:31:34,960
It's really good question or. Yeah, I don't know.

856
01:31:35,020 --> 01:31:38,620
That's a good one along the lines of the questions.

857
01:31:38,620 --> 01:31:47,860
So I told you the substantia nigra produces dopamine and the normal function of dopamine is to reinforce the hyperkinetic the goal signal.

858
01:31:48,670 --> 01:31:56,590
Does anyone know of a neurodegenerative disease that involves dopamine and the substantia nigra Parkinson's?

859
01:31:56,680 --> 01:32:03,669
Yeah, Parkinson's. So, like, that's actually degeneration of the neurons in the substantia nigra virus.

860
01:32:03,670 --> 01:32:06,730
You're decreasing the amount of dopamine produced.

861
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:10,660
Does anyone know? I mean, it depends how much you know about Parkinson's.

862
01:32:10,660 --> 01:32:17,290
So what are some of the symptoms of Parkinson's? What do you see? You see tremor, speech, loss, speechless.

863
01:32:17,740 --> 01:32:25,240
And then there's another one. Like if you read or see the movie version of that, like Oliver Sacks movie Awakenings,

864
01:32:25,240 --> 01:32:33,010
I think there's there's another one, a manifestation of Parkinson's where people get frozen or they get stuck.

865
01:32:33,310 --> 01:32:41,950
So, like, if you're if you get to a corner and you stop, they often have you get frozen and have trouble starting movement again.

866
01:32:42,460 --> 01:32:46,870
So once they start moving, that is easier for a person with Parkinson's.

867
01:32:47,110 --> 01:32:52,390
But people get frozen in place and that's because they're lacking dopamine.

868
01:32:53,380 --> 01:32:59,860
So the normal function of dopamine is to reinforce movement and to inhibit stop.

869
01:33:00,040 --> 01:33:05,679
When you lack dopamine, the stop works fine, but it's hard initiating that movement.

870
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:15,010
So once you stop, it's really hard to start again. So the freezing aspects of Parkinson's disease are often related to that lack of dopamine,

871
01:33:15,340 --> 01:33:21,310
and some of the drugs that are given are trying to replace that dopamine so that they can move again and become unfrozen.

872
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:28,430
It's the pathology in a real world, I guess. Okay.

873
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:36,590
So that basal ganglia related to our ability to start and stop motion, but there is more to motion than that.

874
01:33:36,680 --> 01:33:41,390
So I can start motion towards that thing, but think about all the ways my hand can move.

875
01:33:41,870 --> 01:33:47,600
I have to be able to move directly towards it in a smooth way and not just kind of iterate my way as I go.

876
01:33:48,140 --> 01:33:54,500
So cerebellum cerebellum is involved in coordination of that movement.

877
01:33:54,890 --> 01:34:00,470
So in large scale coordination for balance, but also in making this motion as I keep reaching over there.

878
01:34:00,740 --> 01:34:05,899
This is really weird on the video as I keep reaching towards and realizing that.

879
01:34:05,900 --> 01:34:12,140
Oh yeah. So Cerebellum is also involved in that smooth coordination of that movement.

880
01:34:12,150 --> 01:34:16,070
So making those fine corrections as I go. So basal ganglia, start.

881
01:34:16,070 --> 01:34:20,110
Stop. Cerebellum. The coordination and balance. Okay.

882
01:34:20,390 --> 01:34:26,299
The cerebellar structure is very similar to the cortex in that we have gray matter predominantly on the outside.

883
01:34:26,300 --> 01:34:32,120
So the neural cell bodies on the outside and the white matter below the outer cortex and the inner portion.

884
01:34:32,900 --> 01:34:38,750
It has a has fewer as a simpler layer is in the cortex and it's very distinctive looking and defined.

885
01:34:38,870 --> 01:34:42,500
So this is the fluorescent microscopy view of the cortex of the cerebellum.

886
01:34:43,670 --> 01:34:47,640
The first thing you see when you look at a section of cerebellum, we'll see this probably in class next week.

887
01:34:47,870 --> 01:34:52,110
They have these large pyramidal neurons right at the junction of these two layers.

888
01:34:52,130 --> 01:34:53,600
These are the Kim G cells.

889
01:34:54,170 --> 01:35:03,230
They're huge parameter neurons involved in motor outputs, and they have an myelinated axons that extend up above into this molecular layer.

890
01:35:04,220 --> 01:35:09,290
And then below them is this really dense area that looks almost like a bunch of lymphocytes,

891
01:35:09,890 --> 01:35:14,990
which is why many people thought that the image I tried to show you Perkins's cells on the midterm exam,

892
01:35:15,110 --> 01:35:18,110
they were looking at this and that these are lymphocytes. They're not.

893
01:35:18,140 --> 01:35:27,410
They're actually granular neurons. So this are just the neural cell layers and the interactions between these cells of these granular cells.

894
01:35:27,410 --> 01:35:31,430
And then the white matter outputs are what conveys that coordination of movement.

895
01:35:31,820 --> 01:35:35,300
So again, layers just a little simpler and very distinct of functions.

896
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:41,449
This migration system that are inside this layer, migration,

897
01:35:41,450 --> 01:35:47,870
this is something that often gets screwed up in development, particularly with in utero infections.

898
01:35:48,500 --> 01:35:56,630
So parvo viruses, there are some other viral infections that if you get infected at a certain point in development in utero,

899
01:35:57,020 --> 01:36:00,020
it actually there's usually a layer of cells here.

900
01:36:00,140 --> 01:36:05,600
And then they have to migrate to their normal location during development and viral

901
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:11,479
infection at a certain stage of development disrupts this and you get cerebellar hypoplasia.

902
01:36:11,480 --> 01:36:18,530
So the cerebellum is malformed and the manifestation of that is that the person walks with a very wobbly gait.

903
01:36:19,430 --> 01:36:26,150
If you look online later and see examples of this, look up cats or kittens with cerebellar hypoplasia,

904
01:36:26,870 --> 01:36:33,260
and that is due to in utero infection with feline pen leukemia virus, which is a parvovirus of cats.

905
01:36:33,560 --> 01:36:37,160
And the cats, they look very wobbly and people look very cute.

906
01:36:37,160 --> 01:36:42,920
People send videos of them and the cats can't like, you know, cats are usually fabulous jumpers, like amazing a coordinating.

907
01:36:43,010 --> 01:36:52,219
They'll still try to do that, but they'll kind of fall but they're not how they how severely affected they still can be functional pets

908
01:36:52,220 --> 01:36:58,430
but they walk a little funny but that cerebellar hypoplasia related to abnormal migration of these neurons.

909
01:36:59,150 --> 01:37:11,000
Yeah so kind of a question on like the cerebellum to forebrain ratio of animals so the mouse had a pretty large cerebellum too is a cerebral.

910
01:37:11,330 --> 01:37:14,700
So I'm just wondering whether other animals like cats, for example,

911
01:37:14,700 --> 01:37:22,129
will have possibly a similar ratio given their coordination or maybe birds have some specific.

912
01:37:22,130 --> 01:37:26,750
Just from your experience working at different animals, have you noticed any ratios of interest?

913
01:37:27,140 --> 01:37:35,270
I'm not sure because someone's probably measured that. I'm not sure that I've noticed, like because you still have to have the cortical control.

914
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:40,909
Like, I'm not sure I can think of an example, example of an animal where the cerebellum is like so overwhelmed,

915
01:37:40,910 --> 01:37:44,240
like the cortex is minuscule compared to the cerebellum. I think that would be hard.

916
01:37:44,780 --> 01:37:47,870
I think. Yeah.

917
01:37:47,990 --> 01:37:54,230
And in rats and mice, even though they have they have less surface area right in that court in the cerebral cortex.

918
01:37:56,840 --> 01:38:00,980
But there's still I mean, for an animal, they're still pretty smart.

919
01:38:01,070 --> 01:38:05,930
So like some of the some of the manifestations of, like, you know,

920
01:38:05,930 --> 01:38:10,880
how does this look in their behavior is more the molecular structure of how the neurons are organized.

921
01:38:11,180 --> 01:38:15,319
So like rats and mice can still like learn stuff and run a maze of getting information from their environment.

922
01:38:15,320 --> 01:38:21,920
So even though they can't do calculus or something, they still have sufficient volume to that cerebrum.

923
01:38:22,460 --> 01:38:27,080
And a cat. I mean, to me, I have to like look at what the ratios are.

924
01:38:27,080 --> 01:38:32,210
The cerebellum doesn't look extraordinarily large compared to like a dog or another species.

925
01:38:33,080 --> 01:38:41,930
Birds are interesting in that their cerebral cortex, they actually use a different neural epithelial layer,

926
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:45,160
which blows my mind for the higher cortical functions.

927
01:38:45,170 --> 01:38:52,880
They use the neo striatum, which is a kind of a vestigial layer almost in our brain, but that I can't remember the type.

928
01:38:53,720 --> 01:38:59,120
What's the type of evolution we have to structures that serve the same function but they develop from different origins?

929
01:38:59,120 --> 01:39:02,560
Is that divergent is convergent divergent, remember?

930
01:39:03,200 --> 01:39:10,080
But they have a different structure in their brain that's forming the main higher processing center.

931
01:39:10,280 --> 01:39:20,240
So it's kind of unique to birds. So I don't know. I don't know if like size of the cerebellum or a potentially just complexity of the like.

932
01:39:20,270 --> 01:39:23,479
Neural architecture is the driving factor I was going to add into the mix.

933
01:39:23,480 --> 01:39:30,310
The folding, yeah, complex the folding and certainly cerebellar atrophy like the pathology lesion.

934
01:39:30,320 --> 01:39:36,950
If you have a defect there, you get both decreased size of the cerebellum and you'll notice there'll be like either

935
01:39:36,950 --> 01:39:42,080
no Perkins's cells or they'll be like absent or you won't see this layering at all.

936
01:39:42,350 --> 01:39:48,740
You'll just have kind of a more straight line of cells. So definitely there's a cellular architecture disturbance when you lack that function.

937
01:39:50,840 --> 01:39:54,800
I think it's your side of that next week. If you remember that, you'll know what that slide is.

938
01:39:55,910 --> 01:40:01,540
All right. So these are the latter. I'm going to watch my time distracted. This is the lateral, the ventricle system.

939
01:40:01,550 --> 01:40:07,700
So I said the ventricles are the side of production of cerebrospinal fluid, which has a buffer function,

940
01:40:07,700 --> 01:40:14,030
a shock absorber function, and also serves to circulate nutrients from the blood and remove waste products.

941
01:40:15,350 --> 01:40:22,340
So it originates in the ventricles. It's produced by the choroid plexus, which is a type of epithelium lining,

942
01:40:22,940 --> 01:40:26,980
that type of epithelium comprised by cells that are called dependable cells.

943
01:40:26,990 --> 01:40:35,600
It's like a specialized type of epithelium lining the ventricle and then they get more proliferative in the in the core in plexus.

944
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:44,690
So see a short example of that. So they produce cerebrospinal fluid, which has a one way flow into the ventricles,

945
01:40:44,690 --> 01:40:49,849
and then it flows through additional system of channels into the third ventricle,

946
01:40:49,850 --> 01:40:54,410
through this aqueduct of Silvio's, to the fourth ventricle, which is under the cerebellum.

947
01:40:55,310 --> 01:40:58,820
And then it actually was used to animate, but I lost it.

948
01:40:59,960 --> 01:41:05,330
It actually flows around the cerebellum and goes up into the layers of the meninges.

949
01:41:06,440 --> 01:41:11,749
So the meninges are the only structures that are true connective tissue in the brain.

950
01:41:11,750 --> 01:41:17,270
We'll see later. There are no fibroblasts in the brain itself. So the meninges are coverings, they are vasculature in them.

951
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:22,669
And there's a one way absorption of cerebrospinal fluid of these structures called arachnoid.

952
01:41:22,670 --> 01:41:28,640
Villines is a little clusters of blood vessels and they're absorbing the cerebrospinal fluid back into the bloodstream.

953
01:41:29,180 --> 01:41:34,240
So there's one way directional flow and absorption in the through in the arachnoid villa.

954
01:41:36,020 --> 01:41:37,849
So okay so this is fluid.

955
01:41:37,850 --> 01:41:46,430
We this cushions the brain can even think of some pathology that might result in this system when you think about meningitis.

956
01:41:46,580 --> 01:41:49,910
Yeah, that's yeah. That's one. So that was the one I was thinking of. That's good.

957
01:41:50,180 --> 01:41:55,430
So meningitis is inflammation of that lining structure of the brain, which can do a couple of things.

958
01:41:55,430 --> 01:41:59,589
One, it can block at least some of that cerebral spinal absorptions.

959
01:41:59,590 --> 01:42:06,590
They might have some increased pressure there. And also, as we'll see in a minute, there's a structure called the blood brain barrier.

960
01:42:06,890 --> 01:42:12,080
And if that's degraded by inflammation, you can actually get inflammatory cells entering the brain itself.

961
01:42:12,380 --> 01:42:16,400
So meningitis is one so fluid. This is a fluid flow system.

962
01:42:16,820 --> 01:42:19,850
And sometimes you get a condition where there's more fluid in the brain.

963
01:42:20,240 --> 01:42:27,020
We know that, for example, cerebellar hypoplasia is the one we just talked about where is decreased size of the cerebellum.

964
01:42:27,020 --> 01:42:33,499
But cerebellum itself can cause this because there are anatomical disturbances where this

965
01:42:33,500 --> 01:42:39,380
opening the frame in there is too wide and the cerebellum kind of slides down here.

966
01:42:40,010 --> 01:42:45,860
So. Arnold Chiara malformation is one it's a malformation of the cerebellum is blocking this flow.

967
01:42:46,310 --> 01:42:53,870
So now what's going to happen if this is blocking here, what's going to happen there and it's going to expand, you're going to get hydrocephalus.

968
01:42:54,080 --> 01:43:02,600
So thinking of water in the brain. So hydrocephalus is just like a mechanical issue, whether it if it could be because of the cerebellum sliding down,

969
01:43:02,600 --> 01:43:07,129
which is a really common congenital abnormality, could be because of injury or infection or something.

970
01:43:07,130 --> 01:43:13,820
Blocking more distally and the net effect are still making the cerebrospinal fluid, but this space has nowhere to go.

971
01:43:14,150 --> 01:43:17,210
So what you see is the lateral ventricles get bigger and bigger and bigger.

972
01:43:17,630 --> 01:43:24,860
We're going to pressure. The brain has nowhere to go. So you're going to have pressure, necrosis starting at the area around the ventricles.

973
01:43:25,010 --> 01:43:28,219
So that's hydrocephalus. Okay. So that can be acquired.

974
01:43:28,220 --> 01:43:30,170
It can be congenital in some instances.

975
01:43:30,170 --> 01:43:36,380
So people have to do things like place a shunt to drain that fluid because the downstream effect is going to be necrosis of those neurons.

976
01:43:37,010 --> 01:43:41,880
Okay. So cerebrospinal fluid circulation and that it.

977
01:43:41,900 --> 01:43:45,680
Oh, sorry. Following like the addition of like a shunt.

978
01:43:46,010 --> 01:43:54,169
Yes. Would you still have movement into, like the dura matter and the subarachnoid space of the of the fluid?

979
01:43:54,170 --> 01:43:58,969
Or does that not happen as well? It probably doesn't happen as well.

980
01:43:58,970 --> 01:44:02,930
The goal in placing a shunt for treatment of any of these disorders,

981
01:44:02,930 --> 01:44:11,000
like if you have Arnold Perry malformation or something, hopefully you still have some circulation around that area.

982
01:44:11,240 --> 01:44:18,139
I'm not sure if it's compatible life to have none, but the goal is to prevent because it's diminished.

983
01:44:18,140 --> 01:44:25,879
The goal is to prevent this over buildup of fluid here. So they're trying to drain that because that's really what's causing more the neuropathology.

984
01:44:25,880 --> 01:44:31,340
It's that increased pressure and then it depends on what the problem is like if

985
01:44:31,340 --> 01:44:34,850
there's something surgically you can do to fix with the anatomic disturbances,

986
01:44:34,850 --> 01:44:39,710
you could do that, but that's not always possible. Okay.

987
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:44,300
So we talked about cerebrospinal flow and then we're going to talk about barrier structures.

988
01:44:44,300 --> 01:44:47,930
So there are two main barrier structures to know in the brain.

989
01:44:48,260 --> 01:44:51,990
One is a barrier between the. And the cerebrospinal fluid.

990
01:44:52,710 --> 01:44:57,540
And the other is the blood, the famous the blood brain barrier. Find out what the heck that finally means.

991
01:44:58,290 --> 01:45:02,670
So you talk about all the time, but few people think about what it really is.

992
01:45:02,790 --> 01:45:11,460
So the blood CSF barrier, let's do that one first. So I just told you that the CSF fluid is made in the ventricle by the cord plexus.

993
01:45:11,790 --> 01:45:15,689
So this is low back view of what it looks like. Here's a portion. Here's the brain outside the ventricle.

994
01:45:15,690 --> 01:45:22,980
The space with the V is the ventricle itself. And this is that sort of proliferative epithelium that is the choroid plexus.

995
01:45:23,670 --> 01:45:26,900
It's basically fingers covered by this purple stuff.

996
01:45:26,910 --> 01:45:30,900
This is the epithelial cells. So this is the cord plexus cells themselves.

997
01:45:31,320 --> 01:45:37,520
And then there's stroma and a lot of blood vessels. Okay, so this finger is this thing.

998
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:44,280
Here are the epithelial cells are green, and then there's stroma and tons of blood vessels.

999
01:45:46,400 --> 01:45:49,400
The blood vessels here are leaky.

1000
01:45:49,490 --> 01:45:53,170
This is the only place in the brain where the capillaries are normally leaky.

1001
01:45:53,870 --> 01:46:00,680
So they're giving a lot of nutrients, a lot of substances into this little space below the epithelial cells.

1002
01:46:02,150 --> 01:46:05,330
The core of plexus, the epithelium itself is not leaky.

1003
01:46:05,420 --> 01:46:10,460
It has tight junctions animated. Yeah, I just drove it.

1004
01:46:10,510 --> 01:46:16,640
The bottom of the coral plexus itself is not like it has tight junctions between the adjacent cells.

1005
01:46:17,120 --> 01:46:21,440
And so for anything to get across any substances of any size,

1006
01:46:21,680 --> 01:46:26,600
they have to actively be taken up by the epithelial cells and push it into the cerebrospinal fluid.

1007
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:36,320
So the current plexus epithelium controls the composition of the cerebrospinal fluid by selecting what it wants to take from the blood and whatnot.

1008
01:46:36,770 --> 01:46:44,570
Okay. So the blood CSF barrier itself is these tight junctions, right of the correct plexus,

1009
01:46:44,900 --> 01:46:50,810
but selective absorption of material from the blood and putting it forward into the brain itself.

1010
01:46:51,680 --> 01:46:57,140
Okay. Yeah. So the, the, the sweetly part on the outside of those epithelial cells.

1011
01:46:57,530 --> 01:47:03,680
Oh, this. Yeah. Those are those like your like have things. Yes. Are facing the brain or facing the cerebellum.

1012
01:47:04,100 --> 01:47:09,230
This is facing the ventricle. This is the ventricle itself. So the ventricle is the space.

1013
01:47:09,470 --> 01:47:13,130
Here is the brain. Okay, okay. Here is the other part of the brain. Here's the space.

1014
01:47:13,430 --> 01:47:16,999
And so here is those cells. So here are the ventricles are facing this way.

1015
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:21,560
And the cilia beating actually aids the movement of that fluid.

1016
01:47:22,280 --> 01:47:26,309
So they're beating and that's what helps control the flow, that one directional flow.

1017
01:47:26,310 --> 01:47:30,740
Okay. Yeah. Okay. If this gets damaged.

1018
01:47:30,920 --> 01:47:38,570
So this is a potential area of vulnerability. So if you have particulate matter that reaches the brain, if you have infectious agents,

1019
01:47:38,900 --> 01:47:44,960
if you have drugs and they get to this area, they potentially can get at least to the interstitial space.

1020
01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:50,420
And then depending on the integrity of this core plexus epithelium, they could enter the ventricles.

1021
01:47:51,350 --> 01:47:54,440
This is an area of vulnerability. A lot of infectious agents.

1022
01:47:54,440 --> 01:47:57,950
The first part you see inflammation is here in the core of plexus.

1023
01:47:58,520 --> 01:48:04,280
But back to nanoparticle toxicology. This is an area that you often see the first deposition of particles.

1024
01:48:04,700 --> 01:48:08,360
And if you have inflammation, inflammation destroys stuff.

1025
01:48:08,750 --> 01:48:13,840
Inflammatory cells can break this down and then you have disruption of that blood CSF barrier.

1026
01:48:14,300 --> 01:48:16,280
This is a potential area of vulnerability,

1027
01:48:16,700 --> 01:48:23,510
but it's designed this way so that the cord plexus can comprise the CSF fluid by being selective over what to accept.

1028
01:48:24,200 --> 01:48:27,770
That's blood CSF barrier type junctions of the cord plexus itself.

1029
01:48:28,970 --> 01:48:36,780
Oh, God. Going to slow blood brain barrier is another barrier function of the brain.

1030
01:48:36,830 --> 01:48:41,780
So that was in that choroid plexus area. And the ventricles, the blood brain barrier.

1031
01:48:41,780 --> 01:48:45,439
Throughout the brain, you have little capillaries. Neurons need oxygen.

1032
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:49,729
There's capillaries all throughout the brain, but the capillaries throughout the brain,

1033
01:48:49,730 --> 01:48:56,450
in contrast to those capillaries in the core and plexus, they have tight junctions between the endothelial cells.

1034
01:48:56,870 --> 01:49:03,080
These are not leaky capillaries. These are capillaries that are well adhered to one another.

1035
01:49:03,410 --> 01:49:08,620
So there's not going to be stuff leaking across the blood in this capillary area.

1036
01:49:08,630 --> 01:49:13,160
And then we also have astrocytes, which are one of the glial cells of the brain,

1037
01:49:13,850 --> 01:49:20,750
putting their little foot processes and the foot processes of astrocytes directly contact the little capillaries in the brain.

1038
01:49:21,590 --> 01:49:28,340
So if things do get across from the blood into the brain itself, the first place it's going to contact is the astrocyte.

1039
01:49:29,270 --> 01:49:33,979
Astrocytes can form sort of a metabolic sync for neurons because they have a higher

1040
01:49:33,980 --> 01:49:38,630
capacity to have altered ionic concentrations or metabolite concentrations.

1041
01:49:39,050 --> 01:49:43,340
So there are more resistance cell to some of the metabolites that can get into the brain.

1042
01:49:43,340 --> 01:49:50,720
The neurons have this. So again, they're acting as sort of a metabolic sync to protect the neurons.

1043
01:49:51,020 --> 01:49:57,469
So the blood brain barrier has those two components, the type junctions between the endothelial cells and the astrocytes,

1044
01:49:57,470 --> 01:50:01,370
which are acting as a first barrier, a protective barrier for the neurons.

1045
01:50:02,270 --> 01:50:03,410
Those are the two components.

1046
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:12,540
This is the structure of the spinal cord itself, which is a little bit which is inverse from what we talked about in the brain.

1047
01:50:12,840 --> 01:50:18,540
So here the white matter is on the outside and the gray matter, the neural cell bodies are on the inside.

1048
01:50:19,260 --> 01:50:21,270
Depending on where they are, they have different functions.

1049
01:50:21,720 --> 01:50:30,990
And then the white matter is essentially a highway for sensory information in the ascending tracts and motor information in the descending track.

1050
01:50:31,030 --> 01:50:37,440
So the organization of again plays a role or dictates what function is being performed.

1051
01:50:37,620 --> 01:50:44,219
So sensory tracts in the top, the dorsal fin, if you are heading information up towards the brain and for the most part,

1052
01:50:44,220 --> 01:50:47,460
the descending tracks are information heading down the spinal cord.

1053
01:50:48,310 --> 01:50:51,870
Okay, so opposite gray matter and white matter, then the brain.

1054
01:50:53,940 --> 01:50:59,729
All right. I'm going to fly through this a little bit. We can review it all that next week if we need some help to remember, these are the components.

1055
01:50:59,730 --> 01:51:07,290
So we've got gone big picture, conceptual structure. There is structures, fluid flow, their very function.

1056
01:51:07,290 --> 01:51:11,250
We just did. And now looking at the component cells.

1057
01:51:11,850 --> 01:51:17,700
So the main cells that we've talked about are neurons, which obviously are the ones that transmit information.

1058
01:51:18,180 --> 01:51:25,680
As we talked about in our histology lecture, only the cell bodies are visible in an HD section and then the great pink wasteland,

1059
01:51:25,680 --> 01:51:30,420
all this stuff in the background, it's not collagen, it's not fibrosis, nothing like that.

1060
01:51:30,780 --> 01:51:36,120
It's all the intertwined axons and dendrites of these cells, which it is amazing.

1061
01:51:37,970 --> 01:51:46,110
Yeah. So it's a lot more complex than any of these cartoons that we're drawing, but were drawn by the degree of interconnectedness.

1062
01:51:46,770 --> 01:51:52,890
So this is a neuron with a pretty big nucleus. And then you get the sense of the purple around it, which is the neuronal cell body.

1063
01:51:53,370 --> 01:51:58,980
And then we have three types of helper cells. So the general word for help restore is a glial cell.

1064
01:51:59,670 --> 01:52:03,720
And there are three types. Two of them are neuro epithelial derived.

1065
01:52:04,020 --> 01:52:10,350
So just like under under epithelial drive. One is bone marrow derived and that's essentially the resident macrophage of the brain.

1066
01:52:10,740 --> 01:52:18,120
So every tissue we talked about pulmonary macrophages, politics of Cooper or the Rose Cooper cells, resident macrophages of the brain.

1067
01:52:18,930 --> 01:52:24,050
So glial cells consist of astrocytes, which I just talked about in the context of a blood brain barrier.

1068
01:52:24,060 --> 01:52:26,730
So they form metabolic support cells for neurons.

1069
01:52:27,210 --> 01:52:35,010
Their Druidic processes contribute to the neurobiol and their other function of the brain is that they're the main repair cells of the CNS,

1070
01:52:35,610 --> 01:52:41,550
so they kind of take the place of fibroblasts. If we have destruction of neurons, we're not going to fill the space with scarring.

1071
01:52:42,210 --> 01:52:47,400
The dendritic, the astrocytes are going to proliferate and fill that space where they're direct processes.

1072
01:52:47,670 --> 01:52:55,440
So they're going to become hyperplastic events fill that space. So it's astrocytes oligodendrocytes are cells that produce myelin.

1073
01:52:55,830 --> 01:53:01,320
So they're going to twist their processes around the axons of the neurons and insulate them.

1074
01:53:01,470 --> 01:53:07,560
I have a cartoon later of what that looks like. These two cells are the brain cells other than neurons that you'll see in the brain.

1075
01:53:08,010 --> 01:53:12,840
Astrocytes, unless they're activated, are very boring looking. It's just like kind of a naked nucleus.

1076
01:53:13,230 --> 01:53:19,560
You hardly notice them. All the deficits look like fried eggs because they have really easy to see.

1077
01:53:19,890 --> 01:53:26,220
They have really clear cytoplasm because there's a lot of membrane and they're the ones that are going to turn that membrane around the axons.

1078
01:53:26,460 --> 01:53:32,640
The fried egg cells are oligodendrocytes easier to recognize. And then Michael Glial Cells are really hard to see unless they're activated.

1079
01:53:33,030 --> 01:53:36,180
They're just resident macrophages and mostly you would use a special stain.

1080
01:53:36,390 --> 01:53:43,330
Those are macrophages in the brain, which at my time I might have thought Here, okay,

1081
01:53:43,470 --> 01:53:48,600
I am going to stop because I know some people class after this and I don't want to make you late.

1082
01:53:48,930 --> 01:53:53,520
I think there we can finish that little bit at the beginning of next week's lecture,

1083
01:53:54,870 --> 01:53:59,310
so we'll just stop here and then finish up next week with neuropathology.

1084
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:03,360
So I will extend I mean, you can take it to sleep if you want.

1085
01:54:03,360 --> 01:54:08,970
I will extend the deadline on the structure function quiz for this week so that you have another time to take it.

1086
01:54:09,960 --> 01:54:15,510
All right, guys, have a good rest of your day and I'll see some of you in 717 this afternoon.

1087
01:54:27,140 --> 01:54:41,200
Okay. The fact that it was happening,

1088
01:54:44,420 --> 01:54:53,820
I don't think I think surprising because I feel like they're going to want to ask so many questions for the rest of this.

1089
01:54:54,190 --> 01:54:57,660
So it's great that we have. I mean, I want to get the information.

1090
01:54:58,160 --> 01:55:02,470
Yeah. I don't know. No, no, I don't think she even talking to me.

1091
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:08,060
No, no, no, it's great. It's great. But I think. Yeah, because next week we only have the one of the things I think we'll finish out.

1092
01:55:08,190 --> 01:55:14,690
Yeah, good. This is my first really good scientific experience.

1093
01:55:14,690 --> 01:55:21,819
I was like, well, there is a neurologist that I feel like I knew anyway,

1094
01:55:21,820 --> 01:55:27,070
growing up and when I was in undergrad, he said, Oh, are you do you want to work for me this summer?

1095
01:55:27,460 --> 01:55:31,990
And he basically had a case that he had a patient who had some issues.

1096
01:55:31,990 --> 01:55:39,370
And I was like, I think the problem is there's Iot building up in your brain, the Parkinsonian presentation in MRI,

1097
01:55:40,690 --> 01:55:46,750
but for some reason they're not her brain is not clearing to look at afterwards

1098
01:55:47,320 --> 01:55:57,060
or if that is what you've heard of that it's what is a mistake for brain data.

1099
01:55:57,160 --> 01:56:00,879
Propeller protein. Hmm. I don't know.

1100
01:56:00,880 --> 01:56:06,030
Neurodegeneration? Yeah. They're sort of like neurodegenerative diseases related to accumulation of certain substances.

1101
01:56:06,040 --> 01:56:12,040
Right. So she was seizing, like, 200 times an hour sometimes, and it was just so cool.

1102
01:56:12,040 --> 01:56:17,230
I spent the whole summer, like, learning about vesicle function in the brain.

1103
01:56:18,040 --> 01:56:21,069
And so, yeah, this is awesome. And that was ten years ago.

1104
01:56:21,070 --> 01:56:25,510
So it was like really good for well, actually it's not for us, but in that school,

1105
01:56:25,710 --> 01:56:32,530
in my job, I work steady job with that zebra finch model from Learning Lab.

1106
01:56:32,920 --> 01:56:38,160
And this study is like how birds learn song, which is actually a motor for vocal learning,

1107
01:56:38,470 --> 01:56:42,250
a model for motor motor learning and vocal learning in humans.

1108
01:56:42,340 --> 01:56:46,090
That's amazing. So, like, birds have, like, the sense that it's like, you know, kids first babble.

1109
01:56:46,260 --> 01:56:51,940
You sound a human to me. And you get reinforced, you hear, because you're like, Yeah, right.

1110
01:56:51,940 --> 01:56:56,820
Yeah. Your synopses actually get. Oh, yeah, right.

1111
01:56:56,830 --> 01:56:58,810
Yeah. Birth of the same thing.

1112
01:56:58,990 --> 01:57:06,190
So, like, little birds have a family and if they hear the song of their own species, their synapses get muddled by that.

1113
01:57:06,310 --> 01:57:10,150
I see. But if you like, raise them with another. They will preference for their own.

1114
01:57:10,150 --> 01:57:13,400
But you can teach them to speak a foreign like. Yeah, like a chickadee.

1115
01:57:13,550 --> 01:57:19,060
Yeah. Yeah. And and they like thing and then like the really cool thing about birds.

1116
01:57:19,060 --> 01:57:31,450
So not finches, but canaries that like the singers that we form the synapses and like that's kind of kind of it canaries during their breeding season.

1117
01:57:31,570 --> 01:57:38,090
They, they're like song learning pathways like after breeding season those areas degenerate

1118
01:57:38,500 --> 01:57:42,159
and then they form them again the next breeding season and they like to fly.

1119
01:57:42,160 --> 01:57:44,649
Every thing that we know about,

1120
01:57:44,650 --> 01:57:50,709
like how neurons can't regenerate and grown has to do with like the status of their stem cells, like around the ventricles.

1121
01:57:50,710 --> 01:57:56,890
So they are literally making new neuron like neurons and like new synaptic connections in their vocal pathways.

1122
01:57:56,920 --> 01:58:01,090
That's fan fantastic. Yeah. But, um, yeah, it was really, really interesting.

1123
01:58:01,090 --> 01:58:05,950
And we had like zebra finches and like, we had these little sound recording areas.

1124
01:58:05,950 --> 01:58:10,900
So my lab job is like, take care of the birds and do this sort of vocal learning.

1125
01:58:11,080 --> 01:58:15,159
That's so cool. So did you see like birds that got to sing that learn to sing in different.

1126
01:58:15,160 --> 01:58:23,200
Yeah, we used finches and white crowned sparrows. Okay. Like you can like we took traces, like of what the pattern could match the pattern.

1127
01:58:23,200 --> 01:58:24,790
And you're looking at like we were trying to, like,

1128
01:58:24,790 --> 01:58:30,580
map out the areas of the brain that control that and trying to show there's also receptor differences.

1129
01:58:30,880 --> 01:58:35,710
We're trying to look at like what's the the difference between that sensitive period for motor learning?

1130
01:58:36,070 --> 01:58:44,170
So like if they don't hear their song, like if they're raised without sure exposure to that, they never really learn.

1131
01:58:44,170 --> 01:58:48,190
Even if they they're much more concrete like about their vocal learning than we are.

1132
01:58:48,490 --> 01:58:52,209
Never can really learn to sing properly and expose exposed later in life.

1133
01:58:52,210 --> 01:58:55,060
And we thought it was a difference in like NMDA receptor.

1134
01:58:55,240 --> 01:59:03,580
There's like a kind of plastic version of an enemy, a receptor that's expressed in embryo, in the embryo and in young adult in young animals.

1135
01:59:03,580 --> 01:59:11,320
And then it goes away or is replaced by the mature form and that one is less able to do like long term potentiation of neurons.

1136
01:59:11,410 --> 01:59:16,989
Oh, so some of that learning sensitive period had to do with a change in like the isoform of candidate receptor.

1137
01:59:16,990 --> 01:59:19,990
That's so crazy. Crazy. Wow. Like, I don't know.

1138
01:59:19,990 --> 01:59:25,060
Like, it was supposedly a model for how people learn languages, huh? I mean, clearly you can learn a language, isn't it?

1139
01:59:25,090 --> 01:59:30,040
Sure. But it's seething in a different way. And it uses even a different portion of your brain.

1140
01:59:30,040 --> 01:59:33,160
And when you learn as a as a child, that's really interesting.

1141
01:59:33,700 --> 01:59:37,210
Yeah. Yeah. That's great. Thank you, by the way.

1142
01:59:37,240 --> 01:59:44,230
Yeah. See you next day. I have a question like the low magnification.

1143
01:59:45,490 --> 01:59:49,000
How can you distinguish them if if it was intimidating for them?

1144
01:59:49,600 --> 01:59:52,960
I mean, the of it was that you had what you know today.

1145
01:59:53,690 --> 01:59:59,820
Right. Yeah. So. Yeah. So if I'm going to ask you that as a question, I'm going to zoom.
