1
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,690
So. Good morning, everyone.

2
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:16,620
So I'm doing actual teaching class teaching lectures for 515 weeks.

3
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:24,900
Thank you for this class. It's hard, but I appreciate you being here.

4
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:34,920
So so as I understand, as I was saying, today's last lecture and this post exam three,

5
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:44,820
you should take a few minutes to kind of figuring out what you need to prepare for for exams being referred to the exam guide.

6
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,160
So exams, fees is going to be very similar to what you did, for example.

7
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:59,219
Two, it's going to be timed on me, but it'll open up so we do not have class on Thursday.

8
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,720
So that's what we tend to say at 8 a.m.

9
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:17,700
M You have till Friday, 5 p.m. to access and still likely have a July study like quick one to look at similar to what we didn't know.

10
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:27,720
So to get comments and problems set for me to refer to them, you got the full points I think would be helpful.

11
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:33,820
And see. I think that's it.

12
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:38,080
Were there any questions in general or about this industry or.

13
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:50,650
Okay. So so today we have our guest lecturer, Dr. Laura used for boda boda.

14
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:58,040
So she is an assistant professor of environmental health sciences here at the University of Michigan Schools.

15
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:04,220
Now she has a background in chemical engineering and doctoral degree in toxicology.

16
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:15,010
And for a postdoc, she did some research on the epigenetics and metabolic drivers of pediatric soft tissue tumors.

17
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:23,960
And her research interests overall lies in the intersection of toxicology, cell metabolism, oxidative stress and epigenetics.

18
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:33,680
And we're excited to have her here today. And I'm going to turn it over to her so she can tell you more about herself and her research.

19
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:41,030
Okay. Thank you.

20
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,270
I know it's really early on for Desert Tuesday,

21
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:57,020
so I just got back from Israel Saturday night and I've been very thrown off with the time change and I still have piles of things in my room,

22
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:03,979
like not packed, not unpacked yet. And so I apologize if I'm a little bit discombobulated.

23
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:12,889
This is why I'm wearing purple shoes, because I normally bike to work and I take my dress shoes along with me and I forgot them this morning.

24
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:19,730
So, yeah, it's one of those days and I realize that it's late in the semester and it's early for you.

25
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:29,210
Hopefully this class will be interesting. I want it to be informal, so please feel free to interrupt me if you have any questions about anything.

26
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,620
What I'm going to talk about today is to give you a little bit of an overview or a recap of epigenetics.

27
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,890
I know you've touched on this a little bit in the semester already, right?

28
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,260
You know that. Yeah, I remember Jen going over that in previous semesters,

29
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:53,209
but I will recap some of the mechanisms of epigenetic regulation, including DNA methylation,

30
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:55,250
hydroxy methylation, histone marks,

31
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:05,390
talk about epigenetic drugs and the role for epigenetics and early development and why how it plays a role in cancer.

32
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:08,600
How Hijacking of developmental pathways lead to cancer.

33
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:19,910
My post-doc research was on pediatric cancer, in particular Ewing Sarcoma, which is a bone and soft tissue tumor that occurs primarily in.

34
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:28,650
It's more common in males and females, and it occurs primarily in adolescents.

35
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:35,550
So I'll talk a little bit about pediatric cancer in general and how it's treated

36
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,870
some of the environmental and genetic factors that contribute to pediatric cancers,

37
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:49,230
kind of looking at it through the lens of an epidemiologist. And then pediatric cancers talk about them, how they're epigenetic diseases, really,

38
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:56,610
and then touch on the role for precision medicine and omics and cancer therapy in general.

39
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:03,050
So again, today's class is informal. Please feel free to interrupt me anytime if you have any questions.

40
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:08,540
So what comes to mind when you think about the term epigenetics?

41
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:13,490
Anybody want to volunteer? Just the first thing that pops in their mind.

42
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:24,580
The environment interaction with the genome. Yeah.

43
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:30,820
Yeah. So certainly you can think of epigenetics in the context of gene environment interactions.

44
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:34,570
Anybody else? Any thoughts?

45
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:43,110
I know. It's quiet. I know. Like I said, I know it's late in the semester, so I get it.

46
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:54,420
So the epigenome, this is a a picture of somebody who has sketched out some of the various epigenetic marks that occur.

47
00:05:54,780 --> 00:06:02,519
This is histone H3 H4, H2 B, and these are different amino acids in these histones,

48
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,050
and they're modified by various modifications, covalent modifications.

49
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:15,330
And the impression you probably get when you look at this, at least what I get is that it's a gigantic mess and it's very complicated.

50
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:27,120
And that is truly, truly the case in that there are dozens and dozens of different epigenetic modifications that have been discovered.

51
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:30,960
And they all have kind of crosstalk with each other.

52
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:37,320
And there is really there's still a lot to be a lot that we need to.

53
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:44,130
A lot of research that needs to be done to fully understand the role for the epigenome and regulation of gene expression.

54
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:49,530
But essentially, epigenetics means on top of the genome.

55
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:56,850
And so these are the covalent modifications that occur to the DNA itself,

56
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:03,570
or to histone proteins that around which the DNA is wrapped, as I'll talk about in a little more detail,

57
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:10,860
that affect the three dimensional structure of the chromatin and the DNA in a way

58
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:14,759
that makes it either more or less accessible to the transcriptional machinery,

59
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:23,249
thereby regulating gene expression. And it's really the epigenome that controls whether so you can think of the genome.

60
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:31,380
You've probably heard this analogy, but I think it's a good analogy. You can think of the genome as your hardware, like your computer hardware,

61
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:36,660
but you really need the software or the epigenome to tell that hardware what to do.

62
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:44,670
And so the epigenome controls how how highly expressed the gene is, whether it's on or off,

63
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:48,150
whether it's highly expressed, whether it's lowly expressed and so on.

64
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,850
And so this is, you know, a formal definition for epigenetics,

65
00:07:54,030 --> 00:08:00,599
a mechanism for regulating gene activity independent of the DNA sequence that determines which genes are turned on or off,

66
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:10,049
up or down in a particular cell type in different disease states in response to a physiologic stimulus or in response to environmental exposures.

67
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:15,480
And that's I highlighted that one because that's what we really are interested in research wise, and that's what.

68
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:18,900
So my current research, just as an aside,

69
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:24,630
is looking at how exposures to environmental factors during early development

70
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:30,360
impact cardiovascular health later in life through programing of the epigenome.

71
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:41,520
So this picture really nicely illustrates the role for the epigenome in determination of cell fate.

72
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:52,049
So each and every one of these cell types, liver cells, hair cells, brain scan, embryonic stem cells, all of these cells have the same DNA sequence.

73
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:58,110
Right. So you start with you start all of us started as stem cells.

74
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:03,660
So embryonic stem cells can give rise to all these different cell types.

75
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:09,180
And even though all these cell types have the same complement of DNA, they're clearly very different.

76
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:13,110
Right. They have different they have different appearances.

77
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:19,830
They have wildly different functions. You know, a liver cell versus a hair cell, brain cells.

78
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:20,490
Skin cells.

79
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:29,580
But it's really the epigenome that determines the fate of an embryonic stem cell and what what that type of cell is going to grow up to be.

80
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:38,489
And I think this provides a nice illustration of kind of starting at the level of the chromosome and going

81
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:47,460
down to the individual histones and illustrating the mechanisms of epigenetic regulation of gene expression.

82
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:55,020
And so if you take this chromosome here and you unwind it, you will see if you if you go smaller and smaller,

83
00:09:55,530 --> 00:10:00,089
you'll find these chromatin fibers and these are termed beads on a string.

84
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:04,650
People. People call them those because that's what it looks like under an electron micrograph.

85
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:13,860
And so each of these chromatin fibers consists of DNA wrapped around histone proteins.

86
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:26,880
And so you have a histone Oct two copies of H-2A, H2, B, H three and H four, and the tails of these histones,

87
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:31,049
there are several tails from these histones that are kind of waving out in space here.

88
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:36,180
And it's at the site of these histones histone tails where you get various covalent modifications,

89
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:40,470
and you can also get modifications to the DNA itself.

90
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:44,830
And I'll touch on that as well. Right now we're just talking about this.

91
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,370
This kind of just shows you the chromatin modifications.

92
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:53,100
But the principle is very similar with the DNA methylation and other DNA modifications, as we'll talk about.

93
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:59,190
But essentially, there are several different enzymes that regulate epigenetic modifications.

94
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:04,620
You have writer proteins that catalyze the addition of the modification.

95
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:10,350
You have erasers. These are enzymes that remove that modification.

96
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:18,210
And so a writer example of a writer would be a histone methyltransferase or a DNA methyltransferase.

97
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:32,130
And then in a racer example would be a DNA, a histone demethylation or the deoxygenated, which are which are a function in demethylation of DNA.

98
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:40,800
And then you have reader proteins, and these are proteins that can recognize a particular epigenetic modification,

99
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:46,860
and they can come in and bind to that modification, and then they recruit other factors to come in.

100
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:53,670
And these could be other proteins that transcription factors, other things that regulate gene expression.

101
00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:00,930
So as I mentioned, there have been numerous epigenetic modifications identified to date,

102
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:07,680
including DNA methylation, DNA hydroxy methylation, and there are a few other.

103
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:14,280
In addition to hydroxy methyl cytosine, you can also have a more oxidized formal or carboxyl cytosine.

104
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:24,900
And these all have been found to have distinct functions in regulation of gene expression and normal physiology and pathophysiology.

105
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:29,879
And there are also a number of modifications of histones. This is not an exhaustive list.

106
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,330
I'm sure that there have been others that have been identified since then.

107
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:44,969
The most common or the the best characterize and probably the most common modifications are acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation.

108
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:49,140
But again, there are numerous other modifications that people have looked at that.

109
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:55,830
Have important roles and gene regulation and a normal biology.

110
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,610
So DNA methylation has been the primary focus of our research,

111
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:11,820
although I do also have a pilot grant to look at some histone modifications and whatnot, but DNA methylation.

112
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,820
Here I'm talking about methylation of the DNA itself.

113
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:26,370
And so DNA methylation is the addition of a muscle group to the five position carbon on cytosine to form five methyl cytosine and this

114
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:39,330
uses the enzyme DNA methyltransferase and the cofactor essential in the thiamin and DNA methylation is associated with gene repression.

115
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:49,290
When you talk about DNA methylation at promoters and outside of the promoter, its role in gene expression is a little more nuanced.

116
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:50,819
And gene bodies,

117
00:13:50,820 --> 00:14:00,120
it's actually associated with active gene expression and DNA methylation in gene bodies prevents transcription of repetitive elements.

118
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:12,929
So this is really important. What you find in cancer, for example, is that the DNA methylation, there's a hypermethylation of gene bodies that occurs.

119
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:16,770
And so you get you start getting repetitive elements.

120
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:23,370
Transcription and that results in various mutations and genomic instability.

121
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:31,980
Cancers are are characterized by promoter hypermethylation and gene body hypermethylation.

122
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:39,180
So again. The height of the gene body hypermethylation results in increased genomic instability and

123
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:46,680
the hypermethylation of promoters leads to silencing of tumor suppressor genes like p53.

124
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:54,360
And this genomic instability leads to chromosomal translocations duplications, deletions.

125
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:00,020
And so it sort of has a a self-perpetuating it's a self-perpetuating process.

126
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:08,220
And once you you start to develop these this genomic instability, it gets worse and worse as things move along and the cancer progresses.

127
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:15,170
DNA hydroxy methylation, on the other hand. So I showed you previously.

128
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:18,700
Cytosine is here. Five methyl cytosine is here.

129
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:22,760
They flipped it in this image in the methyl groups over here.

130
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:26,870
And this can be further oxidized to five hydroxy methyl cytosine.

131
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:33,320
This is actually hydroxy methyl cytosine was actually discovered in the in the fifties.

132
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:39,469
And it was not discovered in like it wasn't discovered in mammals.

133
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:47,440
And so it was so it was just largely. Viewed as this sort of interesting basic science observation.

134
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,399
But did it nobody really thought it had any interesting function.

135
00:15:51,400 --> 00:16:06,639
And in human biology, it was discovered in in 1972, in frogs and then in 2009 in mouse hippocampal neurons and also in stem cells.

136
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:11,200
And that's when people really started getting interested in this and what its potential role might be.

137
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:25,030
And in normal biology and pathobiology and for five hydroxy methyl cytosine is formed from five methyl cytosine by ten methyl cytosine deoxygenated,

138
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:30,280
and this uses ion alpha, beta glutamate and vitamin C as a cofactor,

139
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:36,909
and it's an intermediate in the process of DNA demethylation So I'll show you

140
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:43,930
another slide where the in order to convert five knuckle cytosine back to cytosine,

141
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:51,070
you actually have to go through this oxidized intermediate. But it's also a stable mark with distinct molecular functions.

142
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:57,800
So let's suppose you had a diet deficient in vitamin C.

143
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:03,890
What would you expect to what effect would you expect that to have on five hydroxy methyl cytosine?

144
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:14,650
But do you expect it to go up or down? Do you need it to form?

145
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:22,030
If you need it to need vitamin C to form hydroxy methyl cytosine, expect it to go down.

146
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,380
It's going to go down. Yeah.

147
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:37,720
And there are some there in many cancers are characterized by hypo hydroxy methyl hypo low levels of hydroxy methyl cytosine hypo hydroxy methylation.

148
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:45,340
And there are also several papers linking inadequate vitamin C to cancer.

149
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:52,719
And so whether this is whether the vitamin C cancer connection is through hydroxy methyl cytosine, we don't know.

150
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,510
But just some interesting observations that have been made there.

151
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:10,719
And this slide, as I mentioned, talks about how so cytosine is converted to methyl cytosine and that can be converted back to cytosine.

152
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:19,120
But it has to go through this oxidized intermediate. And the reason for that is that by adding a methyl group makes it very, very stable.

153
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,320
And so to break this bond requires a lot of energy.

154
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:26,049
And but if you oxidize it first,

155
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:36,190
then it's chemically more favorable to remove the methyl group and convert it back to methyl or convert it back to unmodified cytosine.

156
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:41,530
So for a longest time, people thought that DNA methylation was irreversible and that was it.

157
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:45,370
But it turns out that it can it can be reversed.

158
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:53,890
And in fact, it is reprogramed quite extensively during normal development and probably in other stages of of our life, depending on the tissue.

159
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:59,410
So as I mentioned, it's a frequency frequently lost in cancer.

160
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:07,990
So does anybody have any questions at this point? Again, I'm no, I'm going through this kind of quickly and it's a lot of material, but.

161
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:16,130
Okay. So I'll talk about histone modifications briefly.

162
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:20,690
I touched on this just a little bit already, but as I mentioned,

163
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:34,120
histone is comprised of h2a to be H three and H for two copies of each of those to form an optima and histone proteins form nucleosomes.

164
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:41,570
So this is a nucleosome and a 146 base pairs of DNA is wrapped around these nucleosomes.

165
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:46,219
And then the n-terminal tails of these histones can be modified, as I mentioned,

166
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:53,810
to affect gene expression and cancers similar to aberrant DNA methylation and hydroxyl methylation that's observed in cancer.

167
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,230
There are also aberrant histone methylation patterns that you tend to see.

168
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:02,620
So this is, you know, a busy slide.

169
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:06,399
Some of these are these are a few of these slides are quite busy.

170
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,760
And I don't expect you to memorize these details.

171
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:18,820
But what I just want to show you is kind of how DNA methylation fits into our normal nutrition and metabolism

172
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:28,930
and how what we eat and our lifestyle might affect DNA methylation or other epigenetic modifications.

173
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:38,840
And so one carbon metabolism, the one carbon metabolic pathway provides cofactors for DNA and histone methyltransferase.

174
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:45,729
So remember I mentioned that DNA methylation is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferase and then it

175
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:51,910
uses us identical in the finding that if I accidentally have a binding is actually derived from

176
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:57,879
the one carbon metabolic pathway and so you have folic acid and choline in your diet and those can

177
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:07,060
be converted to five methylene tetrahydrate folate and subsequent lead to tetrahydrate folate.

178
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:15,700
And in this process, this is used this process converts homocysteine to thiamin.

179
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:20,499
So you need to be able to you're constantly forming homocysteine through metabolic

180
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,770
reactions and then you want to be able to convert it back to the thiamin,

181
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:27,160
which is used to create and see on the thiamin.

182
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:32,970
And Sam is a cofactor not only for DNA methyltransferase is and histone methyltransferase is,

183
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:39,790
but also for methylation of DNA, RNA proteins, all sorts of cellular components.

184
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:42,340
So it's really, really critically important.

185
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:53,680
And you can imagine, oh, and then these numbers over here represent the enzymes that are important for these metabolic transitions.

186
00:21:54,220 --> 00:22:03,120
And methane synthase, for example, over here requires B12 as a cofactor and betaine homocysteine.

187
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:06,730
Also transferase over here requires zinc as a cofactor.

188
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:16,750
So if they tell you, if you, for example, are eating a vegan diet, is anybody anybody vegan?

189
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:23,620
I was vegan for two years. And you have to take a B12 supplement because it's really hard to get B12 from.

190
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:26,860
And if you're not eating animal products, impossible, basically.

191
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:32,170
And so you can imagine that if you are getting inadequate B12,

192
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:39,730
you're getting a build up of homocysteine and that's associated with various adverse health effects like cardiovascular disease in the long term,

193
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:49,660
but also other problems in the short term. So this is just kind of to show you again how vitamin intake, how our diet,

194
00:22:49,840 --> 00:23:03,459
how these types of things might affect not only our epigenome but other cellular, cellular downstream factors and cofactors for epigenetic modifiers.

195
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:13,900
You can actually buy them at the store. They're sold as supplements. So Sami is a precursor to sit down and see what's happening.

196
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:24,280
And this is sold for one of the major indications for it that people sell it for is depression.

197
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:35,830
There's also succinate, which is a cofactor for the Ted Dyer Oxygen Aces and also alpha beta glutamate.

198
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:40,330
So a lot of these and a lot of these things you can buy a supplements.

199
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:43,690
It's just an aside that I thought was a little bit interesting.

200
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:54,090
Again, if you're buying supplements, please make sure you're getting something that's vetted by the United States Pharmacopeia and or a consumer lab,

201
00:23:54,310 --> 00:24:03,270
something like that, because it's kind of a. An environment where, you know, anything goes as far as, you know, things could be.

202
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:07,290
They could be selling you something that is garbage or full of heavy metals.

203
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:13,540
You never know. So. This is another slide that, again, is busy.

204
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:19,299
But I just want to show you again the broader context of the the types of metabolic

205
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:24,070
processes that regulate DNA methylation and other epigenetic modifications.

206
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:33,340
And many of these many of these pathways are hijacked by cancers in order to reprogram

207
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:38,290
epigenome in a way that allows the cancer to continue to survive and proliferate.

208
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:45,910
And so each of these sort of hubs and in the normal metabolism.

209
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:55,160
All of this. So many of these different epigenetic modifying enzymes which are all shown here in blue,

210
00:24:56,270 --> 00:25:06,170
take cofactors from the Krebs cycle and use those to convert, use those to catalyze various epigenetic modifications.

211
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:13,720
And so you have histone acetyl transfer pieces that use acetyl COA sirtuins that use on a

212
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:21,260
de lysine deacetylase is histone methyltransferase is that again is us identical mining.

213
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:29,120
And so basically there are a lot of all of these enzymes that regulate the epigenome can pull cofactors

214
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:36,260
from metabolic pathways in cells and that's how they're able to catalyze the reactions that they do.

215
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:43,730
But again, cancer cells can hijack these pathways in a way that gives them a proliferative advantage.

216
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:52,640
So if you're thinking about cancer, would you say cancer is a genetic disease or an epigenetic disease?

217
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:58,780
Anybody have any thoughts on that? It can be both.

218
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:02,370
Yeah. Doctors can overlap. Absolutely. Yeah.

219
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:05,920
And I'll. I'll. I'll touch on this in just a minute for sure.

220
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:15,220
Yeah. So it can be. In fact, in most cases, it's never exclusively one or the other because there's so much crosstalk between the two.

221
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:22,030
And what types of studies are techniques might be useful to understand the mechanisms driving cancer?

222
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:26,090
Does anybody in here do cancer research? Yeah.

223
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:34,640
Glioblastoma. Okay. And one of the labs we're collaborating with actually look at the metabolic pathways.

224
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,560
Yeah. Specifically, like during synthesis.

225
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:42,630
Mm hmm. So that's. Yeah.

226
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:52,879
Fascinating. Yeah. Yeah. So cancers, they don't they not only hijack these metabolic pathways for epigenetic programing,

227
00:26:52,880 --> 00:27:00,710
but also like period synthesis gives them the building blocks they need to build more cells and proliferate more rapidly.

228
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:08,000
And yeah, it really this connection between metabolism and epigenetics and cancer is really cool.

229
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,969
And that, in my opinion, I think it's exciting. So what do you, if you don't mind, do you do like mouse research?

230
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:18,950
Do you do? Okay. Yeah. So we basically are interested in a specific gene,

231
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:25,010
which is the time when genes to the cell surface receptor and kind of looking at the tumor microenvironment,

232
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:35,239
we get the patient tissue cultured and single nuclei or even like a different organ model and then we inject it in mouse

233
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:45,920
and study the tumor microenvironment and basically interested in specific cell states of the glioblastoma tumors.

234
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:49,040
And they're also unique between each tissue, right?

235
00:27:49,100 --> 00:28:02,000
Yeah. So it's hard to kind of like pinpoint like if a surgeon Juma would be more, I don't know, aggressive than the other.

236
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:12,070
Um, but yeah, that specifically what we're interested in looking at like how does Tai one gene interact with other environment.

237
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:18,090
Exactly. Integrin proteins or yeah. And yeah.

238
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:27,380
Patient tissue. Yeah. That's a really hot topic is understanding how, you know, a lot of times you study cancer,

239
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:33,170
you're studying cancer cells in a dish and it's just the cancer cells and not any other cell type.

240
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:38,840
But it turns out that cancers interact with their microenvironment, as it's called.

241
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:49,250
They interact with the immune system, with fibroblasts in the in the stroma of the tissue, whatever tissue the tumor is growing in.

242
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:59,840
And so, yeah, this cancer cell microenvironment interaction thing is really a really important area of research.

243
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:12,730
So yeah, so animal research is a really common, a really common approach for cancer cancer studies also studying cancers, in vitro.

244
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:19,430
We did a little bit of both. We did some work where in my post-doc where we were studying cancer cells in a dish.

245
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:27,500
But then we also with co-cultured them with other cell types and also do various animal studies as well.

246
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:32,270
And then of course, there are epidemiologic studies to understand at a population level what

247
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:38,030
environmental factors or other types of factors might be contributing to cancer.

248
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:43,760
So cancer is a genetic disease and and epigenetic disease.

249
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:48,890
Familial cancers can also be explained by inherited mutations.

250
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:53,660
Many cancers harbor significant DNA damage and genomic instability.

251
00:29:54,800 --> 00:30:01,280
Mutations are often carcinogenic, and introducing mutations into mice can result in cancer.

252
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:07,759
But cancer's also an epigenetic disease, so cancers have defects in their cellular identity.

253
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:15,050
If you remember, I showed you the slide with the embryonic stem cells, but give rise to the different cell types in the body.

254
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:24,080
That whole process of cellular differentiation that occurs where an embryonic stem cell becomes a differentiated cell type,

255
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:31,280
that process is epigenetically programed and it can be hijacked in cancer.

256
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:38,479
And in fact, cancer cells have this property of being poorly differentiated in many cases where

257
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:43,970
they don't really resemble the tissue that they or that they originated in.

258
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:49,610
And that's because they kind of forget who they were. They forget that they were a brain cell.

259
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:54,560
And now they've become this sort of poorly differentiated, I don't know,

260
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:58,930
zombie that's somewhere in the middle between a stem cell and a and a differentiate itself.

261
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:07,069
Genetic damage and cancer also involves proteins that often involves proteins that regulate the epigenome.

262
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:15,110
So there are a number of pediatric cancers that have mutations and epigenetic modifying enzymes.

263
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:24,740
In fact, that may be the only the only mutation that they have on cancer cells can harbor epigenetic damage in the absence of.

264
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:29,370
Difficult genetic damage. And this is really common in pediatric cancers.

265
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:33,659
So if you're looking at and I'll talk about this in a little more detail,

266
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:42,360
but if you have an adult tumor over here and you have a pediatric tumor over here, like most adult tumors are genetic train wrecks.

267
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:45,930
And so they have just hundreds or thousands of mutations.

268
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:52,980
And most pediatric cancers are over here on the side where they have very, very few actual mutations.

269
00:31:54,180 --> 00:32:05,400
And the reason for that is that most adult tumors are happening much later in life, and they're happening in the epithelial layer of the tissue.

270
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:12,000
And that layer of tissue tends to see a lot of environmental exposures like UV,

271
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:17,910
light chemicals, different things in our environment that cause mutations.

272
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:24,420
But I'll talk a little more about the difference between adult and pediatric tumors in just a moment.

273
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:31,740
Carcinogens can also be epi mutagen and also introducing an AP mutation.

274
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:35,459
At least advice is sufficient to induce cancer.

275
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:43,650
So there is a group that showed that if they induce and IPG AP mutation in a tumor suppressor gene that silences that gene,

276
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:54,420
they can cause the mice to develop cancer. And this this slide kind of illustrates the cross-talk between genetics and epigenetics.

277
00:32:54,900 --> 00:33:00,540
So if you have a dysregulation of DNA methylation,

278
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:07,980
say you have hypermethylation of the gene body that results in genome instability and potential genetic mutations.

279
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:12,450
And so that's one mechanism of crosstalk.

280
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:20,220
I also mentioned that often times in cancers you get an alteration of epigenetic enzymes.

281
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:33,870
So a mutation in an epigenetic modifying enzyme that causes it to be hyperactive or not active enough, and that can play a huge role in cancer.

282
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:42,390
And so, yeah, there's a lot of crosstalk between these different processes in the context of cancer.

283
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:52,269
And there are a variety of proteins that regulate the epigenome and DNA methyltransferase.

284
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:58,209
So all of these different enzymes that I've mentioned function in these large multi protein

285
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:08,700
complexes and you often may have DNA methyltransferase and histone or histone methyltransferase,

286
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:15,520
or you may have multiple enzymes in this large multi protein complex that regulate the epigenome.

287
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:26,530
And aberrant expression of these epigenetic modifying enzymes is common in cancer, as I mentioned, and they may offer potential therapeutic targets.

288
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:34,389
And, you know, this is, again, another slide that has a lot of information that I don't expect you to memorize.

289
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:39,250
But again, I just want to give you some context into how how the epigenome is regulated,

290
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:45,760
because you may think about it in terms of like just a single enzyme in a single modification,

291
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:52,570
but it's actually all of these modifications kind of interact with each other and the enzymes interact as well.

292
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:58,690
So there are a number of drugs that target the epigenome.

293
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:05,140
And of course, then this is a huge area of interest for cancer research.

294
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:11,380
One of the best characterized agents for treating cancer.

295
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:16,690
Epigenetic modifying agents treating for treating cancer, DNA hypermethylation agents.

296
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:22,330
These targeted DNA methylation, as you might might expect from the name.

297
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:28,090
And one example of this is the site of being and that's shown shown over here.

298
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:37,719
This is approved for treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome, which is a pre leukemic blood disorder and also acute myeloid leukemia in the UK.

299
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:41,260
So these drugs are being used in the clinic here.

300
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:49,330
Some METHYLTRANSFERASE inhibitors are still in clinical trials at this point, but again,

301
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:57,010
as the name suggests, they target histone methylation and some examples are an easy H2 inhibitor.

302
00:35:57,010 --> 00:36:03,879
This is a this catalyzes a specific histone modification and it's in clinical trials

303
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:10,209
for select hematologic and solid malignancies there also and allow men in inhibitors.

304
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:18,610
These are two proteins that again are part of this large multi subunit complex that regulate histone methylation.

305
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:28,379
And these are still in preclinical development. So developmental genes can be regulated on multiple levels.

306
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:32,010
And you may ask, why am I? Why am I suddenly talking about developmental genes?

307
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:37,530
Cancer in I in large part is.

308
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:47,170
Basically a a manifestation of altered of alterations in normal development.

309
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:55,120
Okay. So you have normal pathways that govern the differentiation of a stem cell into a differentiated cell,

310
00:36:55,480 --> 00:37:00,670
that govern our normal development from stem cells into full grown human beings.

311
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:04,780
And those genes are all epigenetically regulated.

312
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:09,700
And it's these developmental pathways that can become hijacked in the context of cancer.

313
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:18,910
And so developmental genes can be regulated at the level of the promoters where you have you're in close proximity to the target gene.

314
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:24,790
And there are distinct epigenetic marks that promote gene repression and activation.

315
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:30,970
These are a couple of examples. A trick for trying methylation is associated with gene activation.

316
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:34,510
K 27 tri methyl is associated with gene repression.

317
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:41,730
And then you also have the you have regulation at the level of enhancers.

318
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:52,800
So if this is a a length of DNA, these can be these are a long range processes for regulating gene expression.

319
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,510
They can be thousands of KB upstream or downstream of a target gene.

320
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:00,780
So let's say you have your target gene over here and then you have all of these

321
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:06,150
different enhancers that can be thousands of KB away from that target gene.

322
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:12,089
But you can see that through this three dimensional folding of the chromatin that you can actually

323
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:19,590
get these long range enhancers to come into contact with with this target area of regulation.

324
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:26,100
And this, again, promotes long range regulation of gene expression.

325
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:33,600
And this is why thinking of DNA as sort of a linear sort of a linear thing like this,

326
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:38,190
where you have a transcription factor that binds to the promoter and then turns on a gene.

327
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,480
It's, I think, okay to envision it that way.

328
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:47,819
But you also want to understand that there are these very it's the three dimensional

329
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:55,230
topography of the the DNA that really plays a role in regulation of gene expression.

330
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:59,690
So it's a little more complicated than than just a single promoter.

331
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:08,040
And hijacking a normal developmental pathways leads to cancer.

332
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:11,309
So you have as I mentioned,

333
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:18,030
you start with your stem or progenitor cells and they undergo a process of differentiation to become a differentiated tissue.

334
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:22,799
And this occurs during embryonic development and also in different tissue

335
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:29,610
types where you have some resident stem cells that can regenerate the tissue.

336
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,830
And also occurs in postnatal development.

337
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:40,440
But there can be genetic mutations or epigenetic factors that can contribute to the development of a malignancy.

338
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:47,710
Two guys take a break usually. I know. I'm sorry. Does anybody have any questions?

339
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,000
Pediatric tumors in particular.

340
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:07,730
I mean, cancers to some extent are all all diseases of deregulated development, but pediatric tumors are in particular, developmental diseases.

341
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:17,780
And so this image nicely illustrates the different cancers that can originate from different stem cell populations.

342
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:28,730
So these are neural stem cells, neural crest stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells and hematopoietic progenitor cells.

343
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:38,060
And you can see that neural and neural stem cells give rise to the central nervous system in the peripheral nervous system, in the adrenal glands.

344
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:46,190
But under in the context of a malignancy can form if there if there are some

345
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:50,810
genetic or epigenetic hits that leaving that normal development to go awry,

346
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:57,980
then you can give that can give rise to brain tumors, soft tissue tumors like neuroblastoma and Ewing sarcoma.

347
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:07,700
And on the side of mesenchymal stem cells or hematopoietic stem cells, the mesenchymal cells give rise to bone and muscle.

348
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:17,240
And those deregulation of those developmental pathways can lead to Ewing Sarcoma, osteosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and hematopoietic.

349
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:23,210
STEM and progenitor cells normally can form normal blood, but they can also give rise to leukemias.

350
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:30,470
As anybody in this and here who would be willing to mention it as anybody had cancer as a kid.

351
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:34,969
There's always this is a relatively small group.

352
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:42,379
But whenever I whenever I give this lecture, there's usually one or two people who have had cancer as a cure.

353
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:46,470
Do they know do you know somebody who's had it? Yeah.

354
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:53,880
So it's extremely rare in terms of cancers are rare diseases in general,

355
00:41:55,140 --> 00:42:00,300
but in pediatric cancers in particular are pretty are pretty rare, but they're not unheard of.

356
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:04,980
So people you do. Almost everybody knows somebody, certainly.

357
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:18,049
And so the, the, the in the incidence of childhood cancers over the years has actually been increasing.

358
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:27,970
And so the trend from 1992 to 2016, this is giving just that time range was statistically significant.

359
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:36,810
So there's this really significant increase in incidence of childhood cancers, but a decrease in the mortality, which is really which is really great.

360
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:44,120
Very encouraging. We've had significant we've made significant strides in the treatment of these diseases.

361
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:53,510
And cancer is the leading cause of death. This always shocks me because, again, I always thought of cancer in kids is being almost unheard of.

362
00:42:54,620 --> 00:43:00,140
The cancer is the leading cause of death by disease among U.S. children between infancy and age 15.

363
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:07,220
So only accidents and injury cause more deaths and suicides when you get when you hit adolescence.

364
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:16,790
So so it is, you know, rare, but it's it's still a significant cause of morbidity and death among kids.

365
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:25,519
And, yeah, the suicide suicide in adolescence is becoming even, you know, even before the pandemic,

366
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:30,110
the rate of suicides in adolescence was increasing and becoming a bigger concern.

367
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:41,079
And and after the pandemic, it's just gotten worse. There's approximately 11,000 new cases of pediatric cancer diagnosed in children from

368
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:47,140
age zero to adolescence in the U.S. and the worldwide incidence is much larger.

369
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:52,450
One in 330 individuals will be diagnosed with cancer before the age of 20.

370
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:55,810
So, again, not that uncommon.

371
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:03,100
But when you think about childhood cancers, they're not like your grandparents disease.

372
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:13,780
And this is where I was mentioning how pediatric tumors tend to have very few mutations, whereas adult tumors are sort of a genetic trainwreck.

373
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:19,420
And that's because one of the main reasons for that is well,

374
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:26,889
one of the big reasons is that cancers in adults happen later in life after they've seen all these environmental exposures,

375
00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:36,010
after they've smoked for 50 years, after they have used tanning beds and laid out in the sun with no tanning, with no SPF or whatever.

376
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:43,680
Whereas children don't have that, you know, they don't have that lifetime of environmental insult.

377
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:51,309
But that's not what's contributing to their cancers. Adult tumors are occurring in the epithelial layer of organs.

378
00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:54,970
So the outermost layer of of the organ or tissue.

379
00:44:55,990 --> 00:45:03,600
So your skin, the lining of your GI tract in your in the breast and the prostate, the colon.

380
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:10,750
So those are the the layer of tissue that's seeing, you know, the environmental the environmental insults.

381
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:23,190
Whereas in children, they tend to occur more in mesenchymal tissues, such as these are tissues such as bone soft tissue, tumor, collagen, the.

382
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:25,930
The connective tissues in the body.

383
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:38,360
And they also, when they occur in the brain, brain tumors, central nervous system and brain tumors in adults, you tend to see glioblastoma.

384
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:46,130
You see these tumors that occur in the higher brain, whereas in children they occur like in the lower parts of the brain, like medulloblastoma.

385
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:50,700
For example, children get a lot of leukemias.

386
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:56,670
You do see leukemias in adults as well, but it's very common in children.

387
00:45:57,090 --> 00:46:03,390
And also, again, these soft tissue tumors, lymphomas, bone cancers, these types of things.

388
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:13,110
Wilms tumor, this type of kidney cancer. And so the the the mechanisms for treating these cancers are different.

389
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:18,270
Children are not simply little adults. The diseases are different.

390
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:24,870
The treatments are different. Again, adult tumors are primarily epithelial, but epithelium.

391
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:28,860
Tumors are rare in children. And the response to therapy is different.

392
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:35,490
And the social and cultural ethical issues of treating children with cytotoxic agents is very different.

393
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:40,500
And there also unique needs of an adolescent young adult population.

394
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:47,969
So let's say you are, you know, 19 years old and you end up getting rhabdomyosarcoma,

395
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:52,960
which is a muscle tumor and or Ewing sarcoma, which is a tumor that I studied.

396
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:58,920
These tumors are nasty. They're very aggressive.

397
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:11,100
And so they require a lot of very nasty, aggressive treatments, think surgery, chemotherapy, really aggressive regimens of chemotherapy, radiation.

398
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:12,600
So if you're 19 years old,

399
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:19,950
what what do you what might you be thinking about if you're getting exposed to these two radiation and chemicals and these types of things?

400
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:27,090
Anybody like what would be the concern if it was you or your child who is getting exposed to these things?

401
00:47:28,330 --> 00:47:32,010
Well, if you're someone who would be looking to have a child in the future,

402
00:47:32,010 --> 00:47:37,920
that might be an issue as well as just like your overall physical appearance and maybe losing your hair, losing a lot of weight.

403
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:39,359
Yeah, absolutely.

404
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:45,840
And so that's where that's where I'm you know, what I'm getting at when I talk about the unique needs of the adolescent young adult population.

405
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:49,620
So these kids have a long life ahead of them.

406
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:57,870
Right. You know, if you're 75 years old and you get diagnosed with prostate cancer or breast cancer or whatever, it's certainly a terrible thing.

407
00:47:57,870 --> 00:47:59,880
Like nobody wants to see anybody get cancer.

408
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:09,090
But if you have to live for 30, 40, 50, 60 years after your cancer treatment, like you want to have a good quality of life.

409
00:48:09,930 --> 00:48:19,590
And so, again, the the therapies, the the thought thinking around treating these these people is is going to be different.

410
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:23,560
You're going to really have to think about how much risk you want to tolerate.

411
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:29,370
And in that, if you're 75 years old, you've already had your children.

412
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:37,560
They probably all have children. But if you're 19, you have this life ahead of you where you may want to have a family and that type of thing.

413
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:45,209
So this talks about the different genomic landscapes of childhood and adult cancers, again,

414
00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:54,120
showing low versus high mutation rate, a single versus multiple driving mutations and mutation specificity.

415
00:48:57,690 --> 00:49:04,260
As far as treatment goes for pediatric cancers, it's been a success story.

416
00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:10,680
This is from the Cancer Statistics Review in 1975 to 2003.

417
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:21,420
And, you know, in the time from and actually goes back to 1960, if you go from 1960, this goes all the way up to 22.

418
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:29,320
But these trends have largely held up since then. You can see that there's a gradual increase in survival for these various cancer types.

419
00:49:29,370 --> 00:49:39,019
So this is all sites together. This is Hodgkin lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, all of them.

420
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:47,160
You see this nice progressive increase in survival rate, whereas if you have something like AML, you think almost every kid,

421
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:55,799
not almost ever, but if you get if you catch acute myeloid leukemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia, it's very, very aggressive.

422
00:49:55,800 --> 00:50:02,310
But you have a really, really good chance of surviving and living a long, healthy life afterwards.

423
00:50:02,310 --> 00:50:06,960
But you can see that in the sixties you were is basically a death sentence.

424
00:50:06,990 --> 00:50:15,740
So this is great in the same sort of survival trends have have played out for for solid tumors as well.

425
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:22,530
So these are all the solid tumors and the the abbreviations are down here at the bottom.

426
00:50:23,010 --> 00:50:26,160
So this is great. But the cure is not easy.

427
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:31,690
It's aggressive and highly toxic and it's never a guarantee.

428
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:40,500
So this is a kit that my post-doc mentor, Dr. Beth Lawler, who she was an M.D.,

429
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:46,770
Ph.D. She spent several years working as a pediatric oncologist in the clinic and then went on to

430
00:50:46,770 --> 00:50:52,290
get her Ph.D. and she eventually went into basic science research full time and left the clinic.

431
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:55,790
But she encountered children like this all the time.

432
00:50:57,060 --> 00:51:00,930
So this is I would be the type of person who would be on the research side of things,

433
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:10,350
because I could never deal with this sort of like human pain and and despair that she had to

434
00:51:10,350 --> 00:51:14,880
deal with and that friends of mine who are pediatric oncologists deal with on a daily basis.

435
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,250
And there are a lot of challenges to treating pediatric cancer.

436
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:27,420
One of the problems with with pediatric cancer is that they're very rare and.

437
00:51:29,070 --> 00:51:37,830
Drug companies don't want to develop drugs that target a disease that happens to 2 to 3 people per million every year.

438
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:42,150
Right. They want to have something that they're going to able to recoup their investment on.

439
00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:48,450
And so I happens is that if you want to have if you have a drug that you want to use to treat a pediatric cancer.

440
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:55,590
Efficacy needs to be shown in other tumors. So an adult tumors where you have a lot a much larger number of patients.

441
00:51:55,890 --> 00:51:59,700
And that way they can recoup, again, the costs of of manufacturing,

442
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:06,240
the drug of of bringing it to to manufacturer in the first place, all the research and development that has to occur.

443
00:52:08,370 --> 00:52:15,240
The other challenges that there's a paucity of targetable mutations, which limits precision therapies,

444
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:19,940
and then there are significant long term health effects of the treatments.

445
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:25,680
Again, as you might suspect, the treatments depend on the type and stage.

446
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:32,219
The most common modalities are surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and they're less common.

447
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:40,950
But focus of significant research efforts are targeted therapies, immune therapies and also gene drugs that target epigenetic modifiers.

448
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:47,370
So survivors of pediatric cancer and an increased risk of chronic health conditions.

449
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:52,140
And why do you think that is? Yes.

450
00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:56,280
During the chemo and radiation and the treatments you don't like.

451
00:52:56,280 --> 00:53:01,410
You're killing a lot of healthy cells that are important for development, immune protection.

452
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:11,190
Yeah, absolutely. So you're targeting you may be targeting resident stem cell populations that function and regeneration of tissue.

453
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:16,380
You're you're definitely going to be harming healthy cells, healthy tissue.

454
00:53:17,850 --> 00:53:24,060
What else how do does anybody know how cytotoxic how certain cytotoxic chemotherapies work?

455
00:53:27,630 --> 00:53:36,480
So they they kill rapidly dividing cells. Right. And the reason they do that is because it's through damaging of DNA.

456
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:40,920
So they cause DNA double strand breaks and the cancer cells.

457
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:49,740
That that results in cell death. And so something like Doxorubicin.

458
00:53:51,450 --> 00:53:57,570
I'm thinking of the not doxorubicin. It's hop aside which is a topo I summarize inhibitor.

459
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:02,400
These cause a double strand breaks. So they cause mutations, right.

460
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:09,270
So it they're very effective at killing cancer cells, but they can also cause mutations in,

461
00:54:09,630 --> 00:54:13,260
say, bone marrow stem cells or other other cell types in the body.

462
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:18,870
And what happens is. What do you think? What if you're exposed to a cytotoxic agent?

463
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:22,110
What happens later in life? Sometimes cancer.

464
00:54:22,410 --> 00:54:31,350
Yeah. So. So these these kids are, you know, fortunate enough to survive this particular cancer, Ewing Sarcoma, whatever.

465
00:54:31,350 --> 00:54:34,920
They go through this regimented chemotherapy, and they're fine.

466
00:54:35,150 --> 00:54:37,740
They go on to live their life. But then they have all these problems,

467
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:48,780
including about a 20% increased a 20% risk of a secondary cancer later on in life, which is just not acceptable.

468
00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:58,770
So this is why there's so much work going on to develop more effective therapies, particularly for these younger populations of people.

469
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:06,150
And this is a mother of a cancer survivor. Again, these are a few slides from my postdoc mentor.

470
00:55:07,110 --> 00:55:10,890
But the mother said, you know, I'm grateful she's alive, but I grieve the price she's paid.

471
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:18,630
And the price may you know, the price that she paid may become apparent as this child goes through life.

472
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:27,110
And so this is a paper from the New England Journal of Medicine in 2006 in which they compared siblings.

473
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:33,420
So they had one sibling who developed pediatric cancer and another healthy sibling.

474
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:43,410
And they looked at patients who had survived at least five years post cancer therapy and followed them, you know, later in life.

475
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:52,800
And they found that compared to their healthy sibling, there were these massively increased risks of various severe,

476
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:57,720
debilitating health conditions, joint replacement, 54 fold, increased risk.

477
00:55:58,530 --> 00:56:06,120
If you have been treated for pediatric various pediatric cancers, congestive heart failure, heart failure, heart failure is a big one.

478
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:18,569
So a lot of cancer drugs such as doxorubicin are cardio, toxic, secondary cancer, ten fold increased risk of cognitive dysfunction.

479
00:56:18,570 --> 00:56:25,979
So and ovarian failure. I think these yeah the these got kind of scrunched together compared to these.

480
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:31,410
But if you spread them out so, you know, a 3.5 fold increased risk of of ovarian failure.

481
00:56:31,530 --> 00:56:36,209
So again, yeah, all sorts of long term debilitating health conditions.

482
00:56:36,210 --> 00:56:45,090
And this is again, one of the major considerations in treating kids with cancer and childhood cancer,

483
00:56:45,090 --> 00:56:53,410
even though we have made we as a scientific community have made significant strides in treating it, it's still a significant cost of life.

484
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:59,520
So you can see that average years of life lost per person, dying of cancer.

485
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:05,370
This is from 2027, a childhood.

486
00:57:05,790 --> 00:57:12,650
Somebody who gets cancer in childhood loses 70 years of life on average, you know, whereas somebody with prostate cancer that is nine years of life,

487
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:18,420
again, this is nobody wants to see somebody get prostate cancer and lose nine years of life.

488
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:23,160
That's still terrible. But again, when it happens in kids, it's just this.

489
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:32,710
Just. It's sort of enraging and upsetting and highly motivating in terms of, you know,

490
00:57:33,310 --> 00:57:37,510
wanting people, people wanting to get out there and do research to find better therapies.

491
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:43,720
So thinking about cancer from the lens of an epidemiologist,

492
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:48,760
what do you think are some of the biggest challenges to understanding why kids get cancer?

493
00:57:51,360 --> 00:58:00,170
And when you think of any. So.

494
00:58:03,090 --> 00:58:10,470
Why do kids get cancer in the first place? It's likely a combination of genetic, epigenetic, environmental and behavioral factors.

495
00:58:11,850 --> 00:58:19,590
The president's cancer panel stated in 2010 that the true burden of environmentally induced cancer has been grossly underestimated.

496
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:24,900
So this includes not just pediatric cancers, but also just all cancers in general.

497
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:32,010
Identifying the environmental contributors to childhood cancers is super challenging.

498
00:58:32,790 --> 00:58:36,750
And why is that? Well, pediatric cancers are very rare.

499
00:58:38,670 --> 00:58:43,320
For example, Ewing Sarcoma affects 2 to 3 people per million.

500
00:58:44,070 --> 00:58:49,980
So extremely rare. Limited availability of tissue samples.

501
00:58:50,670 --> 00:58:58,620
So it's hard to get access to tissue to do the research and understand what environmental contributors might be happening.

502
00:58:59,130 --> 00:59:05,400
There's a lot of biological heterogeneity. Case control studies are often subject to recall bias.

503
00:59:05,430 --> 00:59:12,870
So you can imagine that you have a mom and a dad that come in and their child has leukemia.

504
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:21,400
And if you suspect that, you can imagine that if you were to ask this parent, you know,

505
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:28,140
were you exposed to something that may have caused this leukemia or was there some sort of factor that may have contributed to this?

506
00:59:28,410 --> 00:59:31,950
They're going to be more likely to be they're going to be hyper sensitive to that,

507
00:59:31,950 --> 00:59:34,680
and they're gonna be more likely to remember all of these different things.

508
00:59:35,130 --> 00:59:39,600
Whereas if somebody somebody has a kid who doesn't have leukemia, you know,

509
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:44,910
they may not they're they're not hyper focused on these exposures and these types of things.

510
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:55,440
So there's also the fact that cancer is maybe caused by environmental exposures to either parent,

511
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:00,720
to the child in the womb or to the child very early after birth.

512
01:00:00,990 --> 01:00:07,040
So there are epidemiologic studies linking linking a paternal exposure.

513
01:00:07,090 --> 01:00:16,830
So say a paternal occupational exposure to some carcinogen or some other environmental endocrine disrupting agent and diseases in their children.

514
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:22,410
But how do you go back and study that epidemiologically?

515
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:28,140
That's a really, really challenging. It's really challenging when the disease is so rare to begin with.

516
01:00:30,390 --> 01:00:34,230
And this is probably outdated because this is a few years old.

517
01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:38,160
But there are some 80,000 chemicals on the market in the U.S.

518
01:00:38,670 --> 01:00:43,390
Most of them have not been thoroughly studied. It's just it's just out of control.

519
01:00:43,410 --> 01:00:53,309
There's not enough there's not enough manpower in the in the government agencies to thoroughly study

520
01:00:53,310 --> 01:00:59,730
these chemicals and make sure that they are fully vetted and not causing harm to humans or to animals.

521
01:01:02,790 --> 01:01:12,180
So as far as environmental triggers for pediatric cancers, there's no clear common toxic or environmental cause.

522
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:19,590
Whereas something like, you know, smoking and lung cancer, you know, that's a clear environmental cause in kids.

523
01:01:19,590 --> 01:01:28,680
That's not the case. There's potential potential contributors that have been shown prenatally and postnatal tobacco smoke,

524
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:31,980
pesticides, traffic, pollution, paints and solvents.

525
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:40,440
Interestingly, there has been an association with associations between viral outbreaks and leukemias.

526
01:01:41,790 --> 01:01:45,300
So the H1N1 swine flu, there was an outbreak.

527
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:52,170
This was in the last 15 or 20 years. And there was a leukemia cluster that followed that.

528
01:01:53,790 --> 01:02:03,570
Maternal alcohol consumption, exposure to things like as you might or that you might expect chemotherapy, ionizing radiation, U.V. exposure.

529
01:02:04,230 --> 01:02:09,000
Every day you use tanning beds in high school or college.

530
01:02:10,130 --> 01:02:14,420
That is fantastic. Yeah. No, it's okay.

531
01:02:14,990 --> 01:02:18,060
No, I mean, it's fantastic that, like, very few people have.

532
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:27,530
I did all the time in high school and late high school and early early undergraduate because it was just it was a thing to do.

533
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:32,780
Like, if you were going on spring break, you just go go to the tanning salon and get all nice and tan.

534
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:41,749
And and sometimes it was it's just nice to be tan in the wintertime and sit in this warm tanning bed when it's 50 below outside.

535
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:51,350
And it was just the thing to do. And it was a terrible, terrible trend because it was so strongly it has so much damage to your skin.

536
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:56,419
And, you know, so now you know, now I have to worry about getting skin cancer.

537
01:02:56,420 --> 01:02:59,479
And I'm always very vigilant about checking my skin.

538
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:02,420
And I wear sunscreen and I'm very obsessive about it now.

539
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:12,200
But UV exposure has been a huge contributor to cancers, skin cancers in younger populations in particular because of the use of tanning beds.

540
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:18,049
But I think that, again, we used to see them like on every street corner and now I almost never see them anymore.

541
01:03:18,050 --> 01:03:23,000
So I think that the the popularity of these things has decreased, which is great.

542
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:31,550
One, a couple of examples of environmental contributors to pediatric cancer.

543
01:03:32,660 --> 01:03:36,110
Has anybody heard of diet of Sylvester all or D.

544
01:03:36,110 --> 01:03:46,420
S daughters? So this is this was a a group of girls, a population that developed vaginal cancers.

545
01:03:47,410 --> 01:03:51,880
Aboriginal cancers are extremely rare, especially in teenagers and young adults,

546
01:03:52,480 --> 01:04:00,820
but there's a cluster of rare vaginal clear cell adenocarcinomas in teenage girls and it was eventually linked to prenatal estrogen exposure.

547
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:10,020
And so they were doctors were prescribing diets of Sebastopol to millions of women in the U.S. between 1938 and 1971.

548
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:22,870
And they used it to prevent abortion, miscarriage, premature labor, basically for this basically for as a panacea for all pregnancy related issues.

549
01:04:24,730 --> 01:04:34,090
But it turned out that this this early developmental exposure to this hormone, this hormone mimic caused cancer later in life.

550
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:38,380
And so this is the paper,

551
01:04:38,450 --> 01:04:45,310
I believe it was in the New England Journal of Medicine showing Association of Maternal Sylvestre All Therapy with tumor appearance in young women.

552
01:04:45,490 --> 01:04:50,020
So probably some epigenetic programing that's going on there.

553
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:58,540
And this is kind of a common paradigm with it's called the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease Hypothesis,

554
01:04:58,540 --> 01:05:06,160
which states that these early developmental exposures can lead to diseases later in life, probably through epigenetic programing.

555
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:14,050
Any questions so far? We have about nine more minutes left, so I'll just start.

556
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:22,270
Keep going. Unless anybody has any questions. We will get through all of these slides, but I'll get as far as we can.

557
01:05:22,290 --> 01:05:28,350
So there are a number of genetic triggers for pediatric cancers.

558
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:35,190
There are various overgrowth syndromes. Beckwith, Wiedemann, Lee Remaining Syndrome.

559
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:39,420
Retinoblastoma, neurofibromatosis.

560
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:42,780
Neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis.

561
01:05:44,130 --> 01:05:51,240
I had a friend who had the retinoblastoma mutation and he had had retinoblastoma and lost one of his eyes.

562
01:05:52,890 --> 01:05:58,110
And he actually had kids and one of his daughters also had retinoblastoma.

563
01:05:58,110 --> 01:06:02,430
So it is, again, not something that's unheard of.

564
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:10,980
And this is a child that the white people, this common in children with retinoblastoma,

565
01:06:13,110 --> 01:06:16,799
there are also mutations in epigenetic machinery that can occur.

566
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:23,730
So histone h three mutations for example in diffuse diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma.

567
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:28,530
This is a brain tumor. So anybody know the famous person?

568
01:06:30,090 --> 01:06:38,970
Yeah. Yeah. So this is where the Red Car Foundation raises money to to to find therapies for dipg.

569
01:06:39,990 --> 01:06:45,540
But again, there's most commonly no predisposing condition for these cancers, which is kind of maddening.

570
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:53,930
There are some twin studies do give us some clues into into, you know, what drives these cancers.

571
01:06:55,100 --> 01:07:02,030
There's a high concordance of leukemia and identical twins suggesting that there's a genetic a strong genetic basis to this.

572
01:07:02,690 --> 01:07:06,260
The concordance is higher in leukemias that have a strong driver mutation.

573
01:07:06,710 --> 01:07:10,190
So they're called AMLO.

574
01:07:10,190 --> 01:07:14,440
The histone is a histone METHYLTRANSFERASE that's involved in these various rearrangements.

575
01:07:14,450 --> 01:07:19,190
So a piece of one chromosome breaks off and fuzes with another piece of another chromosome.

576
01:07:20,210 --> 01:07:23,910
And that goes on to function as an aberrant transcription factor.

577
01:07:25,490 --> 01:07:32,180
So 100% concordance, if one kid has a has this driver mutation, the other kid is going to get leukemia.

578
01:07:33,410 --> 01:07:42,620
Whereas a weak driver, some other types of chromosomal translocations have a much lower concordance between twins and interestingly, leukemia.

579
01:07:42,620 --> 01:07:49,969
Translocations can be identified in up to 1% of newborn infants, but certainly 1% of kids don't go on to develop leukemia.

580
01:07:49,970 --> 01:07:56,370
Right. So the initiating hit happens in utero and that single hit is not sufficient.

581
01:07:56,370 --> 01:08:00,980
And so you need some other genetic or epigenetic factor that contributes to that.

582
01:08:01,430 --> 01:08:06,290
And the research community doesn't fully understand what those what those hits are.

583
01:08:06,290 --> 01:08:09,680
But there's a lot of work to be done in that regard.

584
01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:21,720
Pediatric cancers are epigenetically driven and that chromosomal translocations drive widespread epigenetic reprograming.

585
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:29,910
Again, these leukemias that are driven by this M.L. Fusion, this histone methyltransferase synovial sarcoma.

586
01:08:30,850 --> 01:08:38,339
So another soft tissue tumor. This is caused by disruptions to these chromatin remodeling factors called swi.

587
01:08:38,340 --> 01:08:48,720
Snip Ewing Sarcoma involves chromosomal translocations, but there are other mutations or disruptions in genes that encode chromatin modifiers.

588
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:56,340
Medulloblastoma is an astrocytoma. So again, largely epigenetically driven diseases.

589
01:08:57,850 --> 01:09:06,880
I started doing Sarcoma. I think I'm going to skip over this and just talk briefly about precision medicine before before we adjourn the class.

590
01:09:07,270 --> 01:09:14,350
But Ewing Sakala is an example of this most common bone in soft tissue tumor in children and young adults.

591
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:20,310
And about 25% of patients have metastatic disease at diagnosis.

592
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:24,760
So it's a very, very aggressive tumor and epigenetically driven.

593
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:32,260
And yeah, a lot of work to develop epigenetic therapies to treat these to treat this cancer.

594
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:42,910
And we got him in skip over this. This is just kind of as an example of a pediatric cancer and the epigenetic programing and the DNA methylation

595
01:09:42,910 --> 01:09:47,890
inhibitors and different types of epigenetic drugs that have been tested to treat to treat this tumor.

596
01:09:50,010 --> 01:09:56,370
And I just want to talk in the last couple of minutes that we have in the class about precision medicine.

597
01:09:57,210 --> 01:10:05,010
And so this is an emerging approach for disease treatment and prevention that takes into account individual variability and genes,

598
01:10:05,250 --> 01:10:08,460
environment and lifestyle for each person.

599
01:10:08,490 --> 01:10:15,630
And this is this was the Precision Medicine Initiative that was launched by President Obama in 2015.

600
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:22,290
And this allows doctors and researchers to hopefully predict more accurately which treatment

601
01:10:22,290 --> 01:10:27,060
and prevention strategies for a particular disease will work and in which groups of people.

602
01:10:28,230 --> 01:10:32,190
And omics studies have greatly aided precision medicine, which is excellent.

603
01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:40,590
So one example of this is chronic myeloid leukemia in the Philadelphia chromosome.

604
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:46,290
And this was this is really a prototypical precision medicine example.

605
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:51,450
This was the first chromosomal aberration to be discovered in cancer.

606
01:10:51,750 --> 01:11:01,920
It was discovered in 1960. And so what happens is it's a reciprocal translocation between chromosome nine and chromosome 22.

607
01:11:02,010 --> 01:11:11,639
And so you get this this bcr able fusion that occurs and you have this it forms this aberrant protein kinase,

608
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:16,320
which is an enzyme that goes around and phosphorylated as adding a phosphate group to things.

609
01:11:17,070 --> 01:11:24,480
And phosphorylation is a common mechanism in cells to turn on or off a protein.

610
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:36,240
And so many cases, cancer's cancer related mutations are characterized by mutations and fast and

611
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:41,910
protein kinase because they can go on and turn things on that shouldn't be on.

612
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:50,760
And that's what leads to this accelerated proliferation and and tumorigenesis in many cases.

613
01:11:52,230 --> 01:12:00,810
And this drug, imatinib or Gleevec, was approved in 2001 to treat this to treat this chronic myeloid leukemia.

614
01:12:01,110 --> 01:12:04,620
And it specifically targeted this BCR-ABL kinase.

615
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:10,170
And unfortunately, you know, when this came out,

616
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:17,370
this it was just all the rage in the cancer research community because people thought, well, we don't even need to.

617
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:26,400
We can stop using cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs because we can find these targeted inhibitors of these pathways that promote cancer.

618
01:12:26,730 --> 01:12:40,380
Unfortunately, chronic myeloid leukemia is sort of a an anomaly with regard to its ability to with regard to its sensitivity to a targeted,

619
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:50,410
targeted inhibitor. In most cases, you can't use a single targeted inhibitor to treat a cancer because there are too many escape routes.

620
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:57,960
The cancers people have referred to a growing cancer as evolution on steroids.

621
01:12:58,350 --> 01:13:04,469
So the cells figure out very rapidly a way to if you start hitting them with this inhibitor,

622
01:13:04,470 --> 01:13:09,270
for example, or some other inhibitor, they find a way to escape that pretty quickly.

623
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:14,010
Chronic myeloid leukemia, again, is an anomaly.

624
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:20,970
This inhibitor is quite effective, at least in the initial stages of CML.

625
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:29,400
Eventually, the patients do develop, the tumors do develop some resistance to this, and they need to do some other therapies.

626
01:13:30,810 --> 01:13:39,540
But again, it's kind of the prototypical precision medicine example. All makes, again, is greatly aided precision medicine.

627
01:13:40,860 --> 01:13:43,010
What is omics? It's a study of everything.

628
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:50,240
I just updated these numbers yesterday because the numbers I had that were just a couple of years old were like a fraction of these.

629
01:13:50,250 --> 01:14:00,000
So it's just exploding every year. You know, the microbiome is really, really an area of research interest right now and how that affects our health.

630
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:07,200
The Metabolome So what are the sum of all the metabolites that are generated as in some system that you're studying?

631
01:14:08,130 --> 01:14:15,970
And so there are all sorts of different omics studies that are underway. I'll just talk about transcriptomics and then and then conclude.

632
01:14:15,970 --> 01:14:23,200
But Transcriptomics many of you have probably heard of this or been involved in some transcriptomics studies.

633
01:14:24,490 --> 01:14:30,940
It's probably more common to do a high throughput transcriptomic study at this point than it is to do targeted,

634
01:14:31,330 --> 01:14:37,000
targeted analyzes of specific genes and their changes in expression.

635
01:14:37,030 --> 01:14:41,050
Most of the time we just do the whole genome now or the whole transcriptome.

636
01:14:42,580 --> 01:14:46,270
This is where you have protein encoding messenger RNA transcripts,

637
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:53,320
including alternatively spliced variants and individual cell types have unique transcriptomic

638
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:57,520
profiles that can change over time based on the health of the individual or the environment.

639
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:01,150
And there are methods for measuring the transcriptome.

640
01:15:01,510 --> 01:15:03,880
Microarrays are pretty outdated at this point.

641
01:15:03,910 --> 01:15:14,319
You may see some older papers that use this approach, but also quantitative PCR that allow you to look at individual genes and RNA.

642
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:18,910
SEQ, which is more probably it's getting cheaper and cheaper.

643
01:15:18,910 --> 01:15:22,030
So it's easier to do at this point so that you can just look at the whole

644
01:15:22,390 --> 01:15:27,040
transcriptome and how that's affected by a drug or how it's deregulated in cancer.

645
01:15:29,230 --> 01:15:36,250
And gene expression profiling allows you to analyze gene expression levels for thousands of genes simultaneously.

646
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:39,729
So this is our namesake and its use.

647
01:15:39,730 --> 01:15:48,510
It has uses in disease diagnostics, identifying disease associated snips or fusions, discovery of biomarkers and genome annotation.

648
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:56,679
So this is this is a paper where they've taken a cancer from a brain tumor from a patient,

649
01:15:56,680 --> 01:16:02,680
and then you have the conventional diagnostic histology that can be done, but then you can also do molecular profiling.

650
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:08,020
And that's what really tell you what the gene expression signature is for this particular cancer.

651
01:16:08,590 --> 01:16:13,629
And so the hope is that by using these these high throughput techniques,

652
01:16:13,630 --> 01:16:24,610
we can identify better therapies and yet still still to be determined how well this is going to to work.

653
01:16:25,570 --> 01:16:35,020
I'll also briefly just say that in addition to RNA SEQ, you know, taking a tumor and doing RNA seq now you can also do single cell RNA.

654
01:16:35,020 --> 01:16:38,890
SEQ where you take a tissue or piece of a tumor.

655
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:46,480
You can dissociate that individual into individual cells and you can look at the transcriptional profiles of all the individual cells.

656
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:55,270
So it's gotten very sophisticated and it's really exciting because it just gives you so much more insight into what's going on biologically.

657
01:16:55,420 --> 01:17:00,970
So I've run out of time. There's a few more slides if you want to look through those, if you're interested.

658
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:05,590
But obviously you don't need to know them for for the exam or whatever.

659
01:17:06,370 --> 01:17:10,059
But I appreciate your your questions and your attention.

660
01:17:10,060 --> 01:17:18,610
Again, I know it's early on a Tuesday and late in the semester, and I'm feeling I'm I'm having a rough week adjusting to the time change.

661
01:17:18,610 --> 01:17:24,340
And so I hope you have a great rest of the week and please reach out with the only questions.

662
01:17:24,610 --> 01:17:25,270
So thank you.
