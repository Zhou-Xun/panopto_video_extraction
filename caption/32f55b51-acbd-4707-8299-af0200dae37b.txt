1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:09,190
The. Study designs that have as the unit of analysis, the individual.

2
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:19,850
The person. You recall Monday we went through ecologic studies that have as unit of analysis groups or aggregates.

3
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:29,360
So today we will begin the designs in whom information is collected on and used on individuals.

4
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:45,600
We will go through two main topics. First, I will describe a schematic that we will be using throughout the study designs to describe.

5
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:52,820
The exposure and outcome experiences of a population of people in a population.

6
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:59,600
And we will do this only for dichotomous variables.

7
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:10,860
And then we will delve into cross-sectional studies, which is that first design that measures exposure and outcome in individuals.

8
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:24,500
So you recall this is the classification of study designs we have done and this is what we are doing, right?

9
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:32,810
Now. This is that schematic I mentioned.

10
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:42,080
If we think of a population, it could be represented.

11
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,540
Somehow like this in this representation.

12
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:54,800
Each. Line Road represents a person.

13
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,770
In a window of observation. That is time.

14
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:08,500
This is what we typically see as epidemiologists.

15
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,300
So for each person, each again is represented by each row here.

16
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,760
Data experiences I represented by circles.

17
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:35,860
At each unit of time so the columns can be understood as time units.

18
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:47,020
And in this schematic, we can assume that these time units are common for everybody that can be traced under the same column.

19
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:55,560
Okay. There are two codes that that we use in this schematic.

20
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:01,340
One is a color code to represent exposure status.

21
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:08,780
So arbitrarily I have been using blue to represent.

22
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:16,940
Not being exposed. And great to represent being exposed.

23
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:23,240
And the other code is within the circles that represent.

24
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:33,820
The time experience of each person of the event time unique. They can be open or they can be.

25
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:38,890
Closed, I guess in. So the open circles mean.

26
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:52,210
There was not an outcome at the time unique and the close circles mean there was an outcome experienced at that time.

27
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:59,520
I also have a. A remnant, I guess, from.

28
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:04,549
A previous life that I really don't use.

29
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:13,500
But. I also had a special outcome here, which is, you know, the ultimate outcome there.

30
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,180
And it was a close call me then.

31
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:27,400
Originally it was called the. Crossbones, but it took a lot of memory in the computers ages.

32
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:38,829
And then I realized they rarely use it. So, you know, you can ignore it or you can assume that is is the same as the outcomes or disease.

33
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:42,100
You know, we are talking about that. We will just see these instead.

34
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:48,190
Okay. Any questions on that? Schematic representation.

35
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:56,510
Now. Okay, so using that schematic, we could describe.

36
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:05,450
A few possible exposure experiences a person can go through during an observation window in a population.

37
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:13,200
So there are different types of exposures that can be represented with this schematic.

38
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:24,130
Here we have a person who was exposed and exposed excuse me, in blue during the whole time of observation.

39
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:30,880
And here is a person who was exposed during the whole period of observation.

40
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:40,990
Those exposures are called time invariant or time fixed exposures.

41
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:45,370
We can give you an example of a time invariant exposure.

42
00:05:53,880 --> 00:06:03,760
Rachel. Type of delivery at birth like C-section.

43
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:16,640
Um, right. I guess if you are born via a C-section, you will be exposed to having been born by a C-section.

44
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:24,620
I guess forever in your life, right? So something that happens earlier in life and then doesn't change from then on because you cannot change.

45
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:29,609
That's good. But that's another example. What?

46
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:33,360
Uh. Are we bored with that?

47
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,670
We are sort of stuck, Stephen. Right.

48
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:45,270
Well, but. But smoking. Could smoking change over time?

49
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,600
The smoking status of a person? It can. Right.

50
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:52,290
So perhaps. Perhaps it's not really time invariant.

51
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:59,200
Ask him. Mark. Okay, Asma.

52
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:05,600
Typically, Asma, we consider an outcome. Now it can be an exposure for.

53
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:13,080
For all their outcomes. But. Are we born with asthma and remain with asthma forever?

54
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:27,350
Well, but not really. And it it if it freezes over time, then is not fixed.

55
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,830
My. Mutation.

56
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:36,810
We are born with our genes and are more or less stuck with them.

57
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:42,580
You know, for life. And we either have the mutation or do not have the mutation.

58
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:48,940
Uh, there was another hand race here. Okay, this.

59
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:58,309
Well. I guess as biological constructs?

60
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:03,590
Possibly, yes. I wouldn't say gender, but perhaps sex assigned at birth.

61
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:08,100
Right. Although, I don't know.

62
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:13,430
I think even that can change right over time. Um, perhaps, yes.

63
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:18,020
I think they're genetic in them. And in fact, perhaps the.

64
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:24,230
The sex chromosome. That that that one really cannot be changed.

65
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:31,160
Okay. So those are exposures that are time invariant than fixed.

66
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:39,010
And then, you know, by contrast, there can be exposures that do change over time.

67
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:50,710
And this is an example. This person went through something, an exposure earlier during the observation period and then became unexposed.

68
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:59,770
So that's at time very exposure. And this could represent, you know, maybe perhaps a childhood infection, you know.

69
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:17,950
That was acute and then went away. Or it could be another event, an exposure that.

70
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,750
Linger on for a while. But then changed.

71
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,870
Right. Um.

72
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:37,190
This person was an exposed. Do something.

73
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:43,790
For most of the observation period. Then toward the end of the observation period became exposed.

74
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:48,830
And in fact, had an event an outcome during a.

75
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:58,280
The exposure period. Now the majority of exposures actually are like this.

76
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:06,110
So I would say smoking perhaps falls more into something like this.

77
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:14,279
You know, for some people, some people may go through stages of life or they smoke relatively consistently for a while.

78
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,420
Then they may quit smoking, they may relapse, you know, go back to smoking.

79
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:28,610
Diet aids. It's it's also a classic example, you know, about ice cream intake.

80
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:36,110
But I mean, yeah, you could be exposed every day to ice cream intake, but most of the time perhaps,

81
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,060
you know, people have an ice cream every now and then, so they may be exposed to ice cream.

82
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:48,510
Based on days of. Yeah. That would be a tine variant exposure.

83
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:53,010
And there is a special case. How is this?

84
00:10:55,080 --> 00:11:06,239
Sometimes we actually miss to observe what the exposure to status of somebody might be during some time of the overall observation period.

85
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:13,260
And this is represented by this gap. We don't know what the exposure status of this person was.

86
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:23,570
For this gap. All right. So again, time invariant or fixed and time varying exposures.

87
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,650
We can also represent different outcome experiences and different types of outcomes.

88
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:38,560
So recall the outcomes. I represented by a full circle.

89
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:43,780
Right. And you have a full circle. That means the person experienced an outcome at that time.

90
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:48,460
Unit an open circle means the person is not experiencing an outcome at that time.

91
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:56,290
So this person went through the whole observation period without any outcomes.

92
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:09,230
There are no full circles, right? This person had an outcome that happened only once during one unit didn't happen again.

93
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,270
That outcome could be I mean, we don't know if it's an outcome that could happen again.

94
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:18,530
But for this person only happened once. It's a traffic injury.

95
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:26,190
Yeah. There are also other outcomes that.

96
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:32,500
Once you have them, you are stuck with them.

97
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:39,350
So they would be in very. Examples.

98
00:12:44,240 --> 00:13:00,760
Sorry. Just 1/2. Right, like a permanent physical injury.

99
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:06,240
Like, let's say an amputation of a limb or something.

100
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:09,600
Yeah, that would be a very good example. Is it some.

101
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:25,640
Like which one? There is one example that is HIV is is paradigmatic because.

102
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:42,830
I guess for the most part, once a person is diagnosed with HIV infection, it it at least from a psychological perspective, it never goes away.

103
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:49,190
Right. There are already a few very rare cases in the literature of.

104
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:56,100
People becoming cured from HIV. Are you familiar with those cases?

105
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:00,580
Um. Yeah.

106
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:08,500
I don't recall the details right now, but. I think what he did with CRISPR.

107
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,920
Technology that that but for the most part still, you know, it's a good example of what is which other outcome.

108
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:28,740
It's like this. Herpes.

109
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:35,020
Herpes, one or two? Both. Okay.

110
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:43,780
Good. Any other examples? Alzheimer's.

111
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:48,980
Yeah, that's a that's a good example. Also, you know, unfortunately doesn't go away.

112
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:57,490
Some cancers. Also put. Type one diabetes.

113
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:04,540
Good one. Yep. Is an irreversible damage to the beta cells of the pancreas.

114
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:15,670
That's it. Great. Okay. Um, there are some outcomes, again, that happen only once at, maybe at the beginning of the observation period.

115
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:20,700
Um. Preterm birth.

116
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,890
Uh, you know that that's an outcome that can only happen at birth.

117
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:34,510
And then there are outcomes that that can recur.

118
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:41,290
And this is how we could represent them. Examples of recurrent outcomes.

119
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:46,750
Recurrent outcomes, recurrent means something that may happen again and again and again.

120
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:52,560
Breast cancer. Breast cancer. Yes. Yeah.

121
00:15:53,240 --> 00:16:00,750
Um, and, you know, is something that that lingers on sort of for quite some time, and then it may recur.

122
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:08,010
Yeah. I mean, well, we would hope that that with something like breast cancer wouldn't recur so frequently.

123
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:13,660
But it can. Which other countries are more frequently us.

124
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:19,040
That makes us innovations. Excellent. What else?

125
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:25,070
Seasonal, seasonal, seasonal infections.

126
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:32,900
Infections are the common cold. Fortunately, who hasn't had more than one common cold in life.

127
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:34,790
So. Okay.

128
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:47,280
And again, this represents an interesting situation in which we have a gap of observation in which we don't know whether there were outcomes or not.

129
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:58,670
Right. Okay. So those are the types of exposure experiences and outcome experiences that can be represented with these schematic.

130
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:11,340
No. Now let's go back to our population that we are being we are observing within a given bit.

131
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:20,170
When we observe when we start observing a population, we are actually naive to their.

132
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:25,320
Exposure and outcome status. Right.

133
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:37,560
Before we begin measuring. So that's represented here in green is some sort of an agnostic approach to the population.

134
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:46,770
We still don't know. Okay. The simplest approach.

135
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:57,950
To the explosion. Outcome is stages of a population that we could attempt as epidemiologists would be to do something like this.

136
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:05,800
Trace. Some bucks around the time unit.

137
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:18,260
To take a snapshot. Of the exposure and outcome situation of the population at that single time point.

138
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:29,910
When we do that, which again is the simplest thing we can do in epidemiology and usually the least expensive thing.

139
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:34,640
We are conducting what's called a cross-sectional study.

140
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:45,150
He's taking snapshot at the single time unit of the exposure and outcome experiences of a population.

141
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:57,270
So I am denoting that time unit where we assess the population this time now.

142
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:10,180
Then. The first thing we do when we take the snapshot of the population is typically to assess the outcome.

143
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:18,860
So. We will assess who has the outcome or event of interest.

144
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:28,580
If it's a binary outcome, we would say who has a value of Y equal to one at that?

145
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:29,300
Thankfully.

146
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:43,300
In this example, you know, I have gone and recruited these people and then I have administered a measurement procedure to determine who has the.

147
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:55,660
Any outcome, one specific outcome, you know. So after administering my measuring procedure, I find out that for people.

148
00:19:56,770 --> 00:20:01,930
In this population, have you? Oh, how can I summarize that out?

149
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,760
I can use that proportion because it's it's a binary outcome coded one zero.

150
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:18,690
So I can estimate the probability of Y equals one at all.

151
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:25,510
And that would be. The four people with the outcome in the numerator.

152
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:37,130
Right. Divided by what? Get total the total population in whom I assess the outcome.

153
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:45,200
What type of probability is this? It's a marginal probability, so I need to count everybody.

154
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:52,520
I've done that for you. Here it is, 27 people, and they will be in my denominator.

155
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:59,720
So the result of this operation is 14.8%, 0.148 does the proportion.

156
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:03,320
And if you want to express it as a percentage, it would be 14.8.

157
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:13,880
In the context of a cross-sectional study of this snapshot, that probability has a proper name.

158
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:19,220
That probability is called the prevalence proportion.

159
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:29,110
Or prevents. There are different types of prevalence proportions.

160
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,530
The most common type is called.

161
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:41,230
The point prevalence and is this simple is exactly what we just think it would be defined as the number of people with an event or outcome.

162
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:50,360
Y equals one at a specific timepoint divided by the size of the population in home, says the.

163
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:59,350
The numerator of the point prevalence are the people who had developed even before the

164
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:04,000
specified time point and who were alive and in the population at the time of the assessment.

165
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:07,090
I mean, otherwise you can know this is right.

166
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:16,540
And they had to develop the event before so that you actually got the event by the time you went and assess that population.

167
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:24,200
And the denominator would be everybody alive in the population at the time of assessment, including those with even.

168
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:29,340
That's an important condition. Because it's a marginal probability.

169
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:35,600
You have to include everybody in the calculus. Okay.

170
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:44,840
There is an interesting characteristic of the polling brilliance, which is that.

171
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:53,079
That in a dynamic population in which. New outcomes are happening.

172
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:57,100
Some people are dying. Some people may be leaving the population.

173
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:01,210
Some people may be getting better from the disease or outcome.

174
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:10,720
The point prevalence is going to depend on when you trace that window for a snapshot.

175
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:22,230
They be. It could.

176
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,950
But right now we are not dealing with the explosions. We are just talking about outcomes.

177
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:35,590
Okay. Suppose the outcome we are interested in.

178
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:50,770
If something is an infectious disease, something that's pretty contagious, that can resolve quickly, but that can kill frequently the person with it.

179
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:56,980
An example is Ebola. Have you heard about Ebola?

180
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:06,190
This is a terrible viral infection that causes bleeding from all natural orifices and is frequently fatal.

181
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:12,840
So suppose there is an Ebola outbreak in West Africa or something.

182
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:17,010
And and you are to.

183
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:30,650
Determine the prevalence of Ebola. You know, I guess the day the next day, you are right with your team from the CDC to the outbreak aid.

184
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:37,800
If you did that on this particular day.

185
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:42,470
This is the point prevalence that you would estimate, right?

186
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:53,350
But. As the outbreak evolves, you would find that.

187
00:24:54,550 --> 00:25:00,030
Over time. Some people would be killed by the event.

188
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,560
So, for example, this person died.

189
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:11,370
There is no more information after they got the event that could be interpreted as it did.

190
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,410
This person also died. This person got better.

191
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:26,310
These ones died. So there is a lot of people dying. And there is also quite a few more getting Ebola because these highly contagious.

192
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:35,870
What would have happened if instead of arriving on this day of the outbreak and estimating the point prevalence here,

193
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:41,070
you actually arrived on this date. Well, let's see.

194
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:45,630
On this particular day, how many cases of Ebola there were?

195
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,330
To write out of how many people?

196
00:25:52,340 --> 00:26:02,310
But there is a germ. I don't know, but you can count something better than me.

197
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:10,700
Um. So if we were to calculate the point prevalence, where would these two people go in the numerator?

198
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:18,169
Right. And the denominator would be everybody else who's alive, including these two, which is the number I was having trouble with.

199
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:25,790
But, uh, you, with your younger age sons, you're also were able to get this number, which was 17.

200
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:34,800
Right. So that prevalent the poll prevalence on this day would be 11.8%.

201
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:44,230
So the point prevalence changes according to some characteristics of the outcome.

202
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:53,480
And when you actually get to assess and we will conclude on which those characteristics are next.

203
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:58,760
But first, I want to give you another example, which is of an outcome that behaves differently.

204
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:10,030
Let's say, an outcome that is long lasting as those that we were exemplifying before, some cancers or HIV positivity.

205
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:21,790
So let's say, you know, for for HIV nowadays, mortality is way, way much lower then than it was earlier in the epidemic.

206
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:25,660
Now it's considered mostly a chronic disease that is manageable, treatable.

207
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:32,650
So perhaps you don't expect too many people to die from HIV.

208
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:40,630
So more people will become infected. You know, as time goes by, you know, in a time window of a population.

209
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:49,030
So if you were to estimate the prevalence of HIV again at this particular window, you would get 14.8%.

210
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:54,549
But as time goes by, you know, more people get infected.

211
00:27:54,550 --> 00:28:01,420
Once they get infected, they are always infected. Some die, but many of them just, you know, survive.

212
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:08,050
And if you were to estimate the prevalence again at this window, you would find again a very different picture.

213
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:12,550
Right. How many cases are there here? So we have.

214
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:25,090
Oh, lots of cases 11 which will go in the numerator out of everybody alive, including these 11 which will go in the denominator which is 24.

215
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:30,700
You'd get a prevalence of 45.8% by increments.

216
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:41,500
So now we can conclude that the point prevalence depends on actually two characteristics of the outcome.

217
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:49,230
The appearance of new outcomes in the population.

218
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:54,050
New people acquiring the outcome. Right.

219
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:59,950
That is called incidence, but. You have.

220
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:03,750
You don't have to worry about that word this week.

221
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:11,000
We will worry about that for next week. You have if you have a grace period there.

222
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:22,900
So, yeah, the appearance of new events. And the average duration of the event until recovery or death.

223
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:31,120
Those are the two things on which. The point prevalence depends.

224
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:38,520
Question. If the appearance of new events is higher.

225
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:47,120
Meaning if the incidence is higher. And let's say there are no differences or changes in the average duration of the event.

226
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:53,549
Will the prevalence increase, decrease or remain the same increase?

227
00:29:53,550 --> 00:30:07,150
It should increase, right. If a miraculous cure suddenly appears and is rapidly deployed in population and shortens the duration of of disease,

228
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:10,270
we know changes in the rate of appearance of new cases.

229
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:14,550
Should the prevalence increase or decrease? Decrease.

230
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:18,860
All right. Because you would have fewer cases, right?

231
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:24,450
They would be disappearing from your site or. No.

232
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:30,840
Can we estimate prevalence during a period and this is what I call a rhetorical question because,

233
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:36,870
you know, I guess if I wrote it here, the answer must be yes. So I guess we can.

234
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:42,830
And that. Particular prevalence during the period has a proper name.

235
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:47,570
Guess what the name is? Period prevalence.

236
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:54,900
Yeah, that was a freebie. So the field brownness is the proportion of the population with an event.

237
00:30:56,020 --> 00:31:01,180
See an outcome like let's look at any time during a specified period.

238
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:09,920
This particular example, we have a period that lasts for four time units.

239
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:16,890
Right. And what would go in the numerator of the field prevalence.

240
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:26,900
Okay. In the numerator, you would have the people who have developed who had developed the event before, before the beginning of the period.

241
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:30,780
Right. And would appear at the first time.

242
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:37,380
You need of the billion plus those who developed it during that period.

243
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:43,020
Right. Like, for example, this person or this person or this person,

244
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:49,500
they did not have the event at the beginning of the period, but they developed it sometime during the beat.

245
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:57,790
And in the denominator when you have two options.

246
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:04,330
You could take the average of the population at the beginning and at the end of the period,

247
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:13,700
if you have the information or you can use the population at the midpoint of the period.

248
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:19,020
If you have that information. In this example.

249
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:29,280
Who would go in the nunnery. The people who had the event before you started.

250
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:35,299
Your observation and obviously would appear as having it at the first time you

251
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:43,700
did this for plus those who developed it during the period would be these eight.

252
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:50,110
So the total number of people in the numerator is going to be 12, right.

253
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:54,080
And for the denominator, this particular example,

254
00:32:54,080 --> 00:33:01,820
I invite you to use the average of the population size at the beginning and at the end of the period.

255
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:07,250
So at the beginning of the period, if you count all these people, there were 27.

256
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:13,150
And at the end of the pool, if you count these people, there were. 24.

257
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:23,520
So we take the average 27 plus we four divided by two and we get a period prevalence of 47.1%.

258
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:31,360
Okay. There's this four part.

259
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:38,020
Yeah. Yeah, I guess for. For the sake of simplicity.

260
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:48,270
Yeah. Yeah.

261
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:51,540
I am ignoring the population size in between.

262
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:59,190
I am assuming that the average captures on average by the population size during the four time units.

263
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:07,969
It's no, it's an assumption. I know it's arbitrary, but that's I guess, by convention.

264
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:15,420
What's usually the. Okay.

265
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:19,250
There is a third type. Any other questions? Yes.

266
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:28,300
So if. That's.

267
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:36,080
Okay. You mean the new cases? Yeah, but if they just.

268
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:42,160
They went away. Yes.

269
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:50,250
Thank you. Excellent question. You are. I think that was an excellent question, which I would repeat, if you don't mind.

270
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:57,250
So in this particular example, it seems once people get the event, they're stuck with the event until the end of the year.

271
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:02,830
But what if it's an outcome that can go away and you can have, let's say,

272
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:10,720
a full circle in, you need to have time or let's say t one and then disappears.

273
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:14,590
Should we count that person that Teresa wrote down?

274
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:19,310
Yes. Resounding yes. Great question.

275
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:35,170
Yes. Uh, fantastic follow up question.

276
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:39,310
What if it's a recurrent event that goes away and comes back?

277
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:43,950
How many times do you count it once? Once.

278
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:49,950
So definition perhaps if you want to refine it after this excellent question should be.

279
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:54,720
When an event appears at least once.

280
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:59,550
Regardless of whether it disappears or whether it recurs.

281
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:11,590
You know, I hadn't had those questions in 11 years teaching this.

282
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:18,070
Thank you. And they are so important. And I think I would include them.

283
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:24,180
Hey, for next year if this were the last year that these courses not.

284
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:30,500
Which is true if there is any other questions.

285
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:41,710
You must be the luckiest or unluckiest people on this program, depending on your outlook.

286
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:47,160
But okay, I've tried to make you make it the luckiest.

287
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:51,430
But anyway, there is a third type of privilege.

288
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:56,560
It is called lifetime prevalence.

289
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:06,130
A lifetime prevalence is the proportion of the population with an event or outcome at any time during their lives.

290
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,680
Generally, until a specified age, sometimes until death.

291
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:19,990
Now, this sounds a little bit mysterious, but you could write an example to clarify.

292
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:26,240
The best example really is for birth defects.

293
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:33,280
And in fact, you know, lifetime prevalence is used very often with birth defects.

294
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:42,580
What happens with birth defects? Birth defects are outcomes that are set by the time a baby is born.

295
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:49,770
Right. So. They cannot appear later on.

296
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:55,810
The problem is they may not be caught at birth.

297
00:37:57,710 --> 00:38:02,450
They may be detected later on, but they were already there.

298
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:16,600
So. If you do a survey of birth defects among, you know, let's say, children entering elementary school, you know, five or six.

299
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:26,610
The prevalence of birth defects at that age would represent the lifetime prevalence of birth defects by age five.

300
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:32,420
Not because new birth defects have appeared.

301
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:45,900
Before rich folks buy, because by that age you would have diagnosed and identify all the birth defects that could be identified by that age.

302
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:55,770
So the point prevalence at age five or birth defect would represent a lifetime prevalence by age five.

303
00:38:57,690 --> 00:39:01,020
Look. Lifetime provides.

304
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:06,570
It has to be again for conditions that. Don't change.

305
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:11,540
Outcomes that once. You get them?

306
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:19,290
They are there. They remain there for a. So if you.

307
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:24,120
Summary pointers on prevalence for recall prevalence is in proportion.

308
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:30,360
The numerator is included in the denominator. That's actually the arithmetic definition of a proportion.

309
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:36,960
When the numerator is including the denominator, that's a proportion.

310
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:42,300
Now both have the same units.

311
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:47,700
She has counts of people. That's the other characteristic of a proportion.

312
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:54,030
Whatever is in the numerator has the same units as whatever is in the denominator.

313
00:39:54,720 --> 00:40:02,710
Right. Now very important prevalence is not risk, whatever it is.

314
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,380
Again, you have a grace period of a few days not to worry about risk.

315
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:12,710
Next week is different, but prevalence is not risk.

316
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:19,070
Never equate the two. Never refer to prevalence as risk.

317
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:23,460
Prevalence is prevalence. But this.

318
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:35,140
When it is unspecified. You are reading a paper and the only talk about prevalence you can assume it is point prevalence.

319
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:48,030
All right. So let's go back to our cross-sectional study and let's keep faithful to our mission as epidemiologists, which is to make causal inference.

320
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:56,100
So in addition to. Assessing who has the outcome in this population.

321
00:40:56,580 --> 00:41:02,100
We are certainly interested in assessing who is exposed and unexposed.

322
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:13,440
So we are going to administer another measurement procedure to ascertain exposure status, whatever the exposure is.

323
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:18,209
It could be. And genetic polymorphism.

324
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:22,170
Or it could be having been born by a C-section.

325
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:25,410
Anything that, you know, you may be interested.

326
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:35,730
So I performed my exposure assessment procedure and I find out for each person whether they are exposed to running.

327
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:41,100
This first person was unexposed, the second one and third were exposed.

328
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:48,839
The next one was unexposed. The third was exposed. And so all clear recall that we had color coding.

329
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:52,830
This blue means unexposed, red means exposed.

330
00:41:54,280 --> 00:42:05,110
We? We can summarize now our information here in one of those famous two by two tables.

331
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:22,690
So I have here, again, put the exposure status in columns and the outcome in rows, and we can proceed to count how many people are exposed overall.

332
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:30,790
Okay. Nine.

333
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:35,140
What those anybody who appears in red.

334
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:40,030
Okay. So if you count the red circles, there is nine of them.

335
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:45,670
That would be the total people exposed at all of those exposed.

336
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:51,760
How many appear as having an outcome at the time you assess the population?

337
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:56,830
Three. So they would go on the cell, right?

338
00:42:57,130 --> 00:43:01,720
Y equals one. Among those who are exposed. How many people are unexposed?

339
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:09,440
Still in total? 18. I mean, you know, you can count them or you can believe in me.

340
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:14,010
All righty. You can also do both.

341
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:18,960
And of those 18, how many appear as having an outcome?

342
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:23,880
One so that one person would be sent and this is obviously the total.

343
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:28,060
Right. Question for you.

344
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:36,270
If we wanted to assess whether there is an association between exposure and outcome.

345
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:41,300
How can we go about? What should we do?

346
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:48,710
It seems I am asking this question at every single lecture lesbian book.

347
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:04,830
Except let's estimate the conditional probabilities of outcome, conditional on exposure status and compared.

348
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:22,630
So for the exposed with a probability of equals one given a equals one, this is three divided by nine or 0.333 350, also 33.3% for the unexposed.

349
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:26,560
But we do if y equals one given eight +01 divided by 18.

350
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:36,680
5.6%. To describe the magnitude of this association.

351
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:41,530
What do we do? We have two options. You remember which options?

352
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:48,560
We can use an absolute or additive scale to do the numerical comparison of the conditional probabilities,

353
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:52,580
or we could use the multiplicative or really scale.

354
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:58,310
Okay, so let's first use the absolute scale or so-called additive.

355
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:05,960
That would consist simply of taking the difference between these two prevalence.

356
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:10,380
And if we proceed in that way, we would be estimating.

357
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:14,660
What's called a measure of association.

358
00:45:15,970 --> 00:45:26,020
And because we are dealing with prevalence and we are using the absolute scale that measure has a proper name is called the prevalence difference.

359
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,300
Use, as it sounds, is the difference in prevalence between exposure groups.

360
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:37,990
So we could take the prevalence in the ex post minus the prevalence in the unexposed.

361
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:45,250
That would be equal to 32.3%, -5.6% or 27.7%.

362
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:55,050
How would we interpret that in words? Well, we can say there is a positive association between exposure and disease.

363
00:45:55,290 --> 00:46:07,470
Would you agree? Because being exposed is related to or corresponds to higher proportion or high proportion of disease prevalence.

364
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:20,510
And then to describe the magnitude, you would say the prevalence in the exposed is 28% in excess of the prevalence in the unexposed.

365
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:25,800
In the absolute scale we avoid.

366
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:34,110
Saying higher or lower because by convention those words.

367
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:42,090
Are reserved for the multiplicative scale. So in the additive scale, we prefer to say.

368
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:48,020
The prevalence is in excess. You can see more.

369
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:54,180
Or you could say less if the association is in laws.

370
00:46:55,790 --> 00:46:58,880
Okay. Just a little note on use of lamps.

371
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:07,899
Now I don't really use kind of notation in tables,

372
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:17,640
but so at the very end of the course there will be a couple of lectures on statistical analysis and we may come back to these.

373
00:47:17,650 --> 00:47:23,470
You do not need to learn this because this is completely arbitrary change, but.

374
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:37,270
You know, if. If you wanted to express this in terms of some general notation, this is how you could do it.

375
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:40,660
You could give letter names to the cells and then.

376
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:49,450
You know. You know, the reason why I don't really like this is because it's it's unnecessary.

377
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:56,739
I guess it's it's pretty logical if you just, you know, do it according to how your table is set up.

378
00:47:56,740 --> 00:48:01,299
If somebody changes the setup of the table, you will be in trouble.

379
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:08,360
Because, you know, this would change that, you know? No.

380
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:16,370
Let's use the other option to express the magnitude of association, which would be the relative or multiplicative escape.

381
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:24,970
If we were to divide. The prevalence is one of the oldest.

382
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:32,270
We would be estimating the prevalence rate. Because the ratio of the prevalence rate.

383
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:41,890
So the measure of association. On the multiplicative scale in a cross-sectional study is the prevalence ratio.

384
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:53,250
In the additive scale, the prevalence differs. So you can proceed dividing the prevalence in the exposed light, the prevalence in the unexposed.

385
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:56,330
That would be 33.3 divided by 5.6.

386
00:48:57,570 --> 00:49:03,250
That presents. The percent things cancel out and you have six.

387
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:11,680
The prevalence ratio is six. You would say there is a positive association between exposure and disease.

388
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:15,370
The prevalence in the exposed is six times higher.

389
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:21,790
Then you can see higher and times than the prevalence in the unexposed.

390
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:29,840
That's the way to interpret that in words. Okay.

391
00:49:32,590 --> 00:49:35,750
And again, using this notation, this would be how?

392
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:42,910
You would summarize the expression. Any questions on that?

393
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:47,290
You know, it's really straightforward, I hope. Relatively simple stuff.

394
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:56,160
Measures. The measure of frequency in a cross-section of studies call the prevalence of prevalence the simplest one.

395
00:49:56,850 --> 00:50:00,210
It measures of association depend on the scale.

396
00:50:01,490 --> 00:50:09,010
On the absolute scale is the prevalence difference on the relative scale or multiplicative is the prevalence rate.

397
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:17,550
A few pointers. The prevalence differences are expressed in percentages because they don't cancel out.

398
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:21,810
But. What is the prevalence ratios at units?

399
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:29,760
Okay. Now from a design point of view.

400
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:41,050
The main characteristic of a cross-sectional study is that the exposure and the outcome are measured at the same time.

401
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:50,690
Therefore. The way to understand exposure and outcome in a cross-sectional study is us.

402
00:50:50,970 --> 00:51:07,140
Current exposure and current. Let me give you an example from real life, real data of a cross-sectional study.

403
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:15,340
So surveys conducted in 470 children, six years old at the beginning of the school year.

404
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:19,870
As part of this survey, weight and height are measured and a blood sample is done.

405
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:24,670
Vitamin D levels are measured in blood and classified as deficient.

406
00:51:25,330 --> 00:51:29,440
If the levels are under 50 grams per liter, there were 49.

407
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:36,370
Such grades is sufficient if the levels are between 50 and 74 and there were 218.

408
00:51:36,370 --> 00:51:44,400
Such kids are sufficient in levels where greater than or equal to 75, and there were 203 such case.

409
00:51:45,990 --> 00:51:51,360
They are also classified as adequate or overweight according to their body mass index.

410
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:56,420
And the number of overweight children in each of the vitamin D groups is nine.

411
00:51:56,900 --> 00:52:04,670
Meaning in these vitamin D deficient groups, 29 in this insufficient group, and 16 in this.

412
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:12,410
A sufficient group. Summarize the data and describe the association.

413
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:16,760
This is a typical homework question.

414
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:25,730
So let's let's go through it. The first thing you should really do is to identify.

415
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:31,160
An exposure and an outcome with these prompts.

416
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:36,950
What would you. Thing could be the exposure and the.

417
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:46,089
Come. The exposure could be vitamin D levels.

418
00:52:46,090 --> 00:52:50,210
Right. And the outcome is being. Overweight, perhaps.

419
00:52:50,330 --> 00:52:53,549
Okay. So.

420
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:57,300
Okay, we got that figured out that that's, you know, that's quite reasonable.

421
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:04,590
All right. Now, how would we summarize the data and then describe the association?

422
00:53:05,130 --> 00:53:11,700
We could use a table. So again, let's have exposure levels in the columns.

423
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:17,310
Note that in this case we have a three level exposure variable.

424
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:22,440
Is not binary is three levels. Right. Um.

425
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:29,010
So I have labeled the vitamin D sufficient as a equals zero by convention.

426
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:40,110
You take that as the unexposed. Then there is a group who is insufficient and have, let's say, an intermediate level of exposure.

427
00:53:40,110 --> 00:53:41,850
And I have labeled them with the equals one.

428
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:52,170
And then there is a group that is exposed to something supposedly bad, you know, deficiency and labeled them as equals to.

429
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:59,510
And then again, you know, conventionally I have I have included the.

430
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:08,050
Outcome in the Grossman here are those with elderly and those without elderly.

431
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:14,950
So I'm just here showing you the numbers where I got them from and where I put them.

432
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:19,300
So this is the total number of people in this exposure, category 49.

433
00:54:19,810 --> 00:54:24,310
This one is the number of people in this exposure category and these one.

434
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:35,890
Is the total in this cut. Okay. And what I wrote, the numbers I wrote on the Y equals one.

435
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:48,190
Are this right? Thank. So the first step is to estimate the summary measures of outcome conditional on exposure.

436
00:54:48,210 --> 00:55:01,560
Right. So we can estimate first the probability of the outcome in the group of deficient kids as nine divided by 49, and that's 18.4.

437
00:55:01,650 --> 00:55:08,300
Next, we can do the same in the next level of exposure, those who are insufficient.

438
00:55:08,390 --> 00:55:18,660
So in nine divided by 218. And finally we do the same for the group is sufficient or 16 divided by 20 then a 79%.

439
00:55:22,990 --> 00:55:26,470
To estimate the magnitude of dissociation. We have two options.

440
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:33,440
We can go the absolute or additive scale. We can go the relative or multiplicative scale for the interest of time.

441
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:38,680
May have escaped the additive scale here. You will have a chance to practice that.

442
00:55:39,790 --> 00:55:49,180
So fear not. And then I'm going to estimate in the relative scale that as a measure of association.

443
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:54,530
Prevalence rates. Thank you.

444
00:55:55,790 --> 00:56:06,820
Yeah, no, there is there is a bit of a of of of difference here from the previous example, which is that we have three categories of exposure.

445
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:14,570
Right. So we have to make a decision and we have to pick one against which to compare the others.

446
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:19,680
That one we pick is called the reference category.

447
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:24,310
The reference. There are.

448
00:56:26,510 --> 00:56:29,629
A number of, I guess, possibilities.

449
00:56:29,630 --> 00:56:34,790
I wouldn't say even rules to pick the reference category, but one of them is, you know,

450
00:56:35,090 --> 00:56:42,830
depending on the type of message you want to convey, you could pick a reference category, the unexposed.

451
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:57,110
So let's do that in this case. The prevalence ratio for this exposure category equals two compared to the reference

452
00:56:57,110 --> 00:57:04,040
category of the unexposed would then be the ratio between the two prevalence rate of 2.3.

453
00:57:05,850 --> 00:57:11,920
For the eight equals one exposure category, it would be the ratio of the two prevalence.

454
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:19,290
Or 1.69. And how about for the reference category itself?

455
00:57:21,210 --> 00:57:27,840
We can actually divide it by itself and that's conventional so that we that would always be one.

456
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:33,390
So the prevalence ratio for the reference category will always be one.

457
00:57:37,070 --> 00:57:46,220
Now we can describe the association, right? There is an inverse monotonic association between vitamin D status and the prevalence is overweight.

458
00:57:47,390 --> 00:57:55,570
Are you in agreement that the association is inverse? Because the higher vitamin D levels.

459
00:57:56,670 --> 00:58:05,590
The lower the prevalence of overweight. And after the direction and shape.

460
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:11,530
We describe the magnitude. So we would say children with vitamin D deficiency have a prevalence of

461
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:20,080
overweight 2.3 times or 133% higher than those with sufficient vitamin D levels.

462
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:22,840
So is the same as we have been doing before,

463
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:31,540
except that now we are giving it proper names prevalence because we are in the context of a specific study design, the cross-sectional study.

464
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:48,520
Okay. But recall, the types of measures that you choose and have available really depend on the scale of measurement of your variables.

465
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:56,140
So let's suppose we have an outcome. That's measured in a continuous scale.

466
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:03,360
The mean body mass index of these children.

467
00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:15,120
So you are given the main body mass index for each exposure group and are asked to summarize the data and describe the association.

468
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:18,200
So again, you could use a simple table.

469
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:31,510
But note, rather than using the probability now you have to use the expected value or mean right because it's not a binary outcome anymore.

470
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:37,690
It's a continuous out. Right. And how would you describe this association?

471
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:48,900
Well. You would estimate the expected values of the outcome for each exposure category, which they have already done it for you here.

472
00:59:51,410 --> 00:59:56,510
And then the measure of association in this case would just be the mean difference.

473
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:04,110
You would not be gracious here because the scale is continuous, so they mean differences.

474
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:12,120
You also have to set one category as the reference and for, you know, consistency, I guess we would pick the same one, the unexposed,

475
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:21,480
then we would subtract the average values, the expected values of each exposure or category minus that reference and would obtain.

476
01:00:22,770 --> 01:00:28,260
This one's for the reference category, obviously in the continuous scale.

477
01:00:29,010 --> 01:00:35,280
The difference will be zero. The interpretation of this association would still be.

478
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:39,930
There is an inverse association between vitamin D status and mean BMI.

479
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:46,790
So this has changed. And numerically, you'd say children with vitamin D deficiency have a mean BMI,

480
01:00:47,330 --> 01:00:53,210
2.2 kilograms per square meter less than those with sufficient vitamin D levels.

481
01:00:54,170 --> 01:00:56,990
You could also say children with.

482
01:00:58,970 --> 01:01:08,660
Vitamin D and sufficiency have 1.1 kilograms per square meter, less BMI and children with sufficient vitamin D levels.

483
01:01:08,830 --> 01:01:17,630
You know, you could describe the associations for each category I have just summarized here and describe just what.

484
01:01:20,230 --> 01:01:24,850
So those are sort of the, you know, nuts and bolts, as they say.

485
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:32,110
But the more interesting question really after this study would be this.

486
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:38,410
Is there a causal effect of vitamin D?

487
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:44,060
On other. How would you answer these questions?

488
01:01:46,490 --> 01:01:53,080
What do you need to answer this question? After you have done your study with hopefully before you.

489
01:01:55,170 --> 01:02:01,990
I think you. You said this before. What do we need? We need protocols and knowledge to interpret.

490
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:10,980
The causal potential of our results. This would be the causal question, right?

491
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:17,490
And then I do my first kind of search of of prior knowledge, and I find this out.

492
01:02:18,330 --> 01:02:26,560
It turns out that. Vitamin D is belongs to a group of vitamins that are called fat soluble.

493
01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:32,200
That means they they are lipophilic. They really like fat.

494
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:39,060
There are four fat soluble vitamins. And these one of them.

495
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:50,780
So because of of of its life, Ofelia turns out vitamin D is sequestered out of plasma and deposited in adipose tissue.

496
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:58,930
And turns out that persons with overweight have usually more adipose tissue that persons without.

497
01:03:00,790 --> 01:03:06,050
So. If this is true, which it is, by the way.

498
01:03:07,510 --> 01:03:13,120
Thus can we conclude from this cross-sectional study that vitamin D.

499
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:18,540
Protect yourself against overweight. No.

500
01:03:19,710 --> 01:03:23,220
So. We need to redraw the duck.

501
01:03:24,150 --> 01:03:28,890
How do we redraw the duck? Yeah.

502
01:03:30,210 --> 01:03:38,760
Instead of an arrow from vitamin D to overweight, we actually have an arrow from overweight into vitamin D.

503
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:51,150
Overweight causes low plasma levels of vitamin D because the vitamin D has been sequestered into adipose tissue, which is.

504
01:03:52,390 --> 01:03:57,340
More abundant a in persons with overweight. Okay.

505
01:03:59,730 --> 01:04:04,310
Is there a statistical association? Yes.

506
01:04:04,490 --> 01:04:09,120
We saw it, in fact. Yep. Is this castle?

507
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:15,600
No. This particular problem has a proper name.

508
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:20,870
And in fact, we have been through it already. Is reverse causation bias?

509
01:04:20,870 --> 01:04:26,420
Exactly. Reverse causation. This is a typical example of reverse causation.

510
01:04:29,010 --> 01:04:32,880
And it is also important to remark at this point that.

511
01:04:35,510 --> 01:04:40,530
Reverse causation is perhaps. The most common.

512
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:45,210
Bias problem in cross-sectional studies.

513
01:04:47,720 --> 01:05:00,380
You cannot possibly conclude about causation in cross-sectional studies because there is no a time dimension.

514
01:05:03,740 --> 01:05:12,020
Between the occurrence of exposure and hope and recall the number one.

515
01:05:13,570 --> 01:05:20,860
Condition for causation to occur is that the exposure or the cause has to precede the outcome in time, right?

516
01:05:22,660 --> 01:05:30,220
If you assess both at the same time, there's absolutely no way for you to tell which one precedes the other.

517
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:36,310
And in some instances.

518
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:48,380
You can actually misinterpret your results if whatever you think is the outcome could actually cause whatever you think was the exposure.

519
01:05:50,620 --> 01:05:53,650
So one of the main problems of cross-sectional studies is.

520
01:05:56,250 --> 01:06:05,880
Reverse causation. Yeah, but let's say I, um, I do some, you know, I continue searching my prior knowledge.

521
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:12,270
And then I find an interesting set of of.

522
01:06:13,950 --> 01:06:19,040
Association in an Excel system. You. Spending time outdoors.

523
01:06:21,110 --> 01:06:31,250
Causes Vitamin D levels because vitamin D is mostly produced by the action of Little Island B race on the skin.

524
01:06:31,940 --> 01:06:41,749
Right. And so the high cholesterol and then the more you are exposed to the sun, the more vitamin D levels you produce.

525
01:06:41,750 --> 01:06:50,080
It's going to get back to you in a second. So they know those causes, vitamin D levels.

526
01:06:51,310 --> 01:06:58,320
On the other hand, they molders. Because it's physical activity, you know, now six year old.

527
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:06,410
Would a six year old outside under the sun. You won't get that keen to stand still.

528
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:18,450
And then you also know that physical activity could have a causal effect on energy balance and overweight.

529
01:07:20,950 --> 01:07:30,009
If this is the true causal system, you know, from my customers, that's vitamin D because of a weight gain.

530
01:07:30,010 --> 01:07:35,030
We conclude from the cross-sectional study. No way.

531
01:07:35,140 --> 01:07:41,440
Well, because according to this, that there isn't a single directed path.

532
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:45,890
From Vitamin D into overweight.

533
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:50,310
Is there a statistical association? Yes.

534
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:58,060
What? Because they are connected through a pulse, you know?

535
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:03,740
This part. But this is an open path, right?

536
01:08:03,890 --> 01:08:06,890
Why is it open? There are no colliders.

537
01:08:07,490 --> 01:08:10,820
Therefore, you should see a statistical association.

538
01:08:10,850 --> 01:08:14,030
In fact, we saw it. But.

539
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:22,230
They are not causally related because that is what type of parties that those that.

540
01:08:24,610 --> 01:08:31,000
It's an open border. But remember, we are connected through a common cause.

541
01:08:31,030 --> 01:08:36,340
The common cause? Release time outdoors. Right. Okay.

542
01:08:37,150 --> 01:08:41,200
So the name of this bias, obviously, is this this problem, this, this.

543
01:08:42,330 --> 01:08:45,300
Non causal explanation is non exchange ability.

544
01:08:50,140 --> 01:08:58,660
Gates in the event Vitamin D exposure levels are not exchangeable with each other with respect to their time outdoors.

545
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:09,180
All right. These are so called confounding. And you don't need to worry about this for a longer period than other things with.

546
01:09:09,780 --> 01:09:19,460
Okay. Question. Association.

547
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:28,380
Yes and no causation. Causation. No.

548
01:09:28,830 --> 01:09:31,080
No. Is there. A good question. Yeah.

549
01:09:31,650 --> 01:09:39,620
So is is is is is the temporal sequence temporality a requirement for for association only statistical association?

550
01:09:39,630 --> 01:09:44,280
It is not. It is not. So you can collect protection cross-sectional so.

551
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:50,510
And the association. I wasn't thinking that right.

552
01:09:50,780 --> 01:10:01,490
So yeah, of course you can find associations, interesting lists then, because they don't depend on the temporality of cause and effect.

553
01:10:02,150 --> 01:10:05,600
But you cannot conclude about causation because you don't have that temporal.

554
01:10:06,690 --> 01:10:11,590
Okay. Right.

555
01:10:12,950 --> 01:10:18,140
So this is the second, you know, another very common issue with cross-sectional studies.

556
01:10:18,950 --> 01:10:27,790
Lack of exchange, ability confound. This is a summary of the measures available.

557
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:39,430
To describe associations in cross-sectional studies according to the scale of the.

558
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:49,070
So if you have dichotomous outcomes, the measure of frequency recall is the prevalence proportion.

559
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:58,170
There can be point prevalence this period prevalence is sometimes lifetime prevalence, but the most common really is the point prevalence.

560
01:11:00,890 --> 01:11:05,240
The measures of association would emanate from the prevalence.

561
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:13,160
And they are in the absolute scale, the prevalence difference in the multiplicative scale, the prevalence ratio.

562
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:28,449
Right. If you happen to have continuous outcomes such as means, means of a continuous outcome in each exposure or group, the measure of frequency.

563
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:33,370
Well, I guess the the name is perhaps not completely correct, but there is going to be that mean.

564
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:37,940
And the measure of association would be the main difference.

565
01:11:40,690 --> 01:11:44,640
The difference in the means. For each exposure cut.

566
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:56,299
Right. That was just this summer. So if your final one pointers on processing seeking things recall you are subject to reverse causation.

567
01:11:56,300 --> 01:12:02,070
Bias is one of the most. Um, pervading problems.

568
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:07,739
They are also subject to non exchange ability and also to other biases.

569
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:13,760
We will study in detail later in the course. They do not measure risk.

570
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:19,280
Do not ever talk about risk in the context of cross-sectional studies.

571
01:12:20,810 --> 01:12:27,500
Um, they can be relatively low cost, do not require frequent contacts.

572
01:12:28,180 --> 01:12:38,300
Uh, so in general, you know, they are certainly less expensive than other study designs we will start looking into next week.

573
01:12:40,850 --> 01:12:46,190
But they are really still very helpful and quite widely used.

574
01:12:46,910 --> 01:12:56,420
In fact, some of you may end up doing your alleles using cross-sectional studies, and I'm sure they could be really, really good ones.

575
01:12:56,610 --> 01:12:59,730
Um. Because, for example.

576
01:13:00,910 --> 01:13:06,530
Most national surveys are in fact cross-sectional studies, NHANES.

577
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:12,670
You all know by now what enhances the national health.

578
01:13:15,180 --> 01:13:20,610
I nutrition examination survey which is conducted in the US regularly.

579
01:13:22,090 --> 01:13:23,660
Its cross-sectional studies.

580
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:35,910
Each time they conduct NHANES, they are just tracing a snapshot of the US population with respect to lots of exposures and lots of them.

581
01:13:37,910 --> 01:13:44,770
And there are others. Anybody familiar with this DHS?

582
01:13:45,830 --> 01:13:47,600
Demographic and health service.

583
01:13:47,720 --> 01:14:00,100
So they are also, you know, like nationally representative surveys from many countries that are put together into one sort of super dataset and so on.

584
01:14:00,630 --> 01:14:11,060
So, so that is quite helpful. They can provide information to generate new hypotheses, even if you cannot conclude causation from.

585
01:14:12,260 --> 01:14:17,450
Then directly, you know, you can get new ideas to test with other studies.

586
01:14:19,130 --> 01:14:30,110
Any questions on what we have covered today? All right.

587
01:14:30,410 --> 01:14:33,620
So here is your progress report. You learned a lot.

588
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:38,720
Then you learned how to escape different exposure and outcome experiences.

589
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:45,710
Define prevalence proportion, at least words in the numerator and denominator and where the data come from.

590
01:14:45,950 --> 01:14:50,390
Snapshot distinguish point prevalence from period prevalence.

591
01:14:53,010 --> 01:15:01,590
Again, you can always in terms of what are the numerator and denominator in each and the difference should just come right back to your I.

592
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:12,960
Calculate those prevalence, then prevalence recognized two elements that the prevalence depends on what are those two it.

593
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:28,970
Yes. So the incidence and the average duration of the.

594
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:39,000
Identify a cross-sectional study by its main characteristic was the main characteristic of a cross-sectional study.

595
01:15:41,870 --> 01:15:45,760
Okay. Right. And that implies that.

596
01:15:51,030 --> 01:15:57,850
Well, let's see what my. Exposure and outcome are assessed at the same time.

597
01:15:58,570 --> 01:15:59,470
Main characteristic.

598
01:16:01,750 --> 01:16:11,090
Estimated measures of association in cross-sectional studies for dichotomous and continuous outcomes for dichotomous outcomes depends on the scale.

599
01:16:11,090 --> 01:16:15,590
Absolute prevalence difference. Relative prevalence ratio.

600
01:16:17,780 --> 01:16:22,040
They named a major limitation of cross-sectional studies for causal inference.

601
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:27,540
No temporality, therefore possible reverse causation.

602
01:16:28,340 --> 01:16:32,670
Okay. Explain another limitation of observational studies.

603
01:16:33,390 --> 01:16:37,360
Lack of. Exchange of. In a nutshell.

604
01:16:38,870 --> 01:16:44,840
Right. Uh, so if there are no more questions, I wish you a good weekend.

605
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:49,910
I should be posting the homework today.

606
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:54,150
Remember, the second homework is due today.

607
01:16:55,930 --> 01:16:59,760
And human and.

608
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:19,370
A real protester. So what does it mean when these guys do this?

609
01:17:19,370 --> 01:17:25,510
Only for Eddie? Pardon me again. And what does it mean for this band of.

610
01:17:28,700 --> 01:17:37,429
Be. I knew that the only thing milk intake as one of the variables exposure or outcome.

611
01:17:37,430 --> 01:17:45,260
You say coronary heart disease as the only variable exquisite about both is to only on the fat to between those two.

612
01:17:47,130 --> 01:17:51,740
It is also going to tell you here is one place going to run the air, not only right?

613
01:17:52,130 --> 01:18:04,690
Right. Okay. Thanks to this, move outside because there is no matter how you feel about sit down.

614
01:18:04,890 --> 01:18:11,290
Yes, I am.

615
01:18:13,780 --> 01:18:21,610
I knew that. That's right.

616
01:18:22,340 --> 01:18:28,420
And you know what I mean? That's I think that was ridiculous.

617
01:18:28,650 --> 01:18:35,230
Yeah, right.

618
01:18:36,530 --> 01:18:40,660
Right. Even even with the deadline. Right.

619
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:51,310
Yeah. So we have a lot of gun owners here and murder.

620
01:18:55,010 --> 01:19:04,970
What do you think might be relevant for the time being?

621
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:09,050
Well, no, it does seem like old times.

622
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:16,050
This is just the first time.

623
01:19:17,810 --> 01:19:25,110
And I really think that can do two things in a funny. Yeah.

624
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:39,610
Well, no, because you're going to see a lot of these ads anyway.

625
01:19:40,430 --> 01:19:57,370
You simply like. Many of you as we keep telling you the.
