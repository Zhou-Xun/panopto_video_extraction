1
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,700
So today is another one of these kind of unscheduled project work data, unstructured project work.

2
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:39,030
So if you work with your groups and let me know if you have questions.

3
00:00:47,340 --> 00:01:14,760
This would not. He speaks 34600.

4
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:20,639
We have a fortune which allows us to deliver a truly massive one.

5
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,880
So I was like, Really? I don't think so.

6
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:33,420
It's not even close to here to do it.

7
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:56,880
Yes, we have a huge amount of little ones that people will be impressed with this Christmas.

8
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:01,720
Okay. You already have.

9
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,780
You know of you.

10
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:14,910
You on a date through like February, some suggestions for long time.

11
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,120
You do really well.

12
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,450
It's going to be a really interesting.

13
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:39,710
Okay. Let's talk about how you use your high school this year.

14
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:45,720
I mean, it's something I don't like to share the coverage on that.

15
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:50,670
But on the surface, the great job is right now in the latest season.

16
00:02:50,970 --> 00:03:06,140
So it's definitely for everyone, no matter what direction you went it for you.

17
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:11,780
When just work out. Which is what he told us. The whole story.

18
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:37,850
What are your plans? And then having persons whom we probably should like share it with the ability to, I guess, have any questions.

19
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,550
Oh, well, yeah, we probably have a lot of questions.

20
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:58,260
And so if we go to register object from project to service, one, one, two, one, one, two, two, two, one.

21
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:20,080
And once you want to know that, to have to look at it.

22
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:28,820
Okay. So that's for you, I suppose I used to lose.

23
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:46,370
Oh, about the patients on Congress. Get most of those which we used to measure things like the physical and mental disorders.

24
00:04:46,520 --> 00:05:01,160
Yeah. I would like to see some of these issues involved in decisions, but you know, different, which is why we killed.

25
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:02,630
So it will kill you.

26
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:16,310
My friend is like, I guess you have so many others in the house because I'm just always, you know, I always get a little bit, you know?

27
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:31,760
Yeah. I mean, there are those choosing between eight divided by seven seems like I mean that was all just

28
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:39,680
editing the calculations to make sure it matches the violence or a lot of interest in this.

29
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:55,060
Yeah, I think it's it's like know, I don't know that, you know,

30
00:05:56,450 --> 00:06:04,540
if you're looking just to practice status and I would highly recommend the quantitative methods of program evaluation courses.

31
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:12,620
Okay. Yeah. That is like to me the most helpful is the analysis course.

32
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:19,099
And like I've taken a class and you can take, for example, like, like I just like teach things very differently.

33
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,970
And so it's not, it's very theoretical, it's not very grounded in reality.

34
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,030
So I would I highly recommend that class is really, really useful.

35
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:37,050
Quantitative passes for program evaluations, which I think it's to run six, five, eight, six, four, five, six, eight or something like that.

36
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:48,710
Yeah, thanks. Because I was I was sort of like the economy courses in this kind of like 90 600 yeah.

37
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:52,590
Yeah. Which seems like something more likely.

38
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:58,940
Yeah. Yeah. That's, that's sort of what I found is that like, you want like transferable skills,

39
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:12,469
like what to do with like a very hard work practice job for this very diverse use of sky resort in my sign up appointments and like,

40
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:20,140
where do we get so that we get like that data, we can do the analysis or something.

41
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:31,220
We need a something that's yeah, I'm working on it for like our other things would ease of use a little bit, you know,

42
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:56,660
based on that study which is a closet Ross immersion which is I don't know which one is the one about that I think I was looking at is work for baby.

43
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:03,950
Is that okay?

44
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:11,479
Yeah. Okay. When I get home doesn't have a bunch of it, which probably just because we're going to have a meeting with them.

45
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,930
But I think something is.

46
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:30,630
Someone is. At the beginning.

47
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:44,420
In the next few years.

48
00:08:52,670 --> 00:09:18,440
There's one quote that the most extreme wings in the country basically have to use to make sure that we get to the top in this country.

49
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,860
One study that was done to match the quality of life.

50
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,420
So study intention.

51
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:58,250
It doesn't say whether it uses you as a service for your parameters, but I think what you want is you give parameters that are in the model.

52
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:03,860
So you're saying, like, can you let people go from, like smoking to dead at, what, three?

53
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:11,090
Like all the all the studies, all the standards that are built into the Marcos and they need to be laid out here.

54
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:22,020
I mean, there's only two things you don't have that as a complete individual as they're doing.

55
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:25,940
Is that zero? All right.

56
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:30,330
Let me see what the CDC life table thinking is.

57
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:33,810
One with all with all the product where you guys.

58
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:34,549
Yeah,

59
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:44,360
but but do you have the parameters for that for the markup to you were just you put so they're all that it should be automatically like we didn't

60
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:58,330
find any extra gravity it's just like well you have the parameters like the legs in the decision tree don't include the parameters of split.

61
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:03,460
Let's split on what we're going through now. Okay.

62
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:13,610
So because I mean, they were talking about how you could split up this quality thing because I mean, it's going to take a long time.

63
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:19,969
But the thing is, I just I don't know how what is motivating of the throughout the quality thing is like

64
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:25,970
the stuff five cohorts we have to do that for the new single fairly straightforward.

65
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:31,550
So if you look at my like the top three models 75 years,

66
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:40,870
you can see like I have something like under the band health section that's like band quality is band intervention cost, band health care costs.

67
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:46,340
So for the band intervention cost is the same cost every single year for even years.

68
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:50,720
And if it's just discounted, there's one that's just specific.

69
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:56,490
Like, like I'm not just we're saying like this is the budgetary costs going to law enforcement agency.

70
00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:07,010
We're like, you're right, you so it's not really like so like you're really designing like one working basically subtracting from like,

71
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:12,050
you know, we have like, let's say, like, like how we do the material quality.

72
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:18,500
Like we're just going to be like more significant difference between the business world,

73
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:26,510
like social or whatever we want to do because because we're going to piece it up.

74
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:32,240
That sounds good. So for your fan markup, you have kind of like time.

75
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:40,400
So here you have to question like it's just a cost, man.

76
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,720
And so like this initiative you.

77
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:56,980
So if you go if you go to class with Bam, you have you're like smoking cause we're here,

78
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:04,540
which is just like not for the lifetime health care cost times likening the data in our models, the number of people who become smokers.

79
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:14,830
So then in addition to that, for each year, for each cohort, you need to add like what needs to happen is for the law enforcement,

80
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:23,910
which is like I mentioned, it's not like you're not modeling anything, but there is another lottery.

81
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:29,590
The cost is gonna go to the students in the area together.

82
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,890
Okay. I was like, okay, then. So what you can go to the summary tab.

83
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:39,190
Like you can see like our output should be pretty good 2016 actually.

84
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,860
So you can see for your markup model out.

85
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:53,800
Very sorry that you have more than is 317 million and like that's what also my noble scenario under the 75 year just industry is like your

86
00:13:54,250 --> 00:14:04,000
banned smoking is like we will lower because you haven't included on $62 billion or whatever it is for each section for marketing purposes,

87
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:11,050
you look like the third place. So that means your results.

88
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:25,230
So this table of show regulation and a little bit further I want to add another code.

89
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:37,210
So when they try to create a formula that would map scorers to this point is a lot of stuff.

90
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,380
Okay, that's what we worked on. Okay.

91
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:47,950
Let's just go to be let's just go to the cost of being on that and it's like,

92
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:53,830
yeah, pretty much anti-sodomy clause point, which is difficult for people to do.

93
00:14:56,140 --> 00:15:07,180
So this is there is a formula or turning that into a 0 to 1, so why don't you do that?

94
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:12,310
So we're basically saying that we are going to be. So that's what I did.

95
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:20,049
I was running it based on the national cost.

96
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:33,900
Every year the federal government is going to outlay this much money and it doesn't matter how much is now that wasn't designed to 100,247.

97
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,890
We actually get it right now.

98
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:46,180
It's also a little bit different in that department and also the U.S.,

99
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:57,980
which is one of the options and it has to do maybe that's not crazy because they didn't

100
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:07,230
want to do this model that to use physical thing when you go to the country itself.

101
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,320
So yeah so this is a one time annual plan.

102
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:21,220
Doesn't matter what occurs. I'm assuming what she got, what she ends up making I think are good costs and all these are now,

103
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:28,950
you know, if we see if it makes sense, if it's given a reason that result in the community.

104
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:43,470
Okay. And then delivery is a short time based on her job, you were talking we had two questions.

105
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:57,140
I guess my first question would be when we're trying to have all these I do this or not this choice instead of doing what can we do?

106
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:05,690
Because we can only. Yeah, okay. Because in the end is anything to move on and do.

107
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:09,730
What's the difference between policy and policy?

108
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:13,719
So if policy and policy are going to be different,

109
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:21,060
numbers of births when you're interested in is how does quality of life change with the trisomy quality of life?

110
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:27,700
So really that's a critical whether that would have made last changes or quality losses.

111
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:31,690
I'm going to take it back now and I made a copy.

112
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:37,209
I'm not doing an exchange. It's not just to go back to school.

113
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:45,150
That's cool with that affordability. So I'm telling you found a study that shows like compared to so.

114
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:54,640
To see the quality of life to get it and then what to do with it for the screening.

115
00:17:54,690 --> 00:18:04,030
Your here is this this is what I thought that was to contribute to the depression with the first time.

116
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:14,040
Yeah. It was the two surveys from this study that didn't have the capability more than those that we can compare against here.

117
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:17,919
So here is using the formula from us. Just one.

118
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:25,730
One other thing I might do here is with the network in some circles here, I mean,

119
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:34,030
the way I might think about it is so that we don't have to actually be doing these numbers in circles,

120
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:38,110
tapping, recognizing about the sort of uncertainty that needs to be resolved.

121
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:44,830
And so here, though, I think your policy is basically should people get screening or not get screening?

122
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,170
And then if they get screening, should not do it.

123
00:18:48,480 --> 00:19:05,620
So just just for you, I would I would either saying that we've done three different either like this and then just rid of the dominates.

124
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:15,020
And I guess typically I like to have these direct line and that screen to your line of nine and then a circle after it interrupts.

125
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:18,280
So this is genetic screening. You're going to it here?

126
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:27,219
I wouldn't you wouldn't think about this as like except as a kind of I would assume that any more distribution better or if

127
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:36,730
it's okay just to say either we're going to do genetic screening and not worry about the corporate world of the patient,

128
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:40,150
accepted or not. Right? Okay. Literally yes or no?

129
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,640
Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Like genetic screening, yes or no.

130
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:51,820
But then this uncertainty here, though, is if if there's no genetic screening, that sort of thing, what type of of pregnancy outcome?

131
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:56,290
When you see the standard trisomy and then other trees,

132
00:19:56,290 --> 00:20:01,239
we're just worried that we wanted to put you typically the problem with three of

133
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:05,160
those proportions we should include all that probably needs to be addressed.

134
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:13,030
And in fact this too I think lifetime this weekend I would I would think this read like we have a branch here which is near to here.

135
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:19,140
If you do some sort of testing, you have it there just had a pointer or not a word and then if there's an appointment,

136
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:26,560
then go it it's it's one of these trisomy like how many people die in that the decision tree is just cost and quality is.

137
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:35,140
So we have something like this in the. It's kind of like an.

138
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:40,070
Yeah. Mm hmm. Yeah. Yes.

139
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:47,150
I guess I wouldn't worry too much about the circles. I mean, that's the way this is the way socialism is generally released to the society.

140
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:53,660
So these have the qualities.

141
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:59,899
And then and then also with this, I think you have you know, the standard is translating.

142
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:11,840
And it was you know, he's trying to twice he doesn't have to do so, like, you know, determination, which is just the difference, actually.

143
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:20,950
And so I think I think he'd have the same structure here for, you know, screening, except you don't have the information.

144
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:25,730
Right. You would just have nine young. You should try something.

145
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:33,980
And then after trying something, you have miscarried or not. Okay. So what was the benefit of using the decision tree?

146
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:39,730
But know there's nothing wrong.

147
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:53,650
Yeah. It was a 102 opportunity.

148
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:59,340
Yes. Yeah, because that's I think the structure for this should be exactly the same.

149
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:04,650
The only thing that's missing in this part here is what would you say about the test results?

150
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:08,070
And so you don't hesitate to ask.

151
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:13,550
Yeah. If you go back here to this little bit.

152
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:21,830
So, you know, one other thing I guess, that you might want to have here is getting complicated.

153
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:30,810
So if someone has tried to. So I think what this is what it doesn't have to be concerned about.

154
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:34,730
Is there an an employee had an employee too.

155
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:40,799
And the next thing is an automated. I'm using one.

156
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:48,870
And if you just scroll down to the next part of your analysis, it's detected the sensitivity of the test.

157
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:57,780
So I think you need a is it detected or not? After 20 months document, he has more to reduce.

158
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:01,030
It should be for also, right? Yes, that's right.

159
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:08,060
And for all of these and actually for the the standard here is you do have the false positives, negative three.

160
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:12,510
So you need any of those here. You need the true positives and false negatives as well.

161
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:23,430
Got it. So I can do that with the actually easier to explain that starting to do the best you can do it.

162
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:30,770
Yeah, that's more results but it's kind of after years and then yeah.

163
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:36,990
Yeah. And just again for visual I would turn these rectangles into the and you just have to feel like

164
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:44,580
this isn't really a decision about whether whether it is whether you get a positive or negative.

165
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:52,920
And actually from your perspective as the person recommending the screening policy, you are not making the decision about termination.

166
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,860
I mean, the appearance making that decision. But from your perspective.

167
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:02,580
So I would I mean, yes, it is a decision for someone, but it's not the decision of the policy.

168
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:12,059
So for your perspective, that's an uncertainty about whether that's going to be a termination of you want to be you of the squares or

169
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:18,330
rectangles for wind when you are making the decision and then uncertainty about what the other other people,

170
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:23,670
the other decisions they might be making think maybe we have it so I can go back.

171
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:37,560
I'm with you for a number of things here is that they assumed that the treatment was positive or negative.

172
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:45,560
And then after that it has to be asked, why do we want the talk?

173
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:55,220
I mean, if it's positive, then you have the determination and then you should go diagnostic counseling services through.

174
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:01,790
Yeah. Diagnostic tools in each segment.

175
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:10,790
Okay. So can't we just you we have a cost for that and a piece of all of.

176
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:19,760
So I do remember we were running the problem that over time was negative and then you were too positive.

177
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:31,160
After two positive terminations, we had like simply highlights after after no termination each of these because they're getting rid of them.

178
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:39,410
So then these really following, I would just type five birth and miscarriage following no termination plan which would replace well,

179
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:44,200
mostly true positive and then following to positive have termination.

180
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:49,190
So termination after termination of miscarriage is.

181
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:57,880
Oh, yeah. Okay, I see what you're saying. So was this number in the study for sure.

182
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:05,630
Okay. Yeah. So I was getting bases covered and if you need to, I mean, you could.

183
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:13,250
So these numbers are per year what it is and put it on a different now you might have A,

184
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:20,750
B and C or if you think it's easier to turn it, which if you're your way to do purposes.

185
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:32,010
Yeah. You know, if it's if it's a more accurate expression and actually this is on a separate, separate, it's mine or something like that,

186
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:37,310
it would be fine, I think because the structure for this, this, this, this, it's all the same resource we can just slightly different.

187
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:41,930
Yeah, but you can at least show you. Here's the thing about what happens. Yeah.

188
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:46,160
And in the same place over six months.

189
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:56,020
Thanks. Thank you so much. I miss the point where you make these fixes.

190
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:02,160
Looking good. Yeah. Yeah.

191
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:15,720
The calculations are going to change to reflect these sort of that it was difficult to separate the spirit of Christmas.

192
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:27,240
Yes. I think that what we're doing is not doing a lot of damage.

193
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:34,750
We were going to use it for some other analysis or images.

194
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:40,990
It just has to be of what we're going to do about certain things.

195
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:45,300
So where do we go to get that hard on the patients and like their heart?

196
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:57,180
Can I take charge of the writing, urging everyone to look at it from the medical literature and immediately documents, typically for approval.

197
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:05,760
Thank you. And I copy there will come standard this one we always just we just make up

198
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:17,150
those rules for the long term outcomes to enable me to do it for my family.

199
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:23,370
It's like a derivative to our experience.

200
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:29,160
So I think that one of the problems that comes first.

201
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:35,410
There's nothing wrong with it.

202
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:49,619
That's what I like. And that was a we decided to do things like if we can't find data specifically something here or it is also something else,

203
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:54,640
like a pair of colleges in child labor and so on.

204
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:06,000
I mean, this is all I know is the exact same sort of a decision tree as many other policies.

205
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:15,390
But the DNA with start on, you start with the operating system.

206
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:23,099
Consider the disease progression operating loss it reported at all based on this trial or

207
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:34,290
whatever and I really rate lower if you want you to take whatever quality is getting rid of it.

208
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:42,630
Well, I can assure you that just like every time you have something like this issue with each of those health status,

209
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:53,220
those you can fix, that is just stop by the start of the college and then you take your steps.

210
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:57,460
You can take my kids and the ones I'll start with your services.

211
00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:04,350
I'm like just seven years old and $1,000 every year.

212
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:18,660
And I'm sorry, I wanted to ask you again to get extra side effects data when you work with the duty of care.

213
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:27,780
And so right now I'm just like putting your C section,

214
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:33,810
I'll just do like a little like was probably pulled more of this my fingers or something like that.

215
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:41,819
Okay. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. And so and so I think that's a really good comparison to use on instruments,

216
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:46,050
on general kind of structure and products for which the cameras are not the same.

217
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:51,930
Is that something which is it's ever been dismissed on and so maybe surprise me.

218
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:55,520
So it's interesting. The discrepancy inducing remission.

219
00:30:55,820 --> 00:31:02,520
Yeah. As long as like you like it much the limitations of like with any research, you just have to be like one of the limitations.

220
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,129
This is for this uncertain about some of the parameters.

221
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:12,780
You think the clinical studies out there you can talk about that insufficient to to give you everything you can.

222
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:17,090
I mean, this is a great time for sensitivity analysis because you can accept these.

223
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:27,060
Okay. But all of the parameters are looks good, you know, based on stellar except just for my bosses,

224
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:38,330
nurses, what can I do to return to C section I, I headed in which is into this.

225
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:56,270
But there is an action plan which I get your description of and then, you know, how does that feel to be surprised if you want to get better sense?

226
00:31:56,430 --> 00:32:03,190
I was actually. But his abilities are just instead of the importance of his time just to demonstrate,

227
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:11,140
just basically like for my little like I just before to Tokyo is and doesn't matter what's happening in

228
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:21,640
terms of the terms of reference for the model exactly what we need to say where we got those numbers.

229
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:26,740
Well, then, you know, are these amino acids all in here already?

230
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:34,090
I presume so. I mean, that's where I'm trying to use all of these studies.

231
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:48,130
So, yeah, it's just it's just like I don't build out any words of direct intervention that was trying to sound like anything like that.

232
00:32:48,150 --> 00:33:02,700
And then it'll be like a specific circumstances where there is a certain amount of generalized anxiety.

233
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:13,210
Like what? You might need something on all these persons who are in any of your research.

234
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:18,200
Yeah. Yeah. I only see as well as it comes by now.

235
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:24,400
You can use this opportunity.

236
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:31,710
You're right. So I feel like I'm just trying to find these hard times.

237
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:37,720
And I guess around sometimes you'll have to tell a story, will measure the outcome in terms of.

238
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:45,429
So I just measure their like symptoms.

239
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:53,900
But like sometimes these things don't have an exact number cutting down, which won't even be okay.

240
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:58,010
It's the and the parameters from the past.

241
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:09,190
So it's like when you're saying like progression for taking some sort of assumptions about how these are or terrible assumptions.

242
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:19,210
So we say we don't know anywhere, that's why.

243
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:23,410
And so we acknowledge that that's not exactly in the library.

244
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:33,880
And if you think that there are certain kinds of things that the mortality and storage condition is much more about,

245
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:39,030
just assume a remission rate is higher. So everything that's going to be fine.

246
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:43,850
I'm not sure it's like this to sometimes be something.

247
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:48,490
They're not all in here, like all the parameters for the outcome or not.

248
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:57,120
And I think they are, because we tend to think that that is this one has the best outcomes.

249
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:05,280
But this is doesn't necessarily get services, at least not yet know.

250
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:09,249
No, it doesn't look like it's the same on this computer.

251
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:16,220
Like not sure for a really big benefit of the future better than the cancer.

252
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:24,770
What about the way that articles today with some of these treatments don't the methods starting spend the money.

253
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:28,870
I see the benefits and if you go through doing right now.

254
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:42,880
So if that's the case then discounting probably is you share that for time horizon 2020 to the last question.

255
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:51,050
I know it's not for you. Right, right, right. Well, I just like the open time.

256
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:59,550
The morning takes too long. I already linked the CDC to the documents that you guys are working on.

257
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:04,570
So you can just use the same like this one is kind of a long term effect.

258
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:11,170
I mean, this is what's going to do it for our final review or whatever.

259
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:31,870
How you can use it as a timetable analysis on the other thing is going to be really a lot like this.

260
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:45,879
I'm turning to the things I already told you that I don't even think about this either.

261
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:56,620
And when I was kind of studying, this was really how I want.

262
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:10,080
Everything. Collaboration, science and average quality of life is 0.95 and the cost base argument is 185 detail.

263
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:16,430
The difference between those two things is subtraction. You're only getting for one.

264
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:21,630
So that was kind enough to direct the studies.

265
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:30,710
No, no, no. I'm not saying that. I'm just saying don't move that 1%.

266
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:34,530
Approach it either way. Just make sure you're clear about what's going on.

267
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:44,070
Was everyone also Q at the model told this is utility can be helpful so if you have a discussion on social care with recovery.

268
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:51,000
Well I'm usually appointed by how do you sense this adverse event and they lose this sort of stuff.

269
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:58,560
It took you so long.

270
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:15,360
This is not here to console. And to her this is the first place with an obvious probability economic impact other on commerce in like

271
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:31,600
Excel or whatever you look what impacts whether you know what do you make of this statement like that?

272
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:35,020
There's not that much circumstance.

273
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:46,780
So I think it shows I think, you know, another column and this is a patient to get close to.

274
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:54,150
I mean, you know, studies that show this kind of soul searching.

275
00:38:55,230 --> 00:39:05,570
But it seems like you really think that she realizes that just because she's the only person that look,

276
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:13,110
this patient, we can't rather, you know, not look good in there.

277
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:19,320
You can poorly translate into fingers.

278
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:23,850
And so it's like 13 seconds.

279
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:28,850
Yeah. So if they use like a simulation model and they did that with somebody,

280
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:37,690
they were going to have to service a system where they needed more intensive training was how the U.S.

281
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:52,140
should be matched with self-assurance and just use that to compare decision was based on what it was like.

282
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:58,680
I mean those are below the previous question, but there's stuff on that.

283
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:15,060
For example, you know, I would use a source for the of and so that I would, you know, I would just like, you know, until we finish things.

284
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:24,230
So the moral circumstance that we saw exposed to do with it.

285
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:33,680
Yeah, I do. I just it's my fault. I think my body just like I would do this and, you know.

286
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:43,020
So you'd like to think about what part of questions that you got.

287
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:49,950
So let's say, you know what, Starbucks, it's a startup, but I would support mom.

288
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:56,399
And so bottom line are this is to help you also cope with.

289
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:56,729
Yeah,

290
00:40:56,730 --> 00:41:10,890
because what and what were we asked about earlier so I'm trying to really homework quality monitoring you do not work for some reason I wanted to

291
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:27,070
find out what it looks like if you could show that kind of scary things you could think about when he and be with you just know what that means.

292
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:39,800
It's just like that type of life expectancy. You know, what matters most is that at this point they could be minus .20.

293
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:45,130
Any period of time is very easy to do.

294
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:49,260
That should show up. So yeah.

295
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:54,690
So if you go up to the formula that would also like to point think so what do you mean you're considering right now?

296
00:41:54,760 --> 00:42:05,750
I did this a bit like you're in this country and we're told that we're starting up like holiday probabilities.

297
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:11,560
I'm always in college because all customers and we're just going to go on.

298
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:16,510
We're going to cover the cost of each one and just kind of each other.

299
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:20,250
I know from all my other and our for all, because if that was like a preterm birth,

300
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:25,860
a C-section, so sure that we're getting discounted if we're only assuming.

301
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:33,210
And right now, I feel like that would be like some kind of mental using a markowitz.

302
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:40,910
So I don't know but. Zero, but I don't. I was born and bred miscarrying miscarriage.

303
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:44,730
I know that you know,

304
00:42:47,430 --> 00:43:02,790
is that miscarriage rate or if you want to call it a miscarriage of termination from your birth and then see that different from the way so many trees

305
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:18,030
are burning what's probably a lot more and you know how much you like one of our great found had like six icer and all these costs and everything.

306
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:24,630
Is there like a big physical impact on the termination versus miscarriage?

307
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:31,950
Now, divorce just depends on the type of situation. Exactly how many of you it was hard on your body language?

308
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:47,000
Hard to say, yeah. Like a third trimester abortions for everybody for the first three months or so, I think we worked our first trimester otherwise.

309
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:52,190
Yeah. So I think so. Yeah, totally fine to use that.

310
00:43:52,200 --> 00:44:00,930
I mean, if could be super aware of any kind of explanations that like doing that resulted in the loss of child,

311
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:04,349
I think that is the most dangerous thing.

312
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:07,380
That's 0.45 when you study for every.

313
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:10,610
That was the miscarriage. Yeah. Everything on that.

314
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:20,960
No. And then they might have been totally different you know, as an actress but I think all these so yeah.

315
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:32,100
So I think that and so you know, the same rate of 0.55 several termination and then they like the estimates of this one with actually did a

316
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:40,530
child we subtract she was it was starting to change all these years as a result of the child because we don't

317
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:49,169
know has ranged users living expenses and it does like in different times what I thought was like in our

318
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:59,370
interventions at the time long time horizon for breast cancer that's increase to the end of the pregnancy.

319
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:08,780
I just want to make sure that it is like they have like this when I was 29 to take one place for something.

320
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:13,049
So that was the life expectancy I was looking for years.

321
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:21,720
How long the down the cost since that's how long it's going to be under the summertime as well for both.

322
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:29,669
Like for the child, we would just multiply the quality for child cancer life expectancy to understand exactly what that would look like to be here.

323
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:33,479
Like for that child.

324
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:43,070
Yeah, sorry. That was that. I guess that. But then the life expectancy in terms of quality change for the mom and that was the US multiplying,

325
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:50,070
you know how much it's impacting the number of years in which that makes sense.

326
00:45:50,190 --> 00:46:01,300
So but I think we need to so for that second like 20% respectively the mother must have some.

327
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:04,500
Well yeah the top ones. Just the bottom resistance of child.

328
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:18,990
Yeah. Do whatever that after we took the average disease in closing place today has.

329
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:22,950
Oh okay. For your child. Thank you.

330
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:26,590
Oh, yeah. Let me know what it is you're good about.

331
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:29,940
I'm not sure what's happening.

332
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:33,030
As usual, this section is.

333
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:41,330
I can't say that I know I'm not. I mean, that's still that's a concern and I'm not interested in doing it.

334
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:49,310
But the average out because there's no consequences action which is an absolute majority average

335
00:46:49,590 --> 00:46:57,750
person so that's a positive response was average age is like 23 X thing is probably understanding.

336
00:46:57,870 --> 00:47:03,959
Yeah yeah but then we'd be just doing total is not only change what's the difference now easier for the model

337
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:13,200
because if you if you wanted to do changes in monthly pretty fundamental I wouldn't need another life expectancy.

338
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:19,920
Yeah so you know if they have a kid questionnaire.

339
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:26,700
Yeah yeah probably C-section more is we're just waiting for the aggregate so we can

340
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:33,420
do the same as the section of the House of Action plan for execution for the child.

341
00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:38,570
Right? Well, no. Go for it. Yeah.

342
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:42,680
There is a kind of additional parser which you try to do that.

343
00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:49,160
I'm not a Pakistani. I'm fine either way.

344
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:53,360
I just have the chance to do.

345
00:47:53,450 --> 00:48:00,230
Whether to think there's. There's all those other reasons. But for some reason, it's that it was pointed.

346
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:08,360
Yeah, I just put it down two decades, maybe later. I mean, what you want to consider.

347
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:16,510
I'm just trying to look for countries like. And I think that the world.

348
00:48:17,810 --> 00:48:28,820
So I'm just thinking it's always been it's been the formation of which is something that is not okay.

349
00:48:33,290 --> 00:48:36,799
I just put it over it. Oh, it's really something that's. But something like that.

350
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:42,540
Yeah. Something like that.

351
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:54,190
Yeah. So what is all this is what I did here was just like every single Aussie woke up in the war.

352
00:48:54,380 --> 00:49:08,750
And if you're having trouble getting that, you you would have to give you more started in the summary or the Markoff model.

353
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:19,690
You started out with a very low cost, like you started with like they didn't work with the actual population numbers then it's okay population.

354
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:27,270
So like the decision tree model, like music, like the like the actual projected population number.

355
00:49:28,190 --> 00:49:32,630
So it's like we're not starting out. Oh, okay.

356
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:37,550
Yeah. How do you know this is all the numbers are going to be different.

357
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:46,840
Oh, yeah. Yeah, well, I would. I use that data so I could find it across the U.S. military.

358
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:55,300
I'll show you a lot. Yeah, I mean, just the papers are the only ones that aren't filled out that we're still looking at it.

359
00:49:55,430 --> 00:49:58,970
In the end, it's assumed something, you know, that's just fine.

360
00:49:59,690 --> 00:50:03,170
That's why your study.

361
00:50:03,350 --> 00:50:20,180
But it's like, oh, 7.0 that was close to anybody that was hired for the claim, but it was hired for all of it.

362
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:23,840
Looks like the whole I mean, we'll keep it in separate on the tree for now,

363
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:29,150
like when I put the summaries properly so that extra ones says the cost in place for peace.

364
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:36,260
I'm not sure I'd be pulling from a different challenge on like to make sure that you bring in 75,000.

365
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:49,130
So you guys got I mean I think I think about you all you chose to do and you don't do it for the qualifying cohort as one.

366
00:50:49,490 --> 00:50:52,980
Yeah. And the cost is, the cost is different.

367
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:58,700
Definitely not stupid sometimes is that.

368
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:04,190
It should be just. Yeah, yeah. The key thing is when it comes to the.

369
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:10,220
Oh so we could use that word. Yeah that's good.

370
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:14,210
And you said reinstallation. We don't need any of it.

371
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:19,890
Yes. So it was their friends for those from those people.

372
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:24,090
No, that's right. Oh no, no, no. The populations we just had population driven.

373
00:51:24,110 --> 00:51:31,800
Yeah. Yeah. That's from the UN population division in the current.

374
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:37,390
Maybe it wasn't there earlier. Okay.

375
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:40,590
Sorry. Okay, so that's what I'm saying.

376
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:56,420
Yeah. Sorry. We do have a question of older or free obsolete models that we don't like the model Nora model order back most of the time.

377
00:51:56,420 --> 00:52:04,969
But I guess you see again, I, I guess I don't remember.

378
00:52:04,970 --> 00:52:08,240
I thought it was a little while ago. All right.

379
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:14,120
So as our estimates break, I mean, it's like the smartphone model sounds pretty obvious.

380
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:18,910
So it's just like cutting costs and you only serve.

381
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:25,010
What I don't know is that going to play around or is different?

382
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:34,030
Because I think it would be I think it's okay. I think that they I get why they don't really think you're able to understand why.

383
00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:45,050
So for me. Yeah, I think I don't know. Sometimes was so interesting that I guess we know that because oh my gosh, I,

384
00:52:45,590 --> 00:52:55,729
I'm angry that I complained about it for 6 hours and quite sarcastically, cause, you know, I don't that makes it easier that way.

385
00:52:55,730 --> 00:53:04,430
But I think be like it's just because I mean, obviously whenever you depend on me for, you know, what you say.

386
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:08,420
Yeah. Oh we already used to get too.

387
00:53:08,850 --> 00:53:17,550
Yeah. So if you're just supposed to discuss it, as you might expect, except this one is this.

388
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:26,660
And so this has higher definition or a different way that might be because we have to have lunch.

389
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:31,220
But yeah, it costs too much of a lot.

390
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:41,120
But you said you have a lot of noise and I find you because I even like your original

391
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:49,129
coming up interview to find recovery and it's fun and your excel sheet it's

392
00:53:49,130 --> 00:53:57,110
contained and it's just it is also the staple and then you just add it up to your

393
00:53:57,990 --> 00:54:07,070
cells and look for our tables that are already here are we are up so we've been using.

394
00:54:07,910 --> 00:54:18,350
I think so because I think that, um, like this is, it's all those things that this one's different of a surprise.

395
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:25,740
I mean, sure it is. I think so. But it's not like I don't know that this is one of those formulas or.

396
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:30,650
Yeah, she's just. I think we need to make this a table.

397
00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:34,790
Okay. Like, not hard, making sure we have this all out there with the sources.

398
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:43,480
Yeah, right. Okay. Now where is the great escape?

399
00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:52,750
Oh. Okay. So.

400
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:11,700
So for the Markov model, you you're simulating the cohorts each year.

401
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:20,870
And did you find something?

402
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:26,810
Oh, sorry. So the band in the band, Mark Colvin.

403
00:55:26,810 --> 00:55:35,420
Obamacare's after a lifetime of medical treatment.

404
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:51,980
So you've got a million people. And then on the 75 people, a couple of just for the population.

405
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:56,540
For each one of them. Yeah. You have a different population turning 18 each year.

406
00:55:56,810 --> 00:55:59,900
I've got to put this, though.

407
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:05,690
This is this is just for one is this want this is one cohort separate.

408
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:14,440
So you start off with a million people. And.

409
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:24,230
Once in a while we work on the status or likely the lifetime costs for coming from an.

410
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:31,490
Yeah. So.

411
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:44,700
Is that the cost or how much? That was the lifetime costs anyway.

412
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:53,740
Yeah, she continued. So I think it's causing this concern as well.

413
00:56:53,810 --> 00:56:59,219
Have you read this paragraph a, c, c?

414
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:09,590
Describe members of this number. This week.

415
00:57:09,610 --> 00:57:21,370
This article has box office work complete, but we want to change delete deleted topic.

416
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:35,560
But this is also one of our most up to date and it's so important you know that because there's a free code for and it's because we

417
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:46,370
were doing so we were adding in all the causes of the various sources that we that's so this is this is the lifetime cost for me.

418
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:51,310
So $75 with nothing in between.

419
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:54,670
So that's where our numbers is like the whole then.

420
00:57:56,140 --> 00:58:05,830
Right. Okay. Yeah. And then what sort of consumers and your devices race so I could get.

421
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:23,260
It's either not on the scoresheet or for me getting a total of 50 courses in one day for my wife.

422
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:29,900
But because this is the only thing. But then if you use it, then you only one, right?

423
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:33,860
Yeah, there's a percentage. You have things like this place.

424
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:37,650
So would you be like, yeah, yeah.

425
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:47,620
Population. All right, so it's him one year.

426
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:57,340
So it's the quiz for that that year for each cohort and more time to adjust to the.

427
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:08,880
Okay. Right. So you get. So this is. All right, so we're your shoes.

428
00:59:09,810 --> 00:59:14,610
On the top of the steps is the same. 50%. We're just going with it.

429
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:22,169
We can't find any. You can look and see if you can find any anything about relapse rates after the different types of treatment.

430
00:59:22,170 --> 00:59:25,500
But here the tunnels are just broken down.

431
00:59:26,090 --> 00:59:31,980
So for now, that's just. There.

432
00:59:43,810 --> 01:00:07,590
People tend to. So that's the first thing and then it's term, then you'll understand that precision will be a smaller,

433
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:16,620
you know, because it's not as fast as you'd like to attach to the library.

434
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:20,190
But also, like as this would be to like here.

435
01:00:21,550 --> 01:00:29,970
Yes. You've got the softer tools, but like not working as.

436
01:00:32,010 --> 01:00:43,970
This was my first experience broker. But as part of its high quality of life.

437
01:00:47,930 --> 01:00:51,649
But I was wondering if they're exactly how I pictured it.

438
01:00:51,650 --> 01:00:59,400
That's so funny. Like, she must not even really, like, measure the shadows, the tail lights from the distance.

439
01:01:00,070 --> 01:01:03,940
It's an owl. So we weren't living in.

440
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:26,670
You should have like. And did you in my know that I put in guidance as a young man?

441
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:41,010
I think I think one of the big differences in here is the other ones.

442
01:01:42,870 --> 01:01:52,170
I'm just I just remember talking to somebody over the last one changes and he said, I tried this.

443
01:01:57,430 --> 01:02:08,850
Yes. You were born with your breasts in the decision tree, one that was with the boys.

444
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:13,920
And that practice used directly opposite quality of life for me.

445
01:02:14,610 --> 01:02:17,610
I didn't use my life. I just like these.

446
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:24,120
Is that my business? Because this is. This is the realm of the gods.

447
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:28,440
Yeah. That's why I was asking you to show up here.

448
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:33,130
You were swimming kind of without one, quite like this woman's pain.

449
01:02:33,210 --> 01:02:39,930
And you're basically calculating the life that has a higher rate of C-section here as her with the stroke or not.

450
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:54,610
Yeah, but know I have my credit rating system and so so there are a few.

451
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:57,590
So you got to with mothers into accounts.

452
01:02:58,230 --> 01:03:08,390
Actually I needed to reassurance so you know it's part of C-section delivery for Medicaid funded into most points here with my speech.

453
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:18,570
So let's say we start off with just one person here.

454
01:03:19,470 --> 01:03:35,280
So this is like one nonsmoker. And for this week, we get volumes of 58.00 8.0 or so.

455
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:46,619
Oh, I'm sorry. I just want to clarify right here, this model show that smokers start medicines for you guys to receive inpatient services,

456
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:50,580
which every year, six months like they received 31 or after.

457
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:56,960
So that's the numbers of the service to adjust.

458
01:03:57,450 --> 01:04:01,470
So those are that's what this model is kind of these are all different realities.

459
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:08,970
Now, the decision is based off of another study from Valley and said it's it's 43, 35.

460
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:16,019
And so the calculation was the heart model giving us a 20 or a 20 year difference.

461
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:18,540
And this is giving us that you're talking about.

462
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:27,250
One of one thing that's happening now seems like the average is try up with one of the models of the average.

463
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:43,400
So part of it depends on what you or you will do you think just okay, once we have having a medical costs and so on,

464
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:55,090
what the heck were the 43 and 35 going to get our calculations or the two good options underlying it and so forth or further about our cancellation?

465
01:04:55,110 --> 01:05:09,370
So that's what you have here. It starts off with people age eight to and I think so I think you're using that 18 year old mortality now.

466
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:17,040
I you know, I mean, someone's you can ask yourself the question, you know, is this .01 percent out of mortality, is that right?

467
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:28,080
So like you had 2.8, like if there's 0.8 immediately is going to really mean it's going to give you a 20% reduction just for that.

468
01:05:28,710 --> 01:05:34,140
And then, you know, the mortality is going to reduce. It just confirms that difference in associations.

469
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:41,580
And so that's what I came to to think about why is that costs are going to be increased.

470
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:52,110
Do you think those you know, especially the quality of smoking that is that the reason that you do this because of driving?

471
01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:58,880
I think there's still 20 years difference for delivery on the table the lot.

472
01:05:59,190 --> 01:06:04,770
One pre-term last was not associated with that.

473
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:11,490
So that's I would say I guess it seems like a dramatic oh, because actually we don't see how it works.

474
01:06:11,610 --> 01:06:15,450
So this part is just. That other study.

475
01:06:15,510 --> 01:06:25,390
This one. So like mine. Look, there is a problem that, like, your give was to maybe it's like 2.01.

476
01:06:25,530 --> 01:06:32,190
You know, the difference is that by the time you're 80, it's yeah, it's like, you know, I mean, it's just varies so much.

477
01:06:32,420 --> 01:06:39,420
So, yeah, I mean, the, the tricky thing for you guys, though, is especially like counting study the first 20 years of your life.

478
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:48,030
Maybe the quality of yes, things are worse when you're in the seventies and eighties, but that's discounted so far in the future.

479
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:58,320
That's when you look at the present, it is like. So I tend to think that our went up like 75 hours.

480
01:06:58,450 --> 01:07:07,049
We actually estimate a more minor than that because like, just like with my like the other thing is,

481
01:07:07,050 --> 01:07:13,830
is the trip to the UN where you live like it's true, you probably reference the study that we're talking about.

482
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:17,300
I will take the limitations.

483
01:07:18,870 --> 01:07:23,980
Okay. Yeah. Like we should have a not sure 18 year old.

484
01:07:24,150 --> 01:07:27,630
We can just say that for sure.

485
01:07:31,230 --> 01:07:34,580
Yeah. Cool comparison, Mark.

486
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:41,970
So those are adopted now. Well, so here we are here.

487
01:07:43,230 --> 01:07:48,590
So we got the that's the is the first couple nonsmoker and teen moms thing.

488
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:53,420
How many. I don't know. Cause I think that's. Or cell phones.

489
01:07:53,660 --> 01:08:05,670
Yeah. So what is the worst diagnostician?

490
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:10,560
I don't think we have. We don't?

491
01:08:12,090 --> 01:08:19,800
That's for sure. Treatments and so on.

492
01:08:20,010 --> 01:08:29,320
Can you just say it was essential to eliminate life and health consequences for them to achieve?

493
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:34,400
Yes. So for the meetings, do that for me.

494
01:08:34,980 --> 01:08:40,570
To me, was positive indicators of negative or positive.

495
01:08:41,610 --> 01:08:48,500
This for me because we've broken it up by including incidents genetically standard.

496
01:08:49,410 --> 01:08:54,020
We were essentially eliminating like the other two false positives and the

497
01:08:54,030 --> 01:08:57,359
positive test results are confirmed by the additional cost of the diagnostic.

498
01:08:57,360 --> 01:09:02,850
We're just using it as a good knowledge, as an additional sensitivity, things that make sense.

499
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:12,600
So they essentially just confirmed to me, you know, how both I think maybe not just one.

500
01:09:13,670 --> 01:09:25,470
Yeah. I mean, I don't get the same sense of the Department of Education.

501
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:43,380
Oh, we get a whole pincher mutation comes down to things like symptomatic, which, you know, it can be purchased for the second section.

502
01:09:48,580 --> 01:09:58,130
It's. Who should you pick?

503
01:10:00,690 --> 01:10:05,640
Show me what you got.

504
01:10:08,390 --> 01:10:14,160
Yeah, I just do what to say.

505
01:10:15,250 --> 01:10:46,530
That it comes with the job. If I should be suitable, maybe it might have to do with sexual violence.

506
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:51,120
Pregnancy is defined as like I want a C-section.

507
01:10:51,120 --> 01:11:12,100
So non smoker. A smoker loses 16 to 18 this month, small or large, healthy 20, 26 to 2.

508
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:19,170
That's not this is if this is discounted in this article this was actually singles.

509
01:11:19,170 --> 01:11:24,800
Okay so let's get pretty close. Okay so now that's not as not is different than what it was part two.

510
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:27,750
So so there are a few things going through it.

511
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:53,490
So if we look at this kind of totals here, this is 16 versus 26 in both these numbers, which was 26 and I'm like 26 and 16.

512
01:11:53,850 --> 01:12:02,060
And then but if you go to the decision tree three.

513
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:16,970
Here. There was two things going on. So these these turtles instead of the other was, you know, 16 and 29 or whatever it is.

514
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:23,940
This is 35 and 43. So this one is, you know, giving you a lot more of these per person in general for both of those.

515
01:12:24,270 --> 01:12:30,050
And so the. In the in the summary here,

516
01:12:30,740 --> 01:12:38,060
these are going to be more probably just because it's a it's assuming more and more and more and more life years per person, per person.

517
01:12:38,330 --> 01:12:42,950
So that's why the aggregate qualities are here. And finally, instead of the 200 records.

518
01:12:43,310 --> 01:12:45,110
So that's what things went technically.

519
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:53,750
There's one other thing going on with the decision trees, and that is a lot of uranium points for a smoker for them in life.

520
01:12:54,350 --> 01:12:57,500
So that's what we thought. Okay. Okay. Can you just put a.

521
01:12:58,100 --> 01:13:05,629
And so we're saying, okay, if you're in these rooms as proposed, we're taking care of smokers.

522
01:13:05,630 --> 01:13:09,590
Sometimes those are 40, 45, 39. That's a 20, 29.

523
01:13:09,590 --> 01:13:20,360
If we go all the way to 2021 before we're saying, oh, but this many smokers, it's been answered by that by 45 by one year.

524
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:24,860
It's not a light. It's not exactly a plant. So they wouldn't necessarily get a lifetime.

525
01:13:24,860 --> 01:13:35,960
And so that's what you are doing with the modified model is you're saying those people who turn 18 and 24,

526
01:13:36,380 --> 01:13:43,070
24, they're only getting one year of this benefit is worth kind of stopping over everything.

527
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:46,340
And is there a way to modify the decision tree or should we?

528
01:13:46,340 --> 01:13:57,440
I mean, I don't like so so let's show you how I wish it would work like that pretty much.

529
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:06,930
First of all, with the discounting, what's happening in 2104 isn't that much of a difference anyway, isn't it?

530
01:14:06,950 --> 01:14:19,040
I mean, you know, presumably if you're if you're ban is is still on a fast 2021 okay and it's still breaking from stopping or starting cigaret usage.

531
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:22,270
There will be some benefit even beyond your time horizon.

532
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:28,900
It might be important to think about I mean, I suppose in some starting point or value, you know,

533
01:14:28,910 --> 01:14:33,980
I haven't been mentioned as a you're not continuing the course of enforcement beyond 21.

534
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:41,920
Yeah, but you are simply getting some of the benefits beyond 2104 that's useful.

535
01:14:41,930 --> 01:14:47,630
Not really on times anyway. And so everything is very well like once you get past the start.

536
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:55,910
So I mean, yeah. So anyway I think those are and I think the bigger thing is probably just the decision tree.

537
01:14:58,040 --> 01:15:04,190
Tree assumption here is I'm right, 43 and a half, 35 to half an hour.

538
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:10,150
How close to nine versus 16? Too soon?

539
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:15,950
We just are. The 2916 trends represents the average incremental cost effectiveness ratio,

540
01:15:16,050 --> 01:15:30,920
which is now the other thing is that these numbers might not be we have something else to look into is just that if they are discounted,

541
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:34,430
discounted anything like 1% or something know different rate as well.

542
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:42,770
So like if you're 25 or estimates of spending, this is not original exponents but if they're saying,

543
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:48,920
you know 43.5% down, Entergy sounds like a discounted number.

544
01:15:48,950 --> 01:15:52,690
Yeah, because that would be right.

545
01:15:52,820 --> 01:15:56,060
So that's where it's adopted from. If you had perfect. How old is the study?

546
01:15:56,090 --> 01:16:06,300
60, 68, which is too far from their life expectancy variation that data retention resources all but that in short,

547
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:10,700
it could be just because you're 21 something you might have adjusted for always declining.

548
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:15,710
As you get into the decision, somebody might look into that.

549
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:21,110
Do you think that those are the discounted gems?

550
01:16:25,660 --> 01:16:34,580
Okay. But then that also I guess I would look at what is actually the one thing in the market model that I might want to use.

551
01:16:34,580 --> 01:16:41,270
This is where I am is double the decade of potential savings, excess mortality.

552
01:16:41,270 --> 01:16:50,030
Is that an average? We're saying that added to mortality ranging from 1 to 4 prostates.

553
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:55,610
So that makes it 18. Your probability of dying is like 1000.

554
01:16:55,890 --> 01:17:12,530
It's pretty low and mortality is under 1% under my tables until you're adding a 1% additional mortality, that's the big increase now.

555
01:17:12,820 --> 01:17:21,860
So yeah, I think that's true. When you're a smoker and you're 44, which things like that's probably not the case for 218 year olds.

556
01:17:21,860 --> 01:17:27,290
21 So all sudden you have this crazy mortality.

557
01:17:30,580 --> 01:17:32,990
Wait. So I might look into that.

558
01:17:33,590 --> 01:17:41,180
Now, the other thing is, if it's something that you look at, spiritualism increase mortality, and that's actually quite small,

559
01:17:41,660 --> 01:17:50,930
you know, saying, okay, you know, okay, incremental costs are going to be a constant, like multiplying it by whatever.

560
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:54,559
Well, yeah. So. So that 1% is it, is it?

561
01:17:54,560 --> 01:18:01,970
That is this year. So if you're a smoker, you're always 1.4% higher than everyone else.

562
01:18:02,570 --> 01:18:10,850
Or is it similarly to at the base rate and multiply by 1.4134 to get out?

563
01:18:11,330 --> 01:18:21,590
That's really close range. And then the quality of life of smoking again is probably not that much lower, at least in the early years.

564
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:25,530
Of course it is lower, I think, when you're down towards your words.

565
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:33,530
But then again, even because people are not going to get emphysema, who are smokers are not going to get it.

566
01:18:33,620 --> 01:18:37,560
And the fact that, like you have to like sit there over it and then so that.

567
01:18:40,490 --> 01:18:48,560
So basically double time parameters, see if we can find some better or maybe more accurate numbers.

568
01:18:48,950 --> 01:18:55,460
But like, are we. I like to like yeah, actually, I mean, the big picture was what I think.

569
01:18:56,180 --> 01:19:00,090
I mean, yes, you have slightly different point of view,

570
01:19:00,290 --> 01:19:05,420
but the big picture there is in two different approaches using data from different sources and stuff like that.

571
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:11,990
But as I see it, you're coming to very similar like you're saying, you're saving costs, you're increasing qualities.

572
01:19:12,290 --> 01:19:17,170
And actually the difference of all these here, I mean, to me, I just can't answer that.

573
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:26,510
So there is difference. Employees are remarkably similar because, you know, the cost.

574
01:19:26,510 --> 01:19:37,550
There's if there's a bigger cost effective, they're both showing reduction on Wednesday at lunch time.

575
01:19:37,870 --> 01:19:42,170
What value. So this is 6% is a problem whether you like it.

576
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:46,280
So I just multiply all these probabilities together and also what do you mean?

577
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:59,300
So advantage to society to do the limitations is still six times.
