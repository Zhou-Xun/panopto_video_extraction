1
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:11,520
Okay. So the second to last lecture we're going to be talking about continue.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:21,900
It's the last section on multistage clonal expansion models. I wrote multistate here, multistate kind of expansion models, topics and examples today.

3
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:30,860
Next week we're going to do a fitting and that will wrap up the lecture part of this course.

4
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,160
So just a reminder of what we've been talking about.

5
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:45,300
Last week, we developed the two stage colon cancer model created by William Carpenter Knutson around 1980,

6
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:51,360
which is this mathematical expression of Newton's hypothesis of the two hits

7
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,879
where you have one head that is sort of starting to create and initiated cells.

8
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,990
And then a second is what is required to get in cells,

9
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:16,320
hence being damage to the DNA or epigenetic changes or something that either removes tumor suppressors or promotes tumor promoters.

10
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:21,510
And so we follow this initiation progression progression paradigm.

11
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:28,860
And so what we did was we derive a set of differential patients for the two stage one extension model hazard.

12
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:39,270
That's for down here as a function of largely opaque if we are just kind of looking at it differential equations.

13
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:47,490
But we had to really kind of go into the guts and the details to understand how the instantaneous

14
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:56,550
transition probabilities associated with the multi state continuous time Markov chain,

15
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:02,790
how old those lead to these equations.

16
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:11,310
So it's hard to just kind of look at them, kind of have to go through the math and let Lab nine.

17
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:17,130
We started last week and I assume people will kind of work on more today. We're going to be simulating these,

18
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:30,839
comparing them to stochastic simulations and to the sort of looking for the constant close form forms from the lab this week, lab ten,

19
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:41,280
we're going to be using these for time varying exposures and exploring a little bit what carcinogen exposure means when you're 15,

20
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:46,590
when you're 50, when you're 75, sort of different parts of the age continuum.

21
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,490
And we're going to be doing that using simulation of the different configurations.

22
00:02:53,640 --> 00:03:04,900
So what we found was we for constant parameters without these kind of important or marketed, let's say exposures, you can get, uh,

23
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:13,830
fat solution as a function of these three parameters which we will loosely associate with initiation, promotion and progression.

24
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:24,390
And so we're going to talk about a bit today is what if the parameters are changed at that?

25
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:32,850
And so that can mean things like specific exposures to carcinogens like benzene and talking about later.

26
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:47,970
But infectious agents like HPV or Epstein-Barr virus, which tend to have people at younger people, tend to have higher prevalence.

27
00:03:48,870 --> 00:04:00,900
And if you don't clear these infections, they can destabilize, integrate into the genome and down the road cause cancer in certain circumstances.

28
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:08,520
The big exposure, of course, is tobacco and smoke.

29
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:16,830
And so cigarets per day has been an important example of a carcinogenic exposure,

30
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:24,090
occupation, very important things like benzene we'll talk about, but also arsenic, radon.

31
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:28,139
And these mean not even mechanics, occupational, but household.

32
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:35,610
So many people even here in Michigan have it's a high radon state and so many people

33
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:41,060
have radon reduction units that are blowing Ray Donovan basements out into the air,

34
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,160
maybe have exposure from city scans or x rays.

35
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:54,180
And so there are many different types of exposures that we might be interested in.

36
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,470
And so from an individual level perspective, we could reconstruct an exposure history.

37
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:09,480
These are both four cigarets per day. This person up top start smoking around age 20.

38
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:15,180
They're smoking 30 cigarets a day until age 41.

39
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:20,940
They quit for a couple of years, relax to about 20 cigarets a day, back up to 34.

40
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:24,000
But now we're at 20 again, quit for per bit.

41
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:32,729
Now we're back in an 8 to 10 or this person down below, they slowly ramped up from ten to 20 to 30 rib down.

42
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:39,900
They're trying to quit around age 50, 60 by and by the time that they die,

43
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:53,580
they actually have quit CIGARETS So if we then know if we can reconstruct these exposure histories and know if and when they have different cancers,

44
00:05:53,850 --> 00:06:00,750
then we can connect exposure histories to the outcomes.

45
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:08,219
But as you may see or like, okay, well, how do I turn this into, you know,

46
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:14,940
I put it into my model and what were the connection that we need is dose response modeling.

47
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:24,000
And so if we have a history of exposure, we need to be able to connect that to changes in the underlying biological parameters.

48
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:29,610
So one question is which parameter or parameters does the carcinogen impact?

49
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:39,089
If we define X of T as the dose of h t, I need a functional form of how the dose impacts that parameter,

50
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:42,629
so probably would have been helpful if I actually put x's on this.

51
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:54,300
But if this is the dose and this and the y axis is the impact on the parameters, does the dose does that parameter change linearly with the dose?

52
00:06:54,930 --> 00:07:03,299
Does it slowly increase? But then to have this kind of threshold effect where anything below the threshold is low,

53
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:12,630
anything above the threshold as high does it rather quickly, but then reach a plateau.

54
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:21,149
Does it just kind of increase exponentially? So lots of different possibilities of how dose response can look like.

55
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:28,980
And there is actually a huge literature on dose response functions, not even just in the carcinogen community,

56
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:35,310
but for lots of chemicals, for infection, infectious diseases and so on and so forth.

57
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:44,820
But it's typically used in this context is a power law relationship which is useful for its flexibility.

58
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:56,160
Um, so if 50 is the dose at age t, then, um, and if we take theta zero as the value of the Premier in the absence of the exposure,

59
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:59,340
so except t zero, this all just kind of goes away.

60
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:07,390
Then we have this power line relationship where we, we raise the dose to some power and we have a coefficient C.

61
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:12,840
So it's a fairly parsimonious approach to doing dose response relationships.

62
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:21,360
It's not the only way. But what we typically see in the multi-stage climate expansion world.

63
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:31,380
Okay. So if I had this time during exposure, how do I connect that to get high hazard?

64
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,010
While there do exist a close form recursion formula.

65
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:52,430
If we have piecewise constant parameters. So I believe this paper that this came from actually did say that while we had piecewise constant exposures.

66
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:58,800
Even though they kind of change relatively frequently, we can still have a piecewise constant hazard.

67
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:00,839
And you get this by.

68
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:08,400
And analytically, solving your differential equations on each segment backwards, making sure that your initial conditions make sense.

69
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,590
This the reason to do this is that it's more efficient for large datasets.

70
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,400
But if you don't have like computational constraints,

71
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:24,590
then and what we're going to do is solve our differential equations just computationally and not worry too much about.

72
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:29,590
Simple simplifying. Okay.

73
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:42,880
So most of what I want to talk about today are three examples of where multi-stage one extension models are used in three different contexts.

74
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:47,250
The first being a retrospective cohort study on individual level data.

75
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:54,670
The second a different cohort study, this time prospective individual level data again.

76
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:59,650
And then finally, a cancer registry analysis using population level data.

77
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,150
And this is going to be most similar to what we'll be doing in next week's lab.

78
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:12,850
Not that specifically. That's kind of that the type of modeling we're going to do at the population level.

79
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:16,690
But but just to show you the sort of flexibility of these models.

80
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:24,790
So this first one, which is the retrospective cohort study, here is the citation for your records.

81
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,810
The paper is on canvas linked there.

82
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:35,470
But this study was interested in the relationship between benzene, exposure and leukemia.

83
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:43,870
And the cohort was about 1700 workers split between three benzene plants in Ohio.

84
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:50,980
And these workers had to be employed at least one day between 1940 and 1965.

85
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:59,230
And they, the researchers, assessed whether they had died and the cause of death in 1996.

86
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:11,430
And so in this cohort of 1700, they had 16 deaths due to leukemia, which is not a lot, but probably more than the general population.

87
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:21,430
QUESTION They have to die of leukemia, or do they have to just have they died of leukemia?

88
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:25,629
Because that's the only way that they they didn't like this was a retrospective cohort.

89
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:30,310
So they weren't following didn't have addresses and contact information for all these folks.

90
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:35,500
They just went to the death records which are publicly available,

91
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:46,239
asterisk and or accessible with data use agreements typically and said like for each of the people that we had in this dataset, have they died?

92
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:53,410
And if they died and if they died. However, if you had more information, you could do this with incidence of leukemia and not just death.

93
00:11:54,220 --> 00:12:00,940
Yeah, good question. So another question is like, where did this data even come from?

94
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:08,559
This data came from Nilesh National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health and not for the purposes of the study,

95
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,940
but just for typical regulatory things that they do.

96
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:17,890
So they actually had air sampling that provided estimates of benzene concentration.

97
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:21,909
I think I'm like an hourly or something ridiculous.

98
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:25,600
Maybe it was daily perspective.

99
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:32,680
And so they have just like constant analysis of how much benzene people would have been exposed to working at these plants.

100
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:39,100
And so if we have the job codes of each individual and the dates that they were working,

101
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:44,440
then we actually can get individual level exposure estimates for all these 1700 folks.

102
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:52,790
And so what this study did was to fit.

103
00:12:52,790 --> 00:13:00,080
The first of what they did was they fitted two surgical an expansion model with fixed parameters and time varying parameters.

104
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,750
And so the first question is, you know, is there any connection to benzene at all?

105
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:15,500
Or can we just explain the the leukemia deaths as just, you know, kind of arising arising out of the population?

106
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:25,580
And so put in some parameters for best fit of the two stage one expansion model of fixed parameters.

107
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:28,820
And mostly what I wanna look at here is table four.

108
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:44,810
So this is the different cumulative exposure levels zero up to 1.7, 22.6 up to 117 depending on this one two quartiles here.

109
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:54,770
And so the baseline prediction is what is the number of leukemia deaths you would expect if there's no connection to the exposure?

110
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,300
Because these are quartiles they're kind of roughly around 2 to 3 each.

111
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:09,530
But if we do think that exposure to cumulative exposure matters, then the more exposure means more deaths.

112
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,380
And so this particularly the high quartile range,

113
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:21,440
has a really big difference in the model predictions and in fact much closer to what was actually observed in the data.

114
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,910
So again, can't do a ton with only 16, 17 deaths.

115
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:33,560
But even just in terms of these predictions, we can see that the exposure makes a big difference.

116
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:50,210
And so what they did was trying to understand what the risk of exposure was in terms of the impact on cancer depending on age.

117
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:57,770
So actually being exposed to benzene at fairly young ages was relatively smaller.

118
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:05,240
This is large relative risk here and increased over time as as we kind of went on.

119
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:20,270
And I think the reason for that we say here is because they think they they estimated it benzene as being a promoter carcinogen.

120
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:31,850
And so promoters typically have more impact at higher ages when folks already have initiated potentially initiating cells.

121
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:42,019
And then here is an example of the relative risk for two different people, depending on their exposure.

122
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:49,490
So I think these are hypothetical exposures. The first one, five parts per million and ten parts per million.

123
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:58,010
And what that looks like if they started working at age 20 and quit working at age 60.

124
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:04,840
And so what their relative risk compared to somebody that was not in events in fact looks like over time.

125
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:19,570
So three questions about this first. So connecting individual level exposures to individual level outcomes.

126
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:32,290
And then and by doing so, being able to say something about risk by age and what a risk might look like for actual workers and projected exposures.

127
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:47,320
The second one is a prospective cohort study in the sense that it was designed as such.

128
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:55,150
This analysis specifically ends up being retrospective because they had the data after fact.

129
00:16:56,770 --> 00:17:02,050
But this is from the Nurses Health Study as one of the two studies here.

130
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:05,770
These are really both the nurses health study and health professional study.

131
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:19,089
It is really amazing. Data sets based in the U.K. Nurses Health Study was established in 1976 and followed 120,000 nurses who are

132
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:28,390
aged 30 to 55 and followed them over time to sort of continue to sort of assess their health and risk factors.

133
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,660
And they'd only lost 6% but by the year 2000.

134
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:37,060
So that almost 25 years later, only 6% attrition.

135
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:44,740
And they had detailed information on, for example, past and current smoking habits of history and diet.

136
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:55,510
I'm a little unclear on specifics of why they only included 100 or 4000 subjects in the lung cancer.

137
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:09,379
Analysis. Maybe just because they didn't have sufficient information to recreate the exposure or health professionals

138
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:18,500
study similar to the nurse nurses health started ten years later that 50,000 men aged 40 to 75.

139
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:29,690
Again, only 6% lost US follow up in 2000 to similar idea, detailed exposures and medical history.

140
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:34,280
And similarly they had an analysis of lung cancer here.

141
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:41,780
So this is connecting smoking to lung cancer. This is where the exposures that we talked about earlier came from.

142
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:52,820
Um, and what this group did was to investigate a dose response relationship between tobacco and lung cancer.

143
00:18:52,830 --> 00:19:04,700
So we're using this power law relationship to investigate initiation, promotion and progression in both nurses health and health professional study.

144
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:16,850
What they found was they didn't see much impact on initiation, but it was more on promotion and conversion.

145
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:29,840
Personally, I am I think I would have been slightly suspect that you had an impact on limit conversion, but not initiation.

146
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:40,010
But this is a little bit due to the assumptions you make, for example, like, say, initiation when conversion rates are the same.

147
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:47,720
Um, but it's still an important investigation here.

148
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:56,930
And so what they found were they were able to model this very large differential risk of lung cancer by smoking status.

149
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:06,320
You keep an eye on the Y axis here for the lung cancer risk for never smokers, current smokers and former smokers.

150
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:14,000
So the y axis, you're going only up to 120 for current smokers and 500 for non smokers.

151
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:22,550
You still have this increase over time. And so what you can see in terms of if we want to go for smokers, non smokers,

152
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:28,280
they can you can actually see how your risk of lung cancer decreases over time when you're since

153
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:36,290
quitting that really big drop in that first year and a kind of a slow decay with your since quit.

154
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:53,080
Beyond that. Um, and so you can look at this kind of dose response relationship here between 20 cigarets and 40 cigarets and the relative risk.

155
00:20:53,260 --> 00:21:01,720
So doubling your number of cigarets per day is actually like tripling your max risk.

156
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:08,470
And then we can see, depending on whether you're smoking 20 or 40,

157
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:16,240
you can say when you quit at age 30 or put at age 50, how does your relative risk of lung cancer decrease over time?

158
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:24,260
And so it looks like it doesn't make a huge difference whether you're smoking 20 or 40.

159
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:30,370
But it makes a big difference if you can quit at age 30 versus credit age 50.

160
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:43,049
Okay. So our last analysis for today is a cancer registry analysis looking at colorectal cancer in the US,

161
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:50,340
in the UK and we're going to compare subsets of colorectal cancer and think anyone's doing colorectal this year.

162
00:21:52,230 --> 00:22:01,560
So a little bit of background. Colorectal screening is common in the US because it's recommended and covered by insurance, but it is not.

163
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:13,120
That is not the case in the UK. And there are these important differences in cancer incidence depending on what part of the large

164
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:19,989
intestine or colon we're talking about the proximal colon or right side colon versus the distal colon,

165
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:24,910
which is the left side, as well as the rectum, which is the bottom part.

166
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:32,650
And so we can see how proximal kind of starts out the lowest,

167
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:40,750
but then kind of crosses and jumps up at the end, whereas distal starts higher but increases more slowly.

168
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,610
We want to understand what the biological implications of these patterns are.

169
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:56,710
There also important differences by sex here, where we see a much greater specific incidence for men compared to men?

170
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:09,140
I also one thing I want to note here is that we see many in the tue on expansion model.

171
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:15,230
Our hazards tend to look like this leveling off.

172
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:20,210
You don't really see that so much. Well, what did we learn to cancer?

173
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:25,490
So we have to do a little bit more modeling here.

174
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:33,560
We're not going to cover this in this class, but in terms of getting into the mathematical details.

175
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:38,810
But colorectal cancer is not a two stage to head cancer.

176
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:40,700
It's actually a three have cancer.

177
00:23:42,440 --> 00:24:00,260
And you have you have basically like inactivation of the APC gene to try to remove the Adenomatous Polyposis Coley gene at not a biologist here,

178
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:11,930
but that if you have two inactivation you start to get polyps and the colon and so called colonoscopy is are looking for these polyps.

179
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:18,590
They want to polyps are where the adenoma is the actual colorectal cancers arise.

180
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:29,690
So we get two hits to start developing an adenoma before it becomes a full blown colorectal cancer.

181
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:38,780
So rather than having the sort of one hit to initiation and then another to colorectal, we have to hit a pre initiated stage.

182
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:43,370
This has a different set of operations associated with it.

183
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:48,200
It's still solvable. Still. Still can write differential equations.

184
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:56,760
You can solve it exactly for fixed parameter and simulated for time, varying as a similar shape.

185
00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:03,470
But the important part is that it doesn't actually achieve its asymptote for at least typical human ages.

186
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:10,010
So usually we just have this kind of straight line coming out.

187
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:16,550
So another cancer for which we typically see this pattern is pancreatic.

188
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:21,890
And then there's a couple of pancreatic being looked at this term.

189
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:34,219
So once the researchers did what they looked at,

190
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:43,730
they fit this three stage Qantas fashion model to the data in both sphere in the US and a registry in the UK.

191
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:51,860
And what I first want to focus on is these first two rows, so the adenoma initiation rate.

192
00:25:52,640 --> 00:26:03,020
So I want to focus on the initiation rate being much higher for proximal colon compared to distal or the rectum.

193
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:15,410
We also see that very similar initiation rates in proximal for men and women, but for distal and rectum, we have a big difference in women.

194
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:22,280
Right. So these differences in initiation are driving some of the patterns that we're seeing.

195
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:32,990
And if we look at the growth rate, once the adenomas have been seeded, we see that the growth rates are actually higher for distal and rectum,

196
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,390
but lower for proximal,

197
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:43,520
even though proximal had a higher initiation rate and then tend to have slightly higher growth rates across the board compared to women.

198
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:53,030
Okay. So then how do these, uh, what are the implications of these for cancer incidence?

199
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:59,090
So if proximal cancer has a lower incidence initially but then overtakes distal

200
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:07,910
later in life due to having a lower growth rate but a higher initiation rate,

201
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,710
it's funny you might think, oh, higher initiation rate, it should be higher earlier,

202
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:18,920
but actually it just means that you're seeing a lot of things that later get to jump up.

203
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:30,900
All right. And then women, of course, are a little bit lower than that for distal and rectum,

204
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,370
but actually are very similar for proximal because they had similar initiation rates.

205
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:45,420
Okay. So big picture takeaways today are that these pension models are pretty flexible.

206
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:48,630
They can be used with a lot of different types of epidemiological data,

207
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:54,820
from cohort studies to cancer registries and more broadly interested in dealing with these

208
00:27:54,820 --> 00:28:01,770
and all these digitalization models is connecting the data to underlying biological patterns.

209
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:10,410
And so thinking about how differences we see in population or individual level are really being driven by exposure differences,

210
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:18,030
differences by sites and sex. And so that's kind of the big picture of what we're trying to do with these models.

211
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,670
So I'm going to give you a bunch of time to work on Lab nine today.

212
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:31,500
But Lab ten on Wednesday is going to be focusing on how cancer incidence depends on different cancer exposures across the life course.

213
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:36,300
So if you have an initiator or promoter and how that depends.

214
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:44,370
If it was early in life, midlife or late in life, so extremely in labs, it should be fairly short.

215
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:52,560
We'll see if my expectations actually if I actually manage to do that.

216
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:58,080
But the last thing I want to talk about is the article review.

217
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,380
We talked a little bit about this the beginning of the semester,

218
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:08,220
but now we have kind of enough information to actually do the work that I want to follow up now.

219
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:17,610
So the assignment is to write a review, slash commentary on an article of your choice that uses multi-stage,

220
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:21,780
presented Genesis models or multi-stage transition models.

221
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:29,670
This will be due just about a month from today on our final period on December 14th.

222
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:35,070
You can, of course, turn it on earlier, if that if you would like.

223
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:39,270
It is not meant to be a super onerous assignment.

224
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,490
It should be less than 2000 words.

225
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:55,650
And I would like you to vet your articles with me just so that I'm not picking something that after you send it to me.

226
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:59,339
I'm kind of like, Oh, this isn't really what the assignment is.

227
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:03,050
So just just check in with me about the articles.

228
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:09,210
This is basically a distillation of the rubric.

229
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:12,510
The rubric at some point will be on canvas when I have time to put it up.

230
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:17,640
But you will be describing the basic research question, discuss the significance,

231
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:22,920
describe the model structure, discuss the modeling assumptions and whether they're reasonable.

232
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,330
Summarize and discuss the results, and provide an overall critique of the paper,

233
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:31,710
particularly highlighting the value of the study in the context modeling.

234
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:37,230
Questions about the article reveal.

235
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:50,840
He says mostly the all of the upper level AP modeling electives now have to have an article review because that's what we told security to do.

236
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:56,000
So that's what this is here. Okay.

237
00:30:57,260 --> 00:31:08,210
There aren't any questions then. I'll go ahead and get started on nine and I'll be here to answer any questions.
