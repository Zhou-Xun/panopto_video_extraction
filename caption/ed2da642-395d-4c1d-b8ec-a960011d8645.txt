00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,993
Qualitative Study Design,
Research Questions.

2
00:00:08,993 --> 00:00:13,073
In this section I'm going to talk
about what research questions are and

3
00:00:13,073 --> 00:00:16,482
how we can think about developing
our research questions.

4
00:00:16,482 --> 00:00:20,923
Research questions are used to
guide the qualitative inquiry.

5
00:00:20,923 --> 00:00:24,707
Research questions usually come
from a variety of sources.

6
00:00:24,707 --> 00:00:26,232
They can be personal.

7
00:00:26,232 --> 00:00:30,802
That is research questions could arise
from personal motivation through your own

8
00:00:30,802 --> 00:00:34,191
lived experiences or passion for
an issue in public health.

9
00:00:34,191 --> 00:00:38,585
They can be practical in that they are
designed to help you accomplish a certain

10
00:00:38,585 --> 00:00:42,126
task that you are assigned in
an organization or institution.

11
00:00:42,126 --> 00:00:46,610
They can also be intellectual in that
we are seeking out to understand

12
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:51,187
something new or explore new terrain
out of intellectual curiosity.

13
00:00:51,187 --> 00:00:55,971
These are just some examples of
sources for research questions.

14
00:00:55,971 --> 00:00:59,200
So there are several types
of research questions.

15
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,964
John Creswell and others have
offered the following categories

16
00:01:02,964 --> 00:01:05,200
of qualitative research questions.

17
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,029
The first is exploratory
research questions.

18
00:01:08,029 --> 00:01:11,614
So this is when we set out to
investigate something new or

19
00:01:11,614 --> 00:01:14,298
something which is not well understood.

20
00:01:14,298 --> 00:01:18,815
The second category is explanatory,
which is where we attempt to

21
00:01:18,815 --> 00:01:23,669
explain patterns related to the topic or
phenomenon we are studying.

22
00:01:23,669 --> 00:01:26,688
Thirdly, research questions
can be descriptive,

23
00:01:26,688 --> 00:01:29,918
in which we set out to describe
the phenomenon or topic.

24
00:01:29,918 --> 00:01:33,939
And the fourth category is
emancipatory research questions.

25
00:01:33,939 --> 00:01:38,592
For these types of questions
we're really pushing to engage in

26
00:01:38,592 --> 00:01:42,116
social action about
the topic we are studying.

27
00:01:42,116 --> 00:01:44,176
So research questions
help us to do two things.

28
00:01:44,176 --> 00:01:46,563
First, they help us to
determine our methods.

29
00:01:46,563 --> 00:01:50,536
They help us to decide if we want to use
qualitative and/or quantitative methods.

30
00:01:50,536 --> 00:01:53,817
Research questions could help guide
us to thinking about if we should use

31
00:01:53,817 --> 00:01:56,311
focus groups or
in-depth interviews, for example.

32
00:01:56,311 --> 00:01:59,260
The type of method of data collection.

33
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:03,959
Second, research questions help us to
establish boundaries as to what we will

34
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:04,465
study.

35
00:02:04,465 --> 00:02:07,759
They help us to breakdown an issue or
problem so

36
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:13,425
that it's manageable in the scope for
one research study or research project.

37
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:16,553
Qualitative research questions
are often exploratory.

38
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:21,625
We think of them as hypothesis generating,
not hypothesis testing.

39
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:26,087
Qualitative research questions
demonstrate flexibility in our approach.

40
00:02:26,087 --> 00:02:30,707
Research questions can change or shift
during the course of a research study.

41
00:02:30,707 --> 00:02:35,400
So remember that the process is not always
linear and there is room for modification.

42
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,520
You may start out with broader
questions and narrow them.

43
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,944
Or you may broaden them if you realize
that you need to expand the scope of

44
00:02:42,944 --> 00:02:46,134
your study in order to
capture important details.

45
00:02:46,134 --> 00:02:50,094
Your research questions may also
change some as you start the data

46
00:02:50,094 --> 00:02:51,465
collection process.

47
00:02:51,465 --> 00:02:58,158
And qualitative research questions
are not only individually focused.

48
00:02:58,158 --> 00:02:59,766
So let's think about some ideas for

49
00:02:59,766 --> 00:03:02,348
where to start with developing
your research question.

50
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:06,948
You can start by identifying the general
issue or population you want to study or

51
00:03:06,948 --> 00:03:09,363
that you will work with in public health.

52
00:03:09,363 --> 00:03:11,374
So while research questions can change,

53
00:03:11,374 --> 00:03:13,794
you will need to think ahead
as you plan a project.

54
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:16,654
So think about,
what are your personal interests or

55
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:20,235
experiences that have led you to
have these research questions?

56
00:03:20,235 --> 00:03:24,020
You should also conduct a literature
search and see what kind of previous

57
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:27,010
studies have been done and
what they have already shown.

58
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:32,058
You could also think about how qualitative
research questions could help you to

59
00:03:32,058 --> 00:03:37,039
implement a new public health program or
to evaluate a public health program.

60
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:41,331
Something important to keep in mind as
you write your research questions is that

61
00:03:41,331 --> 00:03:44,548
research questions and
hypotheses are not the same thing.

62
00:03:44,548 --> 00:03:47,207
Research questions state
what you want to learn.

63
00:03:47,207 --> 00:03:51,122
Research hypotheses state your
tentative answer to these questions.

64
00:03:51,122 --> 00:03:55,739
Qualitative research doesn't
usually test research hypotheses.

65
00:03:55,739 --> 00:04:00,180
Research questions allow for this more
open-ended exploration of a topic,

66
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:06,639
where you are not coming in with
tentative answers to your questions.

67
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:10,763
I also want to mention the idea of
coming up with a grand tour question and

68
00:04:10,763 --> 00:04:12,155
then sub-questions.

69
00:04:12,155 --> 00:04:16,711
So the grand tour question is the broadest
question being examined in the study in

70
00:04:16,711 --> 00:04:18,055
the most general form.

71
00:04:18,055 --> 00:04:21,050
This is the central question
to your research project.

72
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:24,405
You can then have sub-questions
under your grand tour question.

73
00:04:24,405 --> 00:04:28,201
So the sub-questions help
us to narrow the focus, but

74
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:32,009
should also not constrain
us in the research process.

75
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:36,231
The sub-questions maintain the key
characteristics of your grand tour

76
00:04:36,231 --> 00:04:38,315
question, but are more specific.

77
00:04:38,315 --> 00:04:42,666
So by answering these sub-questions,
we can then use this information

78
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:45,674
collectively to answer
our grand tour question.

79
00:04:45,674 --> 00:04:50,862
In embracing the idea the qualitative
research is flexible you should anticipate

80
00:04:50,862 --> 00:04:55,299
that these sub-questions could change
over the course of a project or

81
00:04:55,299 --> 00:04:56,893
new ones could be added.

82
00:04:56,893 --> 00:05:00,829
I will give you an example of some
research that we are currently working on.

83
00:05:00,829 --> 00:05:05,281
So our grand tour question in this study
is, what are the health needs of female

84
00:05:05,281 --> 00:05:08,264
labor migrants coming from
Central Asia to Russia?

85
00:05:08,264 --> 00:05:10,109
And our sub-questions are,

86
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:14,623
which health issues most concern
Central Asian female labor migrants?

87
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:17,792
What are their sexual and
reproductive health needs?

88
00:05:17,792 --> 00:05:22,588
How and to what extent to do Central Asian
female labor migrants meet their health

89
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:24,574
needs while residing in Russia?

90
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:28,843
What are the gaps in services
provided to this population?

91
00:05:28,843 --> 00:05:33,765
By using these sub-questions it helps us
to a little more narrowly focus our scope

92
00:05:33,765 --> 00:05:38,471
in order to gather the best information so
that we can then best answer our grand

93
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:42,537
tour research question of what
are the health needs of Central Asian

94
00:05:42,537 --> 00:05:46,216
women who migrate to Russia for
employment opportunities.

95
00:05:46,216 --> 00:05:47,166
So in summary,

96
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:51,703
research questions provide a focus
to your qualitative research study.

97
00:05:51,703 --> 00:05:54,938
Research questions are not
the same as hypotheses.

98
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:57,841
And research questions are what you,
as a researcher,

99
00:05:57,841 --> 00:06:02,762
are setting out to answer through
your qualitative inquiry.
