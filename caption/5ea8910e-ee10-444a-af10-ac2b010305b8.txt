00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:09,110
Hi, everyone. My name is Jeffrey Chludzinksi, and I am one of the infection prevention is at Michigan Medicine,

2
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:15,420
and one of my charges is to do surveillance and provide support for the cardiovascular

3
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:24,510
operating rooms. So I'm going to be here for the next couple series to go over surgical site infections and

4
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:32,850
go figure out what we do with looking at case definitions and what we call infections.

5
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:37,090
So what is a surgical site infection also known as an SSI?

6
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:44,070
A surgical site infection is the infection that occurs after surgery in the part of the body where the surgery took place.

7
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:49,710
So if you had a procedure done on your chest, an SSI would develop what would?

8
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,810
It would be considered an SSI.

9
00:00:51,810 --> 00:01:03,150
If an infection developed at the chest site, it would not be a SSI if you got a head infection, because the surgery tonight involves your head.

10
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:08,310
Surgical site infections can sometimes be superficial infections involving the skin only.

11
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:14,190
They may also be more serious and can involve tissues under the skin, organs that were implant's material.

12
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:15,990
So depending on the nature of the surgery,

13
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:23,730
you're either gonna have a very superficial layer or you could go down into the organ space depending on where wherever you touch for the surgery,

14
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:30,380
any of that could be involved in a surgical site infection. Why are SSI so important?

15
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:36,290
The biggest thing is they are one of the most common and the most costly H.H. eyes as Assize

16
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:42,200
account for approximately 20 percent of all hospital acquired infections in hospitalized patients,

17
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,270
about two to five percent of patients who undergo an inpatient surgery will develop an

18
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:53,720
SSI in the course of their stay or after they have been discharged from the hospital.

19
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:59,180
Up to 300000 exercise occur each year in the United States.

20
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:04,310
As we mentioned, this is one of the most common that we have in the US.

21
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:11,000
Each surgical site infection is associated with approximately seven to eleven additional post-operative hospital days.

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:20,120
So after each surgical procedure, we have an estimate on how long you are going to be in the hospital for recovery.

23
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:28,550
Sometimes if you do development SSI during the stay. That could add the seven to 10 additional post OP days from your initial admission.

24
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:33,830
Or it could be that you had a normal course during your stay.

25
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:40,460
And instead of leaving the hospital and not coming back, you could come back to the hospital three,

26
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:45,980
four weeks later and have the additional stay, basically.

27
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:50,510
Those are additional hospital days that were not originally planned on.

28
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:56,880
Patients with an SSI have two to eleven times higher risk of death compared with operative patients with Outmuscle High.

29
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:05,060
So basically you can have a surgical site infection after your procedure and you could be fine and nothing happens,

30
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:09,020
or just by the fact that you had a complication after surgery.

31
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,140
It could lead to a greater chance of death.

32
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:22,070
And then finally, as his eyes are believed to account for three point five billion to 10 billion dollars annually in health care expenditures.

33
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:29,480
So, you know, health care is a very expensive business on top of how expensive it is to have a procedure done.

34
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:37,820
You would have even more money associated with the cost that it takes to take care of a surgical site infection.

35
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:41,990
Now, these numbers are coming from a 2014 update.

36
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:51,140
So I'm sure by now with the rate of inflation, those costs are even greater than that.

37
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:55,070
So every year, the joint commission, which is our accrediting body,

38
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:59,990
has a national patient safety goals as exercise are important because of this goal.

39
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:04,460
Goal number seven. We want to reduce the risk of health care associated infections.

40
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:09,140
And as part of that, we need to use proven guidelines, prevent infection after surgery.

41
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:14,300
So not only is it right for the patient and right for the health care system,

42
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:22,250
but is also mandated that we do actively find ways to reduce infection after surgery.

43
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:32,660
Along with our other causes of infections, like from central lines or catheters for urinary drainage.

44
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:38,960
In addition to all that, there's also financial incentives for reducing exercise.

45
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,850
First one is hospital acquired conditions or hack's.

46
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:49,580
We do not get by we I mean, the health care system in general does not get reimbursement for surgical site

47
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:54,830
infections that are related to coronary artery bypass grafts or cabbages,

48
00:04:54,830 --> 00:05:01,400
bariatric surgery or orthopedic surgery and cardiac implantable electronic devices.

49
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,990
So based on some administrative data that we report up through the government on,

50
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:14,990
if there are infections that are due to any of these procedures, we do not get reimbursed for that.

51
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:20,170
It is a cost to these institutions.

52
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:29,600
In addition to that, we also have a pay for performance model where we get a bonus money depending on the

53
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:36,140
way that we perform with our abdominal hysterectomy and colon surgeries briefly.

54
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:42,080
All hospitals can pool a certain amount of money together that is considered at risk.

55
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,330
And depending on your performance, you either lose that money or you gain that money.

56
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:53,510
You can either dean the money that you put it or you can gain some other hospitals money.

57
00:05:53,510 --> 00:06:04,220
So it puts us at direct competition with other hospitals to not not only perform well, but perform better than anyone else.

58
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:10,670
We see this with our Value-Based Purchasing and Hospital Compare website. So this is data directly from Medicare dot gov.

59
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:20,180
And you can see the where the University of Michigan. How we perform with our SSI from colon surgery and from Obama hysterectomy.

60
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:29,090
This is public information. Any patient, any and really anyone can access this data and just see how many infections

61
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:34,220
does an individual hospital or group of hospitals report in a given timeframe?

62
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:39,350
And is that better, the same or worse than our national benchmark?

63
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:45,230
So as you can see with our colon and abdominal hysterectomy is the number of infections

64
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:51,710
that we reported over the number of procedures that we did in that timeframe. And what our standardized infection ratio is.

65
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:59,730
And basically. And then finally, are we. How do we compare to the national benchmark?

66
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:04,090
So what does it take to get SSI? It's not just having a procedure.

67
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:12,460
There's there's multiple things that are involved with getting an SSI. First, we need to have an organism that's going to cause that infection.

68
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:21,160
This can be like Mersa Vieri staff, E. coli, any organism that's not supposed to be in our body or an organism that's in our body.

69
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:28,690
But it's not supposed to be at that site can cause an infection. Just the presence of that is not enough.

70
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:32,260
We also have to have a large enough dose.

71
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:39,040
So also known as the bacterial dose, which is the amount of organism that is required to produce an infection.

72
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:52,360
Some organisms are going to require a very, very small amount and others are going to require a larger amount in order for an infection to develop.

73
00:07:52,360 --> 00:08:03,610
A lot of procedures are going to be at increased risk and require less amount of a dose because of artificial material, suture, staples, implants.

74
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:09,290
Anything that's foreign. That was not part of our body originally, but may have been implanted or used in the course.

75
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:23,470
The procedure is a bacterial hotspot. They love artificial material and a little bit of bacteria can be introduced into that

76
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:29,560
material and they'll proliferate in a way that it wouldn't if it was just all natural.

77
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,400
And then finally, in an impaired host, resistance is required for the infection.

78
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:39,290
Obviously, recovering from surgery, it takes a lot out of you and takes love her recovery.

79
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:42,880
You're going to have a decreased immune response. Your you're you're healing.

80
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:54,700
It's just it's you're at a more vulnerable state, which is perfect for an opportunistic infection to take place.

81
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,630
Additional risk factors. There's a lot. Environment instruments.

82
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:02,890
It's higher prepping and draping traffic. Hand scrub antibiotics.

83
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:07,210
All these individual factors are additional risk factors.

84
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:14,590
The biggest one is going to be the patient factors. Obviously, we can take care of a lot of the stuff.

85
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:19,150
We can control the environment. We know how we we process our instruments.

86
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:28,090
We can dictate what people wear in the hours. We can have control over whether or not we're maintaining sterile field.

87
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:36,460
The one thing that we can not edit or that we can not modify as easily are these patient factors.

88
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:42,310
So these are things that we do need to take into consideration when we are performing surgery.

89
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:47,620
These are going to be these patients age, whether or not they're obese.

90
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:52,270
Are they eating well? Do they have diabetes? Are they a lifelong smoker?

91
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:57,220
They recently smoking. If they are smoking, how much are they drinking?

92
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:04,840
Do they have any remote infection? So, again, using a chest procedure as an example, if they have if they're getting a heart surgery, are they.

93
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:10,900
Do they have an infection at their toe? And is there any way that that could migrate over?

94
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:16,870
If they have, like, an uneasy non healing wound that they are consoli scratching.

95
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:22,720
Are they going to scratch that wound and scratch the new incision?

96
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,970
Are they going to be in the hospital before their procedure?

97
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:34,180
Hospitals are a great place to recover, but they are also a lot riskier than being at home.

98
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:42,160
That you can be introduced to a lot more things. Are they immunosuppressed and do they have any underlying medical conditions?

99
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:48,940
And this would be do they have a high American society of anesthesiology or A.S.A. score?

100
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:57,270
The A.S.A. score is an assessment that anesthesiologists used just to classify what the patients can physical condition is.

101
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:03,880
It ranges from one to six really one to five with six being just administrative.

102
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:12,990
No, but one is a normal, healthy patient and five, being a patient who is expected to survive without this operation.

103
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:23,130
Obviously, somebody who's going to have a lower A.S.A. score is in a better position to recover, recover quickly and recover without complication.

104
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:29,040
Somebody who who needs surgery to survive may not be in the best physical condition

105
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:36,410
and may have additional issues later down the road with the recovery room.

106
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:41,190
Worldclass is going to be another thing that we're going to worry about.

107
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:46,230
This is going to be assigned at the end of the procedure by the surgeon and the circulation nurse.

108
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:52,620
And this tells us how dirty is that wound before or when they were operating?

109
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,950
Is it a clean wound or is it dirty or an infected?

110
00:11:55,950 --> 00:12:02,880
Obviously, clean wound is going to be better because we don't have the introduction of form material,

111
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:12,270
a dirty or an infected case, such as like a trauma. Maybe a bullet or a laceration road burn with gravel getting into it.

112
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:18,330
Those cases have a greater chance of something having been introduced into the wound before surgery even

113
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:27,230
took place and is going to be potentially a greater risk of developing infection and drink recovery.

114
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:31,080
So with all these things, we need to make sure that we can prevent a suicide.

115
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:37,410
We're gonna wanna make sure a patient is clean prior to going to surgery. So even a clue, even a clean patient.

116
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:45,750
We want to make sure that they're bathed beforehand. This could be just with normal soap or a lot of procedures or requiring some sort of

117
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:53,640
antibacterial antimicrobial soap that we want to have applied with the timeframe beforehand.

118
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:59,940
So then that way we are taking care of the burden on the skin.

119
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:08,400
Surgeries are gonna have prophylactic antibiotics given. We want to make sure the right antibiotic is given at the right dose and at the right time.

120
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:13,540
Antibiotics given to close to an incision are not going to have enough time to work.

121
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:26,280
And antibiotics given too early before the incision may leave the body before the surgery ends and not provide an effective protective dose.

122
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:30,840
We really don't want to remove hair. Back in the day, there was a lot of shaving that was involved.

123
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:38,340
We do not want to shave. We really don't want to remove hair unless it's going to impede our ability to perform the surgery.

124
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:43,810
So if that is needed, we're going to want to clip shaving is going to create micro abrasions or cut.

125
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:52,260
Neither micro abrasions, but it could create cuts, which is just another portal potential portal for bacteria to enter the skin.

126
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:55,860
So if we do need to remove the hair, we are going to want to clip.

127
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:05,280
So that way the follicles still remains intact and we're not creating any sort of additional entry points.

128
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:09,300
The big one, we're gonna want to clean hands prior to touching or opening sterile supplies,

129
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:15,000
donning sterile gown and gloves before and after touching the patient. We're gonna want to room a lot of hand hygiene.

130
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:24,780
We can take all the care in the world with making sure that we are taking care of everything, sterilely our instruments or supplies the field.

131
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,560
But if we don't wash our hands and if we don't maintain good hand hygiene,

132
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,870
all that is for naught because we could contaminate that things with our hands.

133
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:40,650
After the surgery, we're all going to want to keep dressings clean, dry and intact. A similar concept.

134
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:45,180
We could have this beautiful incision and be all nice and neatly package.

135
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:49,590
But if we're not taking good care of that dressing, if we're picking at it, if we're letting it get dirty,

136
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:56,400
rolling again, excessively moist, that's going to be a potential introduction into that incision.
