00:00:01,844 --> 00:00:08,844
So we're going to talk about yellow dig as Monica mentioned this is one of our newest tools.

2
00:00:08,844 --> 00:00:11,844
And

3
00:00:11,844 --> 00:00:27,844
this is a student driven social network based in an educational setting. What does that mean. So when we think about a social network, we're thinking about, or what it makes me think about is I'm sharing my thoughts.

4
00:00:27,844 --> 00:00:31,844
I'm sharing links to things I find interesting.

5
00:00:31,844 --> 00:00:44,844
I'm looking through what other people have posted pictures, articles, and I'm giving it a thumbs up, if I like it or I'm putting a reply of like I saw this too I thought this was so interesting.

6
00:00:44,844 --> 00:00:47,844
Can you believe.

7
00:00:47,844 --> 00:00:51,844
That's kind of what we're creating, but in the classroom environment.

8
00:00:51,844 --> 00:01:07,844
Yellow Digg integrates right into your Canvas site, and students can engage by posting commenting on other people's posts are simply reactions, and they will earn points for interacting in the platform.

9
00:01:07,844 --> 00:01:22,844
And so, that point system creates a little extra motivation to get in there, do something, add something, have a conversation with somebody, based on something they shared.

10
00:01:22,844 --> 00:01:32,844
And so some ways that this has been used is as a discussion board alternative. If in your class you have weekly Canvas discussions.

11
00:01:32,844 --> 00:01:37,844
Consider converting them into the yellow dig environment.

12
00:01:37,844 --> 00:01:50,844
If you do that what we want to do is have you revisit your weekly question prompts and make sure they're worded in a way that they're open ended. Each student could potentially come with a different answer.

13
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:56,844
maybe from their experience, maybe with something that they've read recently.

14
00:01:56,844 --> 00:01:58,844
Maybe a meme.

15
00:01:58,844 --> 00:02:15,844
That explains, or a comic they've come across that sort of addresses or relates to a topic you're discussing in class. What we want to avoid is sometimes our discussion prompts tend to really only have one correct answer.

16
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:19,844
And so every student is really just saying the same thing.

17
00:02:19,844 --> 00:02:29,844
And therefore, that doesn't leave much room for conversation around a topic because the only response really is. Yeah, I agree, that's the right answer.

18
00:02:29,844 --> 00:02:44,844
That's we talked about in class. I don't really have anything else to contribute. Other than that. So how can we open that up further to allow many possible different responses.

19
00:02:44,844 --> 00:02:57,844
Perhaps you're interested, perhaps you already do or thought about adding a student journal or blog posts aspect to your course as a participation, or assignment or project.

20
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:08,844
This would be a great way to do that, because people can reply, or add applause, thumbs up, type of emojis.

21
00:03:08,844 --> 00:03:30,844
Some other ways that we've seen this used is for poster sessions. We've actually had groups present their sort of Capstone poster. And then people can comment, and we'll get to show you the different post types that are available within yellow dig, could

22
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:48,844
you could record a video, you could have your student introductions done here. And then another way we've used it. This is in our online program. We used it for an actual simulation scenario where students needed to take on the persona of a professional

23
00:03:48,844 --> 00:04:00,844
working in public health in some role, whether it was an official capacity with the local government or working in nonprofit area, or the health system.

24
00:04:00,844 --> 00:04:11,844
And so we had them create their yellow did profiles, with these characters, and then all of the interaction that took place on yellow dig was in character.

25
00:04:11,844 --> 00:04:26,844
And so the reason we went with yellow did for that was because that wasn't able to be created recreated in the canvas environment in the Coursera environment where it has our university of michigan identities, sort of locked in.

26
00:04:26,844 --> 00:04:36,844
We needed to find a way to break away from that, in order to create these character environments.

27
00:04:36,844 --> 00:04:48,844
So some instructors that have used this shared some feedback with us. Dana in environmental health and nutritional sciences, shared with us.

28
00:04:48,844 --> 00:05:02,844
She used it, I believe last winter semester the yellow dig browser app facilitated back and forth conversation and sharing of articles, and websites, creating a sense of community during the week which is what we want we want students engaging with the

29
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:06,844
material, even after they've left the class.

30
00:05:06,844 --> 00:05:14,844
It also allowed me to reinforce course concepts that had been discussed in yellow dig. and that's a perfect example of.

31
00:05:14,844 --> 00:05:25,844
I saw this article that was shared, or I saw this discussion really got going about this, let's talk about it let's bring it to the whole class and build on that a little bit more.

32
00:05:25,844 --> 00:05:41,844
I think what was most fast one of the most fascinating aspects of Dana's experience was that we heard from another faculty member who came to us around midterm and said, My students said they're using yellow dig in another course, and they asked if we

33
00:05:41,844 --> 00:05:51,844
could use it in this course. And so we tried to work on implementing it. It's tricky to implement at a mid term point.

34
00:05:51,844 --> 00:06:02,844
And so that had some challenges but they are intending to implement that again this fall and give it another try from the start.

35
00:06:02,844 --> 00:06:13,844
So Sharon kar diya who did the simulation experience, found that yellow Duke was a game changer. It created a vehicle for students to be able to take their roles into action.

36
00:06:13,844 --> 00:06:36,844
And students especially enjoyed the different multimedia posting options, and the simulation exercise that Sharon created was specifically to meet a CIF competency to formulate multi sector collaborations that support population health improvement.

37
00:06:36,844 --> 00:06:52,844
And so everything about the simulation was really built around that competency and the tool just allowed us to create these multi sector environments, allowing them to collaborate.

38
00:06:52,844 --> 00:06:55,844
Thank you. I have not seen the poster sessions.

39
00:06:55,844 --> 00:06:59,844
But I'm I very much appreciate that feedback.

40
00:06:59,844 --> 00:07:04,844
I know I sometimes help set up the yellow big environment for the poster sessions.

41
00:07:04,844 --> 00:07:21,844
But I don't get to see how they're actually executed. So that's really helpful. Thank you. Um, I think what the best thing about it is that it, it allows more time for people to look at every post or when you have a live poster session for one our hours

42
00:07:21,844 --> 00:07:40,844
or whatever. Nobody gets to see them all, you know unless they just run through without looking and talking. So we, we actually had the posters up for a week and then the live session was at the end of the week, where we were on zoom and you know had

43
00:07:40,844 --> 00:07:46,844
other activities, and and fantastic work really well.

44
00:07:46,844 --> 00:08:01,844
Yeah, and it's really easy to ask questions to the poster creator asynchronously. And then go back and answer questions, and for everyone to see everyone can see that conversation so it's not limited to that one on one discussion.

45
00:08:01,844 --> 00:08:13,844
It was wonderful. Excellent. And so, like, Oh, I'm sorry, go ahead. He's got a few little witches but for the most part it was just fabulous. You know, I'm so glad to hear.

46
00:08:13,844 --> 00:08:30,844
They have implemented some additional features like notifications reminders. So notifications they had on an individual environment like, send me an email every time somebody posts to this group, so I don't miss anything.

47
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:34,844
As a yellow community host.

48
00:08:34,844 --> 00:08:39,844
I can now kind of set those defaults for students what that what I want them to be.

49
00:08:39,844 --> 00:08:55,844
And there's also reminders. So if a student goes in on day one, posts their introduction, and then doesn't come back for three weeks, I can set up an automated reminder to say, hey, It's been a while since you posted in the community.

50
00:08:55,844 --> 00:09:02,844
Don't forget your participation grade is factored into your participation in this environment.

51
00:09:02,844 --> 00:09:23,844
But even taking the poster session idea, perhaps your course has a poster session as the final product or, you know, sort of the course final project and you could use that throughout the term as a draft space, and share drafts, in every iteration, and

52
00:09:23,844 --> 00:09:40,844
then create even a tag for like Final poster or ready to present you know or something like that, which will organize and filter all the completed posters differentiating them from the draft posters.

53
00:09:40,844 --> 00:09:45,844
So there's different ways you could even group those out.

54
00:09:45,844 --> 00:09:50,844
But I appreciate that experience.

55
00:09:50,844 --> 00:09:57,844
So one of the things we talked about at the beginning was wanting to know. Students engagement level.

56
00:09:57,844 --> 00:10:05,844
One of the things I can see as a yellow dig community creator, as the instructor.

57
00:10:05,844 --> 00:10:18,844
One of the many reports there's many reports that show me how much students are interacting, based on their point levels, their, their current scores.

58
00:10:18,844 --> 00:10:27,844
There's also this network graph which creates a very interesting visual of student participation on the left here.

59
00:10:27,844 --> 00:10:44,844
These are actually taken from Sharon cardi is the simulation exercise so on the far left, you see, what we see are the profiles of some of the simulation characters who have jumped in and started communicating on the program, there are lines and arrows

60
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:49,844
between each of their profile pictures that shows who's who they're interacting with.

61
00:10:49,844 --> 00:10:56,844
And then I pulled out all of the sort of loose ones that had not yet jumped into the platform to begin.

62
00:10:56,844 --> 00:11:00,844
Excuse me interacting.

63
00:11:00,844 --> 00:11:17,844
At the end of their simulation project though. You can see all those arrows, each profile image has several arrows coming in and out of it. And this graph has become a tight ball of interaction.

64
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:22,844
And that happens as a result of there's many cross interactions happening.

65
00:11:22,844 --> 00:11:37,844
One thing I'll point out here is, I don't know if you can see the image, sort of, on the far left that looks like it has a flag behind it. This is Sharon, This is Sharon's character in the simulation.

66
00:11:37,844 --> 00:11:40,844
And notice she only has sort of one connector.

67
00:11:40,844 --> 00:11:48,844
And this is almost what we want. We don't need the students to interact with the instructor, we need them to interact with each other.

68
00:11:48,844 --> 00:12:06,844
And so this graph is just almost a perfect represent representation of this, and you've got some outliers who maybe didn't engage as much, and their point totals sort of reflected that, you know, but there's no, there's no longer anyone who's not engaged

69
00:12:06,844 --> 00:12:15,844
at all. They all jumped in and started interacting.

70
00:12:15,844 --> 00:12:19,844
Oh, thank you, Monica has put a link to the assignment.

71
00:12:19,844 --> 00:12:33,844
So if you want to try. We have a yellow to community set up in are resilient teaching Canvas site that's really just created to be a practice space.

72
00:12:33,844 --> 00:12:35,844
Did you want to add something there Monica.

73
00:12:35,844 --> 00:12:45,844
I'm going to jump into it over here, for sure. So I was going to just kind of show you a little bit of what the posting kind of looks like.

74
00:12:45,844 --> 00:12:48,844
Do I still have the, like if I guess I do.

75
00:12:48,844 --> 00:12:51,844
So you can kind of see what that looks like.

76
00:12:51,844 --> 00:13:00,844
Joanna here is the admin of the community so she can put that welcome message in there. That tells that basically sets the stage for how to interact on yellow dig.

77
00:13:00,844 --> 00:13:13,844
I think it's especially important that if your students are haven't used yellow ticket that we should show them how to interact with it and try to highlight all of the features that it can so we've got some hashtags in here and it, it leaves a basically

78
00:13:13,844 --> 00:13:16,844
a template for what the different hashtags are.

79
00:13:16,844 --> 00:13:21,844
We have different reactions that we can, we can say hey yeah this is awesome cool.

80
00:13:21,844 --> 00:13:33,844
We can add that in there, as an instructor, we can manage accolades we can give people basically little hints and tips so yes this is exactly what I'm looking for.

81
00:13:33,844 --> 00:13:46,844
And that can help us stage, the ideas to how other students should be interacting with it as well. So I'm just going to quickly show you here's also the points for the individuals on their, how to actually create a post on there.

82
00:13:46,844 --> 00:14:06,844
So recently I read an article by the raccoons Rackham School graduate education, and they put some information out there about what is known about the accommodations and disabilities among graduate students so I kind of want to share this out to the community.

83
00:14:06,844 --> 00:14:18,844
So,

84
00:14:18,844 --> 00:14:25,844
and as you can imagine it has all the other HTML types of things they might want to put in there bullet points links comments.

85
00:14:25,844 --> 00:14:31,844
I'm going to try and use a couple of different ones you can see what those all looks like.

86
00:14:31,844 --> 00:14:57,844
And as you can see as I'm typing there's some points, a little bar that's going to expand. So that's going to tell me how to make the most points by adding the most to my, my post, and that should change as I start typing and adding things to it.

87
00:14:57,844 --> 00:15:06,844
This is sort of tracking how close Monica is getting to earning full points for making this post.

88
00:15:06,844 --> 00:15:15,844
And, and the point values, and what's required to earn points can be managed by the individual instructor.

89
00:15:15,844 --> 00:15:33,844
And I have some information about that in my getting started, or you can contact us, and we'd be happy to walk through that setup with you, if you're interested.

90
00:15:33,844 --> 00:15:36,844
A couple typos in here

91
00:15:36,844 --> 00:15:52,844
live demonstration type of that happens. Yeah, exactly.

92
00:15:52,844 --> 00:15:55,844
All right, well, fix it later.

93
00:15:55,844 --> 00:16:17,844
So I want to add a link directly to the actual report, so I can link to it.

94
00:16:17,844 --> 00:16:23,844
putting all of this in Turkey.

95
00:16:23,844 --> 00:16:27,844
I also want to add a file.

96
00:16:27,844 --> 00:16:40,844
The short, brief, sorry you're sitting here browsing through my files. Oh, I can't see that on my end, if you want to exit that Oh sorry, I can't see.

97
00:16:40,844 --> 00:16:44,844
If you see the mouse for a second I can cancel it out.

98
00:16:44,844 --> 00:16:49,844
Okay, there you go, you back. Sorry about that later. No problem.

99
00:16:49,844 --> 00:16:54,844
And sure, I'll add a whole to, um, how did you find this interesting.

100
00:16:54,844 --> 00:17:24,844
How did you find this interesting. All right, we can now see Monica has met and earn she's going to earn 250 points for this post. I will tell you in the background it's set to 40 words to earn that point value.

101
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:42,844
While she builds her pull over on the right side where it says points earned and total goal right before that. Sorry right below that there is a how to earn points, which outlines for students, how they're going to what they need to do to earn points.

102
00:17:42,844 --> 00:17:59,844
There are also two different point models in this course because it's a sort of experimental test try it out community. We've set it up to be free form points, meaning you just sort of earn points and you're working towards a goal that we set.

103
00:17:59,844 --> 00:18:02,844
You can set this up for your courses.

104
00:18:02,844 --> 00:18:24,844
But you can also set it up to where there is a weekly goal. So if in your course, you have perhaps weekly deadlines on a final project, or you have weekly discussion posts that you expect students to participate in there can be a weekly point goal that

105
00:18:24,844 --> 00:18:30,844
resets each week that students need to work towards

106
00:18:30,844 --> 00:18:35,844
Show me as you as well.

107
00:18:35,844 --> 00:18:49,844
So feel free if you want to vote on there just to see how that looks like and that's interactions I also tagged it with the topic in the news you could add any types of topic tags that you want students to engage with, with a poster session, maybe you

108
00:18:49,844 --> 00:18:57,844
have different sessions poster sessions and they want to make sure that they label it that way, you can do so that way as well.

109
00:18:57,844 --> 00:19:05,844
Yeah, so that's basically what it looks like.

110
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:12,844
So this yellow community is open all the time. If you want to try it out.

111
00:19:12,844 --> 00:19:20,844
And we have a link to it in the slides that will share with you after the session.

112
00:19:20,844 --> 00:19:23,586
And I think that might be my last slide.
