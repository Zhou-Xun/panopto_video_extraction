1
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:06,810
The right people here.

2
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,370
All right. Hi, everyone. Welcome to epidemiology. 674.

3
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:19,260
This is epidemiologic data analysis using our I'm so excited to be here with you all.

4
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:25,170
This is one of my favorite classes to teach because you don't have to be here. You're here because you're excited about this topic, just like me.

5
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,530
And yeah, this will be a seven week class.

6
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,139
We'll meet every Wednesday from 3 to 5 in this room.

7
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,600
I've never taught in this room before, but I think we've got all the tech figured out and here we go.

8
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,310
So confirming all of you have access to our canvas page.

9
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:47,370
This is where we'll share information about this class and communicate with each other.

10
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:55,020
Let's close out a different way. Anybody having trouble accessing the campus site?

11
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:00,330
Because here's where we'll get all of our links to join our coding programs together.

12
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,930
I want to draw your attention to these activities before class.

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,290
If you haven't done them yet, you can do it while I'm talking.

14
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:16,500
So here we'll ask you to create a ladder with our studio below.

15
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:19,710
Okay. This can be through any email you want. Doesn't have to be or you must email,

16
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,809
but make an account through there and we'll be primarily using our through the

17
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:29,670
cloud this semester that'll help us share files with each other for assessment.

18
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:38,880
And an alternative approach you can do is you can uninstall our under laptops and some of those instructions are available here.

19
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:49,840
I found that this. Activities can take a high degree of time troubleshooting because everybody's laptop is a little bit different.

20
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,890
So if you're having any issues, if you want to work on your personal computer,

21
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:57,740
feel free to come to student, drop in hours and I'll help you through that as we go through.

22
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:04,480
So it's a little bit more straightforward approach so that during class time we can hit the ground running on coding.

23
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:08,770
We're going to use the portion that can be accessed through a web browser.

24
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:17,110
So I've had people do take this class using just a tablet. The web browser really makes it a pretty portable way to do our coding.

25
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:23,710
So if you haven't yet, please make a log in with our studio cloud so that we can share activities here.

26
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:29,340
Just a little bit of remaining orientation to our canvas site.

27
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,490
Here is our syllabus.

28
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:42,810
You have this downloaded here and I'll share it. My name is, as I said, Kelly Borkowski.

29
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:48,010
It's pronounced like a buckle and a ski. But you can call me Dr. B incoming Kelly.

30
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:51,720
Professor B, there are several options here.

31
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:57,690
Here's a description of this course. Our course materials will be distributed through canvas.

32
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:04,660
A description? There's no prerequisites for this class, so I'm not assuming that you have any prior knowledge.

33
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:13,229
There's some recommendations that you've taken. An intro, epidemiology and biostatistics course was something I've really enjoyed recently.

34
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:21,870
We've had people coming to us from not the not not just the Epidemiology Department, and we've had undergraduates joining us in the class.

35
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:25,770
So please feel free to point out if I'm using terminology,

36
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:32,729
I might get enthusiastic and start speaking using specific terms and and feel free to speak up.

37
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:36,120
And we want to make sure that we're communicating to a wider audience.

38
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:43,930
All right. Here is how we're going to interact. We're going to have in-person lectures, as you can see here.

39
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:49,360
We'll also have in-person product. Both of these things will happen during our two hour period together.

40
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,810
Attendance is recommended. As you'll see. This is an interactive time.

41
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,850
I'm also recording it on Panopto.

42
00:03:54,850 --> 00:04:03,130
So if you miss a session, feel free to engage over the recording and welcome everyone who is viewing this electronically.

43
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:11,610
There'll be weekly homework assignments, you'll submit through canvas and there'll be discussion posts.

44
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:16,500
So I require you to do three discussion posts throughout the course.

45
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,089
So the homework will be every week and then the discussion posts you only have to do three times.

46
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:22,050
You're welcome to do more.

47
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:30,880
One of the big things with our a big cultural shift for people who have worked with other programing languages before like that,

48
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,930
things are kind of hierarchical. If you have a question there,

49
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:42,630
you go to the SAS website and you get help from the experts here with are that entire structure is flat and it's really based on the user base.

50
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:52,890
So we have to practice asking effective questions and we have to practice being good contributors to the community and providing responses.

51
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:58,620
So this will be one of the objectives that we'll be working on this in this class is how to ask for help and how to provide help,

52
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:04,050
because that's really part of the culture of. So it's a purpose of this discussion posts here.

53
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:09,450
And the purpose of the homeworks will be to practice coding so you can see what are some of the things that we really value in

54
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:16,800
this class and how we want you to be able to take what you want here and push it to the next level in whichever field you wish.

55
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:24,759
One of the things people are most excited about often with this class is our grading is on a satisfactory,

56
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:30,760
unsatisfactory scale, and the university sets out threshold at 70%.

57
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:42,130
So. And you can hit all of that by doing all of your homework or some combination of homework and discussions you can see there.

58
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:53,660
Okay. Yeah. You can see additional communication preferences here.

59
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,410
I have a google form if you'd like to give me feedback in the moment so that I can adapt for the class.

60
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:08,030
There's also, of course, teaching evaluations where you can provide assessments of this course and of me at the end of the semester.

61
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:16,460
But this way I'll be able to actually implement those changes on a level which you'll be able to respond to.

62
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:22,360
What else? Oh, yeah. There is no penalty for late work.

63
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:30,150
I understand everybody's juggling a lot of commitments. I have due dates on all of your assignments to help you keep pace with the class.

64
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,690
But if you have to submit something after the due date, you. No, no, no need to tell me.

65
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:38,550
The only exception is our class ends on this date.

66
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:43,470
So if you need to go beyond that for some of your submissions, well, you and I can talk about it together.

67
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:48,950
We can come up with an alternative schedule. What else?

68
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:59,870
All right. We have received a number of accommodation requests from folks and I think the class

69
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:03,920
is designed to be inclusive of those at a baseline level for everyone anyways.

70
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:07,490
But if anything are missing, please, please let me know at this hour.

71
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:11,220
Excellent to see these coming through. Yeah.

72
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:16,010
And you can see that we have we have different goals for each session.

73
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:22,290
So the goal today will be getting started. Here's a number of learning objectives.

74
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:27,150
Sessions two and three will both be about data management and epidemiology.

75
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,400
The actual modeling is pretty quick.

76
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:37,230
We spend a lot of time on data management, and then I'll do descriptive statistics, graphics, hypothesis, testing and regression model.

77
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,520
And then I've even seem. People want to push themselves further.

78
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:46,080
So we have a number of self-guided activities you can do beyond the scope of the class.

79
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,370
Something I've really noticed is people get passionate about this and they want to keep going.

80
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,520
So I'm trying to provide some options that go beyond the class.

81
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,090
Our canvas pages for each of those weeks of the class are going to follow a similar structure.

82
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:08,270
So, for example, here's our structure for getting started with art, a program we're doing right now.

83
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:11,690
We have a number of learning objectives, so it will be our goals today.

84
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:17,600
I will have PowerPoint slides that we'll work through. We also have in our studio cloud workspace.

85
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:22,250
So this will be the portion where we will be interactively coding.

86
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:27,950
And then there'll be a link after class for the Panopto recording,

87
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:37,560
and here's a link to the homework assignment and the discussion thread so you can see what those homework assignments look like.

88
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:49,620
But these are profs. I will ask you to submit your code and your answers, and you can submit them in multiple formats and the rubrics are down below,

89
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,980
so you'll be able to see what criteria you'll be evaluated on.

90
00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:00,220
The discussion posts and we'll talk about this in more detail.

91
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:07,210
But really, with the culture of art, we want to practice asking questions and providing responses.

92
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:19,220
And so we're going to do this kind of in the. A comfortable, sheltered space of our research community here in our class.

93
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:26,180
Before I'm sending you out into the wide world of the Internet where, you know, some people can be more harsh commentators.

94
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:30,860
So here we're going to try to practice some of these skills and this together.

95
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:39,799
So and there's even entire websites that are dedicated to giving you some helpful tips on

96
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:45,140
how to ask a useful question in art so that other people will be able to help you up.

97
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,360
Some of the general things I've seen.

98
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:57,340
Help make these things we facilitate it is to try to be as specific as you can give the actual code you're using,

99
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:02,630
provide the actual error messages, some of them. Questions.

100
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:09,560
Discussion posts that are most challenging to respond to are the ones where people will say a general statement like Nothing is working.

101
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,469
Our definitions of nothing might be very different.

102
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:21,160
And that's hard to point me in an area where something new we haven't tried or how to figure out what specifically is at issue.

103
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:24,880
So try to be as provide as much information as possible.

104
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:31,480
Andrew Discussion post you get credit for a post in question. You got credit for responding to your colleagues questions.

105
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:37,810
So even if you don't have a question that we encourage you to log onto the discussion thread and see if you can help people out.

106
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:47,110
There's a rubric here to assessing those those three discussion posts you'll do throughout the semester.

107
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:55,990
All right. That was a whirlwind tour of our campus site and our syllabus, our expectations.

108
00:10:56,410 --> 00:11:00,460
Just want to pause there. There was some question in the news.

109
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:10,010
It's a little off. Usually the first week of school, you're seeing syllabi in every class right away.

110
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:24,490
So maybe it's been a couple of weeks since you've seen one that. Let's hop into it.

111
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:35,520
Uh huh. Okay.

112
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:47,620
All right. We are recording the canvass and stillness over you. Something I'd like to do now is provide some introduction.

113
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:51,220
So I want to have us be more comfortable.

114
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:58,790
Discussing with each other on some of these discussion boards and in person during some of these classes.

115
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:04,310
Sometimes it feels a little vulnerable to express that you're having trouble or that your code is broken or something like that.

116
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:08,330
So we want to get to know each other a little bit better.

117
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:14,450
So I'd invite you to share your name if you wish.

118
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:23,240
Your pronouns, your program, like you're either department or like what, what type of degree program are in.

119
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:27,680
And then why you signed up for this class? Because you don't have to be here.

120
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,620
So, like, why are you excited about where they are?

121
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:40,910
So my name is Kelly because she was our she her I'm assistant professor of epidemiology program and I here I started coding in.

122
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:48,520
AH In 2008, when I was a laboratory scientist, I made some very strange data.

123
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,829
DNA methylation data that had a file extension of that I.

124
00:12:53,830 --> 00:13:01,750
That I did. And. Any of the programs those familiar with tonight, even though it's so fast and want that Excel didn't want that.

125
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:06,520
We didn't want that. And I found a threat on the Internet where somebody said you could process this.

126
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:10,840
And so I kind of went on a self-guided journey out of necessity to teach myself.

127
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:14,130
AR And I have just never looked back. I've loved it ever since.

128
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:20,890
So for me, it provides a lot of flexibility and allows me to be reproducible in my research.

129
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,790
So I hope I as a student always used to sit in the back.

130
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:30,669
So I have a particular kind of affection for that personality style.

131
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:36,670
So let's start in the back and say your name if you wish your pronouns, your your department or program.

132
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:44,440
And then why are you excited to learn? Dad for sure not having breakfast.

133
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:53,830
It's hard to hear the screams for everyone in this guarded and most active year three student and the general left feeling trapped.

134
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:58,310
And I spent a lot of time this summer filling in our great internship.

135
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:06,640
I loved it and I just really want to make sure I really strong foundation and are doing a lot of our programing.

136
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:10,750
E and all of you.

137
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:14,290
I thought you were so excited to be here.

138
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,830
Oh, wow. That's very, very good. Thank you. Yeah, actually, nothing.

139
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:31,560
I think in this class, I think we should go back to that.

140
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:40,740
I dread the second year. I think that the object is that they actually want to learn how to do it.

141
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:46,769
Like for real. Like I thought, like some people have some prior experience that I have.

142
00:14:46,770 --> 00:15:00,550
You don't have to worry. That's not a prerequisite. But I would say that people get to share their knowledge and I use all like.

143
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:19,209
What attracted you, right? So right when I got here, I was helping out there.

144
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:22,860
She heard and I decided to make the part of this.

145
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:32,050
I understand it had to be honesty and also with respect to it also, I feel like you are an optimist.

146
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:36,310
I am passionate about. I just kind of want like that.

147
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:49,330
I actually like knowing like what things are like, you know, like a lot of fun to see that intersection of how you would do to fight for that.

148
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:58,150
I'm Quentin. I'm a second year in general at the orientation classes to learn more about our in general but also

149
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:06,530
it's like a summer internship that for the most part I would like to take what I did there to do it.

150
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:13,629
So yeah. How did you find that once you learn one language?

151
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:18,010
Very well, it's the second one. It's a little bit less of a hurdle.

152
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,590
And I hope you're as well. Yeah. Hi, I'm Maria.

153
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:32,950
Her pronounced I am sitting here and each student she was also your 512 class last year.

154
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:38,760
So I'm learning art because I still feel that fuzzy. I'm learning so far.

155
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:41,920
I feel like it's more like how it works.

156
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,490
But also you get a better understanding.

157
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:50,450
Oh, well, we'll try to. Yeah, okay.

158
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,070
That's a metaphor. I'll take a fuzzy to make it really crystal clear.

159
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:58,870
Hi, I'm Lindsey. I'm a teacher in the farm program.

160
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:04,070
Oh, that's exciting. What if you like secondary school? I chose that.

161
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,780
So I started in Nigeria. Yeah, I love it.

162
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:14,350
And I wanted to take this class because I know I want to go to industry and evolve and I just have background knowledge.

163
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:21,910
So I met up in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and I have also been to a pharmacy.

164
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:31,580
I want to see this class because I don't have much background, are about to see switch products and think.

165
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:47,540
Oh wow. Yeah, you're right on that threshold. My name is Delaney and I'm still in technology and I'm also a more familial resource.

166
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:57,040
So I want to learn more of art. And sometimes I found that it can be pretty complex if you start to write code, but using art is more easier.

167
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:04,999
But all I know is I have to associate and Google and copy paste the article and I don't know why I write it.

168
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:12,160
So I want yeah, I want to tell you about being able to search for things and pull out the relevant information

169
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:19,030
that is excellent that you will continue to do that throughout the rest of your current work.

170
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:25,899
I'm I'm Carol. I'm not so sure I'm a senior in undergraduate.

171
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:35,530
Yes. Okay. I'm on the phone. And I just wanted to look at your background before I graduate and go into research because I feel like, ha, ha.

172
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:39,190
Oh, nice. Let's get you some girls who are growing out on the job market.

173
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:42,819
You're good with. I am Haley.

174
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:56,110
I'm a first year Ph.D. in NHS. Um, I, I'm here because my MPH was all in SAS and my lab exclusively works and ah,

175
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:59,859
I've already started my first research rotation and I feel like I'm drowning, so.

176
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:04,140
Oh, no job. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hoping to quickly find.

177
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:07,719
Oh, hi. Hi. Welcome. Hi.

178
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:11,800
My name is Angel. I'm a second year student.

179
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:17,140
Um, I'm taking stats because I have never used computer languages before,

180
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:23,230
and I'm taking art school this year, so I'm excited to see how they're doing.

181
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:28,150
Both Outlook. Yeah. Oh, you're 41 years too. Okay, 42 credits.

182
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,960
So I'm making the most of it accelerated. You go, okay.

183
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:38,290
I don't I, I'm not. I'm a second year health informatics student as well information.

184
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:45,730
And I took this class because I did take a class last year and I had to drop that

185
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,860
used ah but it didn't seem very friendly for those that have exams for that.

186
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:58,300
So I thought this class would be good as my introductions are wonderful.

187
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,570
Yeah. And there's a number on the campus I drive like things you.

188
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:08,410
To do to extend our learning beyond this class. And I recommend from the School of Information to classes for more advanced programing.

189
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:15,790
So hopefully this will set folks up if they want to take some of the time she.

190
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:35,530
First year. General Mills has a little bit experience with using my skills and also I'm probably what make you more marketable.

191
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:46,569
Okay. Yeah. My name is third year and first year General Epidemiology and I haven't done anything about coding on programing,

192
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:52,860
so I want to work on the knowledge about our preference.

193
00:20:52,890 --> 00:21:07,209
Yeah. My name is Merchant and I'm also a first year graduate student in immunology and taking of courses like the biostatistics by to one.

194
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:11,350
So we should, I should use the ah to do some homework.

195
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:15,940
Sometimes I feel struggling so I think this class will be helpful.

196
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:23,950
Oh, great. Oh, this is my. So we have almost like a whole range of experiences from folks who've been working in this language for over a year,

197
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:27,249
and some folks are brand new at it. So this is this is perfect.

198
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:31,630
This is realistic to what the our community is like on the broader Internet.

199
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:35,019
So please contribute and help each other out.

200
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:42,580
And don't be afraid to ask questions because we have we have a rich amount of knowledge and experience already in this room as we're getting started.

201
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:46,570
I'm excited to get to know you all in more detail.

202
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:52,240
So we're going to do a series of slides on introduction, are in our studio,

203
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:57,999
then we'll go together, we'll take a break and then we'll come back with slides and coding.

204
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:06,190
So we'll try to do this type of, um, flip flop between slides and then multiply it together in class and your homework.

205
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:10,929
One all about our objects and our will we do next week.

206
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:19,360
So next Wednesday. Okay. All right.

207
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,129
So this initial slide section,

208
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:27,100
our learning objectives are to understand what our is and why we might consider using our and we want to become familiar with that,

209
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:30,459
our studio cloud interface. All right.

210
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:36,610
So what is our our is a comprehensive statistical and graphical programing language and environment.

211
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:41,500
And they have this acronym of Cram for the Comprehensive Our Archive Network.

212
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:45,310
And that's where you can download the our program from the current group.

213
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:55,360
Our studio is kind of a very attractive wrapper that goes around with the R program.

214
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:59,100
So if you're working on your personal computer, you've got to download both.

215
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:04,299
So this is like. The structure behind it.

216
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:07,440
And then this is what makes it more user friendly. Okay.

217
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:18,880
So we're working with both of those for this class and for the purposes of providing a uniform, our environment, we're going to use our studio class.

218
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:26,620
So this is an opportunity to interact with both underlying our software and our studio through a web browser environment.

219
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:30,700
And you'll see that our studio cloud looks identical to our studio.

220
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:36,640
So your skills are developed in the class. Using our studio cloud will be transferable to our studio.

221
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,900
Why are you excited to learn? Ah, there are a number of things mentioned today.

222
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:47,740
Here are just collected. A few of the ones that resonate with me.

223
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:52,270
I really like that. It's free. You don't have to pay for it.

224
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:58,930
I remember after I graduated, I didn't want to have to pay the staff licensing fee.

225
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:01,120
I didn't know who to ask to pay for that for me.

226
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:08,680
It's also computationally pretty fast, so I'm generating some large data sets and it seems to handle those pretty well.

227
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:13,460
Another thing that makes it nice that runs on many platforms.

228
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:22,490
So if your colleague prefers to run on Mac, somebody else wants run like a cluster, Unix or Linux environment.

229
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:28,700
All of us. No matter where you are, you can use our. You can even do it in a web browser on a tablet.

230
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:34,960
Something else that drew me to AH is its graphics capabilities, I'm pretty sure.

231
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:42,230
Um, I got my post-doc job because I presented a job top where the,

232
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:48,430
the plots were beautiful and that scientist was like, who I would like some of those plots in my paper.

233
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:59,420
So using graphics is a very powerful way to communicate our results, share our science with folks and ah, you'll see is endlessly customizable.

234
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:03,140
You can also spend too much time making these graphics exactly the way you want it to be.

235
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:11,280
Something else that is really helpful for me and art is that who has advanced statistical methods that might not yet be out in other programs?

236
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:21,210
So staff will issue an update maybe once a year, add new projects, add new capability, or is getting updated every day.

237
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:26,969
So any time a new method comes out, there might be an opportunity to implement it.

238
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:37,650
And this is uniform across coding languages, but it's something that I think is really valuable is that it's a way by sharing our code.

239
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:43,620
By sharing our projects, we can make our research very reproducible for our is transparent.

240
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:49,710
Other people can double check our work and make sure we increase our rigor of our science.

241
00:25:52,430 --> 00:26:00,200
Another thing I really like about it kind of philosophically is that it's open access and open source.

242
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:05,270
What does that mean? Can anybody for me, anybody have any idea what either of these terms mean?

243
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:09,130
What does open access or open source where terms?

244
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:14,830
I'd heard of them before. While you're shopping. Anyone contribute to.

245
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:19,730
The database comprises libraries.

246
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:28,730
Exactly. Yeah. So that is this idea of open source is that anybody can contribute to the source code.

247
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:33,100
Anybody can generate functionality for a heart.

248
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:37,690
Wonderful. These are the open access ideas that.

249
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:43,879
Is this connected to? The first one is that there no barriers to entry.

250
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,850
Everybody can access it. See what the heck is going on here.

251
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:53,689
So we've got some descriptions of this open access and it's free, it's immediately available and then it's open source,

252
00:26:53,690 --> 00:27:02,600
meaning that all of the code that is under the hood is publicly available and you can make updates or any changes that you want at any time.

253
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:11,770
But does this leg prick anyone spidey senses make you nervous?

254
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:15,940
What issues might come up if everything's open access or open source?

255
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:23,410
Is this risky in any way? I've been presenting this as a positive experience and anything we should watch out for.

256
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:30,140
Yeah. I guess it could be unreliable.

257
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:38,440
Like if someone made a distracted grad student and they didn't really know what they were doing and they put it on there,

258
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:43,450
then everybody started using it. And what would they say it does?

259
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:48,820
It doesn't actually do that. You might have reliability issues because anybody could be an author.

260
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:53,710
I'm not going to throw the graduate student that particular out of the box. By God, anybody could be doing anything.

261
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:57,549
We might be making a mistake or not even know it. So.

262
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:00,490
So these things we want to keep in the back of our mind.

263
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:08,260
There's no overall self corporation that is double checking all of the code, the crack code and make sure it works right.

264
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:18,460
All of this stuff is available out there, but we kind of have to be a little bit discerning to figure out which code is useful for us.

265
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:25,600
And our kind of has some ways through the community to figure out what sort this stuff out.

266
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:29,860
So a couple of ways our packages can get ratings.

267
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:35,440
So you can use sometimes I'll just use the top rated package in that area.

268
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:41,020
So almost like a Yelp reviewer or something like the user base can say, Hey, I've had a good experience with this.

269
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:50,480
People can submit. Like through GitHub, they can submit request to be like, Hey, I noticed something funny here.

270
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:57,380
And the really proactive contributors will make that correction in a timely manner.

271
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:03,150
Sometimes you come across a package and there's. Dozens of errors that were pointed out a decade ago.

272
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:06,380
They never you know, they've moved on. They're not updating this thing anymore.

273
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:12,860
So we can prioritize working with packages that have been well that are well maintained.

274
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:15,020
And so it really relying on the user base.

275
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:25,710
So relying on our colleagues to help recommend the packages to each other and the whole community out on the Internet to help us sort through this.

276
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:31,770
There is kind of a ton of information out there is very popular.

277
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:38,450
Here are some data. Those of you who are talking about wanting to be in this class to make yourselves more marketable for internships or jobs,

278
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:43,370
you see job postings from Indeed.com, you see SAS and Orange here.

279
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:46,790
Still pretty popular, but you see are blue here.

280
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,850
It's on the right. And this is a couple of years out of date at this point.

281
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:57,800
So really, I'm hoping to give you another tool in your toolbox so that you'll be able to market yourself on the job postings.

282
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:03,800
Here is a plot where you can see industry types that are using R.

283
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:08,630
So the x axis is the 2016 industry and the Y axis is 2017.

284
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:15,890
So if I was following along this line, that would mean it's a steady amount going to that industry.

285
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:23,630
And here we can see out here some of the biggest people coming to are include academic academia, where we are right now.

286
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:30,140
And that's increasing. It's above this line. Health care is going to are government consulting insurance.

287
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:34,910
There's a whole number of fields which are going to answer. It's not just restricted to one.

288
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:44,360
Here's a group that ranks 12th in terms of what are they prefer and we see that python and

289
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:50,479
are the two top rank tools and then probably the one that is nearest and dearest to my heart.

290
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:56,190
So StackOverflow is a website we will be going to throughout the course for troubleshooting.

291
00:30:56,420 --> 00:31:02,420
There's a great place for asking and receiving help on the internet for our questions.

292
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:05,480
So they ask how disliked is each?

293
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:13,400
Our programing is each programing language and we see that our comes out as the least disliked among people who are using so they don't hate it.

294
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:23,990
So hopefully, hopefully you have a strong showing in the job market no matter what field you want to go to and hopefully you don't dislike that.

295
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:28,580
Michael Correct. A little bit of history.

296
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:35,150
Our came from a programing language called Earth started in the eighties and

297
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:41,750
then in the nineties that program group got solidified for R and there's a

298
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:52,280
core team of people that maintain the hardware of our that way or the software of R that that under the hood and then the most recent develop man is.

299
00:31:54,120 --> 00:32:02,010
The advent of a cluster of packages that we'll use in this course called Tiberius that improves the data management functionality of our.

300
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:08,940
So I used to personally do all my data management and stuff and then come to our for analysis.

301
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:15,420
Now since the title verse, I can really personally I can stay in R throughout the whole pathway.

302
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:19,530
But you may, you may find different combinations of software work better for you.

303
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:30,230
Along with that is constantly evolving, it is shifting, is moving and is updating every day.

304
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:35,870
So you may think you have a handle on it and then something may shift.

305
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:40,370
So we're going to kind of cultivate some flexibility in this class.

306
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:50,630
I'm also going to continuously emphasize this is my mantra to logic Check your work.

307
00:32:51,470 --> 00:33:02,120
We can't just run on autopilot with our just run code and accept that that output to be the whole truth because something might have changed.

308
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:06,680
And we need to we need to really take a discerning eye to it and make sure we can interpret the output.

309
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:11,090
So whenever we run code before we even run the code.

310
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:17,590
When I ask you, what do you expect? Then once you run the code, I'm going to ask you, what do you get?

311
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:21,130
So what do you see in the output? And then I'll see. Do they match?

312
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:25,900
All right, so this whenever you're in doubt, okay, we're going to say, what do you expect?

313
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:29,860
What do you get? And do they match? And this is going to help us logic check your out.

314
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:34,450
This can be a great way to find errors if your expectations don't match what you get.

315
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:37,870
It can also be a way to reevaluate your expectations.

316
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:43,870
Identify if there's times in your life when, hey, maybe my expectations were out of whack.

317
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:51,970
I'm learning something new here. So both great opportunities that can come out of mismatched expectations and observations.

318
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:03,910
You may expect a relatively steep learning curve. This is because in our verses there's thousands of packages available.

319
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:09,460
Can anybody share with me how many? Anybody who has done SAS before?

320
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:14,590
How many products do you sell? If you don't know a process, no problem.

321
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:21,729
It's going to help us think about the scale here. One hand to hand.

322
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:25,120
Three here. Three props. Three.

323
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:28,440
Okay. Yeah, like prop freak.

324
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,630
You just have to laugh.

325
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:42,700
Yeah, those are all great ones, but probably, you know, single and number of props and ah, we're going to see that on today on this first day.

326
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:47,230
So you're just your vocabulary with art is going to be a lot bigger.

327
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:52,720
Part of the reason for this is there's an extra layer in ah.

328
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:56,800
Okay. So the flow itself is the company makes the props.

329
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:04,330
You use the props. And I am have actually layer because the authorship could be anybody.

330
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:11,380
So an AR user is going to be the package. We're also we're going to call those libraries for for our purposes.

331
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:19,030
Those will be the same thing here. So a user is going to make a package that's like a wrapper that's going to contain a whole bunch of functions.

332
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:23,920
And then you're going to use those. So the analogs A to a proc is a function.

333
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:33,280
These are both the verbs in R, but because these can be made by anybody, they're packaged or wrapped together and kind of in collections.

334
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:39,240
So we have a different one additional layer here. Okay.

335
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:45,549
So another thing that you may notice is that there are many combinations of ways to achieve your goal.

336
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:48,640
And. I think this is one of my favorite things about this class is that.

337
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:54,370
We may have a problem and everybody in the room may go about solving it differently.

338
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:59,230
So don't have a panic if your colleague right next to you.

339
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:02,950
You're working on a homework problem and you have completely different ways of going about it.

340
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:08,200
That's a wonderful thing. So my intention is not to funnel you into one way of coding an hour,

341
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:17,650
but to help you more broadly understand your options for coding and how one way to work yourself through that.

342
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:24,770
Another thing that can be a challenge, because a lot of these packages are made by users.

343
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:32,210
It's relatively easy to make a mistake and not know that you've made one or are not even know why.

344
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:37,450
That's because in SAS they're very good at giving you warning messages, right,

345
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:41,100
and error messages that help you troubleshoot and correct whatever your problem.

346
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:47,720
Here in our very package, the package of somebody that gives you a warning message or an error message,

347
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:54,709
that's what we're really going to rely heavily on our logic checks to try to discern if there's an issue

348
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:59,480
there ourselves or is going to in general assume you know what you're doing and just go ahead with that.

349
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:04,250
So we'll practice practice some ways around that.

350
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:15,870
Okay. So we're going to focus on fundamentals, some foundations in this class, and we're going to learn how to learn new skills.

351
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:20,819
So I want you to be able to go out and find a new package yourself and teach yourself that,

352
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:24,510
because in this class, we're not going to teach you every package out there.

353
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:29,910
But we'll practice how to go about the process of learning a new package.

354
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:35,730
Okay. Okay. All right. Let's jump into more concrete.

355
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:44,880
Here's going to be our studio cloud interface. Okay. So it's going to have an upper left hand side, our overall class workspace.

356
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:49,730
There's going to be this is all going to be at the top of the Web browser.

357
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:54,620
There'll be a button for projects. We'll have a separate project for every class.

358
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:59,960
Okay, so this workspace will be the same for the whole semester or a project for each class.

359
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:04,340
There'll be a tab for members so you can see your name and they're your colleagues names in there.

360
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:09,200
And then the upper right hand corner. This to me, your personal account in profile.

361
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:16,570
So this here's my test account. So now, before a class starts, I can double check and make sure that everything looks the way it's supposed to.

362
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,250
Sometimes my administrator view is different than yours.

363
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:27,380
If we click on the Projects tab, we're going to get a list of all the projects that are there.

364
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:34,580
I have a question. Yes, please. So I'm trying to follow along with you in the queue on this page.

365
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:39,650
When I click on the workspace to have access to it, it says you don't have access to everyone.

366
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:44,060
Yes. The first time you do it, you have to.

367
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:48,770
There's a special link to join the workspace and I have that here on slide.

368
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:53,240
Okay. You're getting to it. Then we can wait till that. Nice one. Yes.

369
00:38:54,180 --> 00:39:00,320
Yeah. So this is going to be the link to all of our projects, the very first time to join our workspace.

370
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:04,520
You have to follow this invitation link. So give that a shot.

371
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:10,280
It's also linked on canvas on our. Activities before the first class.

372
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:17,480
So yeah, if anybody's having any issues joining that workspace, I mean, I'm glad you're following along as we're doing.

373
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:28,790
We can take a hard look at. Yeah, I see that.

374
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:32,640
Okay. Thank you. So sorry. I didn't see that in there.

375
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:40,120
No, this is perfect. We want to be able to be flexible and that when things come up, address that right there.

376
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,510
Awesome. Yeah.

377
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:50,570
So once you're into the project, once you're into the workspace, there'll be a list of projects.

378
00:39:53,380 --> 00:40:00,680
Each. Clark is going to have a project shared by my instructor past, so we'll see Borkowski next to it.

379
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:10,130
So now we'll have like, oh, one introduction. There's one part with our cloud.

380
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:17,000
If if you click on it and you join it, and then I join at that point you out.

381
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:24,350
So only one person can be in the project at once. So importantly, once you get there, you're going to excuse me.

382
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:29,180
I just said, excuse me. Okay.

383
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:32,780
So you're going to click on the copy button and make your own copy.

384
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:39,730
So now you have a copy under your name. So now you can make any edits you want to it and really customize it.

385
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:42,890
I'll be your version. You can take all the notes in it you want.

386
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:48,320
But yeah, if anybody goes in this class, you're going to hunt the next person.

387
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:58,880
So click copy and then you can click to go into your personal project and you can return to this personal one anytime.

388
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:02,180
So if you get interrupted, you can just close out of the browser,

389
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:05,900
and then the next time you come back to the workspace, you can reenter through your personal project.

390
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:13,190
You can also export that. You can download that to your personal computer if you want to work offline.

391
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:23,040
So inside a project. When we get to that, it's going to have we're not four man panels.

392
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:31,020
The first panel in the lower left hand corner. This is our console.

393
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:38,299
This is where we're actually interacting with our software. The top left.

394
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,770
This could be our code editor.

395
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:46,700
So we're going to draft all of our code here and submit it down to the console and our output will will show up up here.

396
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:53,720
If you're using regular art without our studio, you would just have these two panels.

397
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,859
So by using our studio, this unlocks these two extra panels on the right.

398
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:02,140
Well, see, these are very helpful. In the upper right hand corner, this is our environment.

399
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:05,719
This is going to be where all of our data sets are going to be. Right now, it's empty.

400
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:10,210
We don't have any data that's loaded in the lower right hand corner.

401
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:13,250
This is going to be all the files that I've shared with you for class.

402
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:17,389
And you can make all your own new files. And here there's an additional tab.

403
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:20,960
So this is the files tab. It'll open up on those tabs for plot.

404
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:27,720
There's tabs for packages help of your tab. So you've got a lot of things you can click through here first.

405
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:36,650
The basic principles of coding is that you're going to have several roles, so you are going to.

406
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:42,810
Input commands a.k.a also known as code.

407
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:48,390
This is the text and the programing language. So you are going to draft code?

408
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:54,310
Or I'll have drafted some template code for you. Then you have another step.

409
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:58,360
You have to submit that code. We'll also call that running code.

410
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:02,739
Okay. So if you draft this in the code editor, it doesn't automatically submit you.

411
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:10,310
Also, that's one extra set to click to submit and run it. Then our software, the robot is going to do an activity.

412
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:14,630
It's going to process that information and produce some kind of output results.

413
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:20,880
This is also text in our language, and then you as a programmer have a job to try to interpret that pull out,

414
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:25,490
meaning you'll see as this class goes on that the output is going to get increasingly

415
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:31,190
complex and it's going to take your expertize to try to interpret those results.

416
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:40,840
All right. So let's look at that, our console. So this is the lower left hand corner of our RCA Cloud.

417
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:47,720
And I'll tell you what, our version you're running. One thing I want to emphasize is that this is temporary.

418
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:56,600
We generally don't favor what's going on over here. So you don't want to have this be your only location of important information.

419
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:01,280
The output that our is providing is going to be in black.

420
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:07,460
And any of your input, anything you're putting into R is going to show up in Royal Blue.

421
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:15,440
The most important thing here is that this.

422
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:20,610
What is this? This arrow? This is a command prompt.

423
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:24,660
And this is telling you that R is ready to accept new code.

424
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:31,140
If your console is missing, this command prompt is still thinking about the last thing you gave it.

425
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:36,090
So it's not ready to accept new information. You don't take this command prompt.

426
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:39,870
This is provided by R for you. This is an indicator telling you that it's ready.

427
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:46,230
I think I spent my first day. I kept typing that I thought I had to provide that.

428
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:49,979
So, you know, there's things you don't know until you try to figure it out.

429
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:55,470
So just like how you don't type that command prompt, that's just an indicator that R is ready for code from you.

430
00:44:57,100 --> 00:45:00,760
And then when we get into the code editor, this is the upper left hand corner.

431
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:06,340
So where the console is temporary here, the code editor, we can save it and we can hold onto it.

432
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:11,740
And here's how we'll tell our that we want to do some actions.

433
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:18,580
Let's see right here. So you don't know any our code yet or you might know some our code yet.

434
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:24,400
But even if you don't know our code, your brains are very good at noticing patterns.

435
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:29,950
So let's just look across here. Does anybody notice any patterns in this code?

436
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:34,870
This is very similar to the code that we'll use on the very first day right now.

437
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:41,380
But let's see before we even understand anything. Anybody notice any patterns here in the code?

438
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:57,860
Sometimes I just let my eyes kind of relax a little bit, not focus too hard.

439
00:45:58,310 --> 00:46:17,330
What kind of patterns do you notice? Anything with colors of colors, a background, repeating symbols.

440
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:28,000
Anything that you see. Yeah. You said there's a lot of words that are by it's like, hey, wonderful.

441
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:34,650
Yeah. So what we've got are repeating rounded parentheses where these are the type of parentheses you're looking at.

442
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:39,570
And those rounded parentheses are often preceded by either a word or a letter.

443
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:47,670
And any time we see a round in parentheses, the word or letter in front of them is a function.

444
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:51,300
So those are b are verbs in heart. So that's great you're noticing.

445
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:56,520
And the other thing we notice, these rounded parentheses always come in pairs, so there's always a close one.

446
00:46:57,750 --> 00:47:04,170
So we got rounded, parentheses come up a lot and there's usually some text in front and black, and that's going to be our function.

447
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:09,330
Okay. We also notice a pattern then you're curious about if there.

448
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:15,630
One of the members. They are all purple.

449
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:22,520
Yeah, exactly. So we're seeing that based on the type of number letter we're getting different color.

450
00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:29,460
So we noticed here our numbers are coming up on my screen, the royal blue and on their projector, they might be purple.

451
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:33,719
And we're seeing that the numbers are separated by commas in black.

452
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:42,530
Yeah. So to provide numeric information are are going to show them up and you don't have to like change the color of your font.

453
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:47,550
Like it'll do this automatically. It will recognize that you're providing a number and put that blue.

454
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:54,020
Apparently you want notices. Yeah.

455
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:57,739
The different colors in the comments.

456
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:10,880
So it seems like I should like you want to do notes on like you're doing for each color like like exactly our font color is changing and we're

457
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:19,370
noticing that there's things that appear to be notes showing up after hashtags and that font is in like green and we'll talk about that.

458
00:48:19,370 --> 00:48:25,700
So within our our text or anything after the hashtag is a personal note for you are going to ignore that.

459
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:32,569
So you can add as many notes as you want and these are in and after the hashtag.

460
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:37,130
So these in green are all of our notes in the our text itself.

461
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,600
And we'll see out here the ones after the hashtag and ones that are in royal blue.

462
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:47,489
This is for designating like a header to make it. The font like bold and big.

463
00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:52,230
And that's outside of the half hour text. Well, do people notice anything else?

464
00:48:57,170 --> 00:49:01,280
So you can really appreciate that your brain is noticing some stuff even before you know this language.

465
00:49:05,930 --> 00:49:10,070
Some other things I might point out. So we saw that numbers get expressed in blue.

466
00:49:10,850 --> 00:49:16,850
Character information gets expressed in bright green and it's surrounded by quotes.

467
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:21,599
And we notice that there's always two of those quotes. So kind of like the parentheses.

468
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:26,700
If you open up, you've got to make sure you close it. So here I'm providing some text information.

469
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:32,670
You have a speech, Abby and Kelly, and they're all separated by commas, just like our numbers were separated by commas.

470
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:39,810
But here, instead of numeric information, I'm driven, I'm giving character information, and there can be spaces within those quotes.

471
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:49,410
Take on different formats. The other thing I want to make sure you notice is the difference in the background color.

472
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:56,260
So here we have the background colors, gray. This is our actual aka.

473
00:49:57,420 --> 00:50:08,270
For the back room for his wife. This is. This is more of our like no taking area or presentation.

474
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:18,670
So these are like titles out here. So women are the way the software knows, like my code and ah, there's three of these back chicks one, two,

475
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:25,600
three rounded parentheses and tells you we're coding an hour and then it closes it out with three of those back six.

476
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:30,010
So the only time we're actually coding an hour is in between here.

477
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:35,350
We're going to be coding in this style here.

478
00:50:36,730 --> 00:50:41,770
So you you describe here, we've got different colors for comments, code parentheses, we've got quotations.

479
00:50:42,310 --> 00:50:46,360
We're going to use Quarto Markdown, which is the newest style of markdown.

480
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:51,150
Because it's going to include both the code and the output.

481
00:50:51,960 --> 00:51:00,510
This is one of the. Honestly, as a programmer myself and as a supervisor, this is one of my favorite things.

482
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:02,550
So I've come out in the last couple of years.

483
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:11,010
Folks would come to me with code in one file and output in another, and it would be clear that it didn't match up.

484
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:14,610
So maybe it's called version six and output version two.

485
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:22,790
Or vice versa. Now you can fix them together your coding, your output in one document so we know exactly what code produced,

486
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:29,110
what output is really good for accountability and we know what version everything is on.

487
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:34,760
So we're going to be working in this class to produce markdown documents that will contain both our code and our output.

488
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:41,920
I also find it to be helpful for communication with outside audiences because if they ask, you know,

489
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:46,910
What decisions did you make to create this figure, we know exactly right there, or we did.

490
00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:57,420
Okay. All right. If you prefer to close in, just if you want to.

491
00:51:57,750 --> 00:52:02,280
If you say this dial doesn't work for me, I prefer to not look at the output.

492
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:10,469
I just want to store the quote on those files are going to have the extension that capital R so that capital R will capture just your code.

493
00:52:10,470 --> 00:52:18,120
It doesn't save your output. But what we'll be using primarily in the class is that John D to capture both the code

494
00:52:18,130 --> 00:52:24,780
and the output and we'll be producing like publishable reports from this code in output.

495
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:32,190
All right. So when you submit code, that's a process of transferring the code from that code editor to the console.

496
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:36,420
So our nodes, you actually want to run your code. Sometimes I'm just typing things.

497
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:40,800
I don't actually want to run it. So you have several options for submitting that code.

498
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:46,980
One is a key command. So command enter.

499
00:52:48,650 --> 00:52:53,000
My map. I think this is control. Enter on a PC so you can do that.

500
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:55,190
You hit those two buttons after each other.

501
00:52:56,990 --> 00:53:04,800
So control center on a PC, you can also there's going to be a button for run and we can click that and that will run the selected.

502
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:07,910
Right. If you want to use your mouse.

503
00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:12,230
So there is a button for run selected line.

504
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:21,270
If we want to navigate around, we can also copy the code from the editor and paste it in the console and press enter.

505
00:53:21,290 --> 00:53:24,940
All right, so you got a whole bunch of options for how you actually want to submit clip.

506
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:29,640
And all these will run in a line of code where the cursor is located,

507
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:34,380
or you can highlight larger sections of code if you want to run them all together.

508
00:53:37,790 --> 00:53:40,850
Moving around in the upper right hand corner is our environment.

509
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:48,320
This is going to contain all the data sets, all the objects you have currently activated that are loaded and ready to use.

510
00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:54,890
So for example, here I have an object called the F of objects called X, Y and Z.

511
00:53:55,430 --> 00:54:00,770
It doesn't just tell us the names. It tells us what type of information is contained in there.

512
00:54:01,250 --> 00:54:04,520
So if a tiny object X is numeric.

513
00:54:05,270 --> 00:54:09,590
It's full of numbers. Simon objects. Z is character.

514
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:16,190
It's full. It's full of text expressions. So we'll learn to recognize different types of objects.

515
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:21,080
And this will help us orient and figure out what type of information is hidden in those.

516
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:23,440
You can double click on them.

517
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:30,669
So if I double click on this, it'll pop up and I can view the dataset and it'll look kind of like an Excel view with rows and columns.

518
00:54:30,670 --> 00:54:36,069
So it's a nice interface. So we were marching along.

519
00:54:36,070 --> 00:54:38,860
Our view in the lower right hand corner is all the files.

520
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:43,840
So this will be where the code, the data, the output files are that I'm sharing with you all.

521
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:49,750
And you can make new ones. You can double click on these if you want to open them in a new window,

522
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:53,890
if you want to download them and get them off the Internet so that they're on your personal computer.

523
00:54:55,910 --> 00:55:02,150
You can also click this mark and click export.

524
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:05,690
That's another way to get things off the Internet and not to your personal computer.

525
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:11,990
So here's what it looks like when you click more, and the option to click export will be there.

526
00:55:13,870 --> 00:55:18,120
Okay. Another tab beside the files.

527
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:21,750
Tab is the Help viewer. This will be one of my favorite tabs to use.

528
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:28,080
We're going to practice asking our questions so any time we can enter function names in the search box.

529
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:36,270
We'll learn about what package that came from. They'll give us examples so they'll give us all kinds of information how to use it.

530
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:41,790
So there is a really quick whirlwind of.

531
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:51,230
Our studio and its interface. So your job is to draft code and submit it, and then our job is to give you output.

532
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:59,030
We'll give you our studio clap project for each class session. And then in our studio viewer, you have different panels.

533
00:55:59,090 --> 00:56:04,910
You have the console, the code editor, environment, the help viewer, the files viewer, etc.

534
00:56:06,810 --> 00:56:14,880
Right. I am looking at my clock and I think we're going to take our five minute break right now.

535
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:19,950
But before you go on break, just double check that you can get into this workspace.

536
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:23,550
And so we'll be able to view our projects afterwards.

537
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:29,370
So during the break, if anybody's having any trouble joining, please let me know and I'll help you up.

538
00:56:29,610 --> 00:56:33,150
Otherwise, we will be back in about 5 minutes.

539
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:42,770
So. It's.

540
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:17,110
Hi. How are you? Hi. I mean, so what are you.

541
00:57:17,190 --> 00:57:22,280
I'm just going to the house, so it's not really the club, but.

542
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:28,850
Yeah. The first day, obviously, it's a little bit more talking,

543
00:57:29,570 --> 00:57:39,350
but so what we'll do is get into the project that shared their whole goal line by line, talking about lines one through 66.

544
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:41,780
Then we'll come back and do slides again.

545
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:49,070
There's like a couple examples to test your understanding and we'll do about ten other slides and then we'll go back in the code.

546
00:57:49,610 --> 00:57:51,739
So no, we won't have class time for the homework.

547
00:57:51,740 --> 00:58:02,900
But um, so all I'm saying on here then maybe I'm the same thing as the homework working class introduction.

548
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:12,670
So this is going to be the one that we'll work through in class. And I'm glad you can get in.

549
00:58:13,910 --> 00:58:18,440
And I have this as a homework, but I did a regular markdown.

550
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:21,979
But it does come the answers it. Oh, beautiful. Yeah, that's right. Yeah.

551
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:25,280
This has been a track quarter.

552
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:28,910
Just math. About two months.

553
00:58:29,330 --> 00:58:32,270
Okay, so I'm in the process of flipping out my materials.

554
00:58:32,310 --> 00:58:37,370
Yeah, I did see you were telling me that when you're talking about it and its that I needed the new version.

555
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:40,970
Ah. Which is still downloaded across video though.

556
00:58:41,390 --> 00:58:46,410
Yeah. It's um. It's exciting that there's updates all the time.

557
00:58:46,410 --> 00:58:49,580
It's also keeps you on your toes. Right. Thanks.

558
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:53,550
Well, that sounds wonderful. Oh.

559
00:59:21,310 --> 00:59:40,070
She? Ever since the search has to Jewish.

560
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:48,110
Okay. Good.

561
00:59:52,640 --> 01:00:19,130
I. You should continue your.

562
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:50,450
In addition, she'll tell you not to go to school.

563
01:00:51,190 --> 01:01:06,520
And so whatever you need to do, I think that, you know.

564
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:22,010
Yeah. But.

565
01:01:40,860 --> 01:02:42,060
One. But no country like India and China, which should have this new structure, would.

566
01:02:45,210 --> 01:02:56,330
That's what I said.

567
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:25,800
What? All right.

568
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:33,600
Welcome back, everyone. We're going to jump into our studio cloud and start programing.

569
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:41,410
So I am logging into our studio cloud with my test account.

570
01:03:41,430 --> 01:03:47,240
I'm going to click this join button. You want me to do it again?

571
01:04:22,170 --> 01:04:26,370
All right. So, do you want to join the thread? I'm going to click to join it.

572
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:34,280
Get in there. Awesome. Okay, so here's the front page.

573
01:04:35,180 --> 01:04:43,879
It's asking you to confirm it. Here's our class name, Nick Jackson, as the staff member in charge of computing services right now.

574
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:47,930
So the school accidentally let us.

575
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:55,450
Uh, account expires. Now we're under the instructional services professional.

576
01:04:55,600 --> 01:05:00,489
So thank you, Mike Jackson, for solving this problem for us in the last 24 hours.

577
01:05:00,490 --> 01:05:06,549
So we're in here so you'll see next name under here for our workspace under projects.

578
01:05:06,550 --> 01:05:10,300
Right now there's only one, but there will be many more throughout the class.

579
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:15,490
What do you do? Every class I'm here is our a one, our introductory class.

580
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:17,190
If you remember here,

581
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:23,500
there's a one under my instructor account name and we're not going to go in there directly because we'll ping pong each other out of it.

582
01:05:23,770 --> 01:05:33,200
Instead, what we'll do, we'll click the copy button. To make our own copy and now launch into a our own version of this.

583
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:41,220
Where we'll be able to make all the edits we want. And I'm going to encourage you to take as many notes and make as many edits in there as possible.

584
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:49,030
Hello. My sense of supply and feels very official. Everything is working.

585
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:54,520
All right, so talk me through. Is anybody having any challenges getting to this point?

586
01:05:54,520 --> 01:06:00,220
And if you've gotten to this point, how many how many views do how many panels are in your window?

587
01:06:01,310 --> 01:06:05,150
You guys going on that? We only have three right now.

588
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:08,450
I got to tell you, before we even ask, what are we missing?

589
01:06:08,450 --> 01:06:11,540
What do we have here? Do you recognize that? Do any of these look familiar?

590
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:15,770
Yeah. You. What?

591
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:21,400
Oh, no, I was just. Sorry.

592
01:06:28,870 --> 01:06:34,020
Oh yes. So how do we know where the link is to join the other slides open?

593
01:06:34,330 --> 01:06:40,680
That was you. This. I would love to.

594
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:51,440
So your workspace is over there. You can still get to it.

595
01:06:52,430 --> 01:07:02,730
And then again, under projects and so on, I was like, All right.

596
01:07:03,070 --> 01:07:08,990
What are you missing? Are you a fighter? Or better yet, what can you recognize?

597
01:07:11,420 --> 01:07:24,479
See. Well, here I consider most of her front watch panels.

598
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:29,670
Do you have active here? You look familiar.

599
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:36,720
Missing the editor, but nice. We've got our console.

600
01:07:37,350 --> 01:07:41,490
We've got our files and we've got our environment. But the one we're missing is the editor file.

601
01:07:41,910 --> 01:07:45,900
He also reminded me. So on the left hand panel, there's other workspaces.

602
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:51,110
So you might have a personal workspace if you have other other projects you want to work on.

603
01:07:51,390 --> 01:07:57,810
You can see other versions of this class I've taught, so you can navigate to other workspaces here on the left hand panel.

604
01:07:58,110 --> 01:08:04,799
You can also exit out of that to regain some view. If you ever want to bring that back, you can hit these three horizontal things.

605
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:09,390
And then I'll give you this navigator. I'm going to I'm going to try to save a little screen space.

606
01:08:10,050 --> 01:08:16,300
Okay. What version of R is everybody running? What you see up at the top of the console.

607
01:08:20,710 --> 01:08:25,690
Yeah. So we're all we all should be running version 4.2.1.

608
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:30,610
So our versions are always going to have a number and they're always going to have a name.

609
01:08:31,330 --> 01:08:36,790
So this one's about funny looking kid. There's a whole series where every our version was like ice cream flavor.

610
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:44,230
They go through different, different species. You can see this was most recently updated in June.

611
01:08:44,890 --> 01:08:46,910
These are updates that come out by our.

612
01:08:46,930 --> 01:08:52,329
Somebody was mentioning at the break that our was processing them on their personal computer to update to the latest

613
01:08:52,330 --> 01:08:58,570
version of our and you'll see this coming it'll ask you probably every six months to update to the latest version of art.

614
01:08:59,350 --> 01:09:06,520
So if you're working on a personal computer, I think most of these things should work reasonably well on older versions.

615
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:12,940
But you might run into some tweaks that we can help you out there. It also tells you what platform you're working on.

616
01:09:13,540 --> 01:09:16,569
I'll give you a couple of caveats. What's down here?

617
01:09:16,570 --> 01:09:20,380
We see in this little royal blue? What's this thing?

618
01:09:23,340 --> 01:09:28,300
Our era. What's up? And called? It's ready to go.

619
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:31,620
That's our command stop. So our opened up is ready to go.

620
01:09:32,850 --> 01:09:36,300
Our environment is empty. We've got no data. So that's. That's okay. We just started.

621
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:39,480
We've got a bunch of files. All these things that I've shared with you.

622
01:09:39,660 --> 01:09:44,160
So we're going to click on one of these files together. And hopefully when we click on this, we'll get that fourth panel.

623
01:09:44,370 --> 01:09:56,440
We're going to click on the file and the lower right hand panel call 11 67401 plus introduction that q D.

624
01:09:56,940 --> 01:10:01,770
So this is going to be our quarto markdown document. So click on that document file.

625
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:08,550
When you click on that should pop open in the upper left hand corner.

626
01:10:08,570 --> 01:10:14,270
We should get our. We should we should get our fourth panel.

627
01:10:14,270 --> 01:10:18,250
We should get our our code editor. All right.

628
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:22,680
Let's watch for a second to. Right.

629
01:10:24,510 --> 01:10:28,950
At the top of this. There's some quote in between these pink ash marks.

630
01:10:29,250 --> 01:10:36,570
This is this is a markdown. Texas is basically setting up the format of the whole thing.

631
01:10:37,110 --> 01:10:42,060
So we've got our title, The Class, the subtitle of this session, add yourself to the author list.

632
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:46,320
Okay. So another list we can put.

633
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:53,280
Who am I in here as? Molly, the test student. I want you to take ownership over this code.

634
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:55,620
You're going to contribute to it. You're going to add to it.

635
01:10:55,620 --> 01:11:03,659
You're going to take away you're going to make your ad yourself as the author of On This Date is set to calculate today's date here.

636
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:07,080
The format is going to default into making a Web site for us.

637
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:10,680
But if we want, we can make a word document or a PDF if we like.

638
01:11:11,490 --> 01:11:14,130
And this is something called the visual editor. We'll see what that is.

639
01:11:16,050 --> 01:11:22,620
And then on the right hand side here is like basically an outline to help us navigate to different sections of this code.

640
01:11:22,620 --> 01:11:26,400
If you want, we can get rid of that. You want to be able to see a little bigger. Totally up to you.

641
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:30,920
All right. So here's this overall formatting at the top.

642
01:11:31,730 --> 01:11:37,910
And now we're getting into the programing language. This is a visual editor if we want if you want a source code.

643
01:11:38,180 --> 01:11:42,380
So here's like what the output is going to look like when we're all done.

644
01:11:42,590 --> 01:11:44,510
If we click this button for source code.

645
01:11:45,580 --> 01:11:53,080
What we see here is that underlying code that made it so you see here this like in bright blue, I got two hashtags.

646
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:57,490
When I go to the visual editor, we see that that's bolded.

647
01:11:58,330 --> 01:12:08,770
Okay, so just we'll practice this throughout, but the visual editor takes it and gives you kind of it's like the preview version of what

648
01:12:08,770 --> 01:12:12,250
it's going to look like when you polish it and produce that for it for your audience.

649
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:16,960
Right. So here gives a little bit of background. We've seen this all before.

650
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:25,090
Here's a part of this markdown we're talking about at the end when we're all the time, when we're happy with our code,

651
01:12:25,390 --> 01:12:30,790
we're going to push this button called Render, and we'll do that just on the very end.

652
01:12:31,030 --> 01:12:35,110
So run all the code together and produce this beautiful output that we want.

653
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:39,910
And there's some examples of the output over here on the right hand side, but we'll make it ourselves again.

654
01:12:42,530 --> 01:12:49,550
Okay. All right. So getting started with our commands and output, here is the first time where we actually have our code.

655
01:12:50,390 --> 01:12:56,510
All right. So here with a gray background, each time we see the gray background, this is actually our code.

656
01:12:56,840 --> 01:13:03,200
And we notice, ah, because it's got these curly brackets and a lowercase are in it and anything within there is the our code.

657
01:13:03,830 --> 01:13:07,850
Here's a little bit of labeling in the beginning. So we've got some code here.

658
01:13:08,660 --> 01:13:15,750
There's a first time we actually have code. Can anyone remember for me what stuff is there a keystroke or how we actually run code?

659
01:13:15,780 --> 01:13:23,540
Like, how do we transfer code from up here in the code editor down to the console where we're submitting it and actually running it?

660
01:13:23,710 --> 01:13:26,170
We may have an idea of how do we run that code?

661
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:37,490
Yeah, we can do control after command center so we can put our cursor, our pointer anywhere on the fly and hit with me in our control.

662
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:46,210
Enter our command center depending on your computer. When you run that, that's your produce output below that.

663
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:49,330
Kocher. So here I'm just telling it per I'm quote.

664
01:13:50,670 --> 01:13:55,920
What does it do? It actually writes on code below it. So this new white box shows up below the gray box.

665
01:13:56,550 --> 01:14:00,380
And so this is the way we can transparently share information.

666
01:14:00,390 --> 01:14:03,430
And people will see the code. Now we see the output right below it.

667
01:14:03,450 --> 01:14:07,290
So they're stitched together. We know exactly what made that output.

668
01:14:13,380 --> 01:14:19,560
How are we going to where do these code shops come from? How are we going to make a new one of these things to make a new culture?

669
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:23,580
You can go up here and press this green plus button.

670
01:14:25,050 --> 01:14:30,000
Here. I can make some space. I can push this green C plus button.

671
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:34,890
And I'll give me a new one. Okay.

672
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:43,940
If you look at the source code. You can see that you can make these with these back six so you're not you can just do it by your keystrokes.

673
01:14:43,940 --> 01:14:47,650
So I could go back to our.

674
01:14:49,030 --> 01:14:53,740
And then three more back checks. This took me a minute to figure out.

675
01:14:53,770 --> 01:14:59,230
These are not apostrophes. These are back to you'll find those on your keyboard in the upper left hand corner over there.

676
01:15:01,130 --> 01:15:08,060
So you can do you can make a new code chunk by typing or you can make it by clicking that green C plus one.

677
01:15:08,490 --> 01:15:13,370
Okay. So that essentially will give you some space, space to coach yourself.

678
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:20,330
Do you all have a preference for the source viewer or the visual editor?

679
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:24,440
Do you like things under the hood or do you like seeing the more polished version?

680
01:15:24,830 --> 01:15:32,570
This is the first year that I'm visual editor is an available function, so you can kind of see how this field is evolving very quickly.

681
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:41,060
Consumer preference for source, source. Ms. which is like this or visual editor, which is a little bit more polished.

682
01:15:43,030 --> 01:15:47,989
I mean, they both work for you. Lives are comfortable going back and forth so far.

683
01:15:47,990 --> 01:15:52,660
So you can see the back checks and then visual ed.

684
01:15:52,870 --> 01:15:56,110
You can see it looks a little cleaned up.

685
01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:05,010
All right, let's actually do something in this code shop so we can use R as a calculator.

686
01:16:05,370 --> 01:16:09,420
I used to carry around, like, a T 83 calculator to do all my calculations.

687
01:16:09,660 --> 01:16:14,040
We don't have to do that anymore. We are free. We can do this in the in the code chunk.

688
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:19,860
So here, if I want to do some arithmetic, if I want to add two plus two,

689
01:16:20,580 --> 01:16:26,550
I could in addition to doing command enter, I could highlight it and click run.

690
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:36,340
Selected life. And so what do you see here? I ran just one slide, 2.2 plus two, and I get the output of four.

691
01:16:37,580 --> 01:16:46,520
What's this I to the left of this with these square brackets? Well, see, throughout this set, the square brackets are for indexing or position.

692
01:16:47,030 --> 01:16:53,120
So this is saying that the answer to two plus two has a value of four in position one.

693
01:16:54,290 --> 01:16:59,450
We only have one position right now. In the future, we'll have things that are like the size of an entire data set.

694
01:17:00,050 --> 01:17:05,090
So this is just saying this is the output in position one, the future.

695
01:17:05,090 --> 01:17:09,400
We'll have more positions. Right. What's your best guess?

696
01:17:09,670 --> 01:17:14,560
What? What do you think the asterisk means here in our. Anybody got a guess for an asterisk?

697
01:17:15,930 --> 01:17:19,290
Yeah. Those were multiplied. So what do I expect to get here?

698
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:26,780
I'm expecting to get a value. I'll see what I get. Then we get the values and position one.

699
01:17:27,020 --> 01:17:30,560
What do you think this Carrot Top is doing? I've heard facing era.

700
01:17:34,530 --> 01:17:37,830
Yeah. It's exponential. Yes, isn't it? Two to the third power.

701
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:41,370
What do we expect to get? Expect to get eight. That's what we get.

702
01:17:41,850 --> 01:17:48,180
And you can continue to expand on this with like more complex calculations and calculate them throughout.

703
01:17:49,330 --> 01:17:52,330
So here I was running Kolb line by line, one at a time.

704
01:17:53,530 --> 01:17:58,720
If you ever want to run the entire code culture at once, you can hit that play button.

705
01:17:59,230 --> 01:18:01,810
You see that? Maybe.

706
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:08,320
So you had this green play by an elaborate hand corner, and it's not just going to run every line what it's like, it's going to turn all of it.

707
01:18:09,010 --> 01:18:16,460
So you can see here we've got. So here's the first line of code has the value of four.

708
01:18:17,050 --> 01:18:25,120
The second line of code has the value of eight. So all of these this output is going to correspond to the order that you submit the code to.

709
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:33,870
I was going to assume you want to see the result, and I'll put that in the output.

710
01:18:35,070 --> 01:18:41,250
All right. We're going to test their comprehension. All right. So right here, I want you at this test, your comprehension point.

711
01:18:43,130 --> 01:18:48,180
To, first of all, make a code. See if you can remember how to make a coach.

712
01:18:48,350 --> 01:18:56,990
We saw two different ways to do it yourself, a little space for your coach and see if you can type code that can do this arithmetic

713
01:18:57,470 --> 01:19:03,500
here within your coaching and then submit that code so we get some kind of output.

714
01:19:06,380 --> 01:19:11,450
And feel free to work with your neighbors as you certainly are as a community based product.

715
01:19:48,190 --> 01:19:55,310
Next. This.

716
01:20:16,940 --> 01:20:20,050
Week. We have an idea.

717
01:20:20,060 --> 01:20:24,530
How do we get started? How are we going to make a culture? How are we going to do the first step of this process?

718
01:20:25,990 --> 01:20:30,880
This will be directly applicable to your homework. You'll have to make a coaching so that you can do some coding.

719
01:20:32,650 --> 01:20:36,030
Who can talk me through? Usually I start by making a little bit of space.

720
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:41,020
I press enter a couple of times, get myself some room to work, and then what are you going to do to make a coach up?

721
01:20:44,970 --> 01:20:52,950
Yes. I personally think it's perfectly clear that during C plus and now we've got our coach,

722
01:20:52,950 --> 01:20:57,270
although now with our cause, there's a lot of needs are in those curly brackets to get us started.

723
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:11,950
What's the next step we're going to do? How are you going to evaluate the arithmetic that's going on there?

724
01:21:18,830 --> 01:21:25,520
We just start doing what that so the number two how are we going to do a plus in is the.

725
01:21:29,140 --> 01:21:33,150
I guess the plus, I don't know how to say that, too.

726
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:37,090
And then what symbol are you going to use for multiplication?

727
01:21:39,550 --> 01:21:42,820
An asterisk times three.

728
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:47,440
What symbol are we going to use for division? Anybody have a guess?

729
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:51,040
I mean, I think we saw that one. You know, use the backslash.

730
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:56,360
Bye bye. Four minus three.

731
01:21:59,060 --> 01:22:03,560
And then I think I meant this to be set up on a different line.

732
01:22:04,730 --> 01:22:10,730
So here's the first one. We've got a value of point five, and therefore we want to calculate the second number.

733
01:22:11,540 --> 01:22:20,510
We can talk ourselves through that two times, three divided by four times two.

734
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:30,500
I think this is supposed to be an extra line. And then the third one would be a two to the fourth power, minus one.

735
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:36,320
And we want to run them all together. We can hit the plus sign and then we see all of the answers together.

736
01:22:37,070 --> 01:22:44,600
So I just did some spacing and realized the formatting got a little funnier than anybody doing anything different to evaluate these.

737
01:22:46,290 --> 01:22:52,980
Yeah. So just getting a little more comfortable with with how some of these symbols work to do arithmetic in our.

738
01:22:56,820 --> 01:23:01,290
My question is how to try to do more of these.

739
01:23:01,290 --> 01:23:06,599
Check your understandings in the moment, because sometimes I find when I'm listening along, I'm like, okay, okay, okay, I got it.

740
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:11,430
And then you're like, Oh, wait, I got to try this myself. It's not right.

741
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:15,450
But I try to actually work through some of these things.

742
01:23:16,680 --> 01:23:20,790
All right, we're gonna jump back to the slides, and we're going to go beyond.

743
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:33,080
Arithmetic in here. We're going to create some objects. All right.

744
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:38,870
So in this next section, we're going to try to build our first objects where to classify object types.

745
01:23:38,870 --> 01:23:42,920
And our we'll also see on slide version how to use our as a calculator.

746
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:53,910
We'll see how to use some functions to perform actions on data. Objects are a fancy word for anything and are that you want to give a name to.

747
01:23:54,540 --> 01:23:58,020
You can give names to anything really. You can give names to variables.

748
01:23:58,230 --> 01:24:05,890
You can give a name to the whole data set. You can give names to your graphs, your results, anything you want an R,

749
01:24:05,940 --> 01:24:10,890
you can assign a name to it, and it'll immediately become an object once it has a name.

750
01:24:12,450 --> 01:24:20,519
The important thing in art is all of our objects are temporary. And so if we want to save them, we'll see.

751
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:26,730
Eventually, there's like a separate step to make that happen. How do we assign a name to something in our.

752
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:32,960
We don't know what this two character symbol that essentially points to the left.

753
01:24:33,730 --> 01:24:40,240
So this left facing error. You're going to read your code when you're building abstract objects.

754
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:45,040
We're going to read it from right to left, and that can take a minute to become comfortable doing that.

755
01:24:46,060 --> 01:24:51,730
So we're in general, R is going to read your code from right to left across that assignment.

756
01:24:51,730 --> 01:24:54,850
Operator So that arrow helps me remember that.

757
01:24:55,890 --> 01:25:00,210
So for example. There might be some correction.

758
01:25:00,330 --> 01:25:04,920
So here is just the command prompt. I don't take this. This is just are telling me it's ready.

759
01:25:06,030 --> 01:25:09,600
But when I read this quote, I say take the value of five.

760
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:14,120
And I find that as an object, I'm calling you object.

761
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:20,950
So we're reading it from right to left. Take the value of five and I find it as a new object calling no object.

762
01:25:23,300 --> 01:25:27,110
So as I described, here's how our is going to read that from right to left.

763
01:25:28,700 --> 01:25:34,879
If we ask our what is new object? So we just type in new object in the console here.

764
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:40,460
If we ever type the name of an object, we're basically querying our being like, Show me what's inside this object.

765
01:25:42,570 --> 01:25:48,180
It will be hard to say that this new object has the value of five in position one.

766
01:25:49,020 --> 01:25:55,440
So anything in those square brackets is telling us in what position the new object has a value five in position one.

767
01:25:55,710 --> 01:26:02,840
And that matches what we expect to have right there. Value a five position one.

768
01:26:04,430 --> 01:26:07,370
And those square brackets are going to show us what positions they're.

769
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:13,450
There's a couple of rules when naming objects, and you don't have to remember these all now.

770
01:26:13,570 --> 01:26:15,910
You're probably trial and error way through them.

771
01:26:16,570 --> 01:26:24,000
But some of these symbols have specific meaning and are some of them we just saw right here the plus and minus.

772
01:26:24,010 --> 01:26:28,330
But some other symbols have special meaning, like the hash tag, the exclamation point.

773
01:26:28,870 --> 01:26:36,100
So you can't put those in the object name because our will think you're trying to do whatever operation those signify.

774
01:26:37,510 --> 01:26:44,230
You can't put spaces on the object name. So spaces in our in general are ignored and optional.

775
01:26:47,020 --> 01:26:52,550
You can put dots or underscores in your object names and you can start names starting with dots.

776
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:56,860
Some of my colleagues make all their temporary files start with a dot.

777
01:26:59,020 --> 01:27:02,260
Objects can contain a number, but they can't start with a number.

778
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:05,080
As I said, you can trial and error your way through this.

779
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:12,130
One thing that is most challenging for SAS users and during this conversion hour is case sensitive.

780
01:27:12,940 --> 01:27:16,899
So uppercase x and lowercase x are going to be those.

781
01:27:16,900 --> 01:27:18,100
That's completely different things.

782
01:27:19,670 --> 01:27:26,260
So it's not just about the single thing, even if just one letter the case is off, it's going to think there are different things.

783
01:27:28,830 --> 01:27:33,240
Okay. Another tip that I tried on my way out of it.

784
01:27:33,510 --> 01:27:39,419
Don't name an object after a function that you usually use because you might overwrite that function.

785
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:42,360
And then you don't have you don't have that function for use anymore.

786
01:27:42,940 --> 01:27:47,160
Well, I'll show you how to get it back, but this can make you stumble a little bit.

787
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:57,580
There's several different object types in our and they're based on the shape of the data that's in there.

788
01:27:58,450 --> 01:28:05,740
So the type of objects we've been talking about so far and the kind of the introductory objects and are called vectors.

789
01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:15,430
Vectors have data in one dimension. So if you're thinking about like just a single variable in your dataset, that would be a vector.

790
01:28:15,670 --> 01:28:25,350
One sequence of values. Once you have two dimensions, rows and columns, then there's two different data types.

791
01:28:25,350 --> 01:28:30,750
You have a matrix or a data frame. These are very similar to each other.

792
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:40,290
Show you the differences between them. And then this is a little bit beyond the scope of the class, but I just want to let you know that these exist.

793
01:28:40,890 --> 01:28:48,750
There's these umbrella objects called list and ask for objects that can actually contain other objects in them.

794
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:58,860
So you can put a whole bunch of vectors or matrices or combinations of vectors and matrices within a list.

795
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:03,360
So this can be a way for carrying around other objects.

796
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:10,360
So you can objects when an object. Okay.

797
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:15,730
So, for example, let's zoom to those vector objects. Here is a sample of vector.

798
01:29:17,430 --> 01:29:21,180
It's an ordered set of values. Here are some example values.

799
01:29:21,180 --> 01:29:24,240
I have value of 6.2. 9.3, for example.

800
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:29,940
And it's important what sequence they're in or what order they're in.

801
01:29:31,350 --> 01:29:39,330
All of those values have a position. So here's the actual values in blue, and then here's their positions.

802
01:29:39,750 --> 01:29:45,570
So this has the value of 6.2 in position one, the value of 9.3 and position two.

803
01:29:46,170 --> 01:29:55,950
So it matters what order they're coming in. So if we have a combination of a value in a position, you might see these call as elements.

804
01:29:59,700 --> 01:30:04,160
That service can be as long as you have some vectors are over a million values lost.

805
01:30:04,550 --> 01:30:09,230
But the important thing is that they have to all be the same type of information.

806
01:30:09,770 --> 01:30:15,830
So you can't go bouncing around between numeric values like our here and character values.

807
01:30:16,060 --> 01:30:23,750
I want everything in that vector to be the same thing. And we'll spend a fair amount of time in our data cleaning space dealing with this,

808
01:30:23,750 --> 01:30:28,660
because you can imagine if you're collecting data in the field, sometimes somebody enters it, right?

809
01:30:28,670 --> 01:30:32,690
And so you might be expecting a numeric and get some kind of character information.

810
01:30:34,120 --> 01:30:40,300
So what are these types of vectors here? The main types. You can have number information or numeric information.

811
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:49,180
Within their integers if there's no decimal places or it's called double if there are, I don't I don't know why they chose the name double,

812
01:30:49,180 --> 01:30:54,310
but that's just a more inclusive numeric information if there's values after the decimal place.

813
01:30:56,440 --> 01:31:00,150
Character information is denoted with quotes around it.

814
01:31:00,550 --> 01:31:03,880
So it's essentially any free text information you want to provide.

815
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:12,400
Factors are a type of vector. And this is where you have.

816
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:21,140
Only certain designated values are allowed. So you might imagine if you just let people type in free text.

817
01:31:22,910 --> 01:31:29,980
You can get any number of. Things like people heard people misspell something.

818
01:31:30,850 --> 01:31:36,670
So factors constrain the options and you only have a certain number of options you can put in there.

819
01:31:36,940 --> 01:31:43,630
So your options might be high, low and medium, or your options might be Michigan, Ohio, Illinois.

820
01:31:43,960 --> 01:31:51,100
And so factors have a constrained set of options, and you can have a ranking system within that if you would need to.

821
01:31:52,930 --> 01:31:59,649
Logical factors are ones that are are treat as a special class, as a series of choices.

822
01:31:59,650 --> 01:32:04,300
And also you can use this to ask our questions like, is this true about my data?

823
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:09,880
It's equivalent. You can just type the capital team, capital F, you don't have to take the homework.

824
01:32:10,150 --> 01:32:19,900
We'll see. The fat will actually turn purple when you're one that identifies this and then that type of vector I'm

825
01:32:19,900 --> 01:32:25,870
going to put off for a while because these are tricky our dates so we can have date information in there.

826
01:32:26,380 --> 01:32:35,470
So these are matter vectors, could be any of these, but within a single vector it wants all the information to be the same if you have unclaimed data.

827
01:32:35,470 --> 01:32:39,460
So like raw data. That that has multiple types.

828
01:32:40,470 --> 01:32:49,620
I will always defile and coerce or change all of the data to the kind of lowest common type, which is usually character.

829
01:32:50,430 --> 01:33:00,900
So if you provide ah with a million values that are numbers and there's one value that's a letter, that entire vector gets coerce to be character.

830
01:33:01,620 --> 01:33:08,700
So that's why I we'll spend a lot of time on data cleaning. But within that vector, there's positions or index.

831
01:33:08,940 --> 01:33:12,990
So we'll use the square brackets when we want to look around or index within an object.

832
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:20,730
And we can select values based on positions. So for example, if we want to look in an object.

833
01:33:22,420 --> 01:33:27,760
And we want to see what's in position for. So this is telling our look around in that object.

834
01:33:28,210 --> 01:33:36,910
Tell me what's in position for. We can also say, tell me what's in positions three through seven.

835
01:33:37,300 --> 01:33:41,140
So a column will continue counting between those values.

836
01:33:43,510 --> 01:33:46,990
We can also select on value criteria. So for example, up here.

837
01:33:47,680 --> 01:33:55,030
So look within this object and return to me only positions where the value of that object meets a certain criteria.

838
01:33:57,740 --> 01:34:03,980
Whenever there's parentheses of any kind, are always going to read it from the inside out.

839
01:34:04,790 --> 01:34:10,910
So it'll calculate whatever you have in our most first and then do the outermost part and we'll practice talking our way through that.

840
01:34:13,850 --> 01:34:18,770
The second most common type of object we'll use after vectors is a data frame.

841
01:34:19,640 --> 01:34:24,110
This you might think of most analogous to like an Excel spreadsheet.

842
01:34:25,430 --> 01:34:35,870
So this is two dimensions of data values. We've got rows and we've got columns and j and are our thinks of these as columns of vectors.

843
01:34:36,230 --> 01:34:39,860
So you can see within each column I have the same data type.

844
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:45,649
So each column is a vector. And well, these are values in here.

845
01:34:45,650 --> 01:34:48,000
We'll see that each value also has a position.

846
01:34:49,670 --> 01:34:55,200
So the position coordinates before in a vector, we could just give one number because it was only one dimension.

847
01:34:55,220 --> 01:34:59,420
Now we have to get two values because we have to give the rows in the column position.

848
01:34:59,750 --> 01:35:05,300
Like if you're playing battleship, you know, you got to say, like, you need two dimensions of information.

849
01:35:05,690 --> 01:35:11,000
So we have to give the row position. And we have to give the column position.

850
01:35:11,660 --> 01:35:19,390
Otherwise, they won't know which value you're talking about. Something we just have to memorize.

851
01:35:19,410 --> 01:35:25,560
I don't know why they do this, but we still use the square brackets to look inside data frame objects.

852
01:35:26,010 --> 01:35:30,540
But our goals are about the row first and the column second.

853
01:35:32,040 --> 01:35:36,270
So we just memorize that it expects rows first and column second.

854
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:43,319
So like we want it to look in a row for column two that would be in here.

855
01:35:43,320 --> 01:35:47,520
So always give the row, coordinate first, then the column coordinate second.

856
01:35:50,770 --> 01:36:00,010
So for example, to look around as an object here, here's going to show us what's in row two and column three as separated by a comma.

857
01:36:01,630 --> 01:36:06,920
If we if we read one of those out. So then the default is to show us, all of us.

858
01:36:06,970 --> 01:36:12,400
So here I'm saying look at that object. There's no rose specified to show me all rose.

859
01:36:13,340 --> 01:36:21,379
Column three. For practices you can also it's sometimes I forget.

860
01:36:21,380 --> 01:36:28,650
Like what? Column number something is it's easier for me to keep track of columns by their names so we can give names to these.

861
01:36:29,580 --> 01:36:34,410
So in addition to positions, they can have names. So these would be like your variable names.

862
01:36:35,220 --> 01:36:44,490
So a column for size, a column for life, a column for all these different criteria to call something by its name.

863
01:36:45,820 --> 01:36:47,050
We're using dollar sign.

864
01:36:48,200 --> 01:36:57,380
So this would be if I'm pulling out an object called N Hands, which we're going to make and pop, this would pull out just the column called Size.

865
01:36:58,070 --> 01:37:02,300
So this would pull out just this column of the data set here.

866
01:37:03,740 --> 01:37:08,380
All of the rules. So a recap.

867
01:37:08,650 --> 01:37:13,990
We've got some objects. Okay. Are we going to assign objects with this assignment?

868
01:37:13,990 --> 01:37:19,270
Operator? Helps us remember that we are going to read from right to left.

869
01:37:19,450 --> 01:37:25,030
So whatever you put on the right hand side is going to get assigned to the object name you're putting on the left hand side.

870
01:37:26,770 --> 01:37:32,370
Vectors are one dimensional objects. Dear friends are two dimensional objects.

871
01:37:33,730 --> 01:37:37,270
Objects contain values and positions.

872
01:37:37,900 --> 01:37:42,940
So values are what's inside the object. Positions are kind of like metadata on top of that object.

873
01:37:44,820 --> 01:37:48,410
Something you might notice here. You call them names.

874
01:37:49,570 --> 01:37:52,930
Don't count as Rowe One that's different from itself.

875
01:37:53,230 --> 01:37:56,590
So these column names are kind of like metadata on top of the data.

876
01:37:56,930 --> 01:38:09,799
They're not in the Rowe one position. And so our objects are going to we can look at conditions or connect with them with the square brackets.

877
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:12,890
And if we want, we can call a column by name with the dollar sign.

878
01:38:13,430 --> 01:38:17,570
Let's pause there, see how we're doing. What's our situation?

879
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:29,440
What kind of questions do y'all have? All right, well, let's hop back into our code and make some of these objects.

880
01:38:34,650 --> 01:38:40,020
All right, so this way, I'm going to sleep. You can wake it back up, you can reenter your project.

881
01:38:40,830 --> 01:38:44,730
But I want to be in a section of the cover. We're making our first hour objects.

882
01:38:44,790 --> 01:38:48,000
Okay. Right.

883
01:38:49,670 --> 01:38:54,320
All right, so what are we doing here in this first line of code? Can I let him talk me through this?

884
01:38:54,350 --> 01:38:58,460
What? What what do you expect to happen here before we even do it?

885
01:38:59,180 --> 01:39:17,919
What's going on in this first line of code? So this is saying take the value of five and assign it as an object.

886
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:25,450
I'm calling number of apples. So what I expect to happen when I run this, I expect on my first object pop up in our environment.

887
01:39:26,680 --> 01:39:30,399
So let's see if that happens. Or on that I'll hit control.

888
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:41,350
Enter. And when I run that I see with the object called number of apples and it has a value of five if you want to see the output, what does it have?

889
01:39:42,010 --> 01:39:49,510
Double check. What do we get? We can run that line of code. We see that number of apples has a value of five and position one.

890
01:39:50,290 --> 01:39:55,390
That's our expectation. We can create another object here.

891
01:39:55,400 --> 01:39:59,940
I'm saying, what's the cost of an apple? This is saying take the value.

892
01:40:01,410 --> 01:40:04,470
0.55 an assignment to the cost of an apple.

893
01:40:05,220 --> 01:40:08,430
So I'm expecting another object or second object to pop up.

894
01:40:10,810 --> 01:40:14,950
So that has the cost of an apple value value of 4.55.

895
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:24,590
We could calculate tax in our. In our. So to take the value of .07 and assign that as a new object called tax.

896
01:40:28,060 --> 01:40:30,640
So now we've got three objects so we can play around with.

897
01:40:31,790 --> 01:40:39,670
So the benefit of having these objects is now we can combine this with some of the arithmetic we already learned.

898
01:40:40,940 --> 01:40:49,250
So I might multiply the number of apples times because when apple to my expectation, you're going to assign that as another object.

899
01:40:50,030 --> 01:40:56,150
Let's see what we got. Okay.

900
01:40:56,390 --> 01:41:01,040
So you can use this to conduct some of your analysis.

901
01:41:01,400 --> 01:41:04,940
If you don't want to assign it as an object, you just want to see the output.

902
01:41:04,940 --> 01:41:08,000
You can connect your calculations directly.

903
01:41:10,930 --> 01:41:20,380
All right. So combining this principle of creating objects with our operators for plus or minus and multiplication to.

904
01:41:21,850 --> 01:41:31,749
Do some kind of computation in your homework. I'm going to ask you to convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit using some of these principles so

905
01:41:31,750 --> 01:41:38,530
you can make an object for the temperature and then use an equation to convert it to a Fahrenheit,

906
01:41:38,530 --> 01:41:47,290
for example. So far, this is just one value.

907
01:41:47,500 --> 01:41:51,380
Let's make these vectors a little bit longer. Okay.

908
01:41:51,480 --> 01:41:56,129
So let's make the see how long this factor is currently here.

909
01:41:56,130 --> 01:42:00,870
I'm going to ask a question and say, how long is the number of Apple's object?

910
01:42:02,230 --> 01:42:05,770
We say right now this object is only one value law.

911
01:42:07,300 --> 01:42:14,560
But if we want, we can make it a little bit longer. So here I'm saying take the values of one through four.

912
01:42:14,570 --> 01:42:17,920
So one, two, three, four, and that's fine. That's two number of apples.

913
01:42:19,410 --> 01:42:21,810
We already have an object called number of apples.

914
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:27,480
Do you think this is going to air out and say, no, you already have an object or you think it's just going to go right through it?

915
01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:35,420
Hour is just going to go right through, is going to assume, you know, what you're doing, which may mean writing over your dataset.

916
01:42:35,540 --> 01:42:43,609
So here I'm going to assign it and I see that the number of Apple's objects has changed for now.

917
01:42:43,610 --> 01:42:51,980
Instead of being a single value, it's an integer value, has positions one through four and has the values of one, two, three, four.

918
01:42:53,470 --> 01:42:56,500
So it's very easy to overwrite your objects.

919
01:42:56,650 --> 01:43:03,460
And I'm just pointing that out on an early basis because this might come up for you in the future.

920
01:43:04,900 --> 01:43:07,990
So now if we go look at that quote, we can see double check.

921
01:43:07,990 --> 01:43:10,270
This object has the values of one, two, three, four.

922
01:43:12,200 --> 01:43:19,630
There's multiple ways to make this so we can use the combine function to combine one, two, three, four.

923
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:25,270
This object is going to create the exact same thing. So no change in those values.

924
01:43:27,010 --> 01:43:30,280
Pointing out that order matters. So if I provide those values.

925
01:43:31,340 --> 01:43:34,400
Instead of one, two, three, four, five, three, one, two, three, four, one.

926
01:43:35,450 --> 01:43:39,120
And then we get an object with those values in a different order.

927
01:43:39,500 --> 01:43:45,860
Order up to three, four, one. All right, so the values and the positions are both relevant.

928
01:43:47,210 --> 01:43:53,850
Here is an equivalent way of creating that same object, and we'll practice doing this next class, but so we can.

929
01:43:54,020 --> 01:43:57,800
We've got a lot of opportunity for flexibility in our coding here.

930
01:44:02,890 --> 01:44:08,320
Now that we have this longer vector, let's try to do some calculations on it and see what happens.

931
01:44:09,810 --> 01:44:18,420
So if I have a vector with the values of one, two, three, four, and I add the number four to it, what do you think's going to happen there?

932
01:44:18,480 --> 01:44:23,460
Do you think four is going to get added to every single value, every single position?

933
01:44:24,330 --> 01:44:29,210
Yeah. So if we run there, we see now that has a value of five, six, seven, eight.

934
01:44:29,220 --> 01:44:32,560
So we're adding four to every position. Okay.

935
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:39,810
Similarly, we can subtract from every position, we can multiply every position, divide every position.

936
01:44:40,890 --> 01:44:44,760
So performing calculations on this factor becomes pretty quick.

937
01:44:45,030 --> 01:44:50,250
We don't have to ask it to do every vector by default. It's going to run on every every value in the vector.

938
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:54,299
This will actually interesting. We haven't seen this before.

939
01:44:54,300 --> 01:45:05,070
The double equal sign an R is essentially asking R a question Is this object equivalent to this object and our output?

940
01:45:05,250 --> 01:45:08,399
Here's a first time we're seeing a logical argument.

941
01:45:08,400 --> 01:45:12,629
So it's telling us at that first position. That's true. Second position.

942
01:45:12,630 --> 01:45:15,780
That's true. Third position is true on fourth positions. True.

943
01:45:15,780 --> 01:45:23,040
So all the way throughout those are equivalent. This will come up in our research because you might have participants who come to study,

944
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:26,340
visit one and you want to know who also came to study visit two.

945
01:45:26,580 --> 01:45:31,270
So you'll see where do those numbers line up? All right.

946
01:45:32,570 --> 01:45:35,240
So I think what we're going to do is wrap up right here.

947
01:45:35,270 --> 01:45:40,640
You have the skills you need to do the first homework assignment, and I'll show you where to find the.

948
01:45:43,340 --> 01:45:48,260
Okay. So this is here on canvas on our getting started with our.

949
01:45:51,430 --> 01:46:04,510
Exercise one. So there are some four problems here, asking you to create some objects and do some arithmetic on that if you would like.

950
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:09,400
And you do not have to use this. But in our.

951
01:46:10,820 --> 01:46:15,250
Files area. I created a homework one.

952
01:46:16,430 --> 01:46:21,049
Courts are marked down template. So if you want, you can do it.

953
01:46:21,050 --> 01:46:23,480
And here or there is like sections.

954
01:46:23,480 --> 01:46:31,730
It tells you where to enter it or if you want you can start from scratch if you want to practice creating your code and output.

955
01:46:32,300 --> 01:46:35,390
The one thing we haven't done yet is how do we go from.

956
01:46:38,320 --> 01:46:44,400
This card and output to like one of these products we want to create so we can click when we're all done.

957
01:46:44,410 --> 01:46:50,510
When you have all the code you want. We can click the render. It's going to run.

958
01:46:50,530 --> 01:46:54,629
All of the code we have. And pop it up in any screen.

959
01:46:54,630 --> 01:46:58,860
It'll make a tremolo or a word doc or a PDF, whatever you.

960
01:47:03,380 --> 01:47:17,380
Ask for. All right.

961
01:47:17,380 --> 01:47:26,160
So this popped up in a browser. You can see I was able to find it over here in the lower right hand corner and click on that to Val.

962
01:47:26,170 --> 01:47:31,330
So I've got a website that contains all of my problems and the output.

963
01:47:31,690 --> 01:47:39,190
If you want to make it a word document, you just say dot x, render that.

964
01:47:43,790 --> 01:47:47,660
And then we've got a word document for your homework.

965
01:47:51,170 --> 01:47:54,950
So here's all of the problems and code. Same thing.

966
01:47:54,950 --> 01:47:58,640
You can go and do it as a PDF if you have a preference for that.

967
01:48:04,460 --> 01:48:09,020
So you can see I usually go cause line by line, one at a time.

968
01:48:16,210 --> 01:48:20,820
Yeah. So slightly different appearance depending on the software.

969
01:48:20,820 --> 01:48:26,850
You look at it afterwards. But when I'm developing code and observing the alpha, I usually go line by line,

970
01:48:26,850 --> 01:48:31,170
running the code, and then at the very end when I'm ready to turn it into render.

971
01:48:31,260 --> 01:48:33,120
But I don't go back to the beginning.

972
01:48:33,590 --> 01:48:41,610
Read everything that you have, the kind of output product so you can share it with your colleagues or your supervisor or in this case,

973
01:48:41,610 --> 01:48:45,240
with me for your homework assignments. Okay. So that's when you're done.

974
01:48:45,510 --> 01:48:49,680
I'm doing that interactive code and line by line with that render button at the end.

975
01:48:49,980 --> 01:48:57,320
Create one of these items and then we can upload it to my desk for for your assignment.

976
01:48:57,600 --> 01:49:03,000
If you get stuck or if you want to help each other, use that discussion post so that you can.

977
01:49:03,480 --> 01:49:09,990
I assure you all of this, your experience is common and other people will really appreciate it if you're able

978
01:49:09,990 --> 01:49:15,000
to practice and put yourself out there and verbalize when you're getting stuck.

979
01:49:15,660 --> 01:49:19,710
All right. Thank you, everyone, for all of your attention. Stick around.

980
01:49:19,740 --> 01:49:23,310
If anyone has questions or comments, wants to show me what your screen looks like.

981
01:49:23,820 --> 01:49:33,170
But thank you for all your attention today. Our studio does not automatically save for you, right?

982
01:49:33,360 --> 01:49:41,010
Oh, this is a great point. If I make any changes to the code.

983
01:49:42,150 --> 01:49:47,940
Notice all I did was put a spoof. The code turns red and has an asterisk to it.

984
01:49:48,150 --> 01:49:56,250
That means there's unsafe changes. So if I want to see if I can click the same button or click on my cursor control

985
01:49:56,250 --> 01:50:00,870
F and you'll see that a new version gets saved in the lower right hand corner.

986
01:50:01,590 --> 01:50:07,620
If you click render, that also automatically saves stuff. So every time I hit Render, this triggers the black.

987
01:50:07,620 --> 01:50:11,350
So over here I have no new information.

988
01:50:11,370 --> 01:50:15,240
It's in black. So if you see your filing in black, you're good to go.

989
01:50:16,740 --> 01:50:19,010
Great point. Thanks.
