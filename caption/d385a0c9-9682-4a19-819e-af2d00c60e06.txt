1
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:05,520
Well, yeah, I would really like something like that. And for that.

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:11,590
Yeah, that's.

3
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:19,059
Yeah. Okay. Sorry about that. You should have the access to the right slides.

4
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:26,010
I posted the wrong slides for myself as well. Oh, okay.

5
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,309
Lower and make sure. Does everybody see that?

6
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:37,990
I read linked the new slides for other today saying okay, how is everybody doing.

7
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:41,410
It gets ready for a break next week, you know. Okay.

8
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,880
Oh, goodness. Okay. So today will be pretty lecture heavy.

9
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:54,010
Um, we don't really have a case example to go through today, so I want to make sure we get through this,

10
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:00,310
this content and leave just a little time for discussion at the end of,

11
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:06,250
uh, a therapy use for Crohn's disease and pediatric patients, just to talk about some of the efficacy there.

12
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:11,830
And then you guys will be off for, for a little bit of a break.

13
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:20,620
So today we're going to talk about the medical nutrition therapy for diverticular disease and IBD.

14
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:27,370
So hopefully you watch kind of the the short videos and the disease process and do the readings.

15
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:30,910
But if you have questions along the way, just let me know.

16
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:39,129
So the learning objectives for today primarily want to focus on inflammatory bowel disease,

17
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:45,130
but we'll discuss the nutritional implications during and following medical treatment for IBD and

18
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:50,350
briefly describe the utility of exclusive enteral nutrition in the treatment of pediatric IBD.

19
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:58,180
Before we get into that, though, I want to talk a little bit about Diverticulosis.

20
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:02,079
So is everybody heard of this? It's very common.

21
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:08,020
Does anybody have like a family member or friend who's had this or at least had evidence of diverticulosis?

22
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:15,639
Very, very common. I think over 70% of the adult population has some evidence of diverticulosis.

23
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,830
So those kind of protruding little pouches in primarily in the colon.

24
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:26,950
And so those can become inflamed and become what we call diverticulitis.

25
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:31,720
So the more active state of this condition,

26
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:41,260
but really the goal of nutrition therapy for Diverticulosis is to decrease the luminal pressure and promote easier passage of stool.

27
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:45,690
So there's still like determining the etiology, like why this happens.

28
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:53,200
I think we have a pretty good idea that when there's a lot of pressure on the colonic wall from trying to pass hard stools,

29
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:58,330
namely due to constipation, that creates a weakening in the colon.

30
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,080
And that's where we get those sacks that kind of protrude out.

31
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:15,610
Now, a question that comes up is like, does it go away or does it resolve like will those diverticular like receive back to normal mucosa?

32
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:24,400
And I don't know the answer to that. I don't think so. I think that the diverticular are there in the goals and would be to prevent

33
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:29,410
inflammation of those diverticular so we don't get to a state of diverticulitis,

34
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:34,630
diverticulitis. So this is common and relatively benign, I will say.

35
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:40,530
But of course it can lead to diverticulitis. Okay.

36
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:49,829
So basically the medical nutrition therapy would be what if we want to prevent constipation hopefully and promote easier passage of stool?

37
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:54,180
What do you guys think? Oh, well, sure.

38
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:58,890
Go ahead. Okay. So what's the difference between the diverticulitis and what are they,

39
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:06,000
the diverticular or those little, like, sac like protrusions on the wall and then a fistula.

40
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:15,450
A fistula will be an abnormal connection between different either organ systems are often parts of the bowel,

41
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:23,160
so it might be part of the small bowel where it's not normally connected,

42
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,959
that there is like an unnatural connection that happens that can become infected as well.

43
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,820
But that would be different than than this. So this is like a sac that's connected.

44
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:39,630
This is like if you have your colon and then it's just a sack that comes out and then continues on.

45
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:51,510
Yeah. Fiber, fiber. Right. So, you know, that's kind of our go to Amante for Diverticulosis.

46
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:57,299
If somebody goes in for like their annual colonoscopy, maybe they've never had any symptoms,

47
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,330
but there is evidence of diverticulosis that's very common.

48
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:03,840
People find that out and they'll say, make sure you eat enough fiber.

49
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:13,440
That's basically all the information they'll get. But basically a high fiber diet, exercise or physical activity also can help in drinking.

50
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,849
Lots of water can help prevent constipation,

51
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:26,340
which would hopefully prevent worsening of the diverticular and possibly prevent it leading to diverticulitis.

52
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:32,020
Yes. I think it's a question of the last question. Okay.

53
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:36,470
Yeah. So what about so now let's say for diagnosis diverticulosis.

54
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,420
So we have these kind of little facts in our colon which are relatively benign.

55
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:46,760
Should people avoid nuts, seeds and corn?

56
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:52,040
I see some have not done some head shakes. What do you guys think?

57
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:57,300
Yeah. It used to be like and then but you know now that there's.

58
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:05,090
But you should avoid this. Yes. So this was commonly recommended like, oh, you have diverticulosis.

59
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,370
You need to avoid nuts, seeds and corn.

60
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:14,180
Those seeds will get caught in the diverticular and then cause irritation and inflammation and lead to diverticulitis.

61
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:18,350
That was a very common recommendation. And you will still hear this.

62
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:23,720
The GI doctors will still get that information. There's really no evidence to support that.

63
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:29,780
So patients do not need to eliminate these foods if they have evidence of diverticulosis.

64
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:38,719
Now, if they are experiencing diverticulitis, these foods may be irritating in terms of symptoms while they're in in in plain states.

65
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:46,490
So they might want to limit some of these foods during that period, but they don't have to broadly avoid them just because of this diagnosis.

66
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:55,710
So Minty focuses on fiber intake, maybe some probiotic and prebiotic supplementation.

67
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:59,459
Not super strong evidence there, but it could help.

68
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:08,040
It's kind of a low risk intervention. Drinking plenty of water and physical activity is shown to help in physical activity.

69
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:14,940
We'll talk about next week. When we talk about constipation, it can be very helpful with just motility in general.

70
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:25,990
All right. So high fiber nutrition therapy usually involves going 6 to 10 grams beyond the standard recommendation of 20 to 35 grams per day.

71
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,820
So we do want to add fiber to the diet gradually to ensure tolerance.

72
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,400
Otherwise, we can have the opposite effect.

73
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:45,860
Kind of if somebody has constipation again, we'll do a whole little section on constipation, but you add fiber too quickly.

74
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:49,630
It kind of talk about adding more cars to the traffic jam.

75
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:58,629
It can not be pleasant. So we want to do that gradually to ensure tolerance, emphasize sources of insoluble fiber.

76
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:03,550
But actually soluble and insoluble fiber are are both recommended.

77
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:08,770
Insoluble fiber truly adds bulk to the stool.

78
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:16,540
So it's going to help push it up through the the colon where a soluble fiber sometimes is is.

79
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:27,379
Thought of as like a business fiber. So it will be soluble with water and that has different features as opposed to

80
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:31,040
just the insoluble that will just add both to the stool and help it along.

81
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,930
Patients can use fiber supplements, of course.

82
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:43,910
I always like to push it through foods first, but you can use like a psyllium, like Metamucil, those types of fiber supplements.

83
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:48,830
Those can sometimes be helpful because you do have to drink those in a decent amount of water.

84
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,440
So that can help with the hydration component as well.

85
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:59,819
And ensure our recommendations for high fiber are appropriate when other digestive conditions exist.

86
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:07,680
So if they have other things going on, we want to tailor our recommendations for fiber according to the whole picture of the patient.

87
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:13,450
So we can consider adding a probiotic and prebiotic food source.

88
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:19,479
Again, very low risk intervention that may help probably won't hurt evidence on probiotics.

89
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,770
And probiotics just in general is not super strong.

90
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:28,570
We'll talk about that in more detail. But it's, again, probably a low risk intervention.

91
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:38,320
And if you're doing it through foods, that that is also a really low risk way to do it as opposed to just like a probiotic supplement.

92
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:46,550
So as we briefly discussed, restriction of nuts seeds, corn popcorn is no longer considered necessary,

93
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:52,760
even though historically it has been recommended to prevent diverticulitis in those that have diverticulosis.

94
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,430
And there's really no evidence to support that recommendation.

95
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:08,020
And there's there are some really good, long, large observational studies that have helped determine that there's no strong evidence base for that.

96
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:14,020
And we do want to ensure adequate fluid intake as fiber increases.

97
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:20,760
Hey, Ralph, it kind of acts like cement in the in the GI tract.

98
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:25,090
We have to have enough water to help move. Now, that added bulk along.

99
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:37,670
Okay. So what about diverticulitis? So if you're seeing patients in that hospital that have diverticulitis.

100
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:45,560
So notice the difference to eye to eye that involves inflammation of whatever specific organ system we're talking about.

101
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:48,830
So this is like the active inflamed.

102
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:59,060
The active inflammatory response of diverticulosis would be diverticulitis.

103
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:04,870
Diverticulitis. So often if the patient is in the hospital for this,

104
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:10,989
maybe they've had some bleeding and abdominal pain and they determined it to be diverticulitis one time.

105
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:14,390
So loud, just some bowel rest. So they're not going to eat a whole lot.

106
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:21,100
Keep them hydrated for, you know, a couple of days of bowel rest, maybe to allow for some healing.

107
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:26,940
And then what would our recommendations be when we are ready to start nutrition therapy?

108
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:42,860
What do you guys think? So this practice, it definitely differs depending on whether the patient is really symptomatic.

109
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:49,790
It definitely differs if it's kind of like an uncomplicated case of diverticulitis that maybe is being handled on the outpatient level.

110
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:56,110
But we'll talk more of like if they're in the hospital and I mean.

111
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:07,200
Yeah. That's, that's usually what we do. We give like a couple of days of nothing, maybe like a day or two.

112
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:13,230
And then we start like with just some liquids. So you will, you'll see patients are often started on a clear liquid diet.

113
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:18,510
Make sure that they're tolerating that, okay. And that their symptoms are improving.

114
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:23,280
And then we're slowly going up against low fiber, softer foods.

115
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:32,849
So this is a little bit confusing for patients because they have diverticulosis and they've always been told they need high fiber.

116
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:37,290
Right now they have this period of active inflammation of that particular itis.

117
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:43,680
And we will say we want to do lower fiber foods initially while they're still active inflammation.

118
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:50,639
Does that make sense? This is just going to be less stress and less work on the GI tract.

119
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:57,090
If we're not dealing with a lot of fiber and it can allow softer foods and it can allow for better healing.

120
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:03,780
So what do kind of low fiber or soft foods until inflammation and bleeding are no longer addressed?

121
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:10,260
And then we want them to slowly transition back to a high fiber maintenance diet.

122
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:17,700
Okay. So low fiber at first while they're kind of in an active state of disease and having symptoms.

123
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:25,559
And then once they're kind of out of this big risk of inflammatory, of having inflammation and potentially bleeding,

124
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:30,389
once that's improved and their symptoms have resolved or have gotten significantly better,

125
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:35,070
we'll move towards a high fiber diet again, of course, with adequate fluids.

126
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:40,860
So there is a different approach to diverticulitis in the outpatient setting.

127
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:45,060
Sorry, this has a typo and I don't think you guys have this on. I just added this.

128
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:52,379
If somebody has diverticulitis as an outpatient and they're just it's relatively uncomplicated,

129
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:55,770
meaning they're they're able to tolerate foods, they're not bleeding.

130
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:03,660
It's not like severe pain. There's really no evidence for dietary restrictions in acute, uncomplicated diverticulitis.

131
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:13,020
So some can just contain or maintain on a regular diet and kind of adjust maybe some foods here or there that tend to worsen symptoms.

132
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:21,480
But we don't have to do that. Conservative approach, if they're on an outpatient level, relatively uncomplicated.

133
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:29,520
But still pretty, pretty consistent. A lot of institutions will start with us.

134
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:35,829
So nothing by mouth. Then start some liquids, low fiber for a couple of days.

135
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:40,870
And as symptoms are resolving, they'll transition back hopefully to a high fiber diet.

136
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,010
Okay. So just a brief overview of these diverticular conditions.

137
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:56,640
It's generally accepted that high fiber nutrition therapy is going to be recommended for patients with evidence of diverticulosis.

138
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:02,250
They don't need to avoid nuts, seeds, popcorn, hulls, all that.

139
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:07,770
It's not been shown to be necessary, although some people, if they find those foods to be problematic,

140
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:12,540
of course they can restrict those or lower the amount they consume.

141
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:22,559
Efficacy of diverticulosis and diverticulitis, nutrition therapy and intervention can be assessed by monitoring the following,

142
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:29,730
so making sure they're adhering to their high fiber, adequate fluid diet, staying active within limitations.

143
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:33,690
This is for Diverticulosis. We want to prevent cancer patients.

144
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:41,370
We talk a lot about how often folks are going to the bathroom, consistency, all that,

145
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:51,870
and then prevention of occurrence or recurrence of diverticulitis symptoms is the goal of the whole diet staying on high fiber, adequate fluid?

146
00:15:54,360 --> 00:16:00,510
The same. Many have questions about how we would approach a patient with diverticulosis or diverticulitis.

147
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:11,989
You feel comfortable with the diverticulitis component where it is initially probably low fiber,

148
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:15,440
but then eventually will transition to a high fiber maintenance diet?

149
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:16,370
Okay.

150
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:23,600
Sometimes that is confusing for patients because we give them both information because they're going to leave the hospital and we want to set them up.

151
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:29,200
And it can be quite confusing at first. Okay.

152
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:36,830
So I want to spend most of our time today talking about medical nutrition therapy for inflammatory bowel disease.

153
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:43,909
So these patients are considered to be at a significant nutritional risk, and there is many reasons for that.

154
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:49,880
And it's often related not only to the disease process, but also potentially to the treatments involved.

155
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:56,620
It's estimated that 60 to 75% of patients with Crohn's disease will experience

156
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:03,570
malnutrition at some point throughout their their disease process and children.

157
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:09,140
So Crohn's disease can be diagnosed relatively young.

158
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:14,469
Both can. But ulcerative colitis, we do see some some diagnoses later in life.

159
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:21,940
But inflammatory bowel disease is often diagnosed either in early adulthood or sometimes even in children.

160
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:30,010
And when kids are diagnosed with IBD, they're especially at especially high risk for decreased bone mass and growth stunting.

161
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:35,829
And that can be due to the use of steroids or the type of medication that's used to combat.

162
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:43,300
Inflammation does affect bone mass and also can affect linear growth velocity.

163
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,950
So children are especially at high risk for nutritional issues.

164
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:56,540
Our primary goal is to restore and maintain the nutritional status of our individual patients,

165
00:17:57,050 --> 00:18:05,780
and that may involve admitting to specific foods, dietary supplements, potentially vitamin and mineral supplementation.

166
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,480
There may be a role for enteral nutrition,

167
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:17,840
as we'll discuss briefly and some that may be have more complicated helped in Crohn's disease and maybe extensive follow section.

168
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,450
There may be a place for parental nutrition,

169
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:26,540
either total parental nutrition or a kind of supplement only in addition to what they can tolerate orally.

170
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:39,470
We'll talk a little bit later, as I mentioned about this, the role of exclusive enteral nutrition or even for Crohn's disease.

171
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,710
Has anybody ever heard of this? Okay.

172
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,260
Well, we'll do a just a brief introduction to the evidence behind this.

173
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:52,540
And again, primarily, it's used in pediatric population.

174
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:56,800
And we'll talk about what what the findings have been in the adult populations.

175
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:08,890
Okay. So IBD can be difficult. As you'll see, we don't really have, like, an Ivy League diet.

176
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:17,110
It's very individualized. Often it's symptom based that our recommendations will be based on the patient's individual symptoms,

177
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:22,620
and patients can carry misconceptions regarding the role of food and their symptoms.

178
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:32,110
Um, definitely that is true. So there is no single dietary regimen for reducing symptoms or decreasing flare ups in inflammatory bowel disease.

179
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:38,600
Diet and specific nutrients play a supportive role in maintaining nutritional status,

180
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:44,200
limiting symptom exacerbations and supporting growth, especially in our pediatric patients.

181
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:51,890
So what does it mean to say that diet and certain nutrients play a supportive role in inflammatory bowel disease?

182
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:05,420
So this is an underlying inflammatory condition.

183
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:11,930
So medically, it needs to be treated. And often there's there's a whole spectrum,

184
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:19,730
an algorithm of the types of medications that patients will be put on to control that underlying inflammatory process.

185
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:30,350
Sometimes there may be decisions for surgical intervention, but nutrition foods don't cause inflammatory bowel disease.

186
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:40,520
Yes, they can exacerbate symptoms. But really, it's this underlying disease process where in some cases, no matter what the patient would eat,

187
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:44,540
they're still going to have symptoms and they still might have active flare ups.

188
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:49,429
So it is more of a supportive role in that we try to maintain nutritional status

189
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:54,500
while not exacerbating symptoms when they are in a state of active disease.

190
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:05,060
Okay. So individuals with IBD, particularly those with Crohn's disease,

191
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:10,980
are at risk for a variety of nutritional deficiencies, and it could be due to various reasons.

192
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:14,210
So maybe it's decreased nutrient intake.

193
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:23,210
There could be a degree of malabsorption depending on the state of the intestine where they have the disease process happening.

194
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,650
They could have increased energy expenditure, increased losses,

195
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:33,650
or they may have a history of bowel resection that is has removed certain absorptive sites.

196
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:40,700
So the most common deficiencies we see in IBD tend to be iron, vitamin D, vitamin B12 and zinc.

197
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:48,740
However, they could have deficiencies or insufficiencies in in both macro and micro nutrients.

198
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:59,480
Some of these micronutrient deficiencies are more prominent at disease diagnosis, while others may persist or even worsen during treatment.

199
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:06,530
So some of the medications as well can potentially worsen an already deficient state.

200
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:13,309
Yes. On her leg. Its currency is one of the things that's like under the umbrella of IBD.

201
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:16,450
Or are there other things under IBD or so? Yes.

202
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:23,650
For purposes of this class, when I refer to IBD, we are specifically talking about Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.

203
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:30,190
So Crohn's disease predominantly affects the small bowel and sometimes the colon.

204
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:37,000
Usually it's like the ilium and the colon. For most people, ulcerative colitis is specific to the colon.

205
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:43,990
Okay, so those when we talk about IBD, that's what we're talking about is Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.

206
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:57,460
Okay. So we talked about several factors can contribute to deficits in energy and protein intake in IBD.

207
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:04,480
Patients with active disease often have reduced nutrient intake due to anorexia.

208
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:13,900
So they just they very poor appetite due to their symptoms not feeling well if and that is really associated with disease activity.

209
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:20,800
So it may be mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines that are being released during this active disease process.

210
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,290
So it's not that they just don't want to eat because they're not feeling well.

211
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:32,730
There is actually some evidence that that inflammatory response that is occurring can suppress the appetite as well.

212
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:41,740
So you'll see that other things can happen. Patients often have a fear of eating because they feel so poorly, and maybe eating makes them feel worse.

213
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,540
Definitely nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain.

214
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:53,080
Some people have constipation. So it's very it's very individualized what types of symptoms they'll experience.

215
00:23:54,280 --> 00:24:01,179
Many patients are on very restrictive diets, and that's a lot of times of self prescribed.

216
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:05,320
Or maybe they found something on the Internet, like tried this elimination diet.

217
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:11,080
That's very common. A lot of medication side effects potentially.

218
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:16,510
There's risk for bacterial overgrowth, especially in our Crohn's disease patients.

219
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:22,180
And then their vitamin and mineral needs may be maybe increased.

220
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:32,170
Again, some Crohn's disease or even oral ulcerative colitis patients may undergo surgical resection to remove disease part of the bowel.

221
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:37,900
So there's lots of things which may lead to increased nutrient needs for healing.

222
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:43,210
So there is a lot of factors that can affect nutritional status.

223
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:47,559
So just a quick word on the bacterial overgrowth.

224
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:56,049
I'd say this is this would be more common in Crohn's disease, but it could happen in ulcerative colitis.

225
00:24:56,050 --> 00:25:01,150
So has anybody heard of Zebo, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.

226
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:07,510
So it's just essentially a form of microbial dysbiosis where there's an overgrowth of bacteria

227
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:12,970
in the small bowel that can cause symptoms of bloating and abdominal pain and maybe diarrhea.

228
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:20,710
So essentially there is excessive proliferation of colonic bacteria that can infiltrate the small bowel

229
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:28,570
and that can be that can happen due to the disease process that's happening in inflammatory markers.

230
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:37,060
So maybe there's impact on gastric acid secretion that allows that proliferation from the colon into the small mammal.

231
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:44,770
Yes, it can. That cause the abscesses. The C I don't know.

232
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:49,509
That's a good question. If there is a fistula, I would think so.

233
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:54,729
If there's translocation of bacteria, that's a good question.

234
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:58,180
And we'll have in a couple of weeks a GI dietitian,

235
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:05,500
a good friend of mine and kind of the GI dietitian at the hospital come in and talk about the low fodmap diet for IBS.

236
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:09,490
And she knows a lot about zero, too, so that that might come up as well.

237
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:15,020
That's a good question. Okay.

238
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:21,020
So this is specific to, well, both I guess Crohn's disease,

239
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:27,049
again can affect any part of the small bowel is actually can affect anywhere in the GI tract.

240
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:32,780
It's less common that we see it in the upper GI tract, stomach and esophagus, but it can it's possible.

241
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:41,510
Usually it's located in the small bowel, um, with a majority of patients that experience Ilio clonic disease.

242
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:45,920
So parts of the ilium and colon will be affected. So disease location matters.

243
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:54,829
The risk for specific nutrient deficiencies is related to the location and extent of mucosal inflammation within the intestinal tract.

244
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:57,800
So for thinking, for example, the terminal ilium.

245
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:11,150
So when I use the terms proximal and terminal or proximal and this also proximal would be like the upper part of a certain intestine or organ system,

246
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:16,219
distal or terminal would be toward the end of that organ system.

247
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:26,240
So we're thinking in the terminal. Ilium So near near the end of the ilium where we connect to the colon, if a patient has active disease there,

248
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:33,740
that may lead to deficiencies of vitamin B12 and or fat soluble vitamins if it's in the proximal small intestine.

249
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,299
So the upper part, the duodenum,

250
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:46,190
maybe the upper part of the tuna active disease may interfere with calcium and iron absorption if they have the diffuse small bowel disease.

251
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:50,300
So a great proportion of their entire small ball is affected.

252
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:57,079
This is often considered like extensive disease with profuse diarrhea that can lead

253
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:01,490
to zinc deficiency other than vitamins and minerals we lose in the stool as well.

254
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:09,800
And then severe colonic disease. So colon mucosal ulceration may lead to ongoing blood loss and that can cause iron deficiency.

255
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:20,210
So those are just some examples of why maybe the state of disease or the location of their disease matters.

256
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:28,330
Okay. So let's kind of go through the medical nutrition therapy considerations.

257
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:37,010
So in our patients with IBD and I'm talking more generally like ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease in general,

258
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:40,950
and we'll get a little bit more specific later.

259
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:48,530
I would say in general, the protein requirements are going to be increased if they're in a state of active disease.

260
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:54,200
And those are typically typically the patients that we see in the hospital.

261
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,579
They're there for a reason.

262
00:28:55,580 --> 00:29:04,130
They're probably having signs of what we call flare up or active disease because Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis can be in states of remission,

263
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:10,850
especially ulcerative colitis. Patients can go years in a state of remission where they're not experiencing symptoms.

264
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:18,110
Usually that time they are maintained on a strict medication regimen, but they may be just fine.

265
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:25,010
So they kind of ebb and flow through like seeds of remission and states of active disease.

266
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:29,930
And these are the patients we'll see in the hospital. They're usually in the midst of what we call a flare up.

267
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:41,600
So the degree of the protein requirement or the increase is really dependent on the severity of the disease state and the restoration requirements.

268
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:46,159
So let's say it's a surgical patient that recently had a bowel resection.

269
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:52,700
Their needs are going to be higher because they are going to need some sort of excess or additional protein for healing.

270
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:57,260
So we'll consider like the whole state of their condition.

271
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:08,170
Inflammation and subsequent treatment with corticosteroids do induce a negative nitrogen balance and that can result in the loss of lean body mass.

272
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:16,800
So we know the inflammatory response. Even at this level, we're not going to talking about the same level that Anna spoke of.

273
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:23,770
But this is an inflammatory disease, so that can have effect on protein catabolism.

274
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:29,710
And then you throw steroids into that. And steroids can also can induce a negative nitrogen balance.

275
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:41,070
So protein needs, maybe, you know, these are just some some quick guides, but of course, it will be dependent on your your patient.

276
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:48,270
But if we think of adult maintenance needs at around point eight or one gram per kilogram of body weight,

277
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:55,170
these would be higher maybe 1.3 to 1.5 to maintain or prevent loss of lean body mass.

278
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,919
And it may be higher in those that we're trying to kind of replenish.

279
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:03,809
So maybe a surgical patient would be 1.5, 1.82 grams per kilogram.

280
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:11,350
So they are considerably higher in these patients. All right.

281
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:18,520
So patients with IBD are at a higher risk for deficiencies of several vitamins and minerals.

282
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:23,889
But we often see calcium, vitamin D, B12, iron, zinc, magnesium.

283
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:27,730
Those tend to be ones we see a lot more often.

284
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:33,820
So supplementation of vitamins and minerals may be required due to malabsorption.

285
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:44,980
It could be inadequate intake or possibly due to some drug nutrient interactions that may prevent optimal absorption of certain vitamins.

286
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:50,140
A lot of patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.

287
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:55,810
A key symptom is diarrhea will define diarrhea in a couple weeks,

288
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:02,230
but it's usually like her or ulcerative colitis patients are going ten plus times a day.

289
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:08,440
I mean, they're just totally depleted. So we know that we can lose nutrients in the stool.

290
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,980
So we do see increase losses of zinc to selenium.

291
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:15,579
So they are for anybody with excessive or prolonged diarrhea,

292
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:23,890
will be at risk for for increased losses of those vitamins and minerals if they have bleeding like.

293
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:32,860
So if they're having ulcerations that are also bleeding, they're going to be may need additional iron supplementation, B12,

294
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:41,530
folate, you know, kind of our our vitamins and minerals that can be associated with nutritional needs because they're bleeding.

295
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:48,959
And then often so steroid use is going to be intermittent.

296
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:54,140
Patients are often going to be on prolonged long term use of oral corticosteroids.

297
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:58,379
So but if they're in an acute inflamed state in the hospital,

298
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:03,870
a lot of times they'll be certain on steroids for a short period of time to really bring down that inflammation.

299
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:10,380
So intermittent use of steroids often requires supplementation with calcium and vitamin D.

300
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:17,430
So we see bone density and vitamin D levels are routinely monitored in our IBD patients because they

301
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:25,050
are at increased risk for osteoporosis because of the fact that steroids can have on bone health.

302
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:36,960
So steroids are a wonderful medication, but they have some really nasty side effects of the use very carefully and try to really avoid overuse.

303
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:44,650
But they do help. Significantly in states of acute inflammation.

304
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:56,520
Okay. So why do you think patients with IBD often become frustrated with trying to manipulate their diet to control symptoms?

305
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:07,740
What do you think? Let's start back here. It's well, it's frustrating because it's like you don't know when you go to eat something.

306
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:11,460
You don't know if it's going to cause a flare up and if it does cause a flare up.

307
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:18,570
Sometimes you can't pinpoint what it is. And then also you just can't eat like everybody else.

308
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,780
Yes. Yeah. What else? What other thoughts?

309
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:25,950
Yeah, similar. I was just thinking, like, how about you were saying earlier?

310
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:32,319
Like, people look online and try like various diets and that can get really exhausting to try different things to get your hopes up.

311
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,830
The things that may not work. Yes, absolutely. I experience that all the time with the adult patients.

312
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:44,630
I see. Oh, we don't really know what's going to help and that's not going to help.

313
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:50,890
So. You can just feel like you're upset about something that might make you feel better.

314
00:34:52,850 --> 00:35:03,959
But. Yes, it's super frustrating for patients because there is not like an IBD diet and it is so individualized.

315
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:13,650
Like what works for some patients to help either manage or not, at least not worsen symptoms may not work for the patient next to them.

316
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:21,959
So it is it's a lot of trial and error, trying to pinpoint maybe which foods hurt or help.

317
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:26,010
And again, the underlying disease process is really what drives the symptoms.

318
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:34,110
So diet is not going to control things when you're in a state of active disease, really.

319
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:40,600
In some patients, again, it's like no matter what they have until we get that information under control.

320
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:51,910
And usually the medication management, the diet component is not it doesn't matter, but it's it's hard to really shape that to control symptoms.

321
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:56,540
Yes. Somebody.

322
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:03,970
Yeah, that's it. That's a good point. So.

323
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:15,809
Foods that they may be tolerated really well last week or a year ago may now not be as tolerated so like these will be calling safe foods are like

324
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:24,389
your I always try to establish like a poor diet for my patients like something we can always go back to that we know is pretty well tolerated.

325
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:30,299
And sometimes even those things, certain foods and that kind of poor diet maybe don't always work.

326
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:36,850
So it can it can change over time. Okay.

327
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:39,940
So, again, it's very individualized.

328
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:49,860
Patients with rapid intestinal transit or extensive bowel resections or that have more extensive or diffuse small bowel disease,

329
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:57,190
this would be specific to Crohn's disease. Also, absorption may be compromised in these patients.

330
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:03,159
Now, some always work individually excessive intake of lactose.

331
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:12,610
If they don't tolerate lactose well, fructose or sorbitol may contribute to abdominal cramping, gas and diarrhea.

332
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:20,110
What do we do? We know? And what do you guys know about lactose, fructose and sorbitol?

333
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:26,500
In the context of maybe somebody that has rapid intestinal transit or has bowel resections.

334
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:36,170
Yes. Well, that's.

335
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:43,700
Yeah. A little bit. Yeah.

336
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:49,300
What are these things? Lactose sorbitol. Sugar.

337
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,790
Sugar, right? Lactose.

338
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:57,230
Really? If only if they don't tolerate lactose and it's poorly absorbed,

339
00:37:57,230 --> 00:38:04,010
that's going to exacerbate some of the symptoms that may already be present with, like, rapid intestinal transit.

340
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:14,850
Fructose is the sugar found in many fruits. All of us probably to some degree, have a little bit of fructose malabsorption.

341
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:25,260
So it's it's poorly absorbed anyway. So then when you add it on top of what's going on here, potentially that can worsen symptoms for folks.

342
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:33,830
And then Sorbitol is a sugar alcohol that has a laxative effect and acts like a laxative.

343
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,510
So that's going to just promote that process even more.

344
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:46,290
So these things are going to cause the sentence, but they could exacerbate them and worsen things like cramping, gas and diarrhea.

345
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:59,640
Yeah, I think we learn something in 630 about because a lot of the water that is now so fructose can draw water into the women of the intestine.

346
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:06,360
And let's say if you're already losing a lot of water due to the rapid transit, that's going to make things worse.

347
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:15,399
So lots of diarrhea. If for some people that maybe have signs of fat malabsorption, also known as DARPA,

348
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:21,010
which will discuss high fat foods, may worsen that so may worsen those symptoms as well.

349
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:30,170
So let's look at our foods. High in fructose, of course, things like high fructose corn sirup.

350
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:35,900
It's telling us it's high fructose, but even things like honey agave.

351
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:42,760
Does anybody ever eat like five one bars or any?

352
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,850
Have you ever eaten too many fiber one bars? All of high school?

353
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:56,330
Yeah. So then you're like, you know, so this is like the chicory root of the inulin they add to, like, nutritional bars to get more fiber.

354
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:02,030
You eat too many of those. Any of us are going to be running to the bathroom because they're not absorbed.

355
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:09,889
You know, they're they're they're going to cause you to go so weak based products can have fructose and then certain vegetables like.

356
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:13,670
And Emily will get in much more into the Low-Fodmap diet.

357
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:19,250
But you'll see various fruits and vegetables will naturally contain fructose.

358
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:23,360
So these are wonderful foods, but for some, they may worsen symptoms.

359
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:29,489
Okay. So this would only be specific to patients.

360
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:36,270
If we felt like their symptoms were worsened by fructose, would we want to maybe not avoid all these foods,

361
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:39,270
but look at their diet and see if we could limit the amount?

362
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:44,400
Only if it seems to help. Okay, so what about fat?

363
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,360
Because these patients are often malnourished. We don't want to limit the calorie source.

364
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:54,180
But in cases where fat malabsorption is present and that's known as the other,

365
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:59,640
are avoiding very high fat foods or like fried greasy foods could be helpful.

366
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:03,030
How do we know if Seattle area is present?

367
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:08,460
Well, often, you know, we do need to talk about our patients, to talk to our patients about what their stool looks like.

368
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:13,740
Guys will get really comfortable talking about bowel movements as a dietician.

369
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:19,590
So you have a real you can actually visually see the presence of fat in the stool.

370
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:23,070
So there may be an oily appearance or oily appearance.

371
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:29,040
It may be yellow in color. Oftentimes they might the stools might float.

372
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:39,990
And I know this is unpleasant for early in the morning, but there is a very distinct odor to fat malabsorption in the stool.

373
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:46,210
So we can't assess for that. There's also fecal fat tests that are that can be done clinically.

374
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:51,970
They're very difficult to collect and ascertain, but sometimes even just taking that history can be helpful.

375
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:58,129
Yeah. Oh.

376
00:41:58,130 --> 00:42:02,720
So if they took pancreatic enzymes to help with fat absorption, they might.

377
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,830
If there is evidence of this, they may have to take outside replacement.

378
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:12,070
And that could be due just to the intestinal the rapid transit.

379
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:17,440
So there's not enough time to have contact. So they might take a supplement that can help.

380
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:27,860
So medium chain triglycerides or mcts may be useful in adding calories and serving as a vehicle for fat soluble nutrients.

381
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:34,700
Why might M.C. Keys be useful in persons with fat malabsorption?

382
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:42,070
We'll get into this in a couple of weeks. But you probably if you remember, probably from Dr. Burgess Clarke.

383
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:46,780
What is it about medium chain triglycerides and how they're absorbed?

384
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:57,709
Yeah. Right.

385
00:42:57,710 --> 00:43:04,340
Exactly. So they don't have to be transport packaging to microns and transported to through the lymphatic system.

386
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:09,859
They're absorbed directly into the intestinal cells and transported directly to the liver.

387
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:11,870
So highly absorbable.

388
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:23,059
So that's a good idea in theory, you know, add more entities that's more difficult in practice, like to use like a hospital grade and seed oil,

389
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:32,180
you know patients up to that a lot and other oils that are high intensities also have other saturated or unsaturated fatty acids in them,

390
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:41,660
not just medium chain triglycerides. So good idea in theory because they would be better absorbed, but it may be more difficult in an actual practice.

391
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:53,310
Okay. What about cyber? We talked about a lot of times symptoms are cramping, diarrhea, abdominal pain.

392
00:43:54,060 --> 00:44:01,890
Fiber sometimes can worsen all of those things. Just because it's makes the body was really hard to break down and pass it through.

393
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:09,719
So fiber is really only from only it's recommended only to restrict fiber during acute exacerbation.

394
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:15,390
So if a patient is prone to strictures, we may have to they may have to follow a low fiber diet more indefinitely.

395
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:24,720
But this is more of something like kind of like diverticulitis, acute avoidance, and then eventually trying to add some fiber back into the diet.

396
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:34,110
So if you go have patients increase their fiber gradually, we want to avoid exacerbation of symptoms by adding things back too quickly.

397
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,989
Okay. So hopefully you did the reading.

398
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:47,010
But what did the book say about probiotics and prebiotics in this population?

399
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:59,880
Are they helpful? Yeah.

400
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:08,000
Think probably are. If you can't get the four, that's the best anyway.

401
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:15,020
Like you need to be bad. Yeah.

402
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:18,660
So in theory, we would think he's somehow really helpful.

403
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:25,560
So what the research has really found is that they may probiotics and prebiotics may be useful

404
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:31,240
in induction and extension of remission in adult and pediatric ulcerative colitis patients.

405
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:34,800
So that's really where the best evidence is, is in ulcerative colitis.

406
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:38,610
And we don't have a lot of evidence that they're useful in Crohn's disease.

407
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:46,410
That doesn't mean that you can't use them, it's just that there's not a strong evidence base to support that recommendation.

408
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:54,720
So for patients with ulcerative colitis, some probiotics, so they have a couple of strains that they've looked at to show promise.

409
00:45:55,110 --> 00:46:00,960
But no preparations have been validated for clinical use for patients with Crohn's disease.

410
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:09,240
The available data do not support clinical effectiveness of probiotic therapy for either induction or maintenance of remission.

411
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:18,370
So there still could be a benefit. It just hasn't really been detected in in clinical trials yet.

412
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:29,750
So this is the third or fourth course and they could be especially helpful concurrently or after antibiotic use.

413
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:34,879
If you think about antibiotics, we're going to strip our bowel of good and bad bacteria.

414
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:42,980
So sometimes when patients are on antibiotics, they'll also take a course of probiotics, steroid use.

415
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:45,590
I'm not sure I'd have to say that that may be true.

416
00:46:45,590 --> 00:46:50,900
Like after a course of steroids to bring down inflammation, maybe then that's the time to try and repopulate.

417
00:46:51,290 --> 00:46:53,990
So that that's something I could look into as well.

418
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:05,299
So, you know, like these probiotics, again, is probably a pretty low risk intervention in most cases.

419
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:08,630
But the evidence is just we don't know.

420
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:13,520
Studies look at such different strains, such different values.

421
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,610
You know, they're not very comparable.

422
00:47:16,610 --> 00:47:21,259
That's why we don't have really great recommendations following clinical trials,

423
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:26,750
because everybody's looking at a different amount, maybe different strains. So we still don't know.

424
00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:37,730
I went to a wonderful talk a couple of years ago in Boston, a physician that works on intestinal transplant.

425
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:49,910
And they were actually that the study was actually taking stool from patients with healthy guts and making it into a pill for other patients to take.

426
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:58,759
I know that sounds horrible, but that's that was their study and it was really interesting and they had some some good findings.

427
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:04,249
But she even said, like, her whole life's work was really gut microbiota.

428
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:08,990
And she said, we don't know. We don't know what works and what doesn't or if it's helpful.

429
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:14,240
In theory, it's more theoretical basis for a lot of this that it's helpful.

430
00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:20,050
Okay. Some other considerations that will come up in the literature.

431
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:25,700
What about omega three fatty acids? Okay, omega three fatty acids, we know or are anti-inflammatory.

432
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:28,880
So those should be really helpful in an inflammatory condition.

433
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:33,050
Well, again, the literature has been really, really mixed on this.

434
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:42,470
And some studies have found that there are reduced measures of oxidative stress, oxidative stress, but really do not affect disease activity.

435
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:51,170
So, again, mixed risk, a risk factor for IBD, maybe an altered omega six omega three fatty acid ratio.

436
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:57,680
You'll hear a lot about this and cannot lot of a lot of efficacy here.

437
00:48:59,630 --> 00:49:07,940
But potentially in a way, we want to improve the omega six omega three fatty acid ratio would be not to lower omega six intake,

438
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:16,129
but to increase our omega three. You'll hear that omega six polyunsaturated fatty acids are pro-inflammatory.

439
00:49:16,130 --> 00:49:22,220
That's like a talking point of a lot of kind of natural health people, which is fine.

440
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:27,979
But what is found like in mice models on a cellular level does not always translate

441
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:34,520
into what happens with consuming multiple nutrients from food into a human body.

442
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:38,570
So pro-inflammatory anti-inflammatory.

443
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:46,879
Both of these fatty acids are very healthy, so we wouldn't want to necessarily reduce our intake of omega six fatty acids.

444
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,480
The the idea would be to eat more omega three fatty acids.

445
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:58,650
So omega three fatty acids have been associated with attenuation of the inflammatory responses in IBD,

446
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:06,000
but really no evidence for us to say, okay, then consume this amount of fish oil or take these supplements.

447
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:09,300
That hasn't translated into a benefit.

448
00:50:10,530 --> 00:50:12,680
So again, kind of frustrating,

449
00:50:12,690 --> 00:50:19,960
like something that seemingly would be very helpful and actually has been shown to maybe attenuate that inflammatory response.

450
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:24,150
We don't have a great way to provide a recommendation on what to actually do.

451
00:50:24,330 --> 00:50:28,650
Yes. Is it hard to make these recommendations? Because we don't know what causes.

452
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:33,390
So it's like we don't know where to look.

453
00:50:33,690 --> 00:50:43,820
Right. Exactly. Because the the actual etiology of Crohn's disease and I sat through a a talk a couple of weeks ago like that.

454
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:49,800
This doctor, this gastroenterologist had this beautiful slide of like Crohn's disease in

455
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:54,180
the middle and then like 20 bubbles on the outside of what could potentially.

456
00:50:54,570 --> 00:50:57,660
And it's like that's overwhelming, you know, like we have a good idea.

457
00:50:57,660 --> 00:51:06,780
But if we can't really get out that root cause a lot of these things are more like supplementary or supportive, therapeutic in nature.

458
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:12,300
So you may not see a huge benefit from some of these things yet.

459
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:18,470
And for omega three use what we suggest like food forms using not like necessarily supplement.

460
00:51:18,690 --> 00:51:25,650
Right. Like so we could say, you know, there is evidence that these fatty acids, you know, could be helpful.

461
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:30,209
So getting more fatty fish, looking at other plant sources.

462
00:51:30,210 --> 00:51:40,200
But I, I don't think we could say, yes, you should take 500 milligrams of each and 500 milligrams of or a day.

463
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:44,730
You know, like we just don't have that evidence. It's probably not harmful.

464
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:48,750
But, you know, I probably wouldn't routinely recommend that.

465
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:56,550
All right. So what about glutamine? This, of course, is amino acid.

466
00:51:56,560 --> 00:52:01,440
This is potentially, you know, helps with gut integrity.

467
00:52:01,450 --> 00:52:09,100
So some data indicates that glutamine plays a significant role in the induction of cellular protection pathways.

468
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:14,980
Modulation of the inflammatory response. Prevention of organ injury after stress or trauma.

469
00:52:15,370 --> 00:52:20,950
And in particular particularly helpful in the GI tract as the integral sites in our GI tract that we'd like.

470
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:27,219
So it may play a role in intestinal permeability, which we'll discuss a little bit later.

471
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:35,080
And Emily will also touch on, but could reduce the frequency of infections by decreasing intestinal permeability.

472
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:42,880
Maintaining the physiologic intestinal barrier can probably not like enough evidence to routinely recommend that.

473
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:50,350
But again, this is like a low risk intervention that that patients could add maybe a glutamine supplement to their diet.

474
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:54,790
It's it's as far as we know, it's not really going to hurt things. It may not help, though.

475
00:52:58,570 --> 00:53:02,500
Okay. So nutrition prescription during an acute exacerbation.

476
00:53:03,490 --> 00:53:08,590
Sometimes patients will require nutrition, nutrition support if they really can't adequately.

477
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:16,210
Nutrition early. So that means until feeding or more severe cases told the French version.

478
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:19,720
They are ready to start eating.

479
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:31,000
We often progress to a low fat, low fiber diet, high in protein, high in calories, small frequent meals, and return to a normal diet as tolerated.

480
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:36,550
So you'll see that physicians know a lot and this just stands for Advanced Diet is Tolerated.

481
00:53:36,730 --> 00:53:42,250
And that's really it. Very individualized and how quickly that may go.

482
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:51,280
And then just talking about fiber. So low fiber at first, but that will gradually add fiber back to the diet.

483
00:53:51,820 --> 00:54:01,120
And we may have to look at specific vitamin and mineral supplementation recommendations depending on on the disease state,

484
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:06,220
what we think may be needed or if we have evidence of deficiency as well.

485
00:54:10,770 --> 00:54:16,379
Okay. So our goal is going to be to maximize energy and protein intake for maintenance of weight and

486
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:21,090
replenishment of nutrient stores while tailoring for a patient's current gastrointestinal function.

487
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:25,469
We really want to encourage a high quality, complete diet whenever possible,

488
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:33,150
but that can take some time to get back to increased antioxidant intake from foods whenever possible.

489
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:39,030
Again, that strong evidence, that antioxidant supplementation really helps if we think about the role of an

490
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:44,430
antioxidant to prevent the development of those free radicals in the cell.

491
00:54:44,670 --> 00:54:50,370
You'd think that would be very helpful. So it is would be appropriate to encourage that from foods.

492
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:56,480
But I don't think we need to recommend a high dose of antioxidant supplements at this time.

493
00:54:56,490 --> 00:55:06,410
We don't really have strong data for that. You can consider supplementation with omega three fatty acids, so you could try a course of fish oils.

494
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:14,190
You could try glutamine. Try getting, you know, omega three foods and just understand that the data is not super strong.

495
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:18,960
But these are both things that would, again, be low risk and potentially could be helpful.

496
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:24,299
And consider use of probiotics. This should say probiotic.

497
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:35,970
Probiotic mixtures as indicated. And that that may may help just get back to a better state for the intestinal flora.

498
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:44,890
All right. Just briefly, I want to talk about the Low-Fodmap diet.

499
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:51,380
So we use Low-Fodmap diet in IBS, which again, we'll have a discussion on.

500
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:57,080
But there is evidence for use in IBD. And this is where a lot of this started was actually in IBD.

501
00:55:57,650 --> 00:56:03,920
So this is more of like on an outpatient level. So we've talked about how we kind of approach our our patients that are having an IBD flare up.

502
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:13,489
And I'm in the inpatient frame, but if it's an outpatient level, so the initial treatment of functional symptoms,

503
00:56:13,490 --> 00:56:19,129
so things like diarrhea, abdominal pain and bloating in patients with IBD that are in remission.

504
00:56:19,130 --> 00:56:29,090
So they're they're in remission. They're their inflammation is under relatively good control, but they're still having these symptoms.

505
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:37,940
A lot of places will institute a diet in that is low in these fodmaps for patients with IBD.

506
00:56:38,990 --> 00:56:41,580
And these again are short chain carbohydrates.

507
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:49,610
They're osmotic active in the small intestine and are rapidly fermented in the colon, which can result in symptoms of abdominal pain and bloating.

508
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:53,510
So again, you'll get a whole talk on Fodmaps.

509
00:56:53,510 --> 00:57:00,499
But I do want you to know, like an IBD and a patient that's in a remission state, but also still having some symptoms,

510
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:05,960
what we call functional GI symptoms, diarrhea, abdominal pain, occasional bloating, things like that.

511
00:57:06,650 --> 00:57:09,530
This may be an appropriate approach for them. Yes.

512
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:15,979
So when you're in remission, when you don't have information, well, you may have some degree of inflammation,

513
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:21,920
but you're not in like an active flare up where you're requiring hospitalization or requiring steroids.

514
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:27,799
Maybe you're on your maintenance medication therapy, still experiencing some symptoms.

515
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:31,700
But that inflammatory response is is definitely decreased.

516
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:42,950
So there's different definitions of remission. So they may like to see that you've been kind of maintained on a certain medication regimen.

517
00:57:42,950 --> 00:57:46,760
Your nutritional status and food intake for the most part is good.

518
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:53,990
And maybe they'll check your inflammatory markers to see that you're not like in an active flare of the disease.

519
00:57:53,990 --> 00:58:00,810
So that could be considered like remission. So this might be appropriate to implement at that level.

520
00:58:01,550 --> 00:58:06,900
Yeah. Last year, you had to take a long.

521
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:12,720
Oh, yes. If this is a whole process and one.

522
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:20,180
Yes. How about impeachment? I think we're at the point where it's like, don't do anything.

523
00:58:20,850 --> 00:58:26,339
I feel like it's hard to say yes. So this is very involved.

524
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:36,510
So and as Emily will discuss the stuff about Low-Fodmap and IBS with her or one of the GI dietitians and go over what this diet entails,

525
00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:44,309
then there's a total elimination period for a couple of weeks, and then there's a sort of part where you're reintroducing foods.

526
00:58:44,310 --> 00:58:46,410
You do at one at a time. It takes some time.

527
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:55,559
Sometimes we can tailor it, like if we know of, you know, these foods that are really these are foods that tend to be most problematic.

528
00:58:55,560 --> 00:59:07,440
The ones that are high fructose, maybe we just select specific fodmaps based on symptoms and go eliminate those or at least eliminate them in IBS,

529
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:11,429
at least it's kind of a we talk about like a buffet concept.

530
00:59:11,430 --> 00:59:14,040
So there is a threshold like you can tolerate some,

531
00:59:14,430 --> 00:59:18,630
but when you overfill your pocket with the fodmaps, it spills over and that's when you get symptoms.

532
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:23,580
That may be true in IBD as well, that there is like maybe a threshold.

533
00:59:23,580 --> 00:59:28,799
You can tolerate a certain amount, but once you get over that is when you get a worsening of symptoms.

534
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:35,520
So there's definitely flexibility with this, but this is not something that patients do on their own.

535
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:45,799
They need they are guided through this ideally. And it does take time to like get back to like finding what are any of these

536
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:50,840
foods triggers the goal is and any elimination diet I should say the goal is,

537
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:55,469
oh, it's always temporary, always. And then we want to get back to a place where we're.

538
00:59:55,470 --> 01:00:01,340
And it's back. Okay.

539
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:04,999
So some general recommendations. Again, these are just general.

540
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:10,370
We would tailor them to our patients, eat small meals or snacks every 3 to 4 hours.

541
01:00:10,370 --> 01:00:13,970
That can just help with tolerance and not overload with large meals.

542
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:18,589
We don't want our patients to get meals. We need they need the nutrients.

543
01:00:18,590 --> 01:00:22,729
They need the nutrition. During periods when symptoms are present.

544
01:00:22,730 --> 01:00:26,410
We want to consume have them consume foods. Potentially they're lower in fiber.

545
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:34,399
So that can help not worsen symptoms. When diarrhea decreases, we can add small amounts of wholegrain foods, high fiber,

546
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:41,660
fruits and vegetables back into the diet slowly, sometimes even just like one high fiber food at a time.

547
01:00:41,930 --> 01:00:48,770
Just do it very slowly. If the patient gets abdominal pain or the diarrhea can hurt returns we've done,

548
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:55,760
have them stop eating that food and try again at a later date and kind of go back to their, what I call like a core diet.

549
01:00:58,070 --> 01:01:01,250
Course, maintaining adequate hydration is very important.

550
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:08,750
We do want to limit caffeine or sugary drinks just because that if they have diarrhea or have had multiple bowel receptions,

551
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:12,230
those things will will stimulate intestinal transit.

552
01:01:14,270 --> 01:01:18,110
Then we can have them eat foods that have added probiotics and prebiotics.

553
01:01:18,530 --> 01:01:21,079
Knowing that in general, those are going to be good for health.

554
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:27,350
But it may not maybe it may not be overly beneficial in terms of their symptoms or maintaining remission.

555
01:01:30,150 --> 01:01:34,770
Might be helpful to take a chewable multivitamin with minerals that can just help with absorption.

556
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:42,989
You do need to make sure these patients are on calcium and vitamin D if they're not adequate in the diet,

557
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:46,910
which it can be difficult to get enough calcium and vitamin D from dietary sources.

558
01:01:47,030 --> 01:01:53,909
Well, not impossible, but a lot of times these patients might require supplementation and a lot of this has to do with their underlying

559
01:01:53,910 --> 01:02:00,780
disease process and the medications they're on that make them prone to bone health issues and deficiencies here.

560
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:08,820
And also like him, patients like the acid reflux medications, and that could affect calcium absorption as well.

561
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:13,410
Calcium citrate tends to be a little bit better tolerated and absorbed in those situations.

562
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:17,760
So you'll see a variety of medications that patients are on.

563
01:02:18,930 --> 01:02:23,400
They might be on medications called methotrexate or sulfasalazine.

564
01:02:23,970 --> 01:02:27,810
These can interfere with folic acid absorption.

565
01:02:27,810 --> 01:02:32,969
So they may have to take additional folic acid and other nutrients.

566
01:02:32,970 --> 01:02:35,430
You guys will have to look into this when you do your case study.

567
01:02:37,350 --> 01:02:44,270
When patients do not have symptoms or if symptoms are pretty well controlled, we do want them to get back to a really helpful, complex diet.

568
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:48,269
So whole grains, varieties of fruits and vegetables, all of that.

569
01:02:48,270 --> 01:02:53,250
And many patients will have periods of time where they're eating relatively normally.

570
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:59,220
And we just start new foods have small amounts one at a time just to ensure a tolerance.

571
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:11,650
So a lot of times our approach for IBD may be symptom based, so we just kind of target the symptoms that that patient is experiencing.

572
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:18,370
So the use of dietary approaches will depend on their predominant symptom or symptoms,

573
01:03:18,790 --> 01:03:24,190
the underlying disease process and potentially the clinician preference, meaning the gastroenterologist.

574
01:03:24,250 --> 01:03:30,280
So for example, if for patients that have constipation predominant symptoms,

575
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:34,510
we talk a lot about IBD having diarrhea, but some patients might present with constipation.

576
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:39,640
Maybe they would benefit from increasing their fiber intake.

577
01:03:39,940 --> 01:03:46,870
But we also have to consider will are they prone to strictures that might not be the best thing that can lead to like a obstruction and a lot of pain.

578
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:56,500
So considering how to approach approach their symptom management in the context of their entire medical situation.

579
01:03:58,810 --> 01:04:05,710
For patients with symptoms that are related to ingesting maybe a lot of lactose, and maybe they're showing signs of lactose intolerance,

580
01:04:07,030 --> 01:04:16,780
they might benefit from lactose restriction, but they don't automatically have to have lactose free foods and then other restrictive diets.

581
01:04:16,780 --> 01:04:21,159
So patients will find lots of different information. Maybe they're like they will.

582
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:25,510
They should go gluten free or be on a specific carbohydrate diet.

583
01:04:25,510 --> 01:04:33,400
Some of those may have some efficacy to relieve functional symptoms, but they've not really been studied in like Arctis for IBD.

584
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:40,490
In addition, you often see restriction of fat, alcohol, caffeine is advised.

585
01:04:42,710 --> 01:04:48,710
The effect of these dietary restrictions and intestinal inflammation is unknown, but they can help some.

586
01:04:49,130 --> 01:04:53,700
Some people control their symptoms. And then finally,

587
01:04:53,700 --> 01:05:03,030
there's newer data on the role of hypersensitivity reactions to food proteins in patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders.

588
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:12,330
These would be things like dietary antigens or common food allergens like wheat and dairy.

589
01:05:14,650 --> 01:05:21,150
You know, we wouldn't want to unnecessarily remove things, especially if they don't have a an allergy to foods.

590
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:25,229
But there are some data that's looking at like common food allergens.

591
01:05:25,230 --> 01:05:31,740
And are those eliciting like an inflammatory response in people that don't have a food allergy, that maybe have IBD?

592
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:36,930
So that might be something that's coming up in the future. More research is needed there.

593
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:46,259
This is really small. This was this is from a database up to date that just has like an algorithm.

594
01:05:46,260 --> 01:05:49,320
This would be used for by clinicians.

595
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:56,010
But you could see how it considers is the patient undernourished or malnourished?

596
01:05:56,610 --> 01:06:03,630
Do they have asked if I could see maybe what type of nutritional therapy or approach may be taken?

597
01:06:08,370 --> 01:06:11,520
Does anybody have any questions on anything we've cover?

598
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:19,490
So I would say just take the patient's entire clinical picture, their nutritional picture under consideration.

599
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:28,520
And often we do have some good recommendations that may be targeted to the individual symptoms that would make the most sense for them.

600
01:06:30,790 --> 01:06:36,159
Okay. I want to take the last 10 minutes or so to just talk a little bit about and or

601
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:40,780
exclusive enteral nutrition in the management of pediatric Crohn's disease.

602
01:06:44,310 --> 01:06:53,190
So what is this really? The treatment calls of pediatric IBD are to induce mucosal healing while continuing to maintain growth,

603
01:06:53,790 --> 01:07:04,130
nutritional status, quality of life and avoiding side effects. So in pediatric patients with Crohn's disease, this is a really important time.

604
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:08,459
Like during like kids, they need to maintain their growth for no matter what's going on.

605
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:15,810
We, we, we always are looking at their growth parameters. We can't allow them to experience.

606
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:27,270
Times are an extended time of really undernutrition because that will affect linear growth and can involve stunting,

607
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:35,579
which then has ramifications for the rest of life. So growth is so important, we have to make sure they are still growing.

608
01:07:35,580 --> 01:07:43,590
So the use of steroids in this population no effective can impact growth, especially linear growth.

609
01:07:44,370 --> 01:07:48,779
So exclusive enteral nutrition is steroid sparing so they don't have to rely on

610
01:07:48,780 --> 01:07:54,149
steroids and is often the first line therapy with remission rates of 60 to 80%.

611
01:07:54,150 --> 01:08:01,160
So highly effective. There is less evidence to support efficacy in adults with Crohn's disease.

612
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:02,660
So not a lot of great studies.

613
01:08:02,930 --> 01:08:11,430
There are compliance concerns which we'll talk about tolerability thought to relate to the practicalities of the use of e.

614
01:08:12,590 --> 01:08:20,419
And studies have not shown great efficacy so far. So this was kind of promising like, wow, this is really great.

615
01:08:20,420 --> 01:08:24,440
And pediatrics hasn't really translated to the adult population yet.

616
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:30,830
Yeah. So. We see it Crohn's disease and.

617
01:08:31,490 --> 01:08:41,980
Children were often with his parents but the parents had never like a family member has a it can't it is thought to be hereditary in nature.

618
01:08:41,990 --> 01:08:46,510
However, I believe this is correct.

619
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:52,010
I was just reading this yesterday. The majority of patients with Crohn's disease don't have a family history of it.

620
01:08:53,540 --> 01:08:59,410
So in my experience, a lot of times know when the but this is like, you know,

621
01:08:59,420 --> 01:09:04,549
sample of like ten maybe that I've seen that have had Crohn's disease diagnosed very often.

622
01:09:04,550 --> 01:09:05,900
There's not a family history.

623
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:15,820
So exclusive and full nutrition at our end is the recommended first line therapy to treat active Crohn's disease in pediatric patients.

624
01:09:15,830 --> 01:09:25,770
So what does this actually involve? It requires the patient to stop eating and receive all dietary energy from formula so taken

625
01:09:25,770 --> 01:09:30,569
either by mouth so they can drink it or they can get it through any gastric feeding tube,

626
01:09:30,570 --> 01:09:34,380
or even through a gastrostomy tube, which is like a permanent feeding tube in the stomach.

627
01:09:36,090 --> 01:09:38,670
So the timeframes vary.

628
01:09:38,940 --> 01:09:48,660
I would add here maybe 6 to 12 weeks or 6 to 8 weeks is kind of the common timeframe where they will do just 6 to 8 weeks and just formula.

629
01:09:50,590 --> 01:09:58,180
And it is designed to induce remission and it is highly effective. So the daily volume of the formula will be calculated based on the estimated energy

630
01:09:58,180 --> 01:10:01,659
requirements and adjusted based on ongoing measurements of weight and height.

631
01:10:01,660 --> 01:10:06,130
So the dietician would be highly involved in prescribing therapy for these patients.

632
01:10:07,780 --> 01:10:14,200
So now that you know what it is, can you see why this might be hard to implement in adult patients?

633
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:21,850
Compliance is really hard. They're just they're not going to not eat and drink formula for eight weeks.

634
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:25,330
It's just it's really hard to get adults to do that.

635
01:10:25,330 --> 01:10:44,049
Yeah. Oh, like technically up to 18 would still be considered pediatric as we get into like adolescence and to make sure that this can become more so.

636
01:10:44,050 --> 01:10:49,730
This is often done in younger patients. I'd have to look at like the mean age of like what?

637
01:10:50,050 --> 01:10:59,280
How this is. Because I have some patients for a different condition that have to potentially do this type of approach,

638
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:05,910
but with an even more restrictive formula, like an amino acid based formula, which is really horrible.

639
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:11,130
And like the teenagers, we use that very sparingly. They do not do well on it.

640
01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:15,659
Yeah. So is it like you just have to have that formula?

641
01:11:15,660 --> 01:11:19,299
They can't. It's not just like a liquid thing, like smoothies.

642
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:22,500
They're adding a banana. It's it's a smoothie. It's like full.

643
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:30,809
You just. It's formula, right? Yeah. But there may be a role in the transition period for like, adding foods back in.

644
01:11:30,810 --> 01:11:36,209
And it sometimes we do like voluntarism at first, but it's just formula for whatever reason.

645
01:11:36,210 --> 01:11:40,380
We'll talk about why with the mechanistic, you know, mechanisms why this works.

646
01:11:40,890 --> 01:11:45,060
But it is just the formula for 6 to 8 weeks. That's their entire source of nutrition.

647
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:53,850
So the exact mechanism of action remains uncertain. But there is hypothesized that it appears to suppress inflammation and promote mucosal

648
01:11:53,850 --> 01:12:00,870
healing and e and improves growth as compared to steroid therapy so they can be off steroids.

649
01:12:00,870 --> 01:12:08,460
They're getting adequate nutrition, so they're growing well. And it also appears to having an effect on the inflammatory response.

650
01:12:09,660 --> 01:12:16,049
So it's hypothesized that the following factors contribute to achievement of remission with exclusive enteral nutrition.

651
01:12:16,050 --> 01:12:22,800
So we're repeating them nutritionally. There are systemic and local immune modulation happening.

652
01:12:24,030 --> 01:12:30,360
We think improvement of the intestinal inflammation and barrier function and also it can benefit the microbiome.

653
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:36,480
We'll kind of dove into each of these briefly. So the nutritional replacement is really important.

654
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:40,770
So steroid use in pediatrics can impact their linear growth velocity,

655
01:12:40,770 --> 01:12:47,250
which is really important that it doesn't impede to a degree that it gets to growth stunting.

656
01:12:48,660 --> 01:12:58,980
So studies have shown that linear growth velocity Z scores significantly increased in groups that use E and compared to kids on steroid therapy.

657
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:08,339
So that's a really big finding. So E and promoting ableism by suppressing protein breakdown and increasing protein synthesis provision of

658
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:14,760
complete nutrition can correct and maintain macro and micronutrient deficiencies or maintain their status.

659
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:20,730
So we see nutritional improvements, we see weight gain. We see increased muscle mass and enhanced bone health.

660
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:27,850
So the systemic and local immune modulation.

661
01:13:29,170 --> 01:13:39,670
Systemic inflammatory markers like CRP or ESR which is in erythrocyte sedimentation rate normalized with exclusive enteral nutrition,

662
01:13:41,020 --> 01:13:45,040
and it's often detectable before we see changes in their nutritional status.

663
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:50,640
So there is reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines within the intestine.

664
01:13:50,970 --> 01:13:58,920
And evidence also suggests that an increase in systemic circulating concentrations of anti-inflammatory cytokines.

665
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:09,200
What about this intestinal inflammation and barrier function and has a direct anti-inflammatory

666
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:16,010
effect on the intestine and Crohn's disease so we can see improvement in intestinal permeability.

667
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:26,829
After six weeks on exclusive enteral nutrition. So the island may allow restoration of functional epithelial and mucosal barrier and

668
01:14:26,830 --> 01:14:31,240
the mucosal barrier by excluding foods that adversely impact the barrier function.

669
01:14:32,730 --> 01:14:37,440
So that you guys heard of like leaky gut what you're see is that term.

670
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:41,440
And then I was like, oh, we really shouldn't use that. What does that actually describe?

671
01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:44,790
Well, it does happen.

672
01:14:44,790 --> 01:14:49,859
So these are like the intestinal barrier. We normally have very tight junctions there.

673
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:58,829
So, you know, foods and compounds don't get through that into into the bloodstream and cause like systemic effects.

674
01:14:58,830 --> 01:15:07,260
But when they lose some of that, um, intestinal or carrier function or integrity is compromised,

675
01:15:07,260 --> 01:15:12,840
we can see that different things can actually get through and get into the bloodstream

676
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:18,300
and the hand is shown to help protect the integrity of that mucosal barrier.

677
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:29,030
And then with regard to the microbiome and can alter the microbiome in patients with Crohn's disease so we can see bacterial shifts,

678
01:15:29,810 --> 01:15:36,140
alterations and diversity in metabolomics and that likely play a role in the remission achievement.

679
01:15:39,100 --> 01:15:48,010
All right. So how is this implemented? So depending on the age and motivation of the child, they can drink the formula.

680
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:52,660
So or sometimes they will do it through a feeding tube.

681
01:15:54,010 --> 01:15:58,209
And the delivery methods can vary depending on what works best for the family.

682
01:15:58,210 --> 01:16:05,850
And we'll get into delivery methods next semester. The type of formula really doesn't matter.

683
01:16:05,850 --> 01:16:09,740
So they can just be on a standard infant formula.

684
01:16:09,750 --> 01:16:12,719
They don't have to be on one that doesn't have cows milk protein.

685
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:18,660
They don't have to be on a people allergenic or what we call like a amino acid or elemental formula.

686
01:16:19,650 --> 01:16:27,209
They can really just be on a standard formula and there's no difference in outcomes when using a polymeric formula,

687
01:16:27,210 --> 01:16:36,690
which is just like an intact normal protein formula versus one that we consider semi broken down or completely broken down.

688
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:42,030
Polymeric formulas are better tasting less expensive.

689
01:16:42,030 --> 01:16:46,229
So as an example of this, even though it's not a formula,

690
01:16:46,230 --> 01:16:52,320
a formula would be like ensure conditions like those would work in this or they could

691
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:56,940
use like an actual formula that can be used to a feeding tube or train poorly.

692
01:17:01,650 --> 01:17:05,640
This is the last sites we'll stop here. So what happens after the 6 to 8 weeks?

693
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:13,320
You know, different places do things differently. So there's no real single guideline on how to reintroduce solid foods.

694
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:19,710
But it is done gradually. So it's not like they just stopped the formula after eight weeks and eat normally.

695
01:17:19,890 --> 01:17:24,690
It's so it's a little deceiving that it's like six, eight weeks because it is longer.

696
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:33,480
Sometimes they'll do a gradual reintroduction, maybe one solid meal a day for the first week and then add on is tolerated.

697
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:39,120
All this time they're still going to be maintained on some level of formula for their nutrition.

698
01:17:39,270 --> 01:17:42,360
So we don't recommend quick reintroduction of solids.

699
01:17:43,380 --> 01:17:46,770
Sometimes you'll see language like an anti-inflammatory diet.

700
01:17:47,130 --> 01:17:48,480
What does that really mean?

701
01:17:50,220 --> 01:17:59,670
So different institutions will kind of define that as one that is really not a whole lot of processed foods or more whole foods,

702
01:18:00,210 --> 01:18:03,060
maybe low in certain carbohydrates.

703
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:12,090
Again, it can be highly variable, maybe carbohydrate free at first with no or very limited amounts of processed foods.

704
01:18:12,090 --> 01:18:20,549
Like I mentioned, many recommend maintaining a diet that's about 50% of formula and 50% of of solid foods for like 4 to 6 months.

705
01:18:20,550 --> 01:18:27,870
So this is like could be a long process and then they'll slowly get back to just solid foods.

706
01:18:29,740 --> 01:18:33,580
So some evidence suggests specific components of the diet, such as wheat,

707
01:18:34,870 --> 01:18:43,120
emulsifying agents or certain fatty acids may have adverse effects on epithelial cell type junctions or impair mucous function.

708
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:49,600
So that's why there may be some recommendations not to do certain carbohydrates and really avoid processed foods.

709
01:18:51,290 --> 01:18:55,520
But like really strong guidelines for this don't quite exist, as far as I know.

710
01:18:57,580 --> 01:19:05,500
But highly effective could be difficult to implement other like I know some major hospitalizations this

711
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:10,900
is that or hospitals health systems this is the first line of therapy for their pediatric patients.

712
01:19:12,580 --> 01:19:18,250
Again, not as much good efficacy to use in adults and that's primarily due to compliance issues.

713
01:19:18,250 --> 01:19:26,590
But also there may be something in childhood where this is just more beneficial with the different growth factors and all that happening.

714
01:19:27,790 --> 01:19:30,940
Does anybody have any questions on anything we've covered today?

715
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:38,430
Okay. So if any of you want to eventually be a pediatric GI dietitian,

716
01:19:38,430 --> 01:19:45,720
you will be you will have lots of work because there's always a baby there and it's a GI dietitian in general.

717
01:19:46,470 --> 01:19:51,390
All right. So enjoy your break. I will see you guys a week from today.
