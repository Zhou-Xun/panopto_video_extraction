1
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:13,500
Rudy Bulc, who is the lead of the patient education and health literacy program at Michigan Medicine, has broken his class five times.

2
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:20,280
That's what would have been my guess. And it comes back up in evaluations every year and how useful this session is

3
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:25,170
because her advice is so practical related to creating educational materials,

4
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:31,830
using principles of plain language. You will think about this lecture in the materials, in your work as nutrition professionals,

5
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:35,900
so just know that there's a reason I've convened you all in-person today.

6
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:43,380
It is that important. There are a few handouts that Rudy has shared with us that are fully accessible on the campus website.

7
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:52,210
There are a few that she highlighted that would be important to have hard copies of Cell will circulate those around as she begins talking any other,

8
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:59,460
you know, when enterprises to their own prizes. My goodness, we have prizes so high that I will turn it over to Rudy.

9
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,660
Usually it takes about two hours for the session, so we'll run straight through.

10
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:10,630
If things look like they're going to run longer, we can check in and take a break, but I was estimated to be about two hours.

11
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:19,050
Yes, it's great. Great to be here again. It's really one of the highlights of my year to present to in your class.

12
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:28,020
And I do see some of your counsel as interns to Michigan Medicine and then are empowered to actually write patient education materials.

13
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:34,650
So it's really, really satisfying. I always like to start all my talks with this video.

14
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:40,560
My asthma. They said they fix it, but it didn't make any difference at all.

15
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:49,740
Well, sometimes mistakes. You need to try twice as hard to fix them using our inhaler all the time.

16
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:56,070
We want to make sure you're using it right. Do I look like an idiot?

17
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:18,270
No. Once you show me how inhaler works, so I I actually like when people laugh.

18
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:22,270
It's hard with masks. I try to find a yeah, it's hard with the mask.

19
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:30,870
It is kind of funny. It's a really good care. I think it was great talking to our next chair.

20
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:37,860
It's not really that funny because what we see in this video is we see failure to treat this beautiful disease.

21
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:43,590
Asthma is a very highly treatable disease, and people really don't have to suffer with it.

22
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:49,140
But what we saw here is that patient education did not work.

23
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:55,830
That led to a failure in Detroit, Michigan, and then escalated to something else.

24
00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:02,640
And it is. This visual integration is a key and essential piece of the up process.

25
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:10,650
You can be an amazing doctor and you can come up with the most state of the art and evidence based treatment plan.

26
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:21,160
But if your patient doesn't understand what they need to do at home to care for themselves, all of your hospital is going to go down the drain.

27
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:27,300
So today, what we're going to do is we're going to start talking about how people speak and what the research

28
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:35,550
is showing us about how health literacy and low literacy affect health care and health status.

29
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:40,380
We also then want to go in. That's going to be about, I would say, 20 to 25 minutes.

30
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:49,680
Then the back of the talk today is about the principles of plain language writing, and it would take about 45 to 50 minutes.

31
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,530
And after that,

32
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:59,970
I would show them one situation with Real-Life examples of writing pieces that were submitted to our Patient Information Clearinghouse.

33
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:09,150
And this is where you want your participation. Raise your hands and help us identify the elements that handle understanding and also

34
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:14,300
suggest ways to improve the writing and make it more accessible and understandable.

35
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:24,060
At the end, I'm going to talk to you about the payment tool, which is the patient education assessment tool that was developed by the agency

36
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:28,230
has really such a quality to assess the quality of patient education materials,

37
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:33,030
which I think is going to be a useful tool for you in the process.

38
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:44,310
So what is health literacy? Health literacy, personal health literacy is the degree to which individuals have the ability to find,

39
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:52,320
understand and use information and services to make healthy decisions and options for themselves and others.

40
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:59,370
This is actually an information that was created in 2020 by the Department of Health and Human Services,

41
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:05,910
and they also have the House, which is the organization that helps leaders,

42
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:15,450
the organization that helps people see these organizations explicitly enable them to try and understand

43
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:22,600
and use information and services to make informed health decisions and actions for yourself and others.

44
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:31,230
So this will place their responsibility to express no hesitancy on health care organizations such as

45
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:38,730
Michigan Medicine and such as the organizations that you're going to be working for in the future.

46
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:43,590
We have good data about how health literacy impacts health,

47
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:50,550
and this data comes from then another study that was done in 2003 by the Department of Health and Human Services.

48
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:55,080
It was called the nine studies. It's the National Assessment of Adult Literacy.

49
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:03,960
So the purpose of this study was to assess the literacy level in the United States, but they also had a component to assess health literacy.

50
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:10,110
And what they found is that only 12 percent of participants and this was a large study.

51
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:13,860
Tens of thousands of people have dissipated.

52
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:21,750
Only 10, 12 percent of participants were proficient, they have proficient skills that enable them to find,

53
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:27,420
understand and use health information to manage your own health conditions.

54
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:34,170
52 percent the majority of participants tested in the intermediate level.

55
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:42,720
And that meant that for the most part, they did have those necessary skills, but they still had trouble with very dense and complex information.

56
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,290
Twenty two percent tested in the basic level,

57
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:54,540
meaning that at best they can understand very short and simple handouts and 14 percent are still below that level.

58
00:06:54,540 --> 00:07:03,630
And still, the assumption is in health literacy research is that 36 percent of American adults have low hesitancy,

59
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:08,160
and this translates to approximately 90 million Americans.

60
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:23,130
When we look at the data, we see that minority groups and underdogs are significantly more dispersed, disproportionately affected by local issues.

61
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:31,680
So you can see Hispanic-Americans, for example, underdogs, African-Americans,

62
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:39,900
etc. have higher rates of low health resources, but we have to remember that this can be misleading.

63
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:48,430
The majority of people do have low hesitancy, are actually white and native-born Americans.

64
00:07:48,430 --> 00:08:02,170
So just by seeing some of these rays identifying, which doesn't mean necessarily that they have sufficient testing procedures don't make assumptions.

65
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:10,390
The risk factor for having been tested was the the number one factor was aged over 65,

66
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:17,530
also having lower educational level, less than a high school diploma or a GP being poor.

67
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:23,440
Incomes at or below the poverty level also having low English proficiency.

68
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:30,800
All of these other demographic elements, they're at increased risk for having no health literacy.

69
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:38,170
Another risk factor is stress. That's not a demographic risk factor because research has shown that just having the

70
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:44,380
stress of the and this really impacts the ability to understand and retain information.

71
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:52,540
So even people who tested in the intermediate level may be or having sufficient literacy on the night test when the doctor's office,

72
00:08:52,540 --> 00:09:01,000
they're talking about an illness that is possibly life threatening or life altering that can really impact

73
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:08,110
their ability to understand information and other related concept to literacy that we need to talk about,

74
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:11,890
especially with you, is no mercy.

75
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:22,030
No mercy is the ability to understand and work with numbers, basic analysis, skills, addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

76
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:29,830
And we do need to normalize not only literacy skills, but also normalize these skills to manage our health.

77
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:40,390
We need those skills to read food labels, for example, and we need them for medication management to calculate dosage dosages to we prescriptions.

78
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:50,300
We need those kids to interpret test results. And we also need those kids to understand the risks and benefits of interventions.

79
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:58,520
What we know about your skills got even lower students than genuine literacy skills.

80
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:08,270
And this data comes to us from a more recent study. It was the school the Program for International Assessment of Adult Competencies here.

81
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:14,270
And this study looked at that proficiency in literacy and numeracy.

82
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:23,030
And they divided participants into five levels, with level one being the lowest and level five being the highest.

83
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:29,810
And what they found is that when they looked at higher proficiency, only 12 percent of attacks.

84
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:41,450
Participants in that study tested in the highest proficiency level, but only nine percent tested in the highest proficiency for numeracy.

85
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:47,450
So less people replication in all honesty and the same thing was reflected on

86
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:52,430
the other side when they looked at lowest at the lowest level four percent,

87
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:59,360
but that this did mean the lowest level for literacy, but 10 percent tested in the lowest level for the lowest thing.

88
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,860
So numeracy skills are even more challenging skills.

89
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:07,500
This, of course, has a huge effect on health status.

90
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:15,040
And study after study, and I'm thinking I'm saying there have been hundreds of studies since then that started came out.

91
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:23,560
And I'm just going to share with you some of those findings. Studies have shown that people are so happy to see have less compliance with treatment.

92
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:32,050
They actually do a number of contention and treatment errors. They get fewer vaccinations and they're also good for your health screenings.

93
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:43,180
And as a result of the low incidence of delayed diagnoses, they also have less knowledge about their health conditions and how to manage them.

94
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:49,360
Studies have also found that health literacy is very expensive for the U.S. economy,

95
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:55,900
and people with low health literacy have a much higher utilization of health services.

96
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,620
And, of course, much higher costs.

97
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:08,410
One study, for example, found that the annual health care cost of people with low hesitancy, often times higher than the average person you'll see.

98
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:21,340
Another study found that people with low hesitancy have six percent more hospital visits, and also the hospital stays about two days longer.

99
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:27,340
Very interesting study from 2015 looked at cost of prescription,

100
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:37,840
and it found that adults with below or below basic health literacy spend about $300 annually on prescription medications,

101
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:48,640
but those with average health literacy and proficient have spent less than a third of their own nine hundred ten dollars.

102
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,380
The most recent interesting study, in my opinion,

103
00:12:51,380 --> 00:13:02,050
that came about this looked it was a study that was done by UnitedHealth Group and United have is a very large health insurance company.

104
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:07,930
And they also have a research arm. And they did this research for Medicare Medicaid.

105
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:21,010
Ask them to look at this research. And what they did is they compared outcomes for six Medicare fee for service.

106
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:27,430
They call them Medicare fee for service beneficially so they could get health outcomes

107
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:33,610
with the level of health literacy in different counties in the United States.

108
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,290
And the way they did it,

109
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:43,450
the wisdom they were able to do it is because of this map and this map was developed by it's called the Health Literacy Data Map,

110
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:49,420
and it's a project that was named by UMC University of Michigan, who was also part of that project.

111
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:54,730
Well, they analyzed health literacy level by county in the United States.

112
00:13:54,730 --> 00:14:01,270
So UnitedHealthcare looked at this and then compare this with the outcomes with those six outcomes.

113
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:13,180
And what they found is that in countries with the highest health literacy, they had 30 26 percent fewer avoidable hospitalization.

114
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:19,930
They had nine percent fewer hospital admissions. They had 18 percent fewer 1951 visits.

115
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:26,890
And this is per capita and also 13 percent lower costs for beneficiary.

116
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:32,020
And so they concluded that if all the counties in the United States had high hopes,

117
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:40,240
this was the levels that would save Medicare over twenty five billion dollars every year.

118
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,170
So this is very, very, very closely.

119
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:55,570
So as this data came out, oh yeah, I should also mention this sometimes, and it's time to talk about this, but it's very, very important.

120
00:14:55,570 --> 00:15:02,320
One thing that we need to know about health literacy is that it's associated with a lot of stigma and shame.

121
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:15,070
And people that have limited health literacy are going to go into your consultation and low literacy can speak to, including language kids.

122
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:23,260
People with low latency generally have a very strong sense of shame about the skill level, and they are very, very good at hiding it.

123
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:28,090
And this is why no hesitancy is often invisible.

124
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:32,010
And I would like to share these other video with you.

125
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:41,000
And this is kind of an audio video now, but it's, I think, still talks about what's happening today was created by the American Medical Association.

126
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:51,530
It's going to go, Oh, I think a lot of people go off because I have it in the stores and in it and realize that it doesn't have to follow that,

127
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:55,250
we need to take it right into it.

128
00:15:55,250 --> 00:16:01,370
I just don't understand. You have to ask me the right way to do it.

129
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:07,220
I just didn't want anyone to know could. I can't.

130
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:15,140
Well, I guess I if you give it to me, so it's something you take in your children.

131
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:25,010
What do you most concerned about how you stand on this for long?

132
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:39,440
I would. Incur the wrath of one, perhaps one councilor, I have sworn that.

133
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,640
Although this trial quite surprised by a crime,

134
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:52,670
so much so how would you take this when it's not on the table tennis and take the time thing and they'll say what was going on?

135
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,620
Do you know what hypertension?

136
00:16:54,620 --> 00:17:03,730
I asked whether that was because when I look at it this way, you have hypertension and I've been taking care of that for a long time.

137
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:16,550
How or hyper? What is the Game of Thrones or how you always got to be doing something like that?

138
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:28,340
I don't know. A lot of people are considered to be there, but you know, you have high blood pressure.

139
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:33,980
Hypertension is a assigned to practice.

140
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:39,280
And then they went, Oh, I usually fix the TV every morning.

141
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:45,080
Sometimes it's difficult for me to take these pills.

142
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:48,890
They say one habit was Amy.

143
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:59,930
I don't know if the fact that one in one woman eating one or two one afternoon or one of you is usually what do take two of them in the morning?

144
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:09,730
And this is why I know I have a reading on the doctor that can be very scary as I'm the nightmare.

145
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:22,930
Working in all of this, and mostly for the first thing you want to have to do better for this is for you to say, I don't know what do you want?

146
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:30,430
I want how I have I a 30 or 71, I need to go to commodities.

147
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:34,820
And part of it is not working correctly.

148
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:46,990
And we need to make sure that I am scoring passages when I showed up two weeks later at the office of the hospital.

149
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:52,470
They put a lot of papers in front of me. I think people have papers that I need to sign.

150
00:18:52,470 --> 00:19:01,840
Well, I wasn't going to say, excuse me, I don't read that and I certainly don't read fast and I'm concerned with some of these words.

151
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:14,380
To me, it was lines and circles. She and she and she's and I wasn't going to reveal my stupidity, so I signed the assignment.

152
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:24,790
Never read it. And then a couple of weeks later, when the how I suggested, the nurse said, How do you like structure has to me?

153
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:32,770
No, I acted as long as I could inside my mouth for a while, and I thought to myself,

154
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:39,940
how could I be so stupid as to allow somebody to take care of my body?

155
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:56,170
And I didn't know was. So as this data started to come out and different organizations started to take

156
00:19:56,170 --> 00:20:05,890
action and implemented programs to help clinicians to overcome the challenges of.

157
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:10,060
And these are just some of the programs that have come out since then.

158
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:13,390
The most important one, the most important ones.

159
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:24,520
But the one I want to focus on is the Cure, which is the agency of healthcare research and quality health agency Universal Precautions Tool Kit.

160
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:33,940
And this tool kit includes 21 evidence based strategies that promote understanding and minimize the risk of the mutation.

161
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:43,830
Those strategies include the language guidelines using teach back signage using interpreters,

162
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:52,180
so those 21 strategies that health organization needs to employ in order to improve the health literacy of their patients.

163
00:20:52,180 --> 00:21:03,640
The interesting thing about this is this need to be applied universally to all patients, not only to the ones that have seen.

164
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:07,360
So why are these guidelines going to go down universities?

165
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:15,940
Because studies have shown the providers are unable to identify accurately who is affected by local ActionScript, we'll see.

166
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:21,160
And this ties back into what we talked about with regards to the stigma and shame.

167
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:30,250
It's just very difficult to identify. That's why you need to communicate with all of your patients in a way that everyone can understand.

168
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:40,540
Also, like I mentioned before. Studies have shown that just having the stress of an illness compromises the ability to absorb any kind of information.

169
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:45,100
Other studies have shown that interventions designed for people with limited health

170
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:51,130
agency are just as effective for those with average or above average housemaid latency.

171
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:57,220
And this is why it makes sense. You don't need to assess the mental state level of your patient.

172
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:03,510
You just really need to communicate with them as long as they're so.

173
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:10,920
One of the strategies that included in the age of your toolkit is the future big, and this is a different method.

174
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:15,750
It's useful verbal communication. Our focus today is on reading materials.

175
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:23,130
But I really wanted to mention this because it's very important, especially, I think, for you in the nutrition field.

176
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:33,960
What it says is that you need to check the information and pictures in pieces after you finished teaching,

177
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:40,860
after you've finished teaching one conflict, you want to ask the patient to teach back in their own words.

178
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:47,280
But the trick is that you have to make sure that the patient doesn't perceive these as they are being tested.

179
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:53,190
No, the test is actually for you to see if you talk effectively.

180
00:22:53,190 --> 00:23:00,090
And this is why you would frame it with a sentence like, let's make sure I did a good job explaining.

181
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:07,650
Can you repeat after me? What is a good breakfast for you or something like that?

182
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:14,820
Now is the special thing. Just bear correctly. You move on to the next concept again until you're done.

183
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:25,960
If the patient doesn't pay you back correctly, then you want to repeat the same concept using different words and then use teach back again.

184
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:34,410
And like I said today, our focus is playing language guidelines for which materials play.

185
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:41,080
Language is communication that your audience can understand the first time that we thought you.

186
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:45,570
And I'd like to try this question for you and please participate.

187
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:55,770
Raise is your hand. Do you think the plain language guidelines is just the same as using good grammar?

188
00:23:55,770 --> 00:24:06,550
I said, how do people not know, why do you think that? You could use good grammar, but still use complicated words or images.

189
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:10,630
That's right. That's exactly right.

190
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:16,660
I thought. Not this that's that's very true.

191
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:26,920
In fact, in addition to that, some principles of plain language actually contradict what I think of all this, and I'm going to show you two examples.

192
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:34,180
One is the use of synonyms. So when you talk English, one to one, they told you don't repeat the same words over and over again.

193
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:38,710
Use synonyms to make your language more rich, more engaging to the reader,

194
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:44,500
which is very true if you write an essay or if you write a paper for school.

195
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:52,570
But for people who have trouble reading, using different words to describe the same concept is actually very confusing.

196
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:59,770
So when we write in plain language, we do not use synonyms. We take quantum and we repeat it over and over again.

197
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:04,510
And in other grammatical that we don't follow is the way that we like numbers.

198
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:11,500
The convention in English is to write the numbers between one and 10 as words and the words as normalize.

199
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:16,780
But for people who have trouble reading, letting the laws is more difficult than reading numbers.

200
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:20,890
And so we want out of those numbers, as in us.

201
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:28,990
And another reason why plain language is not the same as grammar is because plain language is a lot more than just normal.

202
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:36,490
Plain language also applies to the layout and the gorfinkel hand elements of all of the material.

203
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:41,740
There are really surprisingly not amazing facts about plain language.

204
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:46,090
One of those is that creating plain language materials is easy.

205
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:51,760
It's just common sense. Don't use medical terminology and you're writing in plain language.

206
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:57,850
But the truth of the matter is that plain language guidelines are evidence based guidelines,

207
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:02,980
and it's the same the health system I've invented and they didn't come from me.

208
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:11,170
They actually play language guidelines, but actually created by the federal government in 2010 in support of the Plain Language Act.

209
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:17,050
And there was actually a plain language act that defines all of the federal government offices

210
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:22,570
and agencies to write their materials to their clients and customers in plain language.

211
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:30,550
And that's not only about health. It's about anything about transportation, about finance, about agricultural.

212
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:38,470
They are required to write the materials to their consumers in plain language.

213
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:42,190
This is the cover of the federal minimum wage.

214
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:53,020
And then in 2012, families, the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid, those federal plain language guidelines and adopted them for writing about health.

215
00:26:53,020 --> 00:27:00,010
And this is what we are going to be learning today. We will learn the guidelines that were published in this week's stores.

216
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:04,120
Now you all have a handout. You have two handouts.

217
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:12,550
Why has this summary of many these guidelines and the other one has a list of references and resources.

218
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:20,060
So I know this process is that I'm going to be mentioning today are listed in your hand about the second half the team that I decided to put that up.

219
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:27,100
Oh, okay. You referred to that. They have that as well. Right, right. So don't worry about you don't need to write anything down.

220
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:33,460
Everything is included here, including the focus on making good materials you effective.

221
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:38,530
We are. It's a very comprehensive list, so it says about 500 pages.

222
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:45,040
We have a on integral part for which is the understanding and using the talking guidance for writing.

223
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:51,940
And also part five, which is understanding and using the toolkit guidelines for graphic design.

224
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:59,290
So with this, we are ready to actually go ahead and talk about those plain language guidelines.

225
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:03,910
I have to tell you guys it's not rocket science. It's not difficult.

226
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:16,360
It's just something that you have to know. There are six guidelines logical organizations using you and other pronouns using the app to voice,

227
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:25,570
using common everyday words, using short sentences and short paragraphs, and implementing is actually design features.

228
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:30,820
So logical organization do we mean by logical organization?

229
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:40,330
Chronological organization works best when organized is going to work past, present and future, and language is built that way.

230
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:49,180
It's an easy way for our brains to absorb information if a chronological order is not applicable in your case.

231
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:58,030
Then you want to organize your information with the general first and then all the exceptions, conditions and specialized information.

232
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:07,020
And this structure applies to your sentence, applies to your paragraphs and applies to your document.

233
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:18,570
You want to use a lot of useful here. So just like Pinchbeck, we want to chunk the information into sections and get ahead in this section.

234
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:26,540
This helps to break up the information. You also allow the reader to find what they are looking forward to navigational tool.

235
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:34,080
Also, when we right information intersection with headings, it actually increases the blank space on the page,

236
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:42,740
which is a graphical element that aids in understanding the way to write your headings is ask questions you would.

237
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:48,150
This is the most readable, friendly format of presenting information.

238
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:57,510
So instead of just topic headings like healthy food, cholesterol, triglycerides, exercise thinks of strategies.

239
00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:02,970
You want to phrase these questions like what foods help to promote heart health?

240
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:07,590
What is cholesterol? What is what I put for Lazarides?

241
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:14,700
What are the benefits of exercise for the heart? What if some strategies are useful for heart healthy diet?

242
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:20,070
When you phrase the much question, he makes information a lot more relatable to the reader.

243
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:29,010
We really want to resemble a late, large conversation, and a lot of the work that you're going to be doing is that patients whose consultation.

244
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:34,530
Talking to people, being in a consultation like this and stop the handouts that you create for them

245
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:42,750
long to resemble that Q and a big conversation if questions don't make sense.

246
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:49,740
You can use non-Western headings, but you want to make them specific, and I want to make statements.

247
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:57,600
You don't want to use a very vague topic headings. The second principle is using you and other pronouns.

248
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:05,340
So the way that we use pronouns is that we use the way we would show to the organization, to the information providers.

249
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:08,250
And we want to use you talk to us later.

250
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:17,470
But in the question, how do you want to use AI because you want to phrase your headings as if the waiter was asking them again?

251
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:23,560
We want to do things that we love conversation. So here's an example of the same headings with pronouns.

252
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:34,840
So instead of what food help to promote, how have you say, how do my food choices affect my?

253
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:41,070
I mean, there is what is cholesterol you can find is that's what do I need to know about cholesterol?

254
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:53,040
And when you add those poor notes, if you make that information even more relatable and personalized, is it even more than just using questions?

255
00:31:53,040 --> 00:32:00,420
So again, the idea is you want to assemble the conversation, you want personalized the information.

256
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:10,250
Also, when you use pronouns, when you say you will ask that, will you clarify stories, the responsibility for doing what?

257
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:18,390
And that's really important. Another reason why we like pronouns is because using pronouns uses less words.

258
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:26,610
So for some, that critical patients should discuss the wishes and they are not able to make decisions themselves.

259
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:34,020
This is because your wishes, in the event you are not able to make decisions that uses less words.

260
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:40,230
Here is a Thai place to mention the thinking of this, and this is something that comes up,

261
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:47,500
especially in the world of pediatrics when you're going to be writing materials for patients, for parents talking about their children.

262
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:57,360
Right. So you may have something like your infants may need a supplement if he or she is not able to latch the breast.

263
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:02,910
So this huge are kind of I'm not talking constructions.

264
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:12,330
And this is why I was so happy. In 2016, the American Dialect Society chose the singular day as the word of the year.

265
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:20,790
And so it's perfectly legal to say, you know, infants may need a supplement if they are not able to match the breast.

266
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:27,840
Because after I got so much pushback about this singular day that I was trying to use, people said It's not English, it is English.

267
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,500
In fact, Shakespeare used it. Jane Austen used it.

268
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:35,490
And now the American Barracks Society. So does it's the word of the year.

269
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:40,950
And since then, the Webster or the Merriam-Webster API, the emulate.

270
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:47,310
All of these have felt as though the Chicago have all endorsed using the singular they.

271
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:52,410
So we also want to make sure that we use inclusive and we speak the language.

272
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:58,290
It's a preposterous language. And this is something that is really newly emerging.

273
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:06,050
The CDC has published this just a few months ago. The have equity guiding principles for inclusive communication.

274
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:16,170
So. Instead of using for diabetics, we want to save people, diabetics, people first instead of a smoker.

275
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:29,460
A person who smokes instead of mentally ill people with a mental illness assault victim, which is a term that was actually very heavily used.

276
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:40,110
We would now say, as folks like us want to have really small meanings and they make a big, big difference in their lives.

277
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:47,670
They want us to use all doing that. Just say adults age 65 and up adults aged 75 and up.

278
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:52,230
Yes, I was just curious because I feel like I've seen that.

279
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:57,450
There's like some pushback on this because some people like to identify with their illness or like they do say that like,

280
00:34:57,450 --> 00:35:01,470
that's a part of them, and it'll never then never be that somebody without it.

281
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:09,780
Is there any pushback on that, I guess. I have not heard. I have to say about how I felt for years, like in our diabetes center.

282
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:15,770
There were those sensitive to and they don't use distilled diabetes because people don't want to define going, to be honest.

283
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:22,260
You can do them. So I I really didn't feel that I can tell you, this is within you.

284
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:28,440
This just came out, but we are starting to pay a lot more attention of this inclusive language.

285
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:39,710
For example, I manage a database of what the patient education materials that are used at Michigan Medicine and when I first set it up in 2010.

286
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:46,970
I had the population field and I had a dogs, men, women, children, baby,

287
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:56,690
although that's not real questioning even the use of men and women because we have materials on pregnancy.

288
00:35:56,690 --> 00:36:02,200
No, not necessarily. You know, every women.

289
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:07,270
There are transsexual women who are pregnant, and we need to make sure that we address them,

290
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:14,320
and this is one of the things that we are going to be working on in the months to come because I think they are inclusive,

291
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:24,610
which is so important and so many populations really hesitate to use health services because of our use of an inclusive language.

292
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:32,140
Jump in real quick to add on top of that. I think that there is individual variability in what terms people prefer.

293
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:40,360
And so I think there's a move to birthing person in length in materials about pregnancy to reduce terms that

294
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:48,380
might be particularly offensive to folks who are most marginalized or at least represented in in materials.

295
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:59,290
So specifically, to your question about people first, I think there are some communities that are particularly concerned about that language.

296
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:04,630
I see a rejection of people first language, particularly in the neurodivergent community,

297
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:08,770
where some folks actually like to be referred to as an autistic person.

298
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:13,690
And again, there's a ton of variability about preferred language.

299
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:14,470
But to your point,

300
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:22,600
for folks for whom and an autism diagnosis is really sort of central to their lived experience or is a reclaiming of that is neutral.

301
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:30,280
But I think in general, the sort of deep personalization of a diagnosis from a person is standard for respectful communication.

302
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:35,830
So in materials that are targeting a lot of people default to that.

303
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:41,770
And then if you happen to work at a community where you know there's a strong preference for something else, that's when you might adopt it.

304
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:45,580
I don't know if you have other examples. We'll talk about sort of wait terminology, obviously later in this class.

305
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:52,600
But I think in the autism community, that's where I particularly noted that concern I seem to have hearing in this community.

306
00:37:52,600 --> 00:38:00,750
Yes, that's that's very strong. But I don't I don't think so much in terms of just having a disease and a medical diagnosis.

307
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:06,520
Yeah, I think that's true with the deaf community identifies that JavaScript.

308
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:10,250
OK. Using the active voice, using the active voices.

309
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:19,730
Oh, but before we talk about that, you know, I like to talk to you about the passive voice sentence is a sentence like this one?

310
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:25,480
You will be placed on the special guys after your surgery. And so it's a sentence that has two parts.

311
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:31,120
It has the verb to be, plus the particle of another verb.

312
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:37,150
The problem is passive voice. It can be very confusing and awkward sometimes.

313
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:46,750
For example, the drugs are delivered directly into the reference in your because like if you do a catheter, if you phrase it in active voice,

314
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:56,730
it sounds a lot more natural and direct epidural catheter delivers the drugs directly into the ambulance, and you'll be.

315
00:38:56,730 --> 00:39:04,860
I voice another problem it can disguise who is doing what you will be closely monitored during an infusion of your stem cells with

316
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:11,670
weakened vital signs you want be closely monitored doesn't say who's going to be doing the monitoring and this can be confusing.

317
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:16,740
Situation is not good at the moment because it might kill to do good monitoring.

318
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:21,840
Do I have to do the monitoring? So it's very important to take it very clearly.

319
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:28,710
We will monitor you closely with frequency vital signs during your stem cell infusion.

320
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:33,870
Another reason why we do not like passive voice. It's often longer, it's usually longer.

321
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:43,600
And whenever you compound sentence in passive voice that has been converted to active voice, the active voice sentence is going to be shorter.

322
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:51,900
And the other reason why you don't like the passive voice is because it places the patient in a passive world, right?

323
00:39:51,900 --> 00:40:00,330
You will be placed on a special diet after your surgery. Active voice is more than calorie after surgery you will follow.

324
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:03,870
A special diet is much more empowering.

325
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:14,310
And this idea came to me when I was listening to one of my favorite podcasts, The Hidden Brain on NPR, who has listened to the human brain.

326
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:19,350
You have lots of people, isn't it great? It's such a good show.

327
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:24,270
It talks about social science research and how it applies to our lives.

328
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:32,550
So back in 2015 16, the Thanksgiving episode, he was talking about the Thanksgiving meal and how,

329
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:36,360
you know, to avoid overeating and eating too much during this meal.

330
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:43,530
And they were talking about this research, which was actually done by linguistics, which still shows.

331
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:53,190
And the purpose of the study was to measure the effect of self-talk before making a choice between a healthy food and healthy food.

332
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:58,140
So they took a group of students and they divided them into tools.

333
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:04,290
But all of the students were given the choice between a candy bar.

334
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:10,350
One group was instructed to use the words I can't and then make their choice.

335
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:15,450
The other group was instructed to use the words I don't and make a choice.

336
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:22,920
And what they found is that in the group that used the words I can't, less than 40 percent made the right choice.

337
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:26,320
But with the group of students who use the roads, I don't.

338
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:35,610
More than 75 percent made the right choice, so words clearly have a very strong effect on our actions.

339
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:38,850
This is called actually semantic framing.

340
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:51,960
It's actually a concept in statistics that conveys the idea that different words give us different views of reality.

341
00:41:51,960 --> 00:42:00,150
When you use the word camp, it's disempowering because it implies that somebody is making the choice for you when you

342
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:06,870
use the words donkeys and pound because it implies that you are in charge for your actions.

343
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:13,980
And it's the same thing applies in using the passive and the active voice when we use the passive voice.

344
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:16,230
It plays the patient in a positive role.

345
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:22,440
Now, our goal as health care providers is to empower patients to take responsibility for managing their health.

346
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:29,250
So therefore we need to use the active voice, which is more empowering.

347
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:35,970
The next principle is using common words, using plain language alternatives for medical wards.

348
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:43,110
So, for example, instead of hypertension, we're going to use high blood pressure instead of myocardial infarctions.

349
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:45,360
We're going to say heart attack. I don't know.

350
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:52,260
Who knows with myocardial infarction is really the general public, but everybody knows what a heart attack is, right?

351
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:57,600
Instead of alopecia, which they have lost instead of lipids.

352
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:06,270
You just say fat. Also, we want to avoid jargon and medical lingo.

353
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:12,900
So, for example, instead of using the word onset, we're just going to say start instead of really strong medication.

354
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:16,280
We always come across these so many times they get handouts.

355
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:24,420
They say, administer the patient and we change it to either give medication or take medication instead of experience symptom we use.

356
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:32,910
The words have symptoms just to show the world is. The other we'd fabricate is another word that I came across in one of the handouts.

357
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:40,260
I just changed it to make hospitalization. We don't like that word because it's really so wrong.

358
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:46,230
Can Photoshop roads like hospital are easier to weed than hospitalization?

359
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:51,060
And also, our convention is not to use the words physicians to use the word doctor or surgeon,

360
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:57,150
dietitian, etc. So where would you find plain language alternatives?

361
00:43:57,150 --> 00:44:03,810
And this was your assignment right before the class is to access the plain language medical dictionary.

362
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:10,740
In this section, it was developed actually by off by your library, the Health Sciences Library, Taubman and Associates Library.

363
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:16,140
Their librarians developed this little app called the Plain Language Medical Dictionary,

364
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:22,590
that it has about, I think, about 2000 definitions for medical terms.

365
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:26,460
We also like this NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms.

366
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:32,300
It has a lot more tools. It has over 8000 films. The problem is that the definitions of al-Maliki countries.

367
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:47,620
You're not going to find because medical language has tens of thousand Typekit.

368
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:52,220
Dozens of thousands of films, and we don't have plain language alternatives for all of them.

369
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:59,200
So when that comes up and how much clarity they need to provide a definition yourself.

370
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:04,280
So just come up with your own information in plain language and just.

371
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:14,240
Incorporated into the body of the text, otherwise to use and explain medical terminology is to use illustrations,

372
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:19,880
especially with anatomical terms, it's very helpful to have a new situation or photograph.

373
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:25,460
We can also sometimes we use a glass only if we have a booklet that's very long.

374
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:30,680
That really uses a lot of medical lingo that would create a shock last week and would

375
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:37,010
put it at the beginning of the booklet so you can use one or more of these methods,

376
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:44,920
but make sure that you explain that the width is not going to come across any wall that they are going to need to look at.

377
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:50,930
Not just we now have another.

378
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:59,420
Another issue with using easy woes is to avoid confusing instructions, and these are mostly those acronyms,

379
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:04,280
and we all use acronyms all the time because it was so, so, so long, right?

380
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:09,140
So we all use acronyms, but we have to make sure that we explain those acronyms.

381
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:15,620
We also want to remember that the same acronym may have different meanings to different people.

382
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:17,900
And one of my example is the NHL.

383
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:25,880
The NHL means something completely different in the cancer center than it does for just the regular person on the street.

384
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:36,650
The other confusing words that we want to avoid as those using different words to describe is this constant avoiding those synonyms,

385
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:43,250
which we already talked about at the beginning. What placement can also make a big difference?

386
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:47,180
For example, if you feel dizzy, faint or lightheaded,

387
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:55,560
especially after you stand up for lying or sitting position at any time you're taking a distract from.

388
00:46:55,560 --> 00:47:03,210
It's kind of a long sentence, right? By the time that I got to contact your doctor, I already forgot why I need to contact them in the morning.

389
00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:09,810
But listen to this. Any time I've taking this drug product to doctor, if you feel dizzy,

390
00:47:09,810 --> 00:47:17,160
faint or lightheaded, especially after you stand up from a line of sitting position.

391
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:23,280
So just changing those words makes the information more understandable.

392
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:30,840
And depression is better because the main idea, which is contact your doctor any time you're taking this drug,

393
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:37,690
you know you start with the big, the more general good comes first.

394
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:46,530
Another thing I wanted to mention, and this has to do with the issue of of numeracy is percentages,

395
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:55,050
so we always want to use frequencies rather than percentages. So instead of saying 60 percent, we say six out of 10.

396
00:47:55,050 --> 00:48:01,470
Instead of saying 36 percent, we say 36 percent, we say 36 out of 100.

397
00:48:01,470 --> 00:48:10,440
And this actually comes out of research that was done here at the School of Public Health by Professor Brian Zygmunt Fisher a few years ago.

398
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:18,600
He did a study to see what is more understandable to people, and it was very, very clear that the frequencies are more understandable.

399
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:23,130
And he says it's because they identified the reference group of the question.

400
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:30,390
That is, the group of people being targeted, short sentences and short paragraph.

401
00:48:30,390 --> 00:48:33,960
And this is a nice quote which gets in the way here.

402
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:38,580
Forgive me for writing such a long letter. I didn't have time to write a short one.

403
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:43,230
And that is so true because writing short requires a lot more flexibility.

404
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:55,380
It's a lot easier to write long. The benefits of shows are, of course, that show the units of text are more manageable and less intimidating.

405
00:48:55,380 --> 00:49:00,650
They're also small bytes of information out easier to digest.

406
00:49:00,650 --> 00:49:08,660
Short sentences avoid confusion. You want to be aware of what we call compounded sentences, compiled and sentence,

407
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:20,960
because at least two independent clauses that have related ideas and independent clause, unlike dependent laws, can stand alone as its own sentence.

408
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:32,130
So here's an example here. And this is this was actually this comes from a brochure about the visit of policy back in the day,

409
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:37,320
the University of Michigan health system welcomes loved ones to visit patients because we know how

410
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:42,480
important it is for their healing to have family and friends with them during hospitalization.

411
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:49,260
And we know that informed family members lead to better outcomes to patients.

412
00:49:49,260 --> 00:50:05,000
How many classes do you think are in this sentence? Can someone identify how many dependent clause independence clauses we have?

413
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,050
Yep. Three. That's right. We have three.

414
00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:18,200
And actually the cube. How this connecting worlds like because and and and we can just replace them with a new.

415
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:22,200
Right. And it's just going to be a lot easier to understand.

416
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:29,390
University of Michigan Health System welcomes not going to visit patients we recognize with family and friends.

417
00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:37,400
Close. It's doing it with the patient during a hospital stay is helpful and conducive to healing.

418
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:46,120
Keeping family members in front leads to better outcomes for patients. So this very long sentences, actually.

419
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:59,950
And also, by the way, when we split it into three because we got rid of the ones, because in end we actually had now words of.

420
00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:06,880
So the average sentence length is 20 words we never, ever want to go beyond 40.

421
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:11,140
So I actually use my computer to counter words in sentences, in a long sentence.

422
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:14,140
If I have more than 40 for sure, I know I have to split it up.

423
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:23,440
But something even shorter sentences, even like a twenty five year old sentence has, is a compounded sentence and should be scrapped.

424
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:30,310
We also want to use short paragraphs. We limit the paragraph to one topic or five policies.

425
00:51:30,310 --> 00:51:35,740
We introduced the topic in the first sentence. That is the idea of the gentleman first.

426
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:44,590
We aim for no more than seven lines. I say I am for no more than half a page with one point five line spacing.

427
00:51:44,590 --> 00:51:54,640
That would be the maximum length of rough. I want to make sure that you understand that this doesn't impact the number of pages,

428
00:51:54,640 --> 00:52:01,270
so the number of pages for document doesn't mean that it is longer or shorter.

429
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:11,410
Because if you try, you know, it's a longer term booklet, for example, and you want to have less pages, you will shrink the font size,

430
00:52:11,410 --> 00:52:17,830
you would shrink the large spaces, you will use less pages, but you actually make your material more difficult to read.

431
00:52:17,830 --> 00:52:23,440
And I can't tell you how many times people tell me make sure it fits in one page.

432
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,860
Make sure it fits in two pages. Why do you want?

433
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:31,690
Why is that important? It actually doesn't matter how many pages are in the document.

434
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:40,300
In plain language guidelines don't have a limit on the number of pages that indicate a material is more or less understandable.

435
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:49,660
And the principle here is that comprehension takes precedent for shortening the length of the document, the number of pages to document,

436
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:59,110
and we have to remember the simple language and formatting for ease of reading actually increase the number of pages in the document.

437
00:52:59,110 --> 00:53:07,180
We also want to avoid using hidden verbs. This is a really good way to avoid wilderness sentences like the doctor.

438
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:14,530
We've conducted an explanation. The doctor will examine it will cause a reduction.

439
00:53:14,530 --> 00:53:20,590
It will reduce. So all of these hidden verbs will end world and I documents.

440
00:53:20,590 --> 00:53:25,710
We will make a determination. We will determine.

441
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:32,880
The six points to Palestine language is implementing easy to win design features, and there are several elements to this.

442
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,130
One is the use of white space.

443
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:48,030
In a document use of bulleted lists, you select those using the appropriate fonts, using the appropriate emphasis and using images and illustrations.

444
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:52,200
One space in the document is really an important element.

445
00:53:52,200 --> 00:54:01,560
We actually call it an active space because it really aids in understanding it creates a text structure that guides the reader to work with people.

446
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:07,470
And here is a really good example. We have the same sentence imposed by the same paragraph.

447
00:54:07,470 --> 00:54:11,160
Everything is the same. The same font faces the same font size.

448
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:19,260
The only difference is the line spacing, which one is easier to read.

449
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:27,030
If I was. Well, and spacing is easier to read, and it's also easier to edit when you write,

450
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:32,940
even though even if you are required to submit something in standard lines passing 1.0,

451
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:39,890
I always like to increase the line spacing, do my editing and then bring it back down to what?

452
00:54:39,890 --> 00:54:45,530
We also really like the use of vertical lines, and this is an element that is not only a design element,

453
00:54:45,530 --> 00:54:51,970
it's a language element to very kind of what it at least highlight the number, the serial numbers.

454
00:54:51,970 --> 00:54:59,780
I'm usually clear wait lists how the level of importance because we can test bullets within each other.

455
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:04,160
They have the use and understand the order in which things happen.

456
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:09,680
You also make it easier for the user to identify all necessary steps in the process.

457
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:13,190
And it's a graphical element because when we take a sentence,

458
00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:19,460
a long sentence or a paragraph and we break it down into a very quick list, it adds more white space.

459
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:26,630
So for all of these reasons, list of the ideal way to present items, conditions and exceptions.

460
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:33,560
So here's an example of a sentence that would work much better as a bulleted list.

461
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:37,370
Alzheimer's disease has its share of safety hazards.

462
00:55:37,370 --> 00:55:46,580
Everyday activities such as driving a car, chopping vegetables, getting the white water temperature or turning the stove off.

463
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:52,760
So again, you know, by the time that I got to the stove, I already forgot what was the importance of this whole thing.

464
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:58,970
Now, when we change it into a list, then we have a generalized sentence at the beginning.

465
00:55:58,970 --> 00:56:03,260
Everyday activities may be dangerous for people with Alzheimer's disease.

466
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:14,030
They should avoid driving chopping vegetables, setting the water temperature when taking a shower, operating a stove.

467
00:56:14,030 --> 00:56:27,110
This looks better. Anybody know how? Why? Why is this better than listing it in a long sentence?

468
00:56:27,110 --> 00:56:32,820
Yeah, but I'll have to start at the beginning of the sentence just to see like what could be a problem.

469
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:35,750
Just like you can start at them first.

470
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:42,540
Yeah, you could start anywhere on the list to like if you just want to reference the list, you don't have to like, read through the whole thing.

471
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:46,990
Oh, yeah, right? Mm. Easier to be that way.

472
00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:51,490
Any other idea anybody take Nigerian Joy Science?

473
00:56:51,490 --> 00:56:56,870
You know, the maybe. What is politics,

474
00:56:56,870 --> 00:57:01,650
do they create a little pause between which one of these elements and that falls

475
00:57:01,650 --> 00:57:07,760
allows us to absolve this chocolate from it before we move into the next thing?

476
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:12,170
And this is why it's easier for Boeing to absolve the whole thing.

477
00:57:12,170 --> 00:57:19,700
One more like bullets, we want to mark them in what we call a parallel way, and that means that each bullet will have the same structure.

478
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:27,530
They will either all start with a verb or start with a noun with adverbs, because we're all about action.

479
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:35,280
And we want to empower our leaders. But sometimes verbs just don't work, and then you can use a noun.

480
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:38,840
You also want to make sure that we use the same field tense.

481
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:48,230
We can capitalize each bullet the same way and we use periods the same way, so we either use billions or all of them or none of them.

482
00:57:48,230 --> 00:57:54,070
This is a list of bullets, and one of those bullets is not consistent with the rest.

483
00:57:54,070 --> 00:58:02,520
Um, do you have any idea as to which one is not consistent?

484
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:10,740
Not the second, the second, you are smart because all of them are starting with a verb and this one is starting with some noun,

485
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:22,980
so the way that we voted them on, starting with the verb, all the verb selling the same tense because here also develops in different tenses.

486
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:30,600
You know, someone plays it simple and somone, but it wasn't a message.

487
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:42,380
Fields are all in the same tents. And the second bullet we just gave you to give your child a warm bath before before shoulder time.

488
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:47,810
This is a politics list. Those two options here.

489
00:58:47,810 --> 00:58:56,210
Which one do you think is better? The one on the left or the one on the right.

490
00:58:56,210 --> 00:59:03,200
Somebody must have an. Yep.

491
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:07,190
The one on the right, because it's like more spaced out between the bullet points.

492
00:59:07,190 --> 00:59:14,420
Exactly. You have a little bit more space and so it allows you when you have more than one line and a bullet,

493
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:18,680
you need that extra space to allow your brain to say, Okay, that's the breaks.

494
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:28,220
I need to understand this central and forward Typekit step is make it very easy to take in complex information at a glance.

495
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:38,060
It makes it easy to operate specific provisions. They also say words, and they make a leap of logic and your structure is clear.

496
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:47,060
You think this is very useful for us when we have communication protocols because some of those education protocols can be really, really complicated.

497
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:58,940
It's also really useful for your world intuition because you like diets and you're right, sometimes you have to change what you eat at certain times.

498
00:59:58,940 --> 01:00:04,850
So I find that using capers is also relevant to your field.

499
01:00:04,850 --> 01:00:13,100
This is an example. During the first phase of your treatment, you will be receiving chemotherapy and radiation at the same time.

500
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:16,280
This is also called compound treatment.

501
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:23,570
This phase will last for 10 weeks and include and include six weeks of treatment and a four week break at the end.

502
01:00:23,570 --> 01:00:27,140
After the break, you will have an MRI and lab work done,

503
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:32,000
and then you will start cyclic thing without treatment, which was discussed in another handout.

504
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:36,050
So this is a very, very warm and very complex information dose.

505
01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:45,590
Lots of numbers, lots of phases. In order to really understand it, I think anyone would have to wait it several times and a table can really help.

506
01:00:45,590 --> 01:00:52,370
Now, the difference between bullets and a cable is that bullets replace a narrative sentence or paragraph.

507
01:00:52,370 --> 01:01:02,000
A table is edited, not take out that long sentence or paragraph long before we just add another table that helps us to understand.

508
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:08,810
And this helps the three of those kernels helps us to understand there was a phase before we want to find.

509
01:01:08,810 --> 01:01:19,910
And in those weeks you get radiation Monday to Friday, Typekit mother every day and then once a week you have sat down with six to 10 a break.

510
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:29,970
I'll do anything at the end of the 10th week. You go to my labs and then we can live with in the next phase will be interesting.

511
01:01:29,970 --> 01:01:37,740
This is a different graphical element that is very, very important for understanding and readability.

512
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:46,700
Does anybody have any idea what I'm trying to talk about here? Yeah, the color is white.

513
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:49,550
Yes, we're talking about contrast.

514
01:01:49,550 --> 01:01:59,600
And you can see that the right side, it's much easier to read because there is no contrast between the letters and object Typekit.

515
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:04,730
But this is the same contrast, the same color, just the reverse.

516
01:02:04,730 --> 01:02:11,010
Which side do you think it's easier to read? Yeah.

517
01:02:11,010 --> 01:02:19,000
The left on the right one, and that's that is true.

518
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:25,730
This is the actual guideline from the is don't kid for ease of reading, use dark colored text on very light.

519
01:02:25,730 --> 01:02:31,730
Not listed in brown, black and white or cream colored close to bacon is best.

520
01:02:31,730 --> 01:02:40,730
It's easier to read. Now I do want to say I have a disclaimer this is no accommodation for weight weighted materials when materials are on a screen,

521
01:02:40,730 --> 01:02:47,190
when there is a projection in the back. It's easier to read a reverse print.

522
01:02:47,190 --> 01:02:54,420
It's easier than it is to hear, but we don't, you know, we try to avoid it.

523
01:02:54,420 --> 01:03:01,180
Here again, it's another one of the one of the guidelines, one of my favorite ones use of color.

524
01:03:01,180 --> 01:03:07,410
Resist the impulse to use color in a decorative way that may distract people from the text.

525
01:03:07,410 --> 01:03:14,550
We have to remember people like to use color. I think I see it, especially in very Paddock's materials.

526
01:03:14,550 --> 01:03:25,530
Dieticians like to decorate their pictures, there's a lot of cartoons and use of color where it should be done very strategically for emphasis,

527
01:03:25,530 --> 01:03:31,710
for when you want to make a difference, you want to emphasize the difference between two things.

528
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:37,050
But if you use it just ready for decorative reasons, it's going to be very distracting.

529
01:03:37,050 --> 01:03:50,430
This is an example of how it's really not needed, and this is a flier that we did for preventing soldier is fighting frictions, exercise.

530
01:03:50,430 --> 01:03:54,390
And there was a committee in the health system and they had all kinds of accommodation,

531
01:03:54,390 --> 01:04:01,980
including information of education, and they wanted to make the handoff. They said, We want images, we want cargo, we want to make it user friendly.

532
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:05,790
So we said, look, we cannot use the whole background in the jurors.

533
01:04:05,790 --> 01:04:09,360
We can't do that. It's hard to read. So we compromise with them.

534
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:15,180
We had one sentence in the sprint and then the rest, as you can see, is dark over white collar.

535
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:22,710
This was published. I don't remember maybe a couple of years ago, but it's a week or two after that.

536
01:04:22,710 --> 01:04:31,800
We started to get phone calls from units. So nursing units say you, you change this because this uses a lot of color, right?

537
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:38,610
Because the print, all this blue background uses a lot of color in the printer, and then they have to change the car to the edge.

538
01:04:38,610 --> 01:04:42,570
And then you have good strength and it's just not very practical.

539
01:04:42,570 --> 01:04:46,320
And so we said, sure, of course. And we took the color out.

540
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:50,730
I don't think it's less funny or less engaging, and it's much easier to print.

541
01:04:50,730 --> 01:04:59,820
So these practical issues also need to be considered, and this kind of reminds me of of the high, you know, stiletto shoes.

542
01:04:59,820 --> 01:05:04,470
They look really nice. You know, they make you look policemen, but they're not really practical.

543
01:05:04,470 --> 01:05:08,520
I don't wear them, and I know none of you are wearing them.

544
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:17,550
Very interesting. I also want to talk to you about selecting the right foot and before I tell you which are the right forms to use.

545
01:05:17,550 --> 01:05:24,090
We need to understand those two classes of forms, both very formal and demonstrative.

546
01:05:24,090 --> 01:05:30,900
The first forms are the ones with times new Roman. They have the little tags back here.

547
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:39,030
The nonstandard forms don't have those stocks. Just straight lines also still feels like area is a good example of the.

548
01:05:39,030 --> 01:05:43,800
And here is the same sentence. Everything is the same same space.

549
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:49,830
Things that emphasize the only difference is the font size. And here I have another question for you.

550
01:05:49,830 --> 01:05:57,800
Which one is easier to do with the right side of the left side? Yeah, go ahead.

551
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:58,920
Yeah.

552
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:10,320
The right side, the right side, I should have said to you guys, this is my trick question because this is different in print versus on the screen.

553
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:17,050
The reason all of you probably thought it was the right size is because this is the non-self does not have.

554
01:06:17,050 --> 01:06:21,840
So there was no contrast between the letters and the bacon, and they pop.

555
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:33,540
But the stuff so actually help us to read because they keep an eye in a horizontal line as really as to make each letter more distinct than the other.

556
01:06:33,540 --> 01:06:39,990
And so it's easier for brands to distinguish between letters and make sense of them and we need them.

557
01:06:39,990 --> 01:06:48,150
But like I said, this is the recommendation for and then not for material.

558
01:06:48,150 --> 01:06:58,800
So what we recommend is really cool, man. I shouldn't say we will explain no guidelines instruct us to use a cellphone for the title of the heading.

559
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:08,030
So tough. But then for the paragraph, you want to use a search trying.

560
01:07:08,030 --> 01:07:14,660
And I guess that is the conditions are for printed materials, for compensation, for example, like this one?

561
01:07:14,660 --> 01:07:21,950
It's better to use it because conservatives are using all caps.

562
01:07:21,950 --> 01:07:27,320
That's kind of my biggest crusade. You have the same word.

563
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:40,620
One is in all caps. One is a mix of apple and lowercase letters, which one is easier to read.

564
01:07:40,620 --> 01:07:45,580
It's pretty clear, guys. Yeah, go ahead. I mean, I think it's the one on the right.

565
01:07:45,580 --> 01:07:49,500
So yes, it's definitely easier to read on cops.

566
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:56,010
I'll have to wait. Does anybody know how to read?

567
01:07:56,010 --> 01:08:01,500
There's actually a reason for it. Yeah.

568
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:07,500
Well, to me, like I look at like the tall letters and the short letters, and you can kind of see the shape of the word.

569
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:11,580
So then it clicks in your brain a little easier. I wasn't worried about it.

570
01:08:11,580 --> 01:08:12,780
That's exactly right.

571
01:08:12,780 --> 01:08:20,730
The reason I have to wait is because all the letters of the same height and same with when there are small differences between the letters,

572
01:08:20,730 --> 01:08:24,090
it's easier to identify them and delete them.

573
01:08:24,090 --> 01:08:31,260
Now, when I taught this class, here was two or three years ago, one of the students remember that she said, Oh, well, you know,

574
01:08:31,260 --> 01:08:39,060
a few years ago, the City of New York changed all of the street signs, from all cops to a mix of Apple and lower case letters.

575
01:08:39,060 --> 01:08:48,180
And I actually looked it up, and that was true. So thank you all for the students who came from your class in 2000.

576
01:08:48,180 --> 01:08:58,710
One was in 2000 set a time. The City of New York spent almost 28 million dollars to replace all of the street signs from.

577
01:08:58,710 --> 01:09:03,390
They used to be all in Apple case, and now the legal case and Twitter makes sense.

578
01:09:03,390 --> 01:09:06,210
Apple sticks around a bit longer to read,

579
01:09:06,210 --> 01:09:14,910
so if you're driving a car and you don't need to make a turn and you have to take a little bit more time to read the name of the street,

580
01:09:14,910 --> 01:09:17,630
that leads to an accident.

581
01:09:17,630 --> 01:09:27,700
And so this is why the Department of Transportation, they basically told the City of New York, it causes accidents, you have to replace them.

582
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:32,560
And plain language guidelines say very clearly for all of your text,

583
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:41,050
including the title from the head of the upper and lower case letters in combination and nothing ever written in Holy Cross.

584
01:09:41,050 --> 01:09:43,420
And in fact, I drink this down so much.

585
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:52,270
My daughter is a graduate student at U.T., and she sent me a screenshot from the campus Typekit, one of our instructor, and she said.

586
01:09:52,270 --> 01:09:54,820
Am I right to say this is really hard to read?

587
01:09:54,820 --> 01:10:06,430
Yes, it's very hard to reduce a lot of all caps, so we don't ever want to use all caps, but we can use both print, right?

588
01:10:06,430 --> 01:10:12,010
It really is. Where is it? We understand with an emphasis that way.

589
01:10:12,010 --> 01:10:18,910
Another way to emphasize text is to put it in a box. And we do that when we have like a very important sentence,

590
01:10:18,910 --> 01:10:27,910
like do not take more than 3000 milligrams of Tylenol to get that in the box this way because the attention of the reader.

591
01:10:27,910 --> 01:10:35,920
We can also just increase the size of one or two words to make them bigger cups,

592
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:41,530
and we can also change the color of one of two lines to make them stand out.

593
01:10:41,530 --> 01:10:48,870
We don't ever want to use fancy or squint lettering because that's just simply hard to read.

594
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:53,500
Also, limit the use of his colleagues. I don't know. I still don't use italics.

595
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:58,450
I don't use italics or tools like if I, you know,

596
01:10:58,450 --> 01:11:06,340
we have a lot of diaries that we want patients to fill out and you guys are going to be using those a lot of people to fill out,

597
01:11:06,340 --> 01:11:11,140
like for two years and sometimes even example of how to fill out the diary.

598
01:11:11,140 --> 01:11:15,310
Then I would use italics, but for whatever reason, also,

599
01:11:15,310 --> 01:11:25,150
we stay away from underarms because those the other line is also makes it more difficult to read when we use balding.

600
01:11:25,150 --> 01:11:34,120
This is my example to say you have to be strategic about which word it shows toward when you put too many words.

601
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:42,010
It just loses its effectiveness justification.

602
01:11:42,010 --> 01:11:47,260
Well, you see, here is the same sentence.

603
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:52,060
One is justified to the left, and this is what we call full justification.

604
01:11:52,060 --> 01:11:58,390
Well, you have this rigid margin on both sides, not only on the left side, but also on the right side.

605
01:11:58,390 --> 01:12:12,480
And this is very hard to read. Does anybody have an idea as to why it's so how to we feel justified?

606
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:20,000
No. Isn't that like when they're the same, you can kind of like lose your place and be in the wrong line?

607
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:28,250
You lose your place, that's exactly like you use the place because then in order to make that rigid white male game, you have to change the spacing.

608
01:12:28,250 --> 01:12:35,150
The spacing between the walls is not consistent, and that makes it is more difficult to read.

609
01:12:35,150 --> 01:12:44,540
So they have which guidelines say to us for is avoiding use less justification throughout your material, also for the text and the headings.

610
01:12:44,540 --> 01:12:47,180
And this is something I have to say that we, you know,

611
01:12:47,180 --> 01:12:53,120
I look back at materials appropriated four years ago, eight years ago, and we were not so strict.

612
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:59,060
And sometimes we have had things that were centered and now we move them on to the left because then you can skimp.

613
01:12:59,060 --> 01:13:11,490
It's easier to skim to get to what you need. And in fact, research has shown that we do sometimes overlook a headache that is centered.

614
01:13:11,490 --> 01:13:23,910
Use of illustrations in assertions are very helpful for all of us as usual, people, when you see something, it makes it easier to understand.

615
01:13:23,910 --> 01:13:34,080
But I wanted to show you this installation. It's an article about tanks and it has an illustration.

616
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:43,170
It's not a bad illustration because it shows you kind of the context of where in recent times you need to be aware of ticks.

617
01:13:43,170 --> 01:13:50,400
But we show different illustrations for the same topic.

618
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:55,950
We actually could end up consuming it at sea.

619
01:13:55,950 --> 01:14:09,040
Yeah, because I opened. Oh, you opened a tab here, I opened it probably on the other screen now you opened.

620
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:19,080
Oh, you can do that too.

621
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:27,540
Oh, just beautiful. We have.

622
01:14:27,540 --> 01:14:33,960
You know, I think they're all just going to focus, so.

623
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:41,670
All right. That's yep, that's what I want to just see. So you can see here, we actually found a picture of the actual two.

624
01:14:41,670 --> 01:14:50,280
So it's not a very sure the picture. It's not, you know, it's not decorative fixtures, but it's educational in pictures.

625
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:57,310
The really one thing you need to look out for and I can't see it on you.

626
01:14:57,310 --> 01:15:04,950
But then we actually found an illustration of what you need to do if you do find a tick on your skin.

627
01:15:04,950 --> 01:15:12,570
And another not very decorative picture of the bullseye rash date in connection to.

628
01:15:12,570 --> 01:15:23,700
So yes, that is true. It's not really appealing. It's not really indicative, but it is educational and that really is how how we choose.

629
01:15:23,700 --> 01:15:36,280
Let's see. And that is really the collective reality chosen illustrations and graphical elements is we want to choose

630
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:44,020
graphical elements and illustrations and photographs that support the educational content of the handle.

631
01:15:44,020 --> 01:15:55,330
This is I found this. I think I found it on the American Diabetes Association website about three diabetes.

632
01:15:55,330 --> 01:16:01,150
So they tried to illustrate graphically the different stages of diabetes.

633
01:16:01,150 --> 01:16:04,690
And we didn't know.

634
01:16:04,690 --> 01:16:09,400
Not at all. Yeah, you forgot exactly what that means.

635
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:16,190
Yeah, we have still to determine if you have all my blood blood sugar for diabetes or diabetes.

636
01:16:16,190 --> 01:16:22,540
You think this is helpful for the people? I think you said no.

637
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:27,730
It's the same. Excuse me, we all look the same side are not the same.

638
01:16:27,730 --> 01:16:35,280
Yeah, I haven't seen this in a while and I'm having trouble figuring out which is which.

639
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:38,730
What other things are the elements so confusing here? Yeah.

640
01:16:38,730 --> 01:16:46,140
What do you think? They probably don't know the acronym for the oral glucose test or whatever of FPGAs.

641
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:54,300
They probably don't. They also you can see those mathematical symbols, the greater motive and less than those symbols.

642
01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:59,560
Those are not understandable for laypeople. I mean, you guys, you see them right away.

643
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:05,310
My doctors, nurses, do you understand them right away? But like, people really don't understand it.

644
01:17:05,310 --> 01:17:14,030
And so what we did? We also, Benjamin also had percentages, so we just modified it.

645
01:17:14,030 --> 01:17:22,430
We don't use percentages. And we also avoided using those mathematical symbols,

646
01:17:22,430 --> 01:17:27,920
and we did use color to illustrate like what is normal, what is prediabetes and what is diabetes.

647
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:35,740
And you can see that this table is a lot more simpler and much easier to understand.

648
01:17:35,740 --> 01:17:41,180
We also don't want to expect too little to calculate. We need to provide illustrations,

649
01:17:41,180 --> 01:17:48,950
graphs and charts to help the reader to calculate because I don't normally see scales of the general public kind of law.

650
01:17:48,950 --> 01:17:58,610
What's this? This was the this came from our hand out about prediabetes, and the instructions will make half of your plate.

651
01:17:58,610 --> 01:18:03,230
Non-starchy made one quarter of your plate glaze or starchy vegetables.

652
01:18:03,230 --> 01:18:15,050
Make one quarter of your plate a lean or plant. 14 and you can see that the illustration is really helpful here because they explain

653
01:18:15,050 --> 01:18:19,610
exactly what is the what is they have and what is a quarter and how that works.

654
01:18:19,610 --> 01:18:27,690
And I have to say this is just the regular report that you found.

655
01:18:27,690 --> 01:18:34,170
Here's another example of communicating risk information and mathematical information.

656
01:18:34,170 --> 01:18:43,770
And this is a handout that is given to people who are about to have surgery and don't want those patients to buy kindly.

657
01:18:43,770 --> 01:18:47,670
Joe supplements and those supplements are not covered by insurance.

658
01:18:47,670 --> 01:18:53,970
That means that the patient needs to spend about 60 dollars out of pocket money for those supplements.

659
01:18:53,970 --> 01:18:56,610
Of course, a lot of people very reluctant,

660
01:18:56,610 --> 01:19:03,000
and they wanted to write a handout to expand why it's really is worth your while to spend those sixty dollars.

661
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:10,380
And this was the sentence. An NIH funded study conducted here at the University of Michigan showed that cranberry

662
01:19:10,380 --> 01:19:18,110
supplementation after gynecologic surgery reduces the risk of developing a UTI by 50 percent.

663
01:19:18,110 --> 01:19:26,090
So that's pretty strong. But it's a little bit vague, and it also doesn't really explain what the difference is.

664
01:19:26,090 --> 01:19:36,050
Why do you use a photograph like this one? It shows you more clearly what is the effect of this of supplementation?

665
01:19:36,050 --> 01:19:41,330
And you can see that in women that are not taking this supplement.

666
01:19:41,330 --> 01:19:52,310
Forty eight out of 100 developed into I after the surgery hit a urinary tract infection, but also took the supplement only 19 out of 100.

667
01:19:52,310 --> 01:20:01,220
Heather UTIs So 19 out of the 38 didn't have the intervention really impacted.

668
01:20:01,220 --> 01:20:11,660
Not 50 percent of people who underwent the surgery, but really only 20 percent 19 out of out of 100.

669
01:20:11,660 --> 01:20:17,780
And this is why creating the pictographs to explain this information is really important.

670
01:20:17,780 --> 01:20:20,780
And this is also the work that came out of your school.

671
01:20:20,780 --> 01:20:30,890
Hugh and Professor, Bi-Xenon Fisher actually created a very nice site called IQ in a way dot com that we used to create those pics above,

672
01:20:30,890 --> 01:20:36,350
and it's also listed in your resource list. It's very easy to do.

673
01:20:36,350 --> 01:20:43,700
The fact was not walking for a while. Yeah, I don't know why it wasn't working for a while, but now it's back.

674
01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:48,270
It's declined. I think they did something for.

675
01:20:48,270 --> 01:21:00,190
I don't know if it's OK. I think they're doing good in time so I can talk to you a little bit about the reading level.

676
01:21:00,190 --> 01:21:05,330
And this used to come up a lot at the beginning when I was first starting with my program

677
01:21:05,330 --> 01:21:11,120
that I would get a phone call like what I was supposed to ride to sixth grade level,

678
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:18,230
fourth grade level it. The thing is, it's also one of those myths about plain language,

679
01:21:18,230 --> 01:21:24,470
and the myth is that plain language means sliding to a lower reading level and that these materials where

680
01:21:24,470 --> 01:21:31,280
we can also be living level with sex a little in the first place would make them more understandable.

681
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:41,420
That is simply not true. Writing to achieve a grade level score doesn't guarantee clarity or comprehension.

682
01:21:41,420 --> 01:21:52,070
And the problem with lying on the piano putting too much emphasis on the reading level is because there are many readability testing tools,

683
01:21:52,070 --> 01:22:00,770
and all of them are basically mathematical formulas. They just count the number of letters in a world and the number of words in the sentence.

684
01:22:00,770 --> 01:22:11,330
They are not. They don't mention comprehension. And also, if they text in a different reading level, test is going to give you a different score.

685
01:22:11,330 --> 01:22:15,470
There is no one test that is like no better than the others.

686
01:22:15,470 --> 01:22:23,240
And another problem which I think is the biggest problem with those readability formulas is that they don't consider that

687
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:31,040
localization layout and design an image so you can have a text in a very small little font and no line spacing test,

688
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:36,380
the fourth grade reading level. But it's definitely not understandable and not actionable.

689
01:22:36,380 --> 01:22:40,500
The Typekit actually discusses this very extensively.

690
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:47,090
Part seven of the toolkit is titled Using the ability, formulas and Cautionary Note.

691
01:22:47,090 --> 01:22:55,280
They caution against it, and they say imposing a grade level requirement has actually the potential to do harm.

692
01:22:55,280 --> 01:23:01,940
And we want to use the ability formulas in combination with all of the other toolkit guidelines.

693
01:23:01,940 --> 01:23:07,700
The commendation is explainability you contested, but don't focus on the grade.

694
01:23:07,700 --> 01:23:12,980
Just use it as a tool to identify areas that may be problematic.

695
01:23:12,980 --> 01:23:18,350
I like to use the flesh can create that ability test. I use it because it's easy to use.

696
01:23:18,350 --> 01:23:29,300
It simply means part of a Microsoft word. You do have to enable it only once it's under the file menu, what option you click to fan.

697
01:23:29,300 --> 01:23:32,960
And then you have to make sure that these two are checked.

698
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:38,630
One is checked by before they check the common and spelling that actually activates the spell checker,

699
01:23:38,630 --> 01:23:44,210
the other one you have to activate showing the statistics so wants to do that once.

700
01:23:44,210 --> 01:23:50,120
Whenever you do a spell check at the end of the spreadsheet, you've got a box with these statistics.

701
01:23:50,120 --> 01:24:00,530
And that's helpful, right? Because if they tell you, then there are 71 percent of passive voice sentences in your document, that's way too much.

702
01:24:00,530 --> 01:24:05,270
We never go over 10 or 15 percent of passive sentences.

703
01:24:05,270 --> 01:24:10,730
They also tell you the number of sentences for paragraph. So so far, it's not bad.

704
01:24:10,730 --> 01:24:18,100
And also the number of words for sentence and you'll hear it was twenty five, which is a good average for the.

705
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:27,190
But if you would have come up 50, then you know that you have a lot of long sentences that you need to crack down.

706
01:24:27,190 --> 01:24:37,420
Next, I want to share with you some examples of writing pieces for materials that I will submitted to professional education database.

707
01:24:37,420 --> 01:24:46,900
And here I really want you participation. If we were on Zoom, we would probably be doing it with breakout rooms and all of that stuff.

708
01:24:46,900 --> 01:24:52,780
So now as a person, we don't need the breakout rooms. But I really do want your participation.

709
01:24:52,780 --> 01:25:00,600
I want you to read this example and say which one element is what needs to get changed.

710
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:06,170
I think emergency care if you are unable to collect the blood pressure in a reasonable meadow,

711
01:25:06,170 --> 01:25:14,200
including a shotgun for what's wrong with this sentence.

712
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:21,610
Yes, go ahead. I feel like including a short time frame is like a really vague phrase, like, what does that mean?

713
01:25:21,610 --> 01:25:25,510
What does that mean, exactly? What is the show time?

714
01:25:25,510 --> 01:25:34,940
What is reasonable? Right. And this is really, really important this was taken from a document about autonomic dyslexia,

715
01:25:34,940 --> 01:25:40,460
and so that's a condition that affects people who have a spinal cord injury and they

716
01:25:40,460 --> 01:25:46,550
can have this complication will do not push spikes up so much as they can die.

717
01:25:46,550 --> 01:25:50,750
So when you give them such vague instructions, that's not helpful.

718
01:25:50,750 --> 01:25:56,210
That's not going to get them to the E.R. on time. You have to be very specific.

719
01:25:56,210 --> 01:25:59,990
Right. And we change. It actually called them up. I remember this was years ago.

720
01:25:59,990 --> 01:26:04,250
I called them up and I said, What is reasonable? What is the short timeframe?

721
01:26:04,250 --> 01:26:10,220
And then we were able to revise it and say most of the dealers, the emergency room.

722
01:26:10,220 --> 01:26:23,520
If the action steps listed above did not have to decrease the blood pressure below 140 systolic within 30 minutes, 30 minutes, very short timeframe.

723
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:31,470
Oh, these are the breakout rooms. I think I actually bought into the version from last year that I created for the breakout rooms.

724
01:26:31,470 --> 01:26:36,450
I we could get along fine. But anyway, this is a handout.

725
01:26:36,450 --> 01:26:44,120
Interesting handouts are. As you can see, it came from a dietician.

726
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:49,400
It's my dietitian, Alex, and I went to school a few years.

727
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:54,110
You know, I wanted to lose some weight and she gave me this tender, she said,

728
01:26:54,110 --> 01:26:58,700
Put it on your fridge and just remember that when you get a snack from the fridge,

729
01:26:58,700 --> 01:27:03,470
you have to get one item from the left side and one item for the right side.

730
01:27:03,470 --> 01:27:10,680
So this was actually in my fridge for six months. And then I asked, I said, Look, I think it's going to be beneficial for other people.

731
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:14,930
Can we put it in our database? And she gave me the permission to to change it?

732
01:27:14,930 --> 01:27:26,540
What do you think? I changed? Think about everything that we discuss today.

733
01:27:26,540 --> 01:27:36,850
I feel like the like the green and blue words on the bottom don't match with the performance of the top.

734
01:27:36,850 --> 01:27:44,610
There's lots of cars. Is it really needed? I think this is a really good example of how is this toxic?

735
01:27:44,610 --> 01:27:48,480
It's so busy. Really, really bad.

736
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:56,360
And so what happens is I just never read the book all the ideas, I never got there.

737
01:27:56,360 --> 01:28:03,870
As a user, I can say what else is a problem here?

738
01:28:03,870 --> 01:28:11,830
Yes, go ahead. There's not enough white space or it's not really used well, it's so dense.

739
01:28:11,830 --> 01:28:16,150
Right. There is no whitespace whatsoever. Stop, ABC.

740
01:28:16,150 --> 01:28:20,650
I thought she wanted to make sure everything shrinks in one page so you can put it on the fridge, right?

741
01:28:20,650 --> 01:28:26,740
So you may not be able to see it now that it's projected big, but those font size six and eight?

742
01:28:26,740 --> 01:28:36,230
You can read six and eight. It's very difficult. So anyway, after we went from that, it is.

743
01:28:36,230 --> 01:28:41,160
I realized. The first vertical headings.

744
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:48,090
So this is a table. And because she couldn't fit everything on one page, she put the headings vertically.

745
01:28:48,090 --> 01:28:57,800
I never even noticed them. I haven't even noticed them when it was on my fridge because research has shown that people just ignore it.

746
01:28:57,800 --> 01:29:02,610
When things are vertical, things are sideways. People just ignore.

747
01:29:02,610 --> 01:29:14,580
So I these guidelines clearly stand for is a living do not print text sideways on patterned or shaded backgrounds on top photos or other images.

748
01:29:14,580 --> 01:29:18,720
And this is the actual handout that we created. And you can see it put that.

749
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:24,570
I mean, I did keep the paper on one page so you can tell it out and put it on the fridge.

750
01:29:24,570 --> 01:29:29,280
But in order to make it fit in one page, we have to take out a few of those words.

751
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:38,250
It just didn't fit. OK. Oh, yeah, this is one of my favorite ones.

752
01:29:38,250 --> 01:29:42,870
How should they manage my blood thinners or anticoagulation?

753
01:29:42,870 --> 01:29:56,340
Examples, but not limited to Lovenox, Alex Coumadin or aspirin comedy, you need to have Coumadin five days prior to the procedure with Lovenox.

754
01:29:56,340 --> 01:30:01,570
Please contact your physician that prescribed the medication for further instructions.

755
01:30:01,570 --> 01:30:07,350
If you think that's understandable, you are going to have surgery.

756
01:30:07,350 --> 01:30:11,100
You think Coumadin, right, very important medication, blood thinner.

757
01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:18,960
You know, you have to take it to prevent stroke, and these are the infections that you given.

758
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:24,360
You're going to be able to follow them. No. Why do you think that might understand what you're doing?

759
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:30,630
And I know the bleeding is that's a bridge, right?

760
01:30:30,630 --> 01:30:35,400
But I have to say I don't know exactly what Lovenox bridge voyaging is.

761
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:41,680
Is it the bridge to Lovenox Lovenox bridge? And also, what does that mean to hold the medication?

762
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:48,250
You know, all the medication. That's what that means. So this is an example of using jargon.

763
01:30:48,250 --> 01:30:55,500
Know, using jargon, the jargon, the lingo that they use on the is the holy Coumadin, you know, all the nurses know what that means.

764
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:59,880
That means don't give the patient the money, but the patient doesn't necessarily know.

765
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:02,990
And so when we got this, we had to say, Look,

766
01:31:02,990 --> 01:31:11,640
if you stop taking Coumadin five days prior to the procedure and take a different blood thinner, usually Lovenox, instead.

767
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:17,250
This is called Global Square, Jim. So here we have a definition in the body of the text.

768
01:31:17,250 --> 01:31:25,890
This is another one, so I try to bring you all examples from hand that's about to dietitians.

769
01:31:25,890 --> 01:31:32,110
This is about allergies. Unexpected sources of allergens may be found in these foods and ingredients.

770
01:31:32,110 --> 01:31:36,610
Now, if you're food allergy isn't life threatening. Right?

771
01:31:36,610 --> 01:31:42,860
So it's really, really important to be aware of all the different foods that may give you an allergy.

772
01:31:42,860 --> 01:31:46,200
Well, the good good.

773
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:54,360
I guess in the best case scenario is to use your EpiPen, but if you're able to, but if you're not able to, it can be a real problem.

774
01:31:54,360 --> 01:32:00,600
So what do you think about these risks?

775
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:09,780
Yes, Annie, it's hard to read and you almost have to look for like a milk, eggs, peanuts in which investors were or something.

776
01:32:09,780 --> 01:32:18,110
But everything is stored on their part of the reason it's hard to read because it's all moldy.

777
01:32:18,110 --> 01:32:22,070
You're right. It's hard to leave, it's all holding. Yeah. Correct.

778
01:32:22,070 --> 01:32:29,090
The color distinction doesn't mean anything. Doesn't mean anything.

779
01:32:29,090 --> 01:32:36,430
This would work so much better as a bullet through space.

780
01:32:36,430 --> 01:32:43,650
And with the bill, the bullet. Much easier to grasp to it's to show to.

781
01:32:43,650 --> 01:32:50,700
This is another one. And I don't I know some of the I think all of you that they all have to go to an

782
01:32:50,700 --> 01:32:56,250
internship right when they graduate and this is a handout that was written by one vote.

783
01:32:56,250 --> 01:33:03,180
It turns a long time ago. I think our interns at Michigan Medicine, they have, they publish a newsletter.

784
01:33:03,180 --> 01:33:11,160
It's like part of their internship is still to why the newsletter, which is which is nice, but this is kind of old school.

785
01:33:11,160 --> 01:33:22,230
So what do you think about that? Any critiques notes for the also I'm never going to check on.

786
01:33:22,230 --> 01:33:28,910
Who wants to say something? You must have some thoughts.

787
01:33:28,910 --> 01:33:35,950
There's so much going on. And again, I'm going to call on you.

788
01:33:35,950 --> 01:33:39,760
Yeah, I just noticed that everything is bulletin.

789
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:45,460
There's not a lot of white space. And yeah, she's very busy.

790
01:33:45,460 --> 01:33:52,090
So maybe it's just like a lot of tech specs and colors, so just making it more plain and simple.

791
01:33:52,090 --> 01:34:00,260
Exactly. You have maybe too many paragraphs, excuse me, too many paragraphs, I guess, you know.

792
01:34:00,260 --> 01:34:04,820
It's really busy, super duper busy. No whitespace.

793
01:34:04,820 --> 01:34:08,480
Lots of different fights going on D.C. different forms.

794
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:22,070
Different forms like all of these things, create a mess in our head and you really want to keep things streamlined and organized and calm.

795
01:34:22,070 --> 01:34:32,750
What can I expect after the procedure and you witnessed and a complete blood count are done to check for bleeding or other complications?

796
01:34:32,750 --> 01:34:42,900
What do you think about this? Kathy, I mean, it's telling you that they're going to do that.

797
01:34:42,900 --> 01:34:48,630
That's exactly right. Was that what you really don't know what to expect?

798
01:34:48,630 --> 01:34:54,570
What is my role in the text? And so you really have to be very explicit and very concrete.

799
01:34:54,570 --> 01:35:01,110
We will ask you to give me your example and draw your blood so we can test for bleeding or other complications.

800
01:35:01,110 --> 01:35:10,750
So then, you know, in advance that when you wake up, you're going to have to be in a car and there is going to be another.

801
01:35:10,750 --> 01:35:16,510
Yeah, this is quite long.

802
01:35:16,510 --> 01:35:23,410
When I need to change my diet after the surgery? It is.

803
01:35:23,410 --> 01:35:37,650
And I know about this. Some, some edits.

804
01:35:37,650 --> 01:35:44,910
If you're walking for the hospital, see patient education and health literacy program will have a plain language,

805
01:35:44,910 --> 01:35:55,490
y'know, what do you think she would change in this example? Yeah, I feel like the specific recommendations can be made into a list.

806
01:35:55,490 --> 01:36:01,650
Yes. Right. Yep, Jane.

807
01:36:01,650 --> 01:36:08,580
Yeah. It mentions a low fiber diet, but doesn't really define what that is.

808
01:36:08,580 --> 01:36:17,150
That's. Unless they define it later in the document and that something, you know, because I take this small example, it comes from a large document.

809
01:36:17,150 --> 01:36:23,530
But that tool, if you use if you say low fiber diet, you have to remember, you have to explain what that is.

810
01:36:23,530 --> 01:36:32,690
Yeah. Oh, I think it's really broad and vague, like it's kind of like depending on the type of story you have like, you know,

811
01:36:32,690 --> 01:36:39,190
it's really not guiding patients to actually tell the patients so what exactly that they want because sometimes

812
01:36:39,190 --> 01:36:45,280
I they just don't know that it won't take some explicit instruction to what it should be done and not.

813
01:36:45,280 --> 01:36:50,110
And they have, like so many, so many words. It's really, really warranted.

814
01:36:50,110 --> 01:36:53,890
And that's why because there's so many wars you really can't focus.

815
01:36:53,890 --> 01:36:59,240
So you have a lot of hidden rules like in general, what's this in general, however,

816
01:36:59,240 --> 01:37:05,320
you know, all of these words are just not necessarily you can just take them up.

817
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:09,160
You know, you can make some adjustments. You need to adjust your diet.

818
01:37:09,160 --> 01:37:16,090
It's a hidden field. So we really need to be very conscientious about the worthiness of our materials.

819
01:37:16,090 --> 01:37:19,150
And this is what I try to talk about with those hidden villains.

820
01:37:19,150 --> 01:37:32,380
And, you know, was like in general, however, some stuff like that also we hear the six to eight year that we need to use numbers instead of words.

821
01:37:32,380 --> 01:37:40,750
This is an illustration, and this is a Real-Life example from a book for people who are about to have a hip replacement surgery,

822
01:37:40,750 --> 01:37:45,650
and the team wanted this illustration on the cover.

823
01:37:45,650 --> 01:37:52,360
In fact, it's an X-ray. Right? Do you think that's good?

824
01:37:52,360 --> 01:37:58,210
What do you think, Monica, about? I think it's hard to see,

825
01:37:58,210 --> 01:38:05,410
and it would be better if you just have like a drawing or something that you catch because I had a hard time extenders to them.

826
01:38:05,410 --> 01:38:10,940
It's like a Rorschach painting, you know, for for for a layperson, this doesn't mean anything.

827
01:38:10,940 --> 01:38:16,000
They don't see a he appear. They just see all kinds of shapes in black and light and gray.

828
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:24,370
So, you know, it can be really intimidating as a patient, you get something like that and you're like feeling insecure.

829
01:38:24,370 --> 01:38:29,140
Do they expect me to do? Do I not know something? Am I not doing something right?

830
01:38:29,140 --> 01:38:38,560
And you have to really do need to find an information. Black and white light installations are really the most recommended, though the easiest way.

831
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:42,400
This one is not black and white, but it's a good one. It's a good one.

832
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:47,500
It's simple. When we use illustrations for our materials, we don't go to Gray's Anatomy.

833
01:38:47,500 --> 01:38:51,970
Those are way too complicated, and it's way too much medical terminology.

834
01:38:51,970 --> 01:38:59,950
We want illustrations that are specifically for people, and we want them to have babies to point to the important structures.

835
01:38:59,950 --> 01:39:06,880
We don't want too many writers. We don't want labels to structures that are not relevant to the specific issue that we are discussing.

836
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:12,890
But this one was really good. I was able to. Convincing them to use that money instead.

837
01:39:12,890 --> 01:39:19,970
But I also wanted to show you this, which I would argue is right. These two black and white illustration and this one is really good.

838
01:39:19,970 --> 01:39:24,230
It's really clear and shows you where in the body it is.

839
01:39:24,230 --> 01:39:29,270
So it's not enough just to use this one, because this one is also a little bit meaningless.

840
01:39:29,270 --> 01:39:40,730
You can't really picture where it is on your body. But over here, when you get this one, then you can see it gives you the context of where it is.

841
01:39:40,730 --> 01:39:46,560
This is my last example. For today, and this is a before and after.

842
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:53,730
So what do you see here? This is a booklet that we created for patients on intensive care,

843
01:39:53,730 --> 01:40:01,110
and this was graphically designed by professional graphic designer, which we have graphic design.

844
01:40:01,110 --> 01:40:04,890
It's nice, it's pleasing and also can be very helpful.

845
01:40:04,890 --> 01:40:11,520
I mean, also the design and there's nothing wanted you brought about plain language guidelines can be a problem.

846
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:18,440
And luckily with this. The team works with the graphic designer that created the design.

847
01:40:18,440 --> 01:40:24,650
They send it to us, we were able to give them feedback and the designer made the revisions accordingly.

848
01:40:24,650 --> 01:40:31,690
And I'm going to ask you which one do you think is the visual in which one is the after?

849
01:40:31,690 --> 01:40:36,960
First of all, let me say, I do think that one is nice, though, look, in terms of hysterics.

850
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:47,380
You think one is more static than the other? I think they are both esthetically pleasing.

851
01:40:47,380 --> 01:40:55,110
But which one is better in terms of readability and understand ability?

852
01:40:55,110 --> 01:41:08,400
OK, Kelly, what do you think? I think the right one is easier to read and the text is bigger too, and it gets more to the point you are correct.

853
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:15,860
That is the after this was to begin the first graphic design, and this was how it was changed after the edit.

854
01:41:15,860 --> 01:41:25,260
So you identified it correctly and you pointed actually to one of the changes that we made, which was this font size was too small.

855
01:41:25,260 --> 01:41:32,880
And so we increased the font size. And actually what you can see is that we had to move part of the text to the next page.

856
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:40,850
So after we revised date, the head to the booklet had to have more pages and was more costly to print, but was easy.

857
01:41:40,850 --> 01:41:50,500
I mean, you can see other changes that were made. Yeah.

858
01:41:50,500 --> 01:41:57,440
a drive who takes on a lighter background. Exactly. The contrast is better here.

859
01:41:57,440 --> 01:42:08,770
Another clue that this was the after. Yeah, Kathy, all in capital letters.

860
01:42:08,770 --> 01:42:14,010
That's why that was the interesting here they used all cops and he knows you can see long.

861
01:42:14,010 --> 01:42:18,300
So that's kind of gives you the clue of what is the before and after.

862
01:42:18,300 --> 01:42:27,600
So before we end today, and this is good because my parking is almost expiring, I did find a meter for our.

863
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:36,820
So that was good. So I used to have a business, but I wanted to talk to you about the PMA tool,

864
01:42:36,820 --> 01:42:45,390
the patient education assessment tool, which was developed by the HIPAA, the Agency for Information Quality.

865
01:42:45,390 --> 01:42:53,850
And this is a very nice tool. It's a checklist for to buy those to assess if a patient education materials think they want

866
01:42:53,850 --> 01:43:02,340
to give to the patient is is understandable and actionable because as far as medications,

867
01:43:02,340 --> 01:43:07,050
you are going to get a lot of brochures like maybe from the American society,

868
01:43:07,050 --> 01:43:13,440
the American Heart Association and Stroke Association, all kinds of don't always have to put into own.

869
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:17,550
You might be able to find something that you can print and give to the patient.

870
01:43:17,550 --> 01:43:25,740
And this is a tool to tell you if this is material that you are about to give to an operation is understandable and actionable,

871
01:43:25,740 --> 01:43:32,850
so it's basically a checklist to help you if you are going to compare, understand ability,

872
01:43:32,850 --> 01:43:39,180
which means that users can process and explain free messages and action ability.

873
01:43:39,180 --> 01:43:46,980
So platforms guidelines are not only about understanding, also about action of an empowered patient.

874
01:43:46,980 --> 01:43:55,980
So you came up those two tools does the PMFBY and the payment API to meet payment ages for audiovisual materials?

875
01:43:55,980 --> 01:44:02,670
The payment key has 17 questions for unsustainability and seven for action ability the payment,

876
01:44:02,670 --> 01:44:07,740
and he has 13 questions for an understandable and full for action ability.

877
01:44:07,740 --> 01:44:14,340
And as you go through and you are sick of it, well, what are you asking?

878
01:44:14,340 --> 01:44:21,570
Yes, no or MJ? Is there any talking like this core actually online?

879
01:44:21,570 --> 01:44:27,000
There's just like an Excel spreadsheet, and you could be trusted with this component.

880
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:33,920
But how do you discover the more understandable and actionable Panopto maybe it would be a few months

881
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:40,800
is not enough to just not measure the actual state of information that is going to be up to you.

882
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:46,140
Local knowledge and expertize to assess the accuracy of the information.

883
01:44:46,140 --> 01:44:51,240
It doesn't assess the effectiveness, it doesn't function.

884
01:44:51,240 --> 01:44:54,600
And it of course, doesn't mention the ability.

885
01:44:54,600 --> 01:45:01,320
The feedback doesn't call for a specific reason level just because of what the toolkit has warned of before,

886
01:45:01,320 --> 01:45:06,480
because we have to be very cautious about how we use the readability level.

887
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:11,960
So in conclusion, this is my key message for you don't lie about leaving school.

888
01:45:11,960 --> 01:45:19,980
Focus on the six principles of plain language that are summarized for you in to handle all of the six principles.

889
01:45:19,980 --> 01:45:28,590
If you follow them, you want a lot of material that are going to be appropriate for the great majority of patients.

890
01:45:28,590 --> 01:45:34,470
So thank you so much for being here and making the effort to actually come here.

891
01:45:34,470 --> 01:45:39,750
I think it works much better in person. I hope you agree.

892
01:45:39,750 --> 01:45:44,020
Absolutely. I think it's worth the drive. I think it's worth paying for parking.

893
01:45:44,020 --> 01:45:55,150
And I'm very happy to be here. It's really fun. I always look forward to teaching your class.

894
01:45:55,150 --> 01:45:55,300
Two questions for Rudy before she rescues her car and John Drive, so we will as an assignment this Class B making an education material,
