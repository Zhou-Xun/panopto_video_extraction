1
00:00:01,542 --> 00:00:06,181
In this session of HMP 600, the health services system.

2
00:00:06,181 --> 00:00:11,128
We are going to talk about a brief history of financing health

3
00:00:11,128 --> 00:00:15,204
care in the US in the period 1965-2010.

4
00:00:15,204 --> 00:00:22,673
This will continue the history of paying for health care in the United States.

5
00:00:22,673 --> 00:00:28,066
This we will describe some of the evolution of health insurance,

6
00:00:28,066 --> 00:00:34,058
including government involvement in creating Medicare and Medicaid.

7
00:00:34,058 --> 00:00:39,270
And we will explain the connections between this early history and

8
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,994
current structures of healthcare services and

9
00:00:42,994 --> 00:00:46,730
financing of healthcare in the United States.

10
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:53,064
So before we actually delve into the history a little bit,

11
00:00:53,064 --> 00:01:01,350
it's always good to start with an overview of the system as it exists today.

12
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:06,583
And so, this third party payer system evolved and

13
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:12,572
was put into place over the course of the 20th century.

14
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:19,676
And so we are looking at a key period 1965 up through 2010, in the development of

15
00:01:19,676 --> 00:01:24,774
this current infrastructure in our third party payer system.

16
00:01:24,774 --> 00:01:31,766
So this is just to remind us of where we are going and what it looks like today,

17
00:01:31,766 --> 00:01:36,378
and today we'll be talking about how we got here.

18
00:01:38,986 --> 00:01:44,900
So now we're gonna go back to the, what the system looked like.

19
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:51,056
Just prior to the period we're gonna talk about today, 1965.

20
00:01:51,056 --> 00:01:56,667
So, in the 1950s and 60s, we had the evolution of the third party,

21
00:01:56,667 --> 00:02:00,650
the commercial insurance industry, Blue Cross and

22
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:03,832
Blue shield had arisen during world war.

23
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:10,790
During prior to and then in World War Two became firmly established.

24
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:16,202
And after World World War Two, the commercial insurance

25
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:21,851
industry became established and was based in employment.

26
00:02:21,851 --> 00:02:28,229
So our third party payer system is also known as an employer sponsored system.

27
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:34,059
Because health insurance is primarily embedded in insurance and

28
00:02:34,059 --> 00:02:39,048
or in employment which came about in this early period.

29
00:02:39,048 --> 00:02:43,778
Now it's important to remember that of course, at this time, and

30
00:02:43,778 --> 00:02:48,085
continuing up through the period of 2010 and two today,

31
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:52,064
not all employers offer insurance to their employees.

32
00:02:52,064 --> 00:02:58,306
In this period of the 50s to 65, it was mostly large employers,

33
00:02:58,306 --> 00:03:05,442
employers with unionized workers and employers with white collar workers.

34
00:03:05,442 --> 00:03:11,399
But even considering that, the health insurance that exists and

35
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:18,127
is embedded employment would leave out lots of groups and lots of people.

36
00:03:18,127 --> 00:03:24,437
So, who would that be if health insurance is embedded in employment?

37
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:27,618
It would be those who are not employed.

38
00:03:27,618 --> 00:03:32,446
So those who are out of the labor force maybe because they are unable to

39
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:35,285
work because of illness or disability.

40
00:03:35,285 --> 00:03:40,369
Those who are unemployed, who cannot find employment and

41
00:03:40,369 --> 00:03:46,192
those who are retired, who are no longer in the employment realm.

42
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:50,871
But we might also want to think about what's going on in

43
00:03:50,871 --> 00:03:56,274
the period of the 50s and 60s as well outside of insurance.

44
00:03:56,274 --> 00:04:00,007
So, first, let's think about health care.

45
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:06,754
So this is an era often described as the golden age of the medical profession.

46
00:04:06,754 --> 00:04:10,653
Physicians are seen as the most esteemed,

47
00:04:10,653 --> 00:04:15,211
most prestigious, most respected profession.

48
00:04:15,211 --> 00:04:20,588
Hospitals are growing rapidly, new medical treatments are being developed.

49
00:04:20,588 --> 00:04:23,675
So health care services are increasing.

50
00:04:23,675 --> 00:04:28,904
They are expanding across the country across the population,

51
00:04:28,904 --> 00:04:32,166
and they're growing more expensive.

52
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:35,362
We should also be thinking about what else is going on,

53
00:04:35,362 --> 00:04:37,660
what we know about the 50s and 60s.

54
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:42,083
And so this means that we know civil rights advocates

55
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:46,516
are shining a bright light on racial inequalities.

56
00:04:46,516 --> 00:04:50,696
And injustice from the brutal Jim crow laws,

57
00:04:50,696 --> 00:04:57,516
that exist across the United States, enforced segregation in housing,

58
00:04:57,516 --> 00:05:02,589
in education and employment and yes, in health care.

59
00:05:02,589 --> 00:05:05,971
Hospitals are segregated institutions, and

60
00:05:05,971 --> 00:05:10,399
many across the country do not accept black patients at all.

61
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:15,672
According to historian David Barton smith, poor people received

62
00:05:15,672 --> 00:05:21,603
care in the stark charity wards of hospitals, in urban public hospitals or

63
00:05:21,603 --> 00:05:26,323
in the clinics of medical schools and teaching hospitals.

64
00:05:26,323 --> 00:05:31,870
In the South and most border states, blacks obtain care and segregated clinics

65
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:36,946
or in private practice is often outfitted with separate waiting rooms.

66
00:05:36,946 --> 00:05:41,944
Where one would wait until all the white patients in a separate better

67
00:05:41,944 --> 00:05:44,801
appointed waiting room had been seen.

68
00:05:44,801 --> 00:05:49,313
Many hospitals excluded blacks altogether.

69
00:05:49,313 --> 00:05:57,772
Ironically, though, this is David Barton smith goes on to say this exclusion.

70
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:07,509
Not ironic here extended to black physicians who could not

71
00:06:07,509 --> 00:06:11,796
obtain privileges at most mainstream hospitals or

72
00:06:11,796 --> 00:06:16,195
participate in most specialty training programs.

73
00:06:16,195 --> 00:06:22,448
Ironically, this exclusion insulated them from white control and thus thrust them

74
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:27,484
into civil rights leadership roles in many Southern communities.

75
00:06:27,484 --> 00:06:32,259
So we see this period of time that is

76
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:37,034
expanding insurance to some, and

77
00:06:37,034 --> 00:06:43,456
continues to exclude others from insurance,

78
00:06:43,456 --> 00:06:49,231
and also from even access to health care.

79
00:06:49,231 --> 00:06:55,909
Okay, so thinking about who is excluded from health care at this time.

80
00:06:55,909 --> 00:07:01,557
By the time we get to 1965, many have advocated to expand

81
00:07:01,557 --> 00:07:08,004
insurance to at least some of those groups who have not been covered.

82
00:07:08,004 --> 00:07:12,716
And to have government involved in providing

83
00:07:12,716 --> 00:07:16,441
insurance to some of these groups.

84
00:07:16,441 --> 00:07:21,612
And that is how we get to Medicare which is health

85
00:07:21,612 --> 00:07:26,150
insurance for those aged 65 and older.

86
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:31,747
And Medicare also includes a program referred to as social security

87
00:07:31,747 --> 00:07:37,049
disability insurance, that extends health insurance to those

88
00:07:37,049 --> 00:07:42,165
who are blind and disabled, and and later some other groups.

89
00:07:42,165 --> 00:07:46,736
So when we hear Medicare, Medicare is primarily

90
00:07:46,736 --> 00:07:51,200
health insurance for the aged for the elderly.

91
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,459
Those 65 and older, and some additional programs for

92
00:07:55,459 --> 00:07:58,550
the blind and disabled under Medicare.

93
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:04,328
Medicare is a federally funded and operated program.

94
00:08:04,328 --> 00:08:08,998
It's actually modeled on Blue cross and Blue shield type plans

95
00:08:08,998 --> 00:08:13,681
that were talked about in the early part of the 20th century.

96
00:08:13,681 --> 00:08:21,585
So for example, beneficiaries of Medicare are responsible to pay premiums.

97
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:27,443
They face deductibles and they often have coinsurance and copays.

98
00:08:27,443 --> 00:08:32,070
But the key way Medicare is modeled on Blue Cross and

99
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:36,920
Blue shield is the structure of the insurance pools.

100
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,882
Part A is hospital insurance for

101
00:08:39,882 --> 00:08:44,828
acute care needing treatment in a hospital setting.

102
00:08:44,828 --> 00:08:51,595
And part B Is physician visit insurance that you might recall is

103
00:08:51,595 --> 00:08:58,619
very similar to the structure of blue cross hospital insurance,

104
00:08:58,619 --> 00:09:03,484
and blue shield physician visit insurance.

105
00:09:03,484 --> 00:09:11,328
Now later in the 1990s what's called part C Medicare was added.

106
00:09:11,328 --> 00:09:19,897
These Medicare advantage managed care plans create an integrated delivery model.

107
00:09:19,897 --> 00:09:26,070
So a beneficiary would have part C or they would have parts A and

108
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:31,531
B of Medicare, because part C integrates hospital and

109
00:09:31,531 --> 00:09:35,826
physician visit insurance into one plan.

110
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:41,055
Finally, in 2006, part D of Medicare was added and

111
00:09:41,055 --> 00:09:44,848
this is the prescription drug benefit.

112
00:09:44,848 --> 00:09:51,807
So today, most beneficiaries of Medicare have parts A and

113
00:09:51,807 --> 00:09:56,784
then often include also part B and part D.

114
00:09:56,784 --> 00:10:01,902
Other Medicare beneficiaries have part C that

115
00:10:01,902 --> 00:10:06,889
those advantage plans that also incorporate

116
00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:11,226
part D of a prescription drug benefit.

117
00:10:11,226 --> 00:10:15,870
A key thing to keep in mind about Medicare is

118
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:20,522
that it is federally funded and operated.

119
00:10:20,522 --> 00:10:26,143
Which means it operates the same everywhere in the United States and

120
00:10:26,143 --> 00:10:28,910
everywhere across the country.

121
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:34,902
And it is paid for in the same way across the country.

122
00:10:34,902 --> 00:10:39,965
This we will see is different from the second plan

123
00:10:39,965 --> 00:10:44,670
insurance plan that is created in 1965.

124
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:51,633
This plan is Medicaid and Medicaid as established is health insurance for

125
00:10:51,633 --> 00:10:57,585
those who are poor, meaning under the federal poverty line and

126
00:10:57,585 --> 00:11:00,859
have some other characteristic.

127
00:11:00,859 --> 00:11:04,574
They are over the age of 65 and so

128
00:11:04,574 --> 00:11:09,351
people over the age of 65 who are poor have

129
00:11:09,351 --> 00:11:13,604
both Medicare and can have Medicaid.

130
00:11:13,604 --> 00:11:20,666
People who are poor and under the age of 18 can qualify for Medicaid.

131
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:26,770
People under the federal poverty line and disabled can qualify for

132
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:33,103
Medicaid, pregnant women who are poor, can qualify for Medicaid.

133
00:11:33,103 --> 00:11:40,497
And the parents of dependent children typically under the age of six,

134
00:11:40,497 --> 00:11:45,395
can and who are poor can qualify for Medicaid.

135
00:11:45,395 --> 00:11:49,304
Now something key about the Medicaid program,

136
00:11:49,304 --> 00:11:55,266
even though it's established in 1965 at the same time as Medicare,

137
00:11:55,266 --> 00:12:00,756
it is a state program, which means there are 50 state programs.

138
00:12:00,756 --> 00:12:05,035
And actually more than that, if we count the Medicaid program in Washington, D.

139
00:12:05,035 --> 00:12:05,581
C.

140
00:12:05,581 --> 00:12:10,365
And the Medicaid programs in Puerto rico, and

141
00:12:10,365 --> 00:12:14,799
Guam and other parts of the United States,

142
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:21,570
the state programs determine the program design the eligibility and

143
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:29,181
the benefit packages that will be included in their state Medicaid program.

144
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:33,419
Under broad federal guidelines.

145
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:38,736
They, the states themselves and the state programs decide what the payment

146
00:12:38,736 --> 00:12:43,566
levels will be to healthcare providers under the Medicaid program.

147
00:12:43,566 --> 00:12:48,639
And they also established administrative and operating procedures

148
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,812
such as how does one demonstrate their eligibility for Medicaid?

149
00:12:53,812 --> 00:12:58,892
The whether they are under the poverty line.

150
00:12:58,892 --> 00:13:03,933
How often they have to demonstrate that eligibility

151
00:13:03,933 --> 00:13:08,981
in order to qualify for the state Medicaid program.

152
00:13:08,981 --> 00:13:15,703
Some key things to keep in mind about Medicaid is that from the beginning,

153
00:13:15,703 --> 00:13:20,324
as designed in the law, being poor in and of itself,

154
00:13:20,324 --> 00:13:27,468
meaning having an income below the federal poverty level does not qualify you for

155
00:13:27,468 --> 00:13:31,590
Medicaid for most of the history of Medicaid.

156
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:36,044
If you are a single, non disabled adult,

157
00:13:36,044 --> 00:13:42,788
who is younger than 65 but who lives below the poverty level,

158
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:47,894
you are not eligible for Medicaid in any state.

159
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:53,774
Another feature of the Medicaid program is that it is both state and

160
00:13:53,774 --> 00:13:55,568
federally funded.

161
00:13:55,568 --> 00:14:00,524
So just like the states established all of the basic operating and

162
00:14:00,524 --> 00:14:05,842
administrative, parts of the program of Medicaid in their state,

163
00:14:05,842 --> 00:14:09,447
the states established the Medicaid budget and

164
00:14:09,447 --> 00:14:14,610
then the federal government matches the state's contributions.

165
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:19,603
The federal match for Medicaid is anywhere from 50 to

166
00:14:19,603 --> 00:14:24,062
76% based on the state's per capita income.

167
00:14:24,062 --> 00:14:30,184
So wealthier states, their Medicaid program has a 50% match from the federal

168
00:14:30,184 --> 00:14:35,533
government, so half of it comes from federal funding In poorer states.

169
00:14:35,533 --> 00:14:42,086
A larger share of the Medicaid program

170
00:14:42,086 --> 00:14:46,272
is a bigger match comes from

171
00:14:46,272 --> 00:14:52,107
the federal government up to 76%.

172
00:14:52,107 --> 00:14:59,087
So, a key thing to keep in mind about Medicaid is that it is state

173
00:14:59,087 --> 00:15:04,304
A state program, so there are 50 different state programs,

174
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:08,149
and it is funded by state and federal funding.

175
00:15:08,149 --> 00:15:11,447
So think about this difference between these two programs.

176
00:15:11,447 --> 00:15:14,086
Both established in 1965.

177
00:15:14,086 --> 00:15:18,357
Both coming out of federal legislation to

178
00:15:18,357 --> 00:15:23,611
establish government health insurance in the US.

179
00:15:23,611 --> 00:15:27,589
One is a federal program with federal funding

180
00:15:27,589 --> 00:15:32,204
operating in the same way everywhere across the US.

181
00:15:32,204 --> 00:15:37,682
And the other is essentially 50 state programs

182
00:15:37,682 --> 00:15:43,300
funded by the states and the federal government.

183
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:48,211
So that's the basis of Medicare and Medicaid.

184
00:15:48,211 --> 00:15:52,223
I now wanna talk about some of the programs or

185
00:15:52,223 --> 00:15:59,719
some changes in government sponsored insurance that came about after 1965.

186
00:15:59,719 --> 00:16:05,132
But over this long period that we're talking about up through about 2010.

187
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:09,670
So another program that many of you might be familiar with is

188
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:13,576
the State Children's Health Insurance program,

189
00:16:13,576 --> 00:16:18,415
called the CHIP program, which was established in 1997.

190
00:16:18,415 --> 00:16:24,678
Like Medicaid CHIP programs are all state programs.

191
00:16:24,678 --> 00:16:31,377
And what they were set out to do was to extend insurance to children beyond what

192
00:16:31,377 --> 00:16:37,990
was established in the Medicaid eligibility criteria in the Medicaid law.

193
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:44,526
So it allows states to expand Medicaid insurance or

194
00:16:44,526 --> 00:16:51,068
CHIP insurance for poor children in their states.

195
00:16:51,068 --> 00:16:57,303
So two states allow children who are above the poverty line,

196
00:16:57,303 --> 00:17:01,825
above 133% up to 200% of the federal

197
00:17:01,825 --> 00:17:06,973
poverty line to be covered by their CHIP program.

198
00:17:06,973 --> 00:17:14,527
Many more states cover children up to 300% of the federal poverty line.

199
00:17:14,527 --> 00:17:19,529
And in 19 states plus Washington DC children in

200
00:17:19,529 --> 00:17:27,218
the CHIP program can be covered up to 400% of the federal poverty line.

201
00:17:27,218 --> 00:17:31,854
So really extending health insurance for

202
00:17:31,854 --> 00:17:39,411
children to be both poor and what we would call low income children.

203
00:17:39,411 --> 00:17:43,875
So just like Medicaid within broad federal guidelines,

204
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:49,176
each state determines the program design, the administrative and

205
00:17:49,176 --> 00:17:53,454
operating procedures, the eligibility groups, and

206
00:17:53,454 --> 00:17:59,790
how the benefits package will operates, and the payment levels for providers.

207
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:04,782
So some use their CHIP funds, some states use their CHIP funds

208
00:18:04,782 --> 00:18:09,015
to basically just expand their Medicaid programs.

209
00:18:09,015 --> 00:18:14,349
And other states establish separate additional programs

210
00:18:14,349 --> 00:18:20,015
outside of their Medicaid program for their CHIP insurance.

211
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:25,088
Like Medicaid, it receives federal matching funds.

212
00:18:25,088 --> 00:18:30,327
And recall, this is all still prior to the Affordable Care Act.

213
00:18:30,327 --> 00:18:33,689
So we're just talking about the period up to about 2010.

214
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:45,030
Another program, another government, not program, but another initiative or

215
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:51,196
policy change from the federal government that you may have heard of,

216
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:56,651
is the 1974 Employee Retirement Income & Security Act.

217
00:18:56,651 --> 00:19:01,096
Often referred to by its acronym ERISA.

218
00:19:01,096 --> 00:19:07,572
And ERISA was set out to regulate corporate use of pension funds.

219
00:19:07,572 --> 00:19:12,254
And one of the things that it allowed was for

220
00:19:12,254 --> 00:19:15,513
employers to self-insure.

221
00:19:15,513 --> 00:19:21,694
So to use their pension funds to directly fund a health insurance plan,

222
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:26,649
to create their own insurance pool for their employees.

223
00:19:26,649 --> 00:19:33,879
Instead of basically buying into an insurance pool from an insurance company.

224
00:19:33,879 --> 00:19:38,946
Now, self-insured companies will still most often contract

225
00:19:38,946 --> 00:19:43,733
with an insurance company to manage their insurance plan.

226
00:19:43,733 --> 00:19:49,940
So it still might have the branding of one of the big insurance entities,

227
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:53,115
Aetna Cigna, UnitedHealth, etc.

228
00:19:53,115 --> 00:20:02,591
But the company itself is self-insuring its own insurance pool.

229
00:20:02,591 --> 00:20:09,492
Now, why is this important other than as a corporate kind of benefit?

230
00:20:09,492 --> 00:20:16,279
It's important because ERISA preempts state regulation.

231
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:20,909
So insurance plans like all insurance in the United States

232
00:20:20,909 --> 00:20:23,563
is regulated at the state level.

233
00:20:23,563 --> 00:20:28,943
States decide what policies are allowed, how they operate,

234
00:20:28,943 --> 00:20:34,018
what are the requirements for the insurers in that state?

235
00:20:34,018 --> 00:20:39,318
And that's true for not just health insurance, but all kinds of insurance.

236
00:20:39,318 --> 00:20:43,747
But the ERISA law basically allowed

237
00:20:43,747 --> 00:20:48,474
the preemption of state regulation.

238
00:20:48,474 --> 00:20:53,563
And so companies that self-insure their health plans

239
00:20:53,563 --> 00:20:58,328
become exempt from state insurance regulations.

240
00:20:58,328 --> 00:21:02,708
They're still subject of course, to federal insurance regulations.

241
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:08,232
But since most insurance is regulated at the state level,

242
00:21:08,232 --> 00:21:13,194
this exempted, these companies that self-insure

243
00:21:13,194 --> 00:21:18,156
from all of those regulations that states might have

244
00:21:18,156 --> 00:21:22,440
decided is important to ensure the health and

245
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:27,648
well being and economic well being of their citizens.

246
00:21:27,648 --> 00:21:31,332
These self-insured companies are exempt.

247
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:35,711
Now in 1977 soon after ERISA was passed,

248
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:40,552
about 7% of all workers in the United States were

249
00:21:40,552 --> 00:21:44,945
in companies that had self-insured plans.

250
00:21:44,945 --> 00:21:51,505
By 1998, about 20 years later, half of workers now worked for

251
00:21:51,505 --> 00:21:55,587
companies that had self-insured plans.

252
00:21:55,587 --> 00:22:00,564
And by 2018, almost three quarters of workers in

253
00:22:00,564 --> 00:22:05,431
the United States, 108 million workers work for

254
00:22:05,431 --> 00:22:10,533
companies that have self-insured insurance plans.

255
00:22:10,533 --> 00:22:15,447
Meaning most workers have health insurance that is exempt from

256
00:22:15,447 --> 00:22:18,234
any state insurance regulations.

257
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:28,565
Another government policy change that you may hear about when we

258
00:22:28,565 --> 00:22:32,447
talk about health insurance in the United States,

259
00:22:32,447 --> 00:22:37,972
is the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act from 1986.

260
00:22:37,972 --> 00:22:42,596
Which is also often referred to by its acronym, COBRA.

261
00:22:42,596 --> 00:22:51,094
And what COBRA did was extend employer sponsored insurance beyond employment.

262
00:22:51,094 --> 00:22:56,936
I.e, that means after an employee or a person lost their job,

263
00:22:56,936 --> 00:23:00,793
which would typically, prior to COBRA,

264
00:23:00,793 --> 00:23:06,216
have meant that that person lost their health insurance.

265
00:23:06,216 --> 00:23:11,301
The former employee would be able

266
00:23:11,301 --> 00:23:16,385
to buy into that insurance plan to

267
00:23:16,385 --> 00:23:24,208
continue to have that insurance for up to one year.

268
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:30,077
Now, in order to actually keep that insurance to buy into the,

269
00:23:30,077 --> 00:23:35,062
it would mean the person would then be responsible for

270
00:23:35,062 --> 00:23:40,635
paying the entire premium plus 2% of the cost of the plan.

271
00:23:40,635 --> 00:23:44,954
Which would be accounting for, say, the administrative costs of the plan.

272
00:23:44,954 --> 00:23:51,581
So, it was still quite a challenge for anyone who lost their job,

273
00:23:51,581 --> 00:23:57,605
who was now unemployed to continue to buy into the insurance

274
00:23:57,605 --> 00:24:02,203
plan by paying the entire premium plus 2%.

275
00:24:02,203 --> 00:24:07,234
However, for workers or former workers who could

276
00:24:07,234 --> 00:24:12,272
afford this, it was a very important extension.

277
00:24:12,272 --> 00:24:15,026
Because, first of all, it enabled them and

278
00:24:15,026 --> 00:24:19,503
often their family to continue to have insurance, health insurance.

279
00:24:19,503 --> 00:24:24,969
It also helped prevent them from facing preexisting

280
00:24:24,969 --> 00:24:32,928
condition exclusions when they would seek out insurance at a future point.

281
00:24:32,928 --> 00:24:38,102
So COBRA in this period in 1986, in the 1990s, and

282
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:43,494
even through the 2000s was very important legislation.

283
00:24:43,494 --> 00:24:48,019
Even though it was costly, as you can already be imagining,

284
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:53,003
many workers could not afford to pay the entire premium plus 2%.

285
00:24:53,003 --> 00:24:55,939
And so still did lose their insurance.

286
00:24:55,939 --> 00:24:59,165
But for those who could afford it,

287
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:03,848
it was a way to continue to have health insurance.

288
00:25:03,848 --> 00:25:07,787
And another policy change,

289
00:25:07,787 --> 00:25:15,181
somewhat related to COBRA, came about in 1996.

290
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:19,753
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act,

291
00:25:19,753 --> 00:25:22,715
otherwise known by its acronym HIPAA.

292
00:25:22,715 --> 00:25:28,869
And the HIPAA legislation, you might be surprised to know,

293
00:25:28,869 --> 00:25:34,542
was actually about extending protection around health

294
00:25:34,542 --> 00:25:39,988
insurance after the COBRA benefits were exhausted.

295
00:25:39,988 --> 00:25:44,338
So COBRA, as we just discussed, allowed people,

296
00:25:44,338 --> 00:25:49,396
if they could afford it, to continue to buy their Insurance

297
00:25:49,396 --> 00:25:53,950
plan that they had from their previous employer, for

298
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:59,341
up to one year, if they could pay the entire premium plus 2%.

299
00:25:59,341 --> 00:26:02,120
Now, after that was exhausted,

300
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:07,878
let's say the person after a year and a half was able to get a new job and

301
00:26:07,878 --> 00:26:13,850
they would get access to a new insurance plan, through that employer.

302
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:18,598
That new insurance plan could actually impose

303
00:26:18,598 --> 00:26:24,203
preexisting condition exclusions onto that person.

304
00:26:24,203 --> 00:26:29,235
Meaning that their health conditions that existed prior to

305
00:26:29,235 --> 00:26:36,392
this new insurance plan would be excluded from coverage from the health insurance.

306
00:26:36,392 --> 00:26:41,783
And so that kind of restriction caused many problems for

307
00:26:41,783 --> 00:26:45,339
people needing health insurance and

308
00:26:45,339 --> 00:26:50,514
having health conditions that needed to be treated.

309
00:26:50,514 --> 00:26:59,196
And so what the HIPAA legislation allowed is enrolling in a new health plan,

310
00:26:59,196 --> 00:27:04,352
that could not impose preexisting condition

311
00:27:04,352 --> 00:27:09,236
exclusions if that person had been in a full

312
00:27:09,236 --> 00:27:14,544
health plan prior to this new insurance plan.

313
00:27:14,544 --> 00:27:18,080
And that there was no lapse of more than

314
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:23,063
say 63 days in the period between insurance plans.

315
00:27:23,063 --> 00:27:25,918
So, still fairly restrictive and

316
00:27:25,918 --> 00:27:30,648
still many people may not have been able to participate.

317
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:35,681
But COBRA and the HIPAA legislation was some

318
00:27:35,681 --> 00:27:40,713
way to try to enable people who lost their job

319
00:27:40,713 --> 00:27:46,972
to have some access to employer sponsored insurance or

320
00:27:46,972 --> 00:27:53,793
insurance plans in the period that they were not employed.

321
00:27:53,793 --> 00:27:55,208
Now for many of you,

322
00:27:55,208 --> 00:28:00,469
you might be surprised to hear that that's the legislation around HIPAA.

323
00:28:00,469 --> 00:28:05,156
Because you are more familiar with or hearing the term HIPAA and

324
00:28:05,156 --> 00:28:10,470
thinking it has to do with privacy protections of health information.

325
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:15,332
And so, in some ways, this is something important to think

326
00:28:15,332 --> 00:28:18,945
about with how federal policy [LAUGH] works.

327
00:28:18,945 --> 00:28:25,590
Included in the HIPAA legislation were three administrative simplifications.

328
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:28,569
And this often happens in federal legislation.

329
00:28:28,569 --> 00:28:33,305
So these three administrative simplifications were added that

330
00:28:33,305 --> 00:28:36,646
were about electronic health information.

331
00:28:36,646 --> 00:28:42,358
So the three rules are the transaction rules which standardized transactions and

332
00:28:42,358 --> 00:28:46,343
code sets, your we're gonna hear some more about that.

333
00:28:46,343 --> 00:28:52,566
Some of you might be familiar with exactly how claims works and

334
00:28:52,566 --> 00:28:56,885
different codes for billing that occurs.

335
00:28:56,885 --> 00:29:00,561
And those transaction rules were established for

336
00:29:00,561 --> 00:29:04,947
electronic health information in the HIPAA legislation.

337
00:29:04,947 --> 00:29:09,875
Privacy rules for the use and disclosure of patients

338
00:29:09,875 --> 00:29:15,370
protected health information was established by HIPAA.

339
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:18,399
And security rules for the physical and

340
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:22,716
technical safeguards that protect confidentiality,

341
00:29:22,716 --> 00:29:27,859
integrity, and availability of protected health information,

342
00:29:27,859 --> 00:29:31,824
were all established in the HIPAA law of 1996.

343
00:29:31,824 --> 00:29:36,739
And so today we actually hear much more about HIPAA related to these

344
00:29:36,739 --> 00:29:41,659
three minor administrative simplifications that were added into

345
00:29:41,659 --> 00:29:47,307
the legislation than what the primary legislation was actually all about.

346
00:29:49,712 --> 00:29:55,908
So, those are some of the major government policy

347
00:29:55,908 --> 00:30:02,259
changes over this period of 1965 to 2010.

348
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:07,166
Which brings us up to the health care system that is very close to

349
00:30:07,166 --> 00:30:08,746
what we have today.

350
00:30:08,746 --> 00:30:11,899
But it's still not exactly what we have today.

351
00:30:11,899 --> 00:30:16,493
Because this picture of this third party payer

352
00:30:16,493 --> 00:30:21,440
system that has many different types of actors and

353
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:29,007
groups in each of our boxes now, is still not what we have today in 2020.

354
00:30:29,007 --> 00:30:35,225
Because as you know soon after 2010, we have the passage and

355
00:30:35,225 --> 00:30:40,292
then the establishment of the Affordable Care Act,

356
00:30:40,292 --> 00:30:45,475
which makes some significant changes to some of these

357
00:30:45,475 --> 00:30:50,907
structures that we'll talk about in another session.

358
00:30:50,907 --> 00:30:57,536
But at this point as we end the thinking about the structure in 2010,

359
00:30:57,536 --> 00:31:02,535
I just wanna show one slide that shows health insurance

360
00:31:02,535 --> 00:31:07,443
coverage of the nonelderly population in 2011.

361
00:31:07,443 --> 00:31:13,052
So prior to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.

362
00:31:13,052 --> 00:31:16,989
And so, as you look at this slide and

363
00:31:16,989 --> 00:31:22,767
think about some of the things we've talked about,

364
00:31:22,767 --> 00:31:27,756
we see that nearly 56% of the US nonelderly

365
00:31:27,756 --> 00:31:33,160
population has employer sponsored insurance.

366
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:40,024
About 5.7% of the nonelderly population has private insurance,

367
00:31:40,024 --> 00:31:45,024
but it is called non-group insurance because it is

368
00:31:45,024 --> 00:31:49,108
a private individual market insurance.

369
00:31:49,108 --> 00:31:55,885
We see that about 21% of this population has Medicaid or

370
00:31:55,885 --> 00:32:02,675
another public like the CHIP program types of insurance.

371
00:32:02,675 --> 00:32:07,721
And 18% of this population is uninsured,

372
00:32:07,721 --> 00:32:12,117
as of 2011, in the United States.

373
00:32:12,117 --> 00:32:18,291
Something else to think about is why we would talk about health insurance coverage

374
00:32:18,291 --> 00:32:24,207
for the nonelderly population in order to think about the percent uninsured.

375
00:32:24,207 --> 00:32:29,551
And the reason we talk about the nonelderly population is because

376
00:32:29,551 --> 00:32:35,299
the elderly population, people 65 and over, all have insurance.

377
00:32:35,299 --> 00:32:40,223
Because they all have Medicare insurance in the United States.
