1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:18,719
But by the following year or so I guess I was think the only economic and we are you me it's not clear it's going to be for money.

2
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,320
It's a king, right? That's what I'm saying. I don't know.

3
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:39,360
But what's interesting to me was there was an information you really had a romantic election for the front seat of the car.

4
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:49,470
Yeah, I was just feeling the information and markets.

5
00:00:50,670 --> 00:01:04,260
You don't know what's going on?

6
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:09,510
Oh, yeah.

7
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:20,090
Yeah. I'm so happy.

8
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:28,270
I should have put money on weeks ago. Several years ago.

9
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:33,830
You guys like my boss?

10
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,170
I was like, person is really talented consideration.

11
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:56,100
Sometimes I don't know why I like to have a little puppy, so I don't usually said No, not me.

12
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:07,690
No, mom, no. I think one of the first.

13
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:18,420
Oh, we know for sure. I know. But I was debating like with that because this project, I think it's working with you.

14
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:22,010
I guess first of all, talk about it.

15
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:28,170
So let's let's get very involved.

16
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:44,740
I don't think anybody I don't think I going to start with, you know what I want to play game because I feel like my presentation does that I've had.

17
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:50,579
Yeah except for the things I do not think it through.

18
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:54,180
I don't think that's really unrealistic.

19
00:02:55,050 --> 00:03:09,540
I was thinking, why do you think there is a need to change my mind?

20
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:15,930
My money is just all I thought about. I was like, Oh yeah.

21
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:27,780
And I was like, lines trying to improve on something.

22
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:48,899
So she's like, Oh, I think it's is limitless and so on until I get a lot of people.

23
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,380
So then you're like, Oh no, this is a great thing.

24
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,470
So my thoughts and then I don't lose it and try to find something.

25
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:07,020
You look at all of this, if you felt guilty.

26
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:16,350
Oh, I wasn't here. We can start with the information that markets presentation.

27
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:33,250
We have one person who is swimming and I'm in and this presentation so I don't lose sleep.

28
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:49,920
I think it's like, you know, he really I think it's great.

29
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:59,280
It's like this question you just made in the beginning that was just.

30
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,020
Listen. Good morning.

31
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,790
Hello, everybody. Welcome to our presentation on information asymmetry.

32
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:14,640
My name is running out of control on the way.

33
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:21,449
So the concept of information asymmetry is the idea that in a market transaction,

34
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:26,460
a seller or a buyer, there is uneven information between the seller and the buyer.

35
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:37,170
And that leads to that leads to a market transaction that is greatly advantageous to one of those parties and disadvantageous to the other.

36
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:46,470
So George Akerlof considered information asymmetry in a paper that considered the used car market.

37
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:55,710
Now in a used car market. There are good cars which we will call features and there are rubbish cards which we will call lemons.

38
00:05:55,770 --> 00:06:04,770
Now the seller of the car has intimate knowledge of their vehicle and they know whether maybe it'll only last a month or it'll last a long time,

39
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,120
whereas the buyer does not have this intimate information.

40
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:21,270
So this is the asymmetry in question. And it leads to it leads to consumers not wanting to pay peach prices for what could be Lemond vehicles.

41
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:28,440
And as a result, there they will not pay the result of them not wanting to pay piech prices.

42
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:38,790
Sellers with piech cars will not want to sell at lemon prices, which will draw drive out good cards out of the market and move the price,

43
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:43,650
the asking price further down as the quality of the true quality of cars decreases.

44
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:48,920
So obviously in a model like this, there are some things that aren't considered.

45
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:59,140
For example, is a car's such a necessity that people might risk paying what the car more than the car is worth just to own a car.

46
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:09,770
Maybe it's such a necessity and. There are also ways to kind of mitigate this potential market failure.

47
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:18,620
One of them and it is has to do with the with balancing the information in question.

48
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:26,120
Obviously, there are resources like CARFAX and inspections that can be done so that sell so

49
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:31,850
that sellers and purchasers are have comparable information about the product.

50
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:39,710
Now, while in the car market, there is that information asymmetry where the seller knew more than the buyer.

51
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:44,150
We might be able to describe it oppositely in the case of health care.

52
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,010
So there is an asymmetry between the insurer and a potential patient because

53
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:53,120
the patient who's purchasing the insurance actually has intimate knowledge,

54
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:59,299
might have intimate knowledge of their own health, whereas the insurer might not know who they're insuring really,

55
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:03,110
who they are insuring, and the risks that come with insuring that individual.

56
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,219
So as a result as a result, theoretically,

57
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:15,350
you could think that those who when insurance companies add on a monthly premium

58
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:22,040
to cope with the risk that might come with insuring potentially unhealthy people,

59
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:28,280
healthier people will be driven out of the market in the same way that good cars would be driven out of this used car market.

60
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:34,040
There are certain things associated with this information asymmetry,

61
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:42,260
such as inefficient outcomes over delivery and moral hazard, which are often spoke about specifically to health care.

62
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:50,870
And so the question for information asymmetry in health care becomes how do we mitigate

63
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:58,250
or squash these effects of the asymmetry and keep costs lower than they are right now?

64
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:07,830
And because of the assignments for information in the health care market, one of the big life insurance companies, John Hancock,

65
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:11,850
launched an interactive health program under the brand vitality,

66
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:16,500
hoping it would help keep their policyholders stay healthy and reduce the number of claims.

67
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:23,490
How does the vitality worth it? Collect health data from their policyholders venerable tracking device,

68
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:29,820
and incentivize them to go exercising regularly by offering discounts and rewards such as premiums,

69
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:33,620
traveling, discounts, and more to those hitting the fitness goals.

70
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:41,820
Yeah. So as of 2015, they launched the insurance program and essentially promotes healthy eating, exercise and mental well-being.

71
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:49,520
And basically the goal of the insurance plan is to engage consumers with the with their plan and policy.

72
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:55,920
And also, I guess you touched on that. It offers incentives as milestone towards lower premiums and discounts on smart devices.

73
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:02,560
And it begs the question, is this a win win for the consumer and the producers?

74
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:08,190
So consumers are essentially improving the health outcomes by engaging with their interactive health policy.

75
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:14,910
And then participants are it's expected by a study that participants are expected to live 13 to 21 years longer.

76
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:22,200
So essentially, the participants are living longer and insurance plans are collecting more premiums and paying out less claims.

77
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:31,290
So the question is, what are some key differences between a traditional life insurance plan and an interactive life insurance plan?

78
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:45,400
Is anyone familiar with the traditional life insurance plan? No.

79
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:53,190
Okay. So let me get so traditional after you go to the traditional life insurance plan, it involves minimal consumer engagement.

80
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,460
You basically sign up for a plan, you pay a premium, and then you pay out a plan.

81
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:05,350
You get paid on a claim in the case of the event for an eventful day, depending on the details of the plan.

82
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:11,890
There's no incentives for health improvement, like an interactive health plan, and that basically.

83
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:18,250
So there's no you don't really you just have a life insurance plan and then interactive life assurance find.

84
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:22,270
It motivates you to be healthier, exercise, eat better.

85
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,970
And then it's also tech and data driven life.

86
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:30,129
The traditional life insurance plan does not involve any technology or health tech that tracks your data.

87
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:36,940
And it's also it's pretty dull. I mean, as a traditional life insurance plan, there's not many aspects to it,

88
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:42,459
whereas an interactive life insurance plan involves incentives and also it's cost effective for

89
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:48,070
the insurer because they're paying they're paying out less claims and collecting more premiums.

90
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:55,030
And it's called cost effective for the insured as well, because they're saving money on their incentivized lower premiums, smart devices.

91
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:04,600
So they they they decrease your premium if you have if you engage with healthier lifestyles.

92
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:10,060
But if you have a health event or something and they're recording all that data, they also increase the premium.

93
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:17,200
So that's my experience with life insurance, is that it does go up any time they have they get notification.

94
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:20,500
Right. And that's that's the thing. So they're tracking all your data. So yeah.

95
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,470
And that event, yeah, they would increase it. That's why staying healthier, it lowers the premiums.

96
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:32,470
So in the event that there is a health event. So key takeaways from the interactive life insurance plan.

97
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:38,380
A traditional life insurance market is riddled with asymmetry. There's not much consumer engagement between the the insurer and the insured.

98
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,620
They interact on his life insurance policy.

99
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:47,139
All of them want to be consumers to better their quality of life and essentially understand their life insurance policy

100
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:54,400
better because they are trying to get achieve these incentives so they can better their finances and quality of life.

101
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,920
And then also in terms of life,

102
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:05,170
insurance plans prove how health tech is a driver and mitigating information asymmetry and something to consider will help you people continue

103
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:12,370
to pay for an interactive life insurance policy and the sense of what are the trade offs of having a traditional life insurance policy?

104
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:19,750
If you're a healthy, healthy person or if you're already a healthy person having an attractive life insurance policy, what are the benefits to that?

105
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:26,710
So sometimes you need you get motivated to do something if you're paying for it,

106
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:34,030
as opposed to so if you are paying for the health insurance, then you would be motivated to work out the end healthier.

107
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,120
But sometimes if you don't have that health insurance, you wouldn't even think about it.

108
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:44,199
So that's a claim of 13 to 21 years difference in life expectancy.

109
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,769
It would be possible to strain credibility.

110
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:50,979
All of that is true. I mean, it's it's too early.

111
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:54,640
It's strange credibility a little bit because it's all expected.

112
00:13:55,420 --> 00:14:02,800
So you don't know until you also think about who is more likely to want to sign up for an interactive health insurance policy.

113
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:10,360
So in other words, it's a health insurance policy causing you to live an extra 13 to 21 years, or are the people who say, yeah,

114
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,709
I'll wear that health tracker and to get those lower premiums, people who are already going to live,

115
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:19,030
say, 12 to 20 more years and maybe the policies getting them one more year.

116
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:19,600
Yeah.

117
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:31,410
You have a big selection of that going on in terms of which consumers opt into the interactive driver driving policies or auto insurance policies.

118
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:35,400
Now, you can have everything tracked. You know, you're in your vehicle.

119
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:43,410
So if I'm a crappy driver, I'm not going to be signing up for a plan that tracks my driving and sets the rates based on that.

120
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:55,150
And so the second case that we looked at was information asymmetry when it comes to consumer driven health plans in the health insurance market.

121
00:14:55,900 --> 00:15:04,540
So there was a study done by researchers that studied the asymmetric information in how consumers make decisions when choosing those plans.

122
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:13,670
So a little background on consumer driven health plans where there is a health insurance policy that you can buy from any large insurance company.

123
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,600
It's like Blue Cross Blue Shield or UnitedHealthcare.

124
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:24,160
And it allows the use of HSA as which your health savings accounts and health reimbursement accounts to help pay for these products.

125
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:28,870
More than likely, they are high or low for a high deductible plan.

126
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:38,860
And the asymmetry in the health care market leads to the inefficiencies when it comes to consumers who are choosing these products.

127
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:45,070
So the some of the effects of the asymmetric information we kind of touched on earlier about

128
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:50,889
how consumers know more about their health or lifestyle than what the insurers don't like.

129
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:51,940
Looking at it this way,

130
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:59,050
as the patients don't know as much about patients that they're buying if they are less educated and underfunded in these areas.

131
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:04,060
So researchers study the disconnect between the information that they were they were

132
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:08,680
given or what the consumers had and the health insurance that they were purchasing.

133
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:16,839
They found that insurers who are more undereducated, like the lower income people, were purchasing health insurance,

134
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:26,230
that they could purchase health insurance that wasn't helping them, so that they were spending more and causing health costs to rise in those cases.

135
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:35,799
So they found basically two major things that consumers do not understand or some who don't have the

136
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,860
information available to choose the correct health plan when it comes to what their health needs are.

137
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:45,280
And then the inefficiencies in spending do not.

138
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:54,610
Inefficiencies and spending that the consumer driven health plans were designed to address when they were created are not

139
00:16:54,610 --> 00:17:00,910
being fixed because of the inability of the consumer to not have all the relevant information when it comes to purchasing.

140
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,060
So you have higher premiums because.

141
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:16,440
We talk about the CHP. It has a lot of.

142
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,380
Which means that as a country,

143
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:30,050
health care and healthy people will prefer a high premium with slow data post because they visit doctors or use medical resources,

144
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:39,870
which means that the lower. The one.

145
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:53,440
So the House people will try to buy health insurance plans that will lower premiums,

146
00:17:53,440 --> 00:18:00,250
but higher deductibles, which means that the higher out-of-pocket need to be paid by the beneficiaries.

147
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:08,049
However, this doesn't work for the sick people because they will use medical treatments and visit doctors more.

148
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:12,440
So they will prefer higher premiums, lower deductibles.

149
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:24,310
So a sick individual, sicker and knowledge of their medical needs gives them as much information advantage in purchasing health insurance.

150
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:30,640
They want to have a higher price for medical insurance based on the higher anticipated medical cost.

151
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:37,330
In response, the health insurers want to avoid the adverse selection.

152
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:45,640
So what they do, they just use two ways. One is limit the coverage and one is increase the premiums.

153
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,600
The higher premiums will distort the health insurance market.

154
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:57,880
And also the healthy people may exit exit that market or even withdraw from that plan.

155
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:06,250
And finally, the health insurance market becomes a nimble market, and we learn what is an aggressive action in this lecture,

156
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:12,160
which means that buyers have more information that sellers don't have and vice versa.

157
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:23,770
To better understand why and when an individual wants to purchase a health insurance plan, we will use the risk averse model.

158
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:35,090
We suppose everyone in health issues is risk averse in this model.

159
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:44,410
We assume an individual's annual income is $30,000 and then we can find the point of being and if he gets sick,

160
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:49,810
he will lose about $20,000 and then we will get here.

161
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:58,480
And there are 50% possibility that the person will get sick and a 50% possibility after having the health insurance.

162
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:03,880
The person can have access to health and get preventive care.

163
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:17,459
And then we kind of find the point by linking the point and point of view, find the middle point and use the Y value of the point.

164
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:21,630
D We kind of find the point C in that person's utility.

165
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:29,670
And from the distance it's about $4,000, which call it the risk premium.

166
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:37,050
And a risk averse people are willing to pay maximum money, which is $40,000.

167
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:40,740
It's almost a half of annual income.

168
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:43,830
So if this case is true,

169
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:58,080
are you willing to pay that amount of money if you know you have 50% of getting sick and obviously at the moment is $20,000 waiting to.

170
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:03,590
Maybe not yet, but you are someone who have chronic disease.

171
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:08,780
Are you willing to? But you also have you.

172
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:16,820
Whether you have chronic disease or not, your accounts, your trust will not change.

173
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:26,670
So some key takeaways from this presentation before.

174
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:33,900
But information drives markets and asymmetry between information of the consumer and

175
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:40,350
the consumer and the seller can induce adverse effects and even market failure.

176
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,100
So in as far as health care goes,

177
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:52,589
there's there's generally believed to be an direct relationship between the risk of the of the patient and the coverage that they receive.

178
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:59,459
However, we're challenging that with new innovations that help help mitigate this information asymmetry,

179
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,610
for example, with with the John Hancock example.

180
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:12,839
And that also points to the growing presence of these innovations in health care technology that are helping to mitigate this information asymmetry

181
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:21,690
and hopefully bring down bring down the premium of this information asymmetry that is compelled by insurance companies to mitigate risk.

182
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:41,120
So thank you so much for listening to our presentation. Hopefully more than the next two compositions I can economics question going back to

183
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:49,580
the used car that I just started with or was harmed by the asymmetric information?

184
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:57,140
Well, initially I would have said people who are purchasing cars, but they are not.

185
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:04,580
Since they are willing to only purchase cars at a market average, I would say I mean,

186
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:11,960
I would say people who want to sell their peak used cars would not have a viable market to do so.

187
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:15,020
So I would also say that they are actually being quite right.

188
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:22,579
So the sellers of good cars, because they can't if they can't credibly convey that I have a more valuable than average car their

189
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:26,420
stock either keeping their car because they can't get a price that they'll accept or they have to

190
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:31,069
accept a price that's lower than the true value of the car and they'll gain more utility from their

191
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:36,140
car than the price they're willing to accept from a consumer who doesn't know whether they're buying.

192
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:45,010
And then, conversely, a consumer that really wants a car but can't identify it is going to have to, you know, take their chances and their.

193
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:53,090
So it's basically the buyers and sellers of cars. If I, I want I want top end use car real time verifying that's what I'm getting.

194
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:59,480
If I'm a seller of a top end used car, I have a hard time getting a price commensurate with that true quality.

195
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,750
Yeah. So it's those people are hurt.

196
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:10,040
Essentially the question that has I don't know if that leads to a high depreciation of cars like rapid depreciation of cars,

197
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:33,560
but it's possible that restaurants, forensic economists, companies looking for a way through their too.

198
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:43,880
Yeah I think she you know she has couch so she I just any time I was I just texted her to join the service she said she was joining right now.

199
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:58,130
Talk about like pointed towards looks so small that if you do unmute and make sure that the volumes get.

200
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:25,940
I just have to say that I think it's going to be several songs like let's just say, you know, just like there's you want to try to get a muse, right?

201
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:42,830
Yeah. So I was like, well, you know, diminishing returns because you it's set in stone minus my colleagues at the bar for this point.

202
00:25:49,640 --> 00:26:02,690
It doesn't matter how close to finishing, you know what I'm saying?

203
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:11,090
But where you sort of it's one of the things one of the one to the right on the tap.

204
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:17,720
There you go. Yeah. All right. We made it.

205
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:22,760
Okay. So we're going to talk to you today about price transparency in health care.

206
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:27,500
Oddly, we all heard about this incident yesterday at the end of class.

207
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:33,130
So she covered quite a bit of what we're going to cover today, but we're going to cover it again and then some more detail.

208
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:38,900
So that should be helpful. Here's a nice meme for you. I hope you understand this by the end of the presentation.

209
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:44,010
And if not, I guess we didn't do our jobs well. So. Yeah, there we go.

210
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,280
Oh, by the way, I'm branded, right. And then we got Liz.

211
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:52,910
I'm sorry. Yes. All right.

212
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,859
So outline of our presentation.

213
00:26:54,860 --> 00:27:01,850
Just real quickly, I'm going to go over the current landscape of price transparency kind of politically and what that looks like.

214
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:06,410
I mean, some of the theory behind it, what it looks like in regular markets and what it looks like in the health care market.

215
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:13,910
And then we've got Liz going over a study with hospital responses to CMS final rule, and then Craig,

216
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:21,020
who's going to go over this JAMA article and then Conner is going to cover an editorial in that Craig is going to wrap us up with a few solutions.

217
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:30,960
So current landscape, what is price transparency? And it's being able to know what the prices sweet we're getting.

218
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:35,220
All right. Historically, it's been really opaque.

219
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,060
In the US.

220
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:45,300
There haven't really been any big attempts at change until very recently when CMS laid forth the requirements for price transparency in hospitals.

221
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:52,070
You know, final rule was what they called it in 2019 because of COVID and a few other reasons.

222
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,750
This was delayed essentially.

223
00:27:54,750 --> 00:28:02,640
And then in that gap, Trump let out an executive order where medicare.gov has to kind of update your hospital, compare website.

224
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:06,390
A bunch of other things to include hospitals compliance with the rule.

225
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:14,340
And then January 1st, 2021, things finally hit and it went into effect, so to speak, at least their rule did in their enforcements.

226
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,730
And here are kind of the stipulations, right?

227
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:22,530
So hospitals have to provide clear, accessible pricing info that's machine readable and consumer friendly.

228
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:26,940
And then the enforcement strategy is called Civil Monetary Penalties,

229
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:32,070
to basically decide penalties on hospitals who don't comply to having these things available to consumers.

230
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:36,570
So and those got increased in 2022.

231
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:46,290
So price transparency theory in regular markets, the response to price transparency is a consumer demand shift and then a market price change.

232
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,510
So to explain this, I have some drawings for you.

233
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:57,870
We have Richard here. He's not at all connected or he's looking for he's looking to buy some clips.

234
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:01,890
So he looks around, he's going to the farmer's market or whatnot in Ann Arbor.

235
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:06,780
We'll just say and he comes across a couple of plant stands. There are no prices listed.

236
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:10,530
Right. So these are like what the prices are, but they're not listed on the plant stands.

237
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:15,000
So he just decides, well, go for the first one. I see. He gets a plant.

238
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:22,190
It's $10. He's kind of neutral about it. He's like, you know, this little flower, $10 didn't seem quite right, but I got it.

239
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:26,460
I have. My flower will be all right. He didn't know what the other price was, so he's not too upset.

240
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:31,800
But if he'd gone for the other price, he'd be pretty happy if my money went to be worth it.

241
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:38,070
So now the prices are visible. So we no longer have what we have.

242
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:42,389
Price transparency. And so then he goes for the cheaper plant stand option.

243
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:45,690
Right, which is $5, because he sees that it's cheaper. He gets his plant.

244
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,480
What happens to the top line? What does the seller do?

245
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:57,980
Just because the cheaper one right they lower their prices to me is so consumer demand shift and then overall price market change.

246
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:05,330
What component of health care makes the health care market respond differently to price transparency?

247
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,340
So it doesn't respond like these markets do. But why is it a third party payer?

248
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:15,919
Yeah, that's a large reason. Right. So that's kind of what I'm getting at.

249
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:22,130
Like a third party payer creates somewhat of a barrier between the consumer and the seller, which causes healthcare markets to respond differently.

250
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:33,200
So this is the healthcare market. Anybody was wondering if anger's an invasion and here's kind of just a basic

251
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:39,319
drive going on for what the healthcare market would or what it's like right now,

252
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:46,639
so to speak, without any price transparency. And we're going to assume for this that this person has met their deductible and they have 100% coverage.

253
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,820
Right. So this is kind of an extreme, but we've registered again.

254
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:54,620
He's broken his arm. He was one of these two hospitals.

255
00:30:56,990 --> 00:31:00,920
And his main deciding factor is not that one is cheaper and more expensive.

256
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:06,260
Of course, it's that one is in his HMO. So he's going to go to the top hospital.

257
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:09,440
It's going to get his arm fixed. He's not going to pay because he is 100% coverage.

258
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:13,850
He's going to be happy in his arms fixed. How do you go on to the other one that wasn't in his HMO?

259
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:17,270
He would have had to pay $500 and he think, man, now it's really expensive,

260
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:26,870
but my respects so I guess we're all right but it was $500 or you can imagine that being more realistically 5000 or 8000 relative to the other one.

261
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:31,930
Either way, his main deciding factor is whether the thing is in his insurance or not.

262
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:36,830
So when it comes to health care markets, the response is questionable.

263
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:42,530
Because of the third party system, insurers kind of insulate consumers from their price concerns.

264
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:50,209
And you can think of the percent of coverage that consumers have as inversely proportional to the demand sensitivity to price.

265
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:54,500
So I'm not really going to care about the price if I have a ton of coverage.

266
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:59,810
But if I like no coverage, then I will care a lot about the price or if I haven't met my deductible, so to speak.

267
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:05,510
So a big concern in this area is competitive interactions between hospitals.

268
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:10,250
I don't have a drawing for this because it's complex to draw out, but I'll explain it as well as I can.

269
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:16,730
So hospitals have like contractual agreements which we talked about accounting and in 600 as well.

270
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:22,010
But the podcast I listen to for this called them secret discounts, right?

271
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:25,610
And their goal with those is to achieve particular patient access.

272
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:31,969
So they might provide 10% off for UnitedHealthcare patients or something along those lines so that they can get more

273
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:37,730
of those private payer patients and end up with more those eventually and then possibly raise prices later on.

274
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:41,990
Either way, if these discounts are publicly known competition.

275
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:44,860
So like big fishes in the pond, right?

276
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:53,030
Who can afford to decrease prices more than those other smaller guys will say, well, decrease their prices, pull all of their patient mixes over,

277
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:57,800
and then either run them out of business or at least cause them to raise their prices back up or something along those lines.

278
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:02,330
So you end up with prices possibly going up in the long run.

279
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:08,750
So okay, we're going to launch in some studies with Liz first to highlight small world interactions.

280
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:18,200
So I to where the University of Minnesota School of Public Health had some researchers,

281
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:23,190
and they went ahead and looked at a nationally representative sample of 470 hospitals

282
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:28,740
after the price transparency rule or the price transparency rule with minimal impact.

283
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:40,010
And they did an Internet search to see what the pricing used to be in hospitals and then they went ahead and compared to see how the hospital.

284
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:44,910
So that was like a nonprofit. It was on quick.

285
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:49,259
Can you hear the fine? She's super quiet. That the next volume.

286
00:33:49,260 --> 00:34:03,340
I might be wrong. Yeah, I might. I might have chosen the wrong speaker. One sector is saying this system is good and this better this time.

287
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:07,769
Okay, you just restart. Sorry about that. Yeah, well, that's fine.

288
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:16,079
Let's close with research. Okay, so there were some researchers from the University of Minnesota and they went ahead and looked at a

289
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:22,950
nationally representative sample of 470 hospitals for the price transparency rule was passed and they went.

290
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:26,819
There hadn't been error in Internet search to look at the available pricing

291
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:30,510
information and to see whether or not that meant any requirements for these hospitals.

292
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:38,010
They went ahead and looked at how the reporting was different depending on whether hospitals were nonprofit or private public.

293
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:41,729
So the ownership status, they also looked at system affiliation.

294
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:47,850
So if it was an independent hospital versus a hospital with a system that of categories,

295
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:51,719
so essentially looking at number of beds and the size of the hospitals and then also

296
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:55,890
whether or not the hospital was located in a metropolitan area that was cited.

297
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:07,319
So we found that one in four hospitals out of those 170 reported data that

298
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:12,630
met the machine readable format requirements that top are there with a 25.2%.

299
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:22,230
And then they found that 73.5% of the hospitals in the sample, the consumer friendly format, and most of those did that through process and so on.

300
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:30,899
And the key takeaway is that only 23.7% of that sample, both hospitals actually met both of those requirements,

301
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:38,310
which means that only 23.7% actually met the full requirement for the price transparency rule, which is a pretty low number.

302
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:50,030
Next slide. They also found that the specific rates were the least likely to be disclosed, which you can see in the top bar on the right.

303
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:55,190
Only 33.3% of the hospitals in the sample actually sharing that information.

304
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,749
And if I recall correctly, from the actual study, they were pretty journalism as to that,

305
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:08,360
if even a 1% negotiated price was listed on the other side, they counted that as having shared information with the site.

306
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:13,880
And then when they were comparing across those different categories,

307
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:22,459
they found that nonprofit hospitals and the hospitals that are affiliated with System were a lot more likely to report consumer friendly information,

308
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:26,480
which you can see in the bars on the right side.

309
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:39,530
So what do people think might be some reasons of the hospitals having complied with the new law because it would lose their negotiating power?

310
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:46,060
So Andrew said because they lose their negotiating power. I don't know.

311
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:49,659
Yeah I get I hear like that mumbles out there.

312
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:53,740
I mean out of here I might have to call them people. Okay, sweet.

313
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:05,080
Any other thoughts on this? Okay.

314
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:15,950
So I have a question. Okay. Next slide. So some of the reasons, reasons that hospitals might not have complied were that at that time,

315
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:18,570
the hospitals were overwhelmed with the COVID 19 pandemic.

316
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:26,320
So they may have just had other, bigger priorities rather than, you know, organizing all this information on a website or consumer friendly format.

317
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:32,560
Another reason might be that hospitals delayed making the updates because there were some pending legal challenges.

318
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:38,950
So, you know, they may have thinking themselves, let's maybe not put all the time and effort into getting all this information online ready to go.

319
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:42,400
And this is just going to get overheard and it will have been a waste of our efforts.

320
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:51,249
And then lastly, some hospitals may have made a cost benefit analysis and decided that the $300 a day at that point in time,

321
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:57,520
during 2021, the end of the study, they really decided that that fine for noncompliance was cheaper than actually all of the

322
00:37:57,530 --> 00:38:02,140
time and effort and everything going into making these changes to meet the requirements.

323
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:09,469
And just wrote in to address the negotiating negotiating power to achieve

324
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:13,970
certain patient exits or the negotiating power to discount prices for insurers.

325
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:19,620
Well, I think that just achieving the patient mixes.

326
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:23,129
Right. So they do lose a lot of that power. Yeah. They would not be upset, however,

327
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:28,800
about losing the power to discount their practice because then they wouldn't have to write like they want their money.

328
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:35,400
Right. You may not want to reveal that this other I've given this other insurer a better deal than I've given you.

329
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,920
Yes. And other insurers have come back. Yeah. Yeah.

330
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:41,090
And the secrecy alone is encouraging.

331
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:47,780
I kind of feel like there's huge business opportunity for somebody to start a business where you can go and say, I have this insurance,

332
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:53,540
I need this procedure, and they'll collect all this information from different hospitals and say, here's where you serve.

333
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:59,490
Right. Like private firms they can use. Yeah. I mean, nothing to do with CMS or with the hospitals.

334
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:03,780
Yeah, that's something I was thinking about. Yes. In class. Yeah. It's like this is a huge opportunity.

335
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,090
That makes sense. We'll come to some solutions at the end.

336
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:14,570
And one that, like solving serious issues, is getting a way for insurers to seek to lower prices for eventually consumer demand.

337
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:17,820
And so, yeah, private companies can. Okay.

338
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,930
Straight away. Thank you, guys. You did great.

339
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:28,080
This JAMA study actually is similar to what Andrew was just talking about.

340
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:36,810
Looked at a price transparency tool, which is basically an app or a website where you can go on and check the prices for procedures in the area.

341
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:43,170
So what this study did is they looked at three large employers and they gave them a tool to offer their employees a couple hundred thousand people,

342
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:45,360
and they compared against people's not using the tool.

343
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:52,980
And then this tool provided information for roughly about 330 services and know it was just outpatient, not inpatient,

344
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:58,230
because inpatient services, you often hear the doctor one way that people don't really care that much.

345
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:04,140
And the main idea here is that the tool can help consumers pick the lowest priced option.

346
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:12,180
Um, and then there's a relationship between cost and party, but the consumers actually believe this, so we're going to get into that.

347
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:17,370
So next year. Oh, yeah, yeah.

348
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:28,300
You can see from these graphs, these medics appreciate Excel employees using the tool actually increase their spending.

349
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:35,390
So the sample group here in our control group has a green bar that actually increased it by more than the control group.

350
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:41,030
So people with this tool actually increase spending overall and their out-of-pocket spending as well.

351
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:46,879
And then that also increases monetization at what's called hospital based outpatient department services.

352
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:52,190
So basically outpatient centers that are affiliated with hospitals, which are typically more expensive.

353
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:57,049
And part of this is because of what we talked about earlier.

354
00:40:57,050 --> 00:41:00,290
Workout group markets are perhaps different than markets.

355
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:06,170
So sort of thing, some reasons about why this would happen. We have some explanations about this.

356
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:13,129
Later on we get to that. Some things like the conclusion of the study is they found that offering the

357
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:16,220
price transparency tool was not associated with lower health care spending,

358
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:22,520
which is kind of counterintuitive. This graph here kind of shows the utilization for this tool.

359
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:29,690
So the amount of enrollees is not even 10%. So users with one or more log ons was not even comparison.

360
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:36,800
So 90% of people didn't even use this tool. And then you can see it starts to go down with people with more log ons.

361
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:39,860
And you can see here is only a very small percent of employees.

362
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:45,140
So we're going to kind of dove into some more explanations about why that spending increase.

363
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:51,730
And so the next article we looked that was basically an editorial of that JAMA study.

364
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:56,920
It was conducted by Kevin Volpe, who is a physician and also health professor at the University of Penn.

365
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:01,959
And one of the conclusions that he basically was able to draw from the study results was

366
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:07,150
that the price transparency tool is not a panacea or solution for high health care costs.

367
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:12,579
He specifically wanted to look into if there were kind of potential explanations that you could draw

368
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:17,920
from economic theories to basically explain why you don't see this reduction in overall spending,

369
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:23,410
why you actually see an increase in spending, and why so few providers actually utilized the tool when they had access to it.

370
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:29,440
Before I can get into what he identified as four or five kind of major explanations,

371
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,829
I was I mean, we've learned a lot kind of about economic theories in the past.

372
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:37,030
We've also learned how our economic theories differ from traditional economic theories.

373
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:42,849
And so I want to ask you guys, if you guys can think I know Brian kind of touched on some of this a little bit earlier,

374
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:49,420
but if there's is there any other kind of explanations that you guys think makes sense for why we see these results,

375
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:56,810
specifically an individual decision to. I don't know if there's a theory behind it.

376
00:42:56,850 --> 00:43:03,990
I just think it's crippling to think about, like the unknown of what is my bill going to be when I get out of the hospital.

377
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:10,230
I know from personal experience you can end up medically bankrupt. And so being able to spend money smartly.

378
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:16,659
And utilizing all the benefits that you have, I think would increase my spending,

379
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:22,719
which is another reason to have a tool like this, but it's just getting people to use it is the trick,

380
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:26,290
because what we learned yesterday in class was people don't price shop for health

381
00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:30,020
care because it's just so complicated that it's it's paralyzing insurance.

382
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:35,750
Anyone else? I'm thinking.

383
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:42,920
So explanation one that he can kind of talk about was really that we have this lack of information

384
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:48,530
specific to quality that simultaneously presented when we use these price transparency tools.

385
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:52,190
I mean, you can think about why that's potentially an issue of reputation.

386
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:54,950
Our consumer in this instance, you know,

387
00:43:54,950 --> 00:44:01,280
we live in this kind of asymmetric health care environment where the patient doesn't know much about quality and outcomes

388
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:07,160
of different institutions or if you're kind of shopping between potential different alternatives of a care plan,

389
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:14,600
um, now we can also kind of consider that these, these consumers are the consumers on the traditional market and then the traditional market.

390
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:19,880
When you make purchases, we tend to associate higher prices with higher quality.

391
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:23,690
Ah, you think we buy a, we want a better card, we spend more money to get that.

392
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:29,440
And so there's this kind of pre built in conception that they kind of think about when they're,

393
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:35,510
when they're looking at pricing options for health care and which is higher price has equal higher quality.

394
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:44,240
And so you might assume that basically if we don't give this this kind of clear explanation of of different outcomes and different quality metrics,

395
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,860
and we provide the price to in principle,

396
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:52,000
they're actually incentivized potentially to pick a higher priced option in order to get a higher quality care.

397
00:44:53,780 --> 00:45:00,860
Explanation to really looks into the fact that some patients in the study might have already met their deductible.

398
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:05,000
And if you think about that, right, and we've kind of talked about it,

399
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:12,830
we're never really at a at a zero kind of you never you never contributing $0 to your overall spending.

400
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:18,650
But at the same time, patients tend to kind of consider that they've met a zero once they put a deductible.

401
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:27,590
And again, if we can if we consider that patients might assume that higher quality associate with higher with higher prices,

402
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:32,180
then we kind of incentivize by actually utilizing this tool that the patients might.

403
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:38,330
So they're likely to select the more expensive option because to them it's a price of zero basically to get higher quality.

404
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:44,540
Issue number three really looks at that right at the problem that only 10% of the employers who

405
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:49,700
actually had the ability to utilize the price transparency toward their patients actually utilized it.

406
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:54,020
And you can think there's a lot of different kind of explanations.

407
00:45:54,020 --> 00:46:00,800
You could you could try to assume from this some might be kind of on the provider side, very likely the providers not utilize it more.

408
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:07,940
But one of the one of the key assumptions you can make is that potentially patients don't want to utilize price transparency tool.

409
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:14,740
As much as we think that they do intuitively, we would think, oh, every patient, this is great, every patient will utilize it.

410
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:18,229
I want the cheaper option all the time. But that's not always necessarily the case.

411
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:22,100
And health care that typically will operate differently, right?

412
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:25,850
Sometimes because patients have this asymmetric information and they don't

413
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:29,800
necessarily get the kind of quality and outcome metrics associated with the price.

414
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:36,560
A lot of times they just want a clear, singular recommendation from the provider in terms of what is the best kind of care.

415
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:40,579
And you kind of see this work in reverse as well.

416
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:46,010
Sometimes even if a patient utilizes the price transparency tool for their provider's recommending the more expensive option,

417
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:51,410
sometimes it's going to be difficult for that patient to actually consider going with the cheaper plans.

418
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:53,690
And then lastly,

419
00:46:53,810 --> 00:47:00,000
he really kind of touched on the fact that price transparency tools aren't standardized and they vary pretty tremendously and they're not.

420
00:47:00,410 --> 00:47:06,559
I mean, if you think about who sets up these kind of these tools, they have the power to frame things.

421
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:11,000
They have the power to put a reference price. They can kind of guide decision making for that patient.

422
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:16,940
They're kind of shopping for a different hospital or if they're shopping for different platforms.

423
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:20,870
But you can kind of think about it in terms of, you know,

424
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:28,580
if it's not easy for a patient to utilize the tool and actually kind of differentiate between prices and the tool is great,

425
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:33,770
useless for decision making, then I'm going to kind of talk about some potential solutions.

426
00:47:34,970 --> 00:47:40,850
Yeah, I think we can just jump into the solutions here unless it's from outside. So we came up with a few ideas.

427
00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:45,709
The main idea is to get consumers to lower the demand or to press their demand to lower the price.

428
00:47:45,710 --> 00:47:51,980
For these options. Number one is to stop relying on insurance, and that isn't really feasible, at least in the short run here in America.

429
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:56,270
Another option is reference pricing, which has had some success.

430
00:47:56,270 --> 00:48:01,130
Basically, insurance covers the lowest price option. And then if you want something that costs more, you have to cover the rest.

431
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:07,910
A lot of consumers need that higher price item and they're kind of out of luck because they have to cover the rest of that price.

432
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:14,899
Another option was what we talked about was more expensive penalties and stricter enforcement make it more expensive for these

433
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:23,060
hospitals not to post their prices because right now they're intellectual property are these negotiated contract rates.

434
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:28,940
And if they're saying that it doesn't cost them enough money or they actually want to post these, then they're not going to do it.

435
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:33,319
And then lastly, we thought it was bonus program incentivizing this price shopping.

436
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:39,530
So to say that you get some sort of money back if you save, which is similar to a managed care plan for insurance companies,

437
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:44,390
if they can manage a patient's care under what it would typically cost, they get a portion of the savings.

438
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:57,170
So it. Any questions?

439
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:11,270
An interesting point was that quality price transparency might make things worse if it's not a company with quality transparency.

440
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:17,300
So many transparency and both and fixing one but not the other might actually make things worse than fixing neither.

441
00:49:17,490 --> 00:49:27,740
Yeah. Yeah. Well, they collect quality metrics now, like value based stuff from CMS, but also Google News seems like it should be an integrated tool.

442
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:32,120
There should be an integrated that's it comes from a third party and not associated with a plan.

443
00:49:32,270 --> 00:49:35,929
I think that's great. So you got the price you got the price tool, a search on that.

444
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:42,950
But then you'd have to also go to the Medicare compare website. You need a tool that integrates the three things give you like a yeah.

445
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:47,810
And you're expecting that the quality measures that you're running up against are actually what you experience,

446
00:49:47,930 --> 00:49:52,309
which is, I mean, with Google reviews, it's just not true, you know?

447
00:49:52,310 --> 00:50:14,700
I mean, yeah, it's very yeah, you're right to keep everybody welcome.

448
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:21,890
So we're gonna be talking about the shop ability of health care. So table of contents for today.

449
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:26,330
So I'm going to go to the introduction of chapter three of healthcare and a little bit about our ah,

450
00:50:26,330 --> 00:50:29,930
one main article that we had to, to dissect and go through.

451
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:34,220
So Chris is going to go through a little bit of methods of the article and the findings.

452
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:39,680
Some key ideas are going to be wrapped up by Shreya and then Madeleine is going to tie us all together

453
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:44,840
from some of the economics that we learned about this semester and what it had to do with the article.

454
00:50:46,370 --> 00:50:50,420
So aren't consumers able to effectively shop for health care?

455
00:50:51,110 --> 00:50:55,549
And we just that group right before us, we just talked about that as well.

456
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:57,590
We're going to we're going to hear a lot of the same stuff with that.

457
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:08,600
So so far we've learned this semester life utility maximizing consumers are able to effectively shop for goods and services.

458
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:13,280
Right. But that hasn't always been the case for consumers with health care services.

459
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:22,680
So our presentation today is going to focus on and consumers effectively shop for health care services and what are so

460
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:28,940
what are some of the risks and and issues with shopping for health care services that make it difficult for patients?

461
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:39,230
So shop ability of health care is defined as the willingness of a consumer to effectively shop

462
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:47,959
for health care services and what risks and issues they bump into to figure out those issues.

463
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:51,410
So before we get into a specific time in the article,

464
00:51:51,410 --> 00:51:56,389
I want to ask you guys some of the key factors you think about when shopping

465
00:51:56,390 --> 00:52:00,590
for health care services so you can take your phone out and scan a QR code.

466
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:13,730
So some of these key factors in shopping for health care services, what what comes to mind for you when you're when you're shopping around?

467
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:20,300
Just one or two words.

468
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:33,350
You just have to say one word.

469
00:52:34,670 --> 00:52:38,570
It's just nothing. US like. Yeah. Just let me press this hard over and over again.

470
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:42,560
Okay. Okay. Well, all right. We'll skip one.

471
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:46,460
Yeah, well, we'll skip the word. Hoping that that'd be cool.

472
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:50,660
That's an excerpt. All right.

473
00:52:51,110 --> 00:52:54,980
So in one or two words, what comes to your mind? What are some key factors when you're shopping for health care?

474
00:52:55,190 --> 00:52:58,240
I guess it's access. Okay. Access. Like.

475
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:02,200
Like you can expand that, like, baby things that are near you.

476
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:08,900
Location, location wise, within. Like, the general price that you're looking towards are things that fit your insurance plan, business things.

477
00:53:09,050 --> 00:53:16,330
Okay. Yeah, absolutely. You want you want some more quotes, right? You don't want to drive an hour way to get an MRI or like a procedure 2 hours away.

478
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:22,320
And you got to figure out transportation and transportation back and anyone else if it's in-network.

479
00:53:22,850 --> 00:53:29,210
Okay. Yeah. I mean, like your insurance plan company has to go see that, right?

480
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:33,020
Okay. You're going to pay less. Right. Quality.

481
00:53:33,050 --> 00:53:36,440
Most people like to at. Absolutely. So we want health care.

482
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:40,890
That's of good quality, right? It's like in Kansas City issue site utilization.

483
00:53:40,910 --> 00:53:44,000
I want to make sure that the health services I need are included.

484
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:47,750
Okay. That's absolutely. Yeah. So great. Great point.

485
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:52,640
So. Right, we we want health care that's safe, effective, convenient.

486
00:53:53,530 --> 00:54:03,470
You can utilize it whenever you want. So why are shoppers having issues, finding health care services and they struggle to shop?

487
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:11,000
So there's there's three three factors that are often cited when when patients have issues shopping for health care services, third party insurance.

488
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:21,930
And now we're getting to that price transparency stuff. So. Costs are often inch in what for patients it's it's insulated.

489
00:54:22,170 --> 00:54:27,240
So you can't often see the actual price of the procedure or the service you're looking for.

490
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:29,250
So patients just don't know.

491
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:37,169
Obviously, there also remains little, little accurate pricing information so consumers can get a comparison from provider to provider.

492
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:40,200
So who is cheaper is more expensive. Do I want to go there?

493
00:54:40,670 --> 00:54:46,770
So that's hard for the patient to identify. It's also hard to measure quality because patients, of course, aren't experts.

494
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:53,430
And if they don't have a health care background, it's hard to sort of know, like, okay, I'm just going to listen to my provider.

495
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:57,629
They told me to go get an MRI. Here's why should I go against that?

496
00:54:57,630 --> 00:55:02,130
There might be a closer one, might be a cheaper one, and then we're going to really dove into that as article.

497
00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:09,239
So thank you. Yes. So moving into the content of our article,

498
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:18,510
we had a research paper that focused on how often patients forgo lower priced care in favor of a more expensive provider.

499
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:26,940
And to test this out, the authors looked at 50,000 insurance claims from a large commercial payer,

500
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:33,390
and specifically they looked at lower limb MRI claims for non-elderly adults,

501
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:41,640
and they targeted MRI's because these services are typically non-emergent, so they can be planned in advance by consumers.

502
00:55:42,510 --> 00:55:47,010
And MRI's are also one of the least differentiated services in terms of quality.

503
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:52,469
So quality doesn't necessarily differ between those scans oftentimes.

504
00:55:52,470 --> 00:55:55,890
And then MRI's are also relatively expensive.

505
00:55:56,220 --> 00:56:05,610
And when you combine all three of those qualities, the authors determined that MRI should hypothetically be an easy service to shop for.

506
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:10,500
And so to kind of simulate those conditions,

507
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:19,440
the authors made sure that the claims they chose for this study included patients with high out-of-pocket costs exposure,

508
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:23,040
so they use patients with high deductible health plans.

509
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:27,840
And then we also learned about price transparency.

510
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:33,870
So they used a price transparency tool in this study so that patients could check the

511
00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:40,320
prices of MRI scans in their area and they should be able to react to those prices.

512
00:56:42,650 --> 00:56:46,970
So what did they actually find when they analyzed those claims?

513
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:57,320
They found that the influence of the referring physician is much more powerful than the influence of cost exposure.

514
00:56:57,620 --> 00:57:06,320
In fact, they actually found that less than 1% of the study participants actually utilized that price transparency tool,

515
00:57:07,370 --> 00:57:17,510
which is why we see cost exposure only explaining 2% of the variance in pricing across MRI's and we see referrals being the dominant force.

516
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:22,460
51% of the variance of the price of an MRI.

517
00:57:22,970 --> 00:57:28,520
And so because we're not seeing consumers respond to cost,

518
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:39,500
we the authors also found that patients travel past six lower price providers on their way to their treatment location.

519
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:47,600
And so if they would have just chosen the lowest cost provider, they would have reduced their own out-of-pocket costs by 27%.

520
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:53,450
And then on the insurance side, we would see a 40% reduction in spending.

521
00:57:53,690 --> 00:57:57,500
So this tells us a lot about consumer behavior in the health care market.

522
00:57:58,130 --> 00:58:05,930
And one of the concepts we can tie in directly is price elasticity of demand.

523
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:16,010
So our findings on the last slide, although patients had access to a price transparency tool, we don't see them responding to changes in price.

524
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:23,630
And so this would make the demand for MRI scans inelastic.

525
00:58:23,870 --> 00:58:34,310
And so if we were to graph this out, we would have this steep demand slope and any change in price wouldn't really affect demand by a large amount.

526
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:48,740
And so as we've been discussing today, this could have to do with the influence of insurance and having an impact on people's willingness to shop.

527
00:58:49,100 --> 00:59:01,129
And so even though consumers had a price transparency tool and had high cost exposure for more complex services,

528
00:59:01,130 --> 00:59:07,370
when they have more coverage and less information,

529
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:16,220
the willingness to shop will probably decrease, making our in elasticity even more pronounced with complex health care services.

530
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:20,570
I'll pass it to Surya to continue with our findings.

531
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:28,910
So to continue on with the findings, we see that physicians typically refer their patients to about three MRI providers,

532
00:59:28,910 --> 00:59:35,540
which is about 80% of their referrals. And so since patients are given several different options,

533
00:59:35,790 --> 00:59:43,010
they are most likely to weigh in the most on these referrals rather than shop for their health care.

534
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:50,570
Along with that, we see that there is a correlation between where a physician works and where they send their referrals.

535
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:55,549
So in this case, if a physician works at a hospital based system,

536
00:59:55,550 --> 01:00:06,440
there are 27% more likely to send that patient to a place that by MRI, which is within a hospital based system as well.

537
01:00:06,650 --> 01:00:14,120
And so this doesn't always take into account price, quality, distance and things like that.

538
01:00:14,130 --> 01:00:20,750
It's more so the connections that physicians have and which is why they're referring to specific places rather than others.

539
01:00:22,190 --> 01:00:27,110
And so in a typical market, MRI can be considered as perfect substitutes,

540
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:34,130
since it doesn't truly matter where you receive the MRI, it's that you're still getting that health care product.

541
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:42,800
And so in this case, a hospital based MRI can be substituted with a non hospital based MRI.

542
01:00:43,130 --> 01:00:54,770
And so on a graph, for example, X is the quantity of hospital based MRI consumed and why is the quantity of non-hospital based MRI as consumed?

543
01:00:54,770 --> 01:01:04,160
And so we can see that the difference curve has the same utility, regardless of which place they go to non-hospital based or hospital based.

544
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:09,650
And so in a typical market, one is not better than the other.

545
01:01:09,650 --> 01:01:11,870
So we see that they can be perfect substitutes.

546
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:21,050
However, in this article, since the physician referrals do have such an emphasis for the patient on where they receive treatment,

547
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:29,450
we see that patients do not consider MRI's as perfect substitutes, since the physician referrals have so much importance for them.

548
01:01:31,010 --> 01:01:33,530
And so the overall. Oh, yes. QUESTION Yeah.

549
01:01:33,590 --> 01:01:41,060
The question is this just for the actual MRI itself or does this include the interpretation of the results of the scan?

550
01:01:42,110 --> 01:01:45,410
It was just for the MRI. Yeah, not yet.

551
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:55,070
And so the overall takeaways was that physician referrals have a huge importance when

552
01:01:55,070 --> 01:02:00,320
patients do look for where they want to get their MRI and not necessarily with the results.

553
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:07,490
But this is also the reason why patients don't shop as much for health care since

554
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:12,470
they're given options and they do take into consideration what the physician says.

555
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:22,640
And so this does not take into account any lower cost options, better quality care places that are closer in distance.

556
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:26,239
And so like the previous group had talked about price transparency.

557
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:31,760
There are a lot of tools out there, but it's not always as useful as we think it is.

558
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:38,870
And so this study really hones in on there are tools and if we are able to provide

559
01:02:38,870 --> 01:02:45,589
patients with the right knowledge and the right access to these resources,

560
01:02:45,590 --> 01:02:51,290
then being able to price shop will be definitely more feasible for them.

561
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:54,559
And so this article was just solely talking about MRI's.

562
01:02:54,560 --> 01:03:05,080
But in the broader sense, since patients don't shop for MRI's and even this type of care in the future, they might not be willing to, you know,

563
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:12,259
look for better options that are possibly in network or cheaper or lower distance away from

564
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:20,899
them for more complex treatments like surgeries or other illnesses that do need really,

565
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:26,120
really expensive treatment. So we have two questions for you guys.

566
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:27,949
Considering the impact of referrals,

567
01:03:27,950 --> 01:03:34,520
what policies might you implement or who needs to work together to increase the shop ability of health care services?

568
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:47,220
Yes. Kind of like what they touched on in the last presentation.

569
01:03:47,850 --> 01:03:52,590
Giving incentives back to patients for choosing a lower cost option.

570
01:03:53,970 --> 01:03:58,380
Yeah. So that's exactly what the article recommended and we kind of pulled that.

571
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:04,950
So we need policymakers and insurers to work together to incentivize the providers to break those referral habits.

572
01:04:05,430 --> 01:04:10,770
So we see that the hospital based providers keep sending their patients to hospital based MRI scans.

573
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:14,790
So we need to incentivize those providers to break those referral habits.

574
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:25,799
And we know that shop ability of health care and the price elasticity or MRI scans are price elastic or they're price inelastic.

575
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:36,420
So to increase the price elasticity, we need those referring patients to be price conscious and stop those referral habits to increase the elasticity.

576
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:43,249
And our last question, thinking back to class on consuming health care services,

577
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:49,130
what economic concepts become different in this market in terms of shopping for health care services?

578
01:04:55,870 --> 01:04:59,710
So we have this chart from class. We look at economic concepts.

579
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:08,620
So when we're shopping for something simple, like simple goods and service, we are normally well informed about the attributes of the products.

580
01:05:08,620 --> 01:05:10,989
So we know how well it's going to work. We know the quality of it.

581
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:18,010
When we're purchasing it, we have a lot more information, but when we are shopping for health care, we are on it.

582
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:21,550
We are uncertain about the quality and price, kind of like Connor talked about.

583
01:05:21,910 --> 01:05:26,440
We don't really know how how the outcome of that MRI is going to go.

584
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:31,630
So we basically just based our decision on.

585
01:05:33,260 --> 01:05:39,770
Referrals from the provider. And then when you're buying goods and service, you're normally spending your own money.

586
01:05:39,770 --> 01:05:44,929
But because in health care, you're insured, most of the time there's a price barrier.

587
01:05:44,930 --> 01:05:49,300
So we don't see our own money going out of our pockets.

588
01:05:55,110 --> 01:06:03,050
Did the study consider cuts like continuity of care when they were talking about cost of MRI's?

589
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:10,620
Because I was kind of thinking of what Craig was saying to like referring providers when they when they refer individuals for MRI's,

590
01:06:10,620 --> 01:06:17,820
they're thinking about like saving the cost of the patient, having to come back into the clinic to review the MRI results.

591
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:23,550
So if it's done within the health care system, they can get like a portal message or something like that instead.

592
01:06:24,030 --> 01:06:27,480
So I'm wondering if that's a way to mitigate that as well.

593
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:34,950
I don't actually think the article mentioned. Yeah, that kind of stuff, like why they were keeping it in their own system.

594
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:36,620
But that's a good thing.

595
01:06:36,630 --> 01:06:45,550
So it would be an interesting follow up study to see like actually interview the physicians on the reasons why they were doing that to begin with.

596
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:53,700
Right. Right. Yeah. And that's the tough part about our study is we don't have the reasoning why we just have the claim and what happen.

597
01:06:55,290 --> 01:07:01,680
But I guess I have a question for the group because I feel like we were all kind of shocked a little bit by this study.

598
01:07:01,690 --> 01:07:08,820
So do you guys also agree that, like the referring physician has a huge impact on where you go to health care?

599
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:12,780
Okay. Yeah. And a lot of times those referral patterns are established.

600
01:07:12,810 --> 01:07:20,760
I mean, not specific to MRI's, but they are established with other physicians because they refer patients back and forth or somebody that

601
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:25,530
that provider trust and they don't want to send them without a license you had a tough time with in the past,

602
01:07:25,590 --> 01:07:28,379
or that may create conflicts of interest for them. With the MRI's.

603
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:33,810
It's the same thing too, because the you create a referral pattern with the reading provider at the MRI.

604
01:07:33,850 --> 01:07:37,000
So that's beyond just the cost of the MRI.

605
01:07:37,020 --> 01:07:41,819
If if a patient comes into your clinic and they had a MRI done an outside facility,

606
01:07:41,820 --> 01:07:49,290
but you don't trust the radiologist or still billing the patient again for the radiologist, read from the university that you're at anyway.

607
01:07:49,290 --> 01:07:52,550
So it doesn't really save the patient anything of that evidence. Yeah.

608
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:56,760
Yeah. I was just going to add from a provider perspective.

609
01:07:57,330 --> 01:08:09,479
So at U of M, if I were to refer you for an MRI, I would refer to a U of M MRI location because the if they go to an outside provider,

610
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:12,880
it's really challenging to actually get the results.

611
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:15,600
Like we can't see the images, we can only see the read.

612
01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:25,260
And so like she was mentioning, we have to spend like someone has to spend like 30 to 40 minutes on the phone trying to actually get the records.

613
01:08:25,260 --> 01:08:30,990
And then it has to go to one of our radiologists to read it. And so the patient ends up getting billed for all of that too.

614
01:08:31,650 --> 01:08:38,640
And so there's like a lot of reasons from better is like more practical to refer within the same system.

615
01:08:39,930 --> 01:08:44,640
Because a lot of times, like even in the emergency room, the patient has been seen at an outside hospital.

616
01:08:45,260 --> 01:08:52,440
You just can't see those records without someone like sitting down for an hour to like talk to the outside hospital.

617
01:08:53,190 --> 01:08:57,920
And those are not mentioned in article. So we were going solely based off of this.

618
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:09,839
Those are all good points. To also kind of piggyback to me, there's like this trust but verify kind of mindset and well among physicians.

619
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:14,579
So like at U of M in the emergency department, you're coming from an outside hospital.

620
01:09:14,580 --> 01:09:23,010
Even if you've had all your imaging, you're going to get repeated because she doesn't really trust outside radiologist,

621
01:09:23,010 --> 01:09:24,149
not that they don't think they're good,

622
01:09:24,150 --> 01:09:31,710
but they would rather have someone within the hospital that they know and trust do another interpretation of it.

623
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:38,760
So you really are getting like double or triple charge depending on how many times you've been transferred around like lab work.

624
01:09:38,970 --> 01:09:44,380
Yeah. There used to be see more like problems with those systems than anything.

625
01:09:44,410 --> 01:09:49,139
Yeah. The probability that you get a patient coming into the ED with an MRI scan

626
01:09:49,140 --> 01:09:55,110
that is wrong and it's not about them is really you don't it's not about them.

627
01:09:55,110 --> 01:10:03,450
Even back in India, if one physician has recommended you to go to a certain provider to get an MRI, he's not going to accept any other.

628
01:10:03,810 --> 01:10:07,950
Oh, no, I know it's every ten. I'm just saying that that system seems like I agree.

629
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:11,710
Like that's the issue about the different command.

630
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:16,320
But the matter is right, we don't have that kind of thing.

631
01:10:16,850 --> 01:10:20,580
Yeah. Yeah. So it's definitely a system. Yeah, absolutely.

632
01:10:20,820 --> 01:10:25,799
And I think probably does the best job of that out of any healthcare system to do that.

633
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:34,530
Like for, for example, at U of M, we can see stuff from many hospitals fairly easily takes one phone call, which is as an administrative burden.

634
01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:42,420
But for example, other health care systems, even like Michigan State, which is down the road, we have no access to any of their imaging whatsoever.

635
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:48,660
So even or even IHG, which is literally around the corner, can't see anything from.

636
01:10:48,930 --> 01:10:51,960
So it's definitely an issue everywhere.

637
01:10:52,050 --> 01:10:55,300
Is that a function of. A system they're using like one season, Athena, and somebody else's.

638
01:10:55,550 --> 01:10:59,480
So MSU, for example, uses Athena, you have Amazon Epic.

639
01:11:00,670 --> 01:11:03,909
So like we have Kara everywhere and you can see like other hospitals,

640
01:11:03,910 --> 01:11:09,580
the other hospital and I've been able to access radiographic info and they're like, Oh, that's cute.

641
01:11:09,580 --> 01:11:14,410
We're repeating it here. So it's kind of like pointless in a way.

642
01:11:15,580 --> 01:11:18,129
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know.

643
01:11:18,130 --> 01:11:25,930
Like when I worked, like, university hospitals and clinics, like when a new provided came in administration, like whoever their manager was was like,

644
01:11:25,930 --> 01:11:33,940
you're referring inside of UHC or else like we're going to have a talk kind of so like, yeah,

645
01:11:33,940 --> 01:11:39,220
it kind of like posts like unless it wasn't at UHC what's like most of the time it was.

646
01:11:39,250 --> 01:11:42,710
So I think that kind of pushes providers to do based on administration.

647
01:11:43,060 --> 01:11:47,350
But I think the thing that's missing from this conversation is that ultimately the patient has control over that.

648
01:11:47,350 --> 01:11:53,290
They can say, No, I don't want you to repeat it because it's going to cost me a lot of money, but most people don't feel empowered to do that.

649
01:11:53,670 --> 01:11:58,060
Then like from the provider side that I so like I worked in orthopedic clinic

650
01:11:58,180 --> 01:12:02,650
and a patient would have a CT scan for a surgery done an outside facility,

651
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:07,959
the parameters weren't done right. Your surgery gets canceled like and that's a that's a cost of the patient, too.

652
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:13,600
So and then there's like the asymmetry of information, because if a doctor is telling you you need this study,

653
01:12:13,930 --> 01:12:18,549
right, you're going to trust that you actually need it, even if you've already had it at outside hospital.

654
01:12:18,550 --> 01:12:24,160
And the chance of it being incorrect is very low. Has anybody asked why?

655
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:30,320
When you're told, refer inside the system, somebody asks why like is it profit driven or is it actually error driven profit?

656
01:12:30,350 --> 01:12:34,990
It's only profit margin. I will tell you, it's error driven.

657
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:40,480
Okay. Yeah, that's the whole thing is based on everything providers tell you.

658
01:12:40,630 --> 01:12:44,380
Right. But I wonder the driven like what the argument about it.

659
01:12:44,650 --> 01:12:52,870
I think it has to do with what's the back end administrative burden that is caused if an error is made right,

660
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:58,230
even if it's only one out of every 100 or something like that, like what does that mean?

661
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:04,000
That that vision or that provider schedule, I guess, to economists definitely have a cynical streak.

662
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,270
It would basically say it's profit driven or not proven otherwise. Right.

663
01:13:07,850 --> 01:13:12,670
I'm trying to do something else. Yeah. You said you want to incentivize the referring physician.

664
01:13:12,790 --> 01:13:18,790
I don't know. So you want to incentivize the hospital to start referring outside of its own hospital?

665
01:13:18,790 --> 01:13:28,329
And that's the possible part. It yeah, that was one of the things that our question and I was chatting on the side for a second,

666
01:13:28,330 --> 01:13:36,280
but I think like this discussion calls into question the feasibility of the policy proposal in our actual article.

667
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:45,850
I think these are a lot of great ideas. And so, yeah, trying to incentivize providers to break those habits is going to be very tough.

668
01:13:47,890 --> 01:13:51,850
I think that's not a hospital or business prospect.

669
01:13:52,270 --> 01:13:58,680
They have like like supposedly if we talk about this hospital right here, they have one MRI system.

670
01:13:58,930 --> 01:14:03,700
They have had an office that is making it so they don't want to business people outside.

671
01:14:03,970 --> 01:14:13,780
So there is incentive for the physician from like upper management, like, okay, we get this second segment of the place and send it here or there.

672
01:14:13,990 --> 01:14:20,410
So they try to keep the space and we get this our approach that they can get money and also it is efficient to get all the documents.

673
01:14:20,770 --> 01:14:27,420
So which is why there's low shop ability of how they aren't shopping for you.

674
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:30,660
That is the whole job. So very important. Okay.

675
01:14:30,670 --> 01:14:33,820
Thank you, everybody, for your excellent questions and comments.

676
01:14:39,420 --> 01:14:47,930
Okay. Well, you got 5 minutes back. You know, it's kind of like this.

677
01:14:49,890 --> 01:14:56,980
I used to be patient, but I was like, okay, yeah.

678
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:28,410
Let's talk about those experiences from the 70 seconds and 80 seconds and all the way down to earth where the phrase the last thing.

679
01:15:32,030 --> 01:15:38,250
Yes, that's another thing. I'm not sure how it was useful.

680
01:15:39,710 --> 01:16:16,520
I suppose that's an interesting you know, maybe it's not right that they're going to give you an idea of how much your heart is beating in Atlanta.

681
01:16:18,310 --> 01:16:33,480
You know, I think it's covered in other cases since the beginning of it.

682
01:16:33,490 --> 01:16:50,820
Like, maybe it's like, oh, yes, I like to buy tickets.

683
01:16:57,230 --> 01:17:10,760
I think it was on display this year.

684
01:17:11,770 --> 01:17:17,790
Yeah. I don't know. Thursday. This is I think he's not set.

685
01:17:18,510 --> 01:17:33,900
I don't know. I think if I think about it, I don't think it's as far as I know.

686
01:17:37,030 --> 01:17:41,450
What you want to change the place.

687
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:48,600
I, I think the thing I love about it, it's really changed now.

688
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:59,790
And like I said, I think a lot times everyone is really interested.

689
01:18:00,660 --> 01:18:06,480
All right. It should be fun. We got to talk about value.

690
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:14,820
Yes, yes, yes. I think that's a great point. I know. I think you are becoming a person.

691
01:18:15,210 --> 01:18:24,640
I get a lot of that. So I think those that already figure things out because.

692
01:18:26,490 --> 01:18:32,910
Oh, that's the choice. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

693
01:18:34,110 --> 01:18:49,610
That's. Can't I just get, like, big and complain when you think of not knowing right now that this.

694
01:18:54,620 --> 01:19:03,930
Just. I'm sure I know what I'm saying.

695
01:19:04,590 --> 01:19:08,570
Yes. Then how did you guys get?
