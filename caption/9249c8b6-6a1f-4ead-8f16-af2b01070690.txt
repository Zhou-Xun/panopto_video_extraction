1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:17,100
But stuff they can. So when you look at some of the previous studies and this is of another collection

2
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:23,190
of studies looking at the effect of omega three dosage on cardiovascular events.

3
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:33,690
This is a collection of a number of studies looking at cardiovascular events in the very top myocardial infarction,

4
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:49,020
coronary heart disease events, fatal myocardial infarction and cardio total mortality from cardiovascular disease.

5
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:55,920
So coronary heart disease. And then so with the collection of these studies, there's a benefit.

6
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:08,970
There's a clear benefit of using a higher dose, high dose of omega three fatty acids and to treat people who are at risk of cardiovascular disease.

7
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,440
So what's the dosage? And that's important. Low dose.

8
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:17,070
You don't raise the EPA high enough or high enough.

9
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:26,790
But there's some key differences here that I wanted to point out for you mentioned.

10
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,960
I want to mention that's 1.1 prior study.

11
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:41,720
There was a benefit for one gram per day of the DHEA supplement, but subsequent larger trials couldn't replicate the finding.

12
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:50,790
So you mentioned that most studies recruited a broad cohort of patients with low doses,

13
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:59,550
and then recent trials have studied higher doses, reporting cardiovascular benefit to the particular trials of purified EPA.

14
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:07,770
But there's another thing that you need to be aware of. So this study, what was an important inclusion criteria in this study?

15
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:14,650
Though they were high risk for cardiovascular events. Yeah, but what else?

16
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,710
What else did they have to have to get into this study? Oh.

17
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:31,150
But the detriment lower than their lipids. Yes.

18
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:35,000
Yes. Right. The treatment to lower their lipids.

19
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,570
Well, how do you do that? What drug did they use to do that?

20
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:53,450
Statins. Yeah. So if you're taking a drug to lower your lipids and you add to that omega three fatty acids, is that going to benefit people?

21
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:58,250
And that's kind of an important question that you have to pay attention to in this study.

22
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:06,410
So it's really easy to misinterpret this study and its findings because of that one important detail.

23
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:22,420
So the other thing that was interesting about this paper was this supplement was an omega three about carboxylic acid.

24
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:32,950
What's unique about this particular supplement and it's actually a been patented and it's comes under the name E.P.A. the.

25
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:47,850
Yeah. I want to. Um, the chromosome acid formulation helps to make sure that you don't need a high fat meal variance in the digestive.

26
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:51,440
Right. So I can increase the bioavailability of it?

27
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:59,250
Yes. Yeah. What else? Go ahead.

28
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,770
Maybe I was thinking and doing right.

29
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:09,990
But so what? So would a triglyceride with which would be composed of the same things.

30
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:27,130
So the key difference here was that these were carboxylic acids and they don't require hydrolysis by pancreatic lipids.

31
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,660
So you ingest them and they're rapidly absorbed.

32
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:39,790
And you're right, you don't need a high fat meal to take along with this to help in the absorption.

33
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:51,400
So there's greater bioavailability compared to the omega three fatty acid pastas that you would get in the other forms of this type of supplement.

34
00:04:52,810 --> 00:05:00,160
And drug companies are always looking for ways to improve something right.

35
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:09,100
And patented so they can sell this particular thing and to a through a group of patients.

36
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:17,560
And from the patent, they say, well, we have a benefit and it's going to work better than the standard treatment,

37
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:22,320
hopefully, and we can charge more for that particular supplement.

38
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:23,830
And that's what they've done here.

39
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:33,579
So in the current study, as compared with earlier studies, what was unique about the study population in this paper,

40
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:37,870
and I think you've already mentioned this and I mentioned this,

41
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:44,799
it was the long terms of this study is a long term outcome study to assess statin residual

42
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:53,450
risk with the ANOVA in the high cardiovascular risk patients with hypertriglyceridemia.

43
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:55,210
So this is the strength trial.

44
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:05,170
So we're looking at the effects of the omega three carboxylic acid and clinical outcomes in patients with this high cardiovascular risk.

45
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:12,820
So it was a study design. Go ahead, Abby.

46
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:18,630
It was a randomized double blind three. Right.

47
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:29,060
How many centers? It would be nice to have them.

48
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:37,290
No, that's the intervention. But how many? How many? You said a multicenter trial, how many centers there were?

49
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:41,529
There were 675 hospitals that enrolled patients in this trial.

50
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:50,970
So it's a huge trial, 22 countries. And they had 85, 8500 men and over 4500 women.

51
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:56,850
And they all had that criteria. They had high triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol.

52
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:03,420
They've been treated with statins, and they were at high risk and for adverse events from cardiovascular disease.

53
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:10,440
And the mean age was 62 and a half. And you're right, there are two intervention in this group.

54
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:17,790
There was omega three four grams per day and corn oil was the control.

55
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,350
And they were supposed to take these supplements for up to five years.

56
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:26,610
And then we'll talk about the primary outcome in the finding later on.

57
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,480
So this was the design of this particular study. Okay.

58
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:41,309
They didn't know which supplement they were getting in this particular study, nor did the people that were evaluating them.

59
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:46,680
So they were following them up with three months, six months, one year, and then every year afterward.

60
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:53,730
So there was a pretty thorough follow up in these individuals.

61
00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:00,470
And so what was a primary efficacy endpoint?

62
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:15,940
Yeah. I have a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke or I think vascular.

63
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:24,970
Yeah. So these are some serious events that they're looking for in the primary outcomes.

64
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:31,090
They're looking for the prevention of this this attitude, this added supplement to the standard of care.

65
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:40,480
So when you have people with a particular condition, the physicians hopefully everywhere are following the standard of care, which is what they're on.

66
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:45,130
There's a number of other drugs besides the statins that are mentioned to treat these individuals.

67
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:56,380
So they're adding on this supplement to see if it's going to reduce the incidence of these endpoints, quite serious endpoints.

68
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:03,190
And then they had a bunch of secondary endpoints and they seem repetitive.

69
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:11,919
But there are some key differences here. So the first one, composite cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction,

70
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:18,729
nonfatal stroke, coronary revascularization, hospitalization for unstable antigen and angina.

71
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:23,830
And and I underline the key differences in patients with established cardiovascular disease baseline.

72
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:31,600
The whole cohort in patients with established and patients with established cardiovascular disease,

73
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:38,320
a composite of cardiac death, cardiac, cardiovascular death.

74
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:47,530
And then at the very end for all cause death in the whole cohort and in patients with established cardiovascular disease at baseline.

75
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:56,769
So these are the secondary endpoints that were actually tertiary endpoints that they also mentioned in the paper.

76
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:01,840
But this is a really extensive list of things that they're looking to find in this cohort.

77
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:08,410
Yeah, that's. And point kind of confusing to me is that like what they're measuring?

78
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:18,320
Okay. Yeah. So you're following these people and they come in for their scheduled visits and you pull their medical

79
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:26,990
records and you find that they have been hospitalized for heart attack and non-fatal myocardial infarction.

80
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:34,970
And that's considered an endpoint for the secondary efficacy endpoint in this particular trial.

81
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:47,650
Okay. So here are the outcomes.

82
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:57,069
And what you're looking at here is the incidence of adjusted clinical events in

83
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:02,139
this particular trial and the mace that they have in the trial primary endpoint,

84
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:05,980
the major adverse cardiovascular events. That's what that refers to.

85
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:10,630
And they had a huge number of individuals over 13,000.

86
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:17,770
But they've converted that data into person years all the way over here in this column.

87
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,750
And then they have an incident rate per 100 persons,

88
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:30,310
number of patients with events as a percent of total person years for each of these different groups.

89
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:36,070
Okay. And so you're looking at here adverse events.

90
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:42,520
And there was 785 and seven, 95, 12% to 12.2%.

91
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:45,820
And that's not statistically significant.

92
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:56,890
And when they break this down into components of the composite outcome, they're looking at all of these endpoints cardiovascular death,

93
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:05,740
nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, revascularization and hospitalization for unstable angina.

94
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:10,330
And they find there's no difference. Look over here at the p values.

95
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:29,100
Okay. And then when you're looking at patients with an event, the percentage with a primary base, total population and then the core mace guidelines,

96
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:36,150
if you're looking at this as a relationship between months from randomization and patients with an event,

97
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:45,120
the lines fall right on top of one another for that control, for corn oil and with the omega three carboxylic acid, no difference.

98
00:12:56,310 --> 00:13:03,840
And then they're looking at secondary endpoints to focus on that before we get to the why was the study ended early?

99
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:11,790
And again, you see, if you look all the way over here, you're looking at the P values now.

100
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:19,980
So the only thing that was significant here in terms of these secondary events endpoints was this coronary

101
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:26,400
events in patients with established coronary that occurred or neurovascular disease ordering vascular disease.

102
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:36,510
And the difference was number of patients with events, there's corn oil and then here's omega three fatty acids.

103
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:51,090
Not a whole lot of difference there a little bit in terms of the that the events in patients with established cardiovasc cardiovascular disease.

104
00:13:54,500 --> 00:14:08,719
While Cause of death was close to the P-value .09, but you're looking at 234 versus 202, and it's the opposite you get from terms of all cause.

105
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,070
Deaths are actually lower in the Cornell group than in the omega three fatty acid group.

106
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:24,660
So the trial was permit a premature stop since the probability of a clinical benefit was likely to be very low.

107
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,460
And there was also the evidence of risk,

108
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:41,160
including a higher but small incidence of indistinct investigator reported atrial fibrillation and the omega three carboxylic acid group.

109
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:50,100
And that was one of the tertiary endpoints. So they're looking at heart failure, atrial fibrillation, stent thrombosis.

110
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:59,100
So if you have people with preexisting cardiovascular disease, some of them may have had a stent put in a,

111
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:05,859
uh, a lesion within their arteries in their heart to expand it, to increase it.

112
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:14,370
And it may have closed down through the process of atherosclerosis and then venous thromboembolism or pulmonary embolism.

113
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:16,080
Those these are the tertiary events.

114
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:25,980
And they found that the individuals who were in the can, given that omega three fatty acids actually had higher incidence of atrial fibrillation.

115
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:31,520
So you have the I didn't put the I put it on top.

116
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:36,780
You know, I did fish this is the Omega three and this is the corn oil.

117
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:43,500
So we're looking at 144 versus 86 and that's statistically significant.

118
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:48,630
So why why do you need to worry about atrial fibrillation in this particular group?

119
00:15:48,900 --> 00:16:00,330
What could happen next after atrial fibrillation? They could.

120
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:10,530
But what else could happen? What are you what are people giving blood thinners for to when they people have arterial relation?

121
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:15,090
I think I mentioned this yet, but right now.

122
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:22,080
So if the atria aren't contracting rhythmically, right,

123
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:30,930
the blood has to leave the atria when there's a contraction and an opening of the valve to get into the ventricles.

124
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:41,430
Right. And if the the atria are beating faster than the ventricles, where there's a dysregulation of that cardiac cycle,

125
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:55,590
the blood within the atria move or the the the movement of the blood can lead to blood clot formation.

126
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:05,010
So there's a risk of throwing a clot from the atria that can travel up into the brain and causing the stroke to skim stroke.

127
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:12,360
So people who have documented case of atrial fibrillation, they'll be put on a blood thinner to prevent that from happening.

128
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:21,710
And yeah, there's a potential for that clot to go into the into the ventricle and then into the heart, perhaps.

129
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:28,510
But what would stop it from getting into the vasculature in the heart, Abby,

130
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:35,820
would be it would could get into the lungs and causing an embolism in the lungs, in the small vasculature in the lungs.

131
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:41,070
But it can travel on up to the to the brain, causing a stroke.

132
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:43,830
And that's usually the the biggest concern.

133
00:17:50,000 --> 00:18:02,360
So one of the hypotheses or the premise of this approach was to improve plasma and red blood cell, fatty acid profiles.

134
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:12,290
So did it. Did it do that? We're looking at, in this case, tertiles of fatty acids in the two different groups.

135
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,130
So this table is kind of difficult to read.

136
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:25,520
So if you look at the very top of the table, so these are a primary event rate by tertile percent change in fatty acids from baseline to 12 months.

137
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:30,320
So you're looking at the first, second and third TERTILES And then.

138
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:37,940
And in regard to EPA, plasma, EPA, here's the omega three fatty acid and here's the corn oil.

139
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:49,460
And I underlined in red this change that is occurred in terms of omega three fatty acids within these groups.

140
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:58,610
And you can see now some differences between the two in terms of plasma EPA.

141
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,980
So this is the number or the number of percent shown here.

142
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:13,100
And as you go up in the tertile, you get a higher number within the the EPA group.

143
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:21,680
And then when you look at the same type of relationship, instead of you're looking at the EPA in the in the red blood cells,

144
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:35,030
you see a somewhat of an improvement in the group that's consuming the omega three supplement versus the corn oil modest increase.

145
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:42,800
And then you're looking at plasma DHEA and then red blood cell DHEA, and you see a modest improvement.

146
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:49,550
Not at all as impressive as we would have hoped to see in this particular trial.

147
00:19:55,010 --> 00:20:02,390
And then you're looking at by biochemical measures, they're saying here in this particular table.

148
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:07,970
So what is EPA, DHS supposed to do with two blood lipids?

149
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:12,980
Do you remember me saying from the lecture that I talked about a few weeks ago?

150
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:24,700
What is what is what are these America three fatty acids due to the blood lipids, cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol.

151
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:37,200
But they were supposed to reduce. Yeah. And look at total cholesterol.

152
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:42,710
Look at total cholesterol. And then they they've broken this down to the median.

153
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:46,900
In Q1 to Q3 here.

154
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:52,280
So you're looking at baseline 12 month follow up and then percent change.

155
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:58,810
So total cholesterol in the group. And remember, these people are on statin drugs to lower their cholesterol.

156
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:11,710
So they start out in the omega three group and the core group about the same amount, 160 and then a 12 month follow up.

157
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:17,290
The total cholesterol goes down to 154 and it goes up a little bit.

158
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:28,450
There's no significant change here in terms of what's going on, but this is a significant change going from 160 to 150 for LDL cholesterol.

159
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:37,419
It really doesn't change at all. But it's it's it's enough of a change to be statistically significant.

160
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:46,240
This 1.3%, because of the size of the the number of people in this group, show us a slight increase, actually.

161
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,150
HDL cholesterol goes up a little bit in both cases.

162
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:56,260
But the main difference here is in the triglycerides.

163
00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:08,530
So you go from 239 to 191 in the Omega three group and then from 242 to 35 and in the Cornwall Group.

164
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:15,400
So this much there's a much better improvement in triglycerides in people on the in the Omega three group.

165
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:25,510
So what do you what do you remember the threshold for omega three fatty for triglyceride serum triglycerides?

166
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:31,329
What what is the recommended level to not to exceed in terms of triglycerides?

167
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:35,880
When do we call somebody who has elevated triglycerides?

168
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:39,220
Where's the threshold? You remember anybody.

169
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:50,110
So they it's 150. Yeah. And even being on the statin drugs, which is now lower for cholesterol and the triglycerides, they're still really high.

170
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:55,810
191 And here's 240 I'm sorry.

171
00:22:55,810 --> 00:23:00,370
190 but they go from 244, 191 to 2 42 to 35.

172
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:10,600
All right. And then there are some other measures out in terms of the lipids all showing significant effects except apolipoprotein B,

173
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:17,800
and then they measure high sensitivity CRP, C-reactive protein.

174
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:30,010
And this is a measure of systemic inflammation. And they show in both cases a decline from 2.1 to 1.7 and then to 1.8 here.

175
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:35,380
So there's there's a decrease, but there's really not that much of a difference between the two groups.

176
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:46,180
And then here's some more values in terms of EPA, DHEA in there expressing the data a little bit differently here.

177
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:50,470
RB 60% of total and RBC is fatty acids.

178
00:23:50,470 --> 00:24:04,240
And you can see that you get an increase in plasma and RBC, EPA levels in people and they were making three fatty acids and in people.

179
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,450
So you get a two over a 200% change here.

180
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:16,930
But when you look at the of Omega, the quartile which is going to have mostly the and or omega six fatty acids goes down a little bit.

181
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:29,410
Okay. And then the same type of relationship you see in plasma in this case, we're looking at DHEA and RB CS.

182
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:40,900
It goes up in the Omega three group. This is about a 40% change, about a 24% increase in the red blood cells.

183
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:49,840
And then you see a little bit of a decline in these levels within people who are taking the placebo or the corn oil.

184
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:03,340
So what were the adverse events and were they more common in one particular group?

185
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:09,170
And if so, what were they? Go ahead, Abby.

186
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:16,670
I served for my country for the first offense and the gastrointestinal disorders fourth grader.

187
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,960
And in the corner, I just.

188
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,390
It was either equal or vice. Yeah.

189
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:33,350
So if you look at anything, the number or the percentage that are a bit higher in the omega three carboxylic acid group.

190
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:49,190
GI disorders, diarrhea, nausea, dyspnea, nominal discomfort, number of new onset diabetes, which is not different in each syncope or syncope.

191
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:52,820
More h more any bleeding event not different.

192
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:56,690
And that would that's a that was an important finding any bleeding event.

193
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:07,009
So omega three fatty acids prevent blood clot formation and a lot of the concern

194
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:11,420
with their use as a supplement is that you're going to get more bleeding.

195
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:19,850
And in the case of people who are at a risk of vascular disease, not just cardiovascular but cerebrovascular disease,

196
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:26,089
that you can have a greater risk of a, um, a cerebrovascular hemorrhage, right.

197
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:30,620
Because of blood doesn't clot as well as it could, but there's no difference here.

198
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:38,150
So that was kind of reassuring. So having said that, Elizabeth, have you have you experienced some?

199
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:43,070
Side effects with the dosage that you were consuming.

200
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:47,810
I haven't had enough time to really determine that.

201
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:53,720
Okay. It is interesting to mine specifically to address gastrointestinal issues.

202
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:57,230
Huh. Do you know what dose that you're taking?

203
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:01,400
Just one little pill. I don't know what the actual dosages. Okay.

204
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:05,750
This is a prescription where you're just taking over-the-counter. Just over-the-counter.

205
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:12,650
Okay. All right. So so that's a lot of the over-the-counter preps from, like, one gram or something like that.

206
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:23,330
Yeah, this is a did we see, uh, like a spike in gastrointestinal disorders just because the dosage was so, like, it was four grams like that could be.

207
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:29,600
That is really high. Um, I can't imagine.

208
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:35,449
It's got to be more than one pill. That's enough. That's one of the little pills, you know, for fish oil.

209
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:39,610
It's like one of those liquid caps, which has about a gram in it.

210
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:44,239
You would probably take four of those instead of a giant one because you get half of a heart and so on.

211
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:50,390
A big pill would have four grams in it. Um, and then you had a comet, you know.

212
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:58,770
Yeah. So I, I don't know if I'm confusing this with another type of oil, but I've heard of, like, the aftertaste of fish.

213
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:05,630
Yeah, I don't know if it's with all of the omega three pills or the ones that come specifically from fish.

214
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:10,280
Yeah. Yes, there's that. People burp.

215
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:16,010
Yeah. It's part of the gastrointestinal issues related to consuming these types of supplements.

216
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:20,720
That's something that is considered an adverse event.

217
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:29,690
Yeah, Abby. But, I mean, like, if you're not consuming omega three fatty acids, like, regularly on your diet,

218
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:34,579
like the digestive system isn't prepared for that, like, high of the dose.

219
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:38,610
So like the diarrhea. It makes sense.

220
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:43,830
Could be. It could be. But with that, with the dietary form,

221
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:53,990
if you're getting let's say you were to consume a serving of salmon or two servings of salmon that is mixed in with lots of other things.

222
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,049
Right. That change the how.

223
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:01,950
How much is getting in through your gut?

224
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:05,520
Perhaps it's because it's in a food form.

225
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:19,620
It's easily, more easily emulsified and it's within the food matrix as opposed to a bolus which would come in the form of a liquid cap.

226
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:29,100
So yeah, maybe you get used to it, but it's, it's more dispersed in a food form, in the form of a piece of salmon, for example.

227
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:40,530
So I follow this recommendation in terms of the consuming to fish meals a day and I get it through consuming a canned salmon twice a week.

228
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,960
It sounds gross, but it's actually not bad. You know, it's pretty good.

229
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:52,709
Yeah, I see. Like a balanced fish oil supplement in the store, you know?

230
00:29:52,710 --> 00:30:00,720
Like what? Me? It. I would imagine it has to do with this whether or not there's an emulsifier.

231
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:08,520
So the emulsifier would disperse the lipid into small droplets within a water matrix or an aqueous matrix.

232
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,800
And that might fix the problem. I'm not certain of that, but that sounds like it.

233
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:22,980
That's what the trick is, to disperse it into small droplets instead of having one big lipid droplet.

234
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:29,600
To determine that mine are only 1000 milligrams, but even those are still pretty big.

235
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:33,740
Yes. Speaking. Yeah. Can you imagine taking four of those every day?

236
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:39,130
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

237
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:42,889
So this is the whole thing now.

238
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:44,320
I shaded off the other thing.

239
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:55,090
So based on the results of this study, what was the interpretation regarding the use of omega three supplementation to prevent cardiovascular events?

240
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:12,580
So this is the findings aircraft recommended. I mean, that's kind of why the trial ended.

241
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:16,630
They didn't see a great enough benefit of supplementing.

242
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:22,930
Fatty acids in comparison to. Yeah.

243
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:44,050
So of the 6539 patients in each of the groups, there were 785 events in the Omega three group versus 795 events in the Cornell Group.

244
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:54,420
So it's a 0.2% difference, ten a difference of ten people who didn't experience these events or there were events,

245
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:59,970
fewer events, but not statistically significant. So the end of the trial.

246
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:05,460
So what is that? What is the the conclusion now?

247
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:10,110
What detail is really important that goes along with this recommendation?

248
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:19,100
Yeah. Specifically for patients who are already at a high cardiovascular risk.

249
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:25,120
And what else? And also if they're already being treated with stab wounds.

250
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:28,400
Yeah, they're already being treated with stents, right?

251
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:33,510
So that's an important distinction to make.

252
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:40,920
So in the introduction, they were talk they talked about this a little bit and they were talking about the benefits

253
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:50,760
of fatty fish and EPA supplementation before the introduction of the statin drugs,

254
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:54,900
and that it showed in some trials a clear benefit.

255
00:32:55,410 --> 00:33:01,920
And then it mentioned some other trials where people were on different drugs and it didn't seem to have the same benefit.

256
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:06,630
And there are a lot of caveats there in terms of who you include.

257
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:11,580
Who's that? You know, if you have a people group, large group of people who are at risk,

258
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:19,200
if you control for lots of different things which can affect the these types of results,

259
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:30,120
you have to have a huge number of people that you follow up on for a number of years to even see anything.

260
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:39,540
So out of 13,000 people that they followed up, they're seeing only, you know, a little over 14, 1400 events.

261
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:44,400
So you have to have a huge study population to even see anything.

262
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:50,940
So that's that's an important issue that that should have been addressed or should be addressed by all of these studies.

263
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:59,130
And you're coordinating 700, 675 different study sites.

264
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:07,770
So that's a huge endeavor in terms of getting all of this data and in one place and doing the analysis.

265
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:19,560
So I thought this was a very ambitious but impressive study in order to make these assessments and then come up with these conclusions.

266
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:26,070
And they also mentioned that they were completing the study during COVID.

267
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:34,290
Do you remember some of those and that kind of shut down the trial during that time and that that was an issue as well.

268
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:45,420
So think about that. When you look at these longitudinal studies where there are significant events that can.

269
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:49,710
In this case, it didn't. That can affect the outcome of the studies.

270
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:56,480
Okay. So there's another point that I wanted to bring up about this study to.

271
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:06,800
It has to do with, oh, so what are what are some they mentioned a bunch of confounding factors that they controlled for.

272
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:11,330
What else would you need to control for in this study,

273
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:19,880
specifically in regard to the omega three fatty acid supplementation in terms of seeing a benefit?

274
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:27,200
They showed big changes in EPA, in the lipids and DHEA, in plasma, in both the red blood cells.

275
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:37,500
But what kind of things could could found that effect? It has to do with diet.

276
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:45,900
Yeah. Abby, as you say, from cutting from 22 different countries, you have to account for one of the main diets.

277
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:50,640
Yeah. If one of those countries is very consuming, I'm gonna finish.

278
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:55,200
Then you're not going to see it. Absolutely. Very good. That is really important.

279
00:35:55,860 --> 00:36:04,020
So people who live in countries where the diet includes lots of fish and the type of fish is important, too.

280
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:15,270
So in Japan and parts of Asia, you have high populations that consume lots of seafood.

281
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:24,450
And in Europe you have populations that live in the Mediterranean region and in Scandinavian or Asian who also consume lots of fish.

282
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:30,150
But it's also important to kind of fish. It's the fatty fish that seem to matter.

283
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,970
There's another thing in regard to diet that can confound these results.

284
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:43,230
And remember, if they mentioned this, they did show these huge changes in lipids in the blood of these individuals.

285
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:46,800
But there's another thing in here that that could confound this.

286
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:54,630
What about the sugary drinks or fruit intake?

287
00:36:54,900 --> 00:37:02,010
I don't know. Might be minuscule, but yeah, I don't know if that would have a big effect.

288
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:08,790
But I do know that arachidonic acid intake can confound this.

289
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:18,150
So with the EPA, right, you're taking in these omega three fatty acids and you're displacing arachidonic gas from the tissue phospholipids.

290
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:30,450
Right. But if your diet has lots of arachidonic acid in it, that's going to reduce or negate the effect of the omega three fatty acids.

291
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:39,680
So people who are at high risk for cardiovascular disease are going to reduce things with lots of saturated fat in their diet.

292
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:42,180
Right. And they're taking that drug that reduces that.

293
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:50,700
But they're going to consume if they're if they're meat eaters, they're going to consume more poultry.

294
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:58,830
Right. Poultry is probably the richest source of arachidonic acid or one of the richest sources of arachidonic acid in our diet.

295
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:04,440
So that could negate some of the effects of the omega three fatty acids.

296
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:09,900
Okay. So it would be interesting if there was a way to control for that.

297
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:17,399
I mean, you could do a 24 hour recall or some kind of a dietary assessment to get an

298
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:26,370
idea of potential poultry consumption and potentially arachidonic acid levels.

299
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:38,700
But that's a that's an issue. And the corn oil itself has fatty acids, omega six fatty acids that can be converted to recognized acid.

300
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:45,630
That may change while they're on this trial.

301
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:54,329
So remember that being assessed or measured in some of the previous tables in this paper,

302
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:58,110
and I didn't look at the supplemental data for all of the fatty acids that changed.

303
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:09,230
Okay. There's another really important thing that you need to consider when we talk about these different trials.

304
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:16,750
So here is the main conclusion. And then. So they talk about this in the discussion.

305
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:24,400
All right. And this is really, really important when you read these types of studies and they talk here about the choice of comparator.

306
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:30,040
So the control group. And in the current study, they use corn oil.

307
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:35,890
And so that's important as a as a control arm.

308
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:41,979
If you know. So the comparator group in the current study versus the former studies,

309
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:46,660
what were these differences and how might they have affected the interpretation of the results?

310
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:51,010
So what did they use as a comparator in the and some of the previous studies

311
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:56,200
where they looked at omega three fatty acid versus some kind of a control?

312
00:39:57,790 --> 00:40:05,820
Yeah, some of the other previous studies used in a row or mineral was shown to have actual negative impacts on some of the measured factors.

313
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:13,510
Yeah. Specifically about LDL cholesterol, and that was not observed in the corn oil since that was considered the most neutral comparator.

314
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:17,680
Right. So yeah, that's a really important point.

315
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:24,400
And it makes you think, oh my gosh, you know, we're making all of these judgments based on these comparisons.

316
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:33,700
And the control wasn't actually control. It made things worse and it made the fish oil trial look better than it perhaps really was.

317
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:44,860
So we know that this is one particular trial that they mentioned here, the Icosapent trial, and they compared it with the mineral oil.

318
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:56,130
And it yeah, they had adverse events. It changed levels of apolipoprotein B LDL cholesterol and the highly sensitive CERP levels in the in

319
00:40:56,140 --> 00:41:03,400
the bad direction making these which are contribute to cardiovascular disease a little bit higher.

320
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:11,290
Okay. Just by consuming a little bit of mineral oil. But yeah, so go ahead.

321
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:17,800
So I think another difference would be the type of omega three plus of the.

322
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:21,549
They were saying that it's more bioavailable. Yes. Older trials.

323
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:28,629
Yes. Yes. So that would imply that that's an important distinction to if you're consuming

324
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:34,990
these types of supplements and not with a meal that would promote their absorption,

325
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:42,310
that would be a problem. So they're giving it to these people in this trial with something that's more bioavailable,

326
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:50,710
you know, and they're giving them just the EPA and DHEA in this particular formula.

327
00:41:51,370 --> 00:42:00,849
And that's taken up more rapidly. And we saw big changes in those plasma levels of those lipids and in the earning RV.

328
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:04,150
CS So that's a bit different than what we've seen before as well.

329
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:12,970
So when people consider adding omega three fatty acids to their diet in the form of a supplement,

330
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:20,230
you need to consider the risk of the individual their present condition at baseline,

331
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:27,130
what type of supplement they're taking, how much and what they're taking it with.

332
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:30,249
And then there are preparations. As you mentioned,

333
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:39,940
a lot of that can be surplus or perhaps they're emulsified and they're they don't create the same sensation in your GI tract when you consume them.

334
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:53,540
So there's another thing that wasn't mentioned in this study that I imagine may have big effects downstream.

335
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:59,240
And that has to do with, yeah, there was some cardio, there was some GI distress.

336
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:09,440
But you wonder with all of this information coming out about the microbiome, whether the microbiome is changed.

337
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:13,130
Now, when you're on these types of supplements, how is it change?

338
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:22,250
Right. So that's another important consideration when you're considering going on these types of supplements.

339
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:34,220
So lots of lots of interesting caveats here in regard to the use of these types of supplements in the prevention of cardiovascular disease.

340
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:40,080
Okay. So you like this paper? Yeah, it's an interesting.

341
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:44,730
Yeah. Would you recommend. What is it still. Now we are talking you.

342
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:52,070
I'm talking to the future dieticians in the room. Would you still recommend this as a as a something that might have benefit?

343
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:57,689
No, which I was surprised about.

344
00:43:57,690 --> 00:44:00,690
Like I thought it was great and helpful here.

345
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:07,110
I know that the recommendation for that's why the American Heart Association did

346
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:12,780
not include that is in addition to the recommendation for two fish meals a week.

347
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:17,220
So that this there's there's other studies have produced similar results to this.

348
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:21,930
So that's the foundation for this. And yeah, it was surprising.

349
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:28,330
Okay. So quiz three will drop right after class.

350
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:33,010
It's. It's ready to go. And Abby? Yeah, I heard you.

351
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:39,430
I don't know. I was like, I'm from Cambridge, and I was like, man, you know, it's going to drop.

352
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:42,670
I thought it I had I had the I said open.

353
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:47,350
I should have said it will be due on the 14th. And it's, you know, again, nine questions.

354
00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:50,590
There's one matching questions and the others are multiple choice.

355
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:58,720
And they cover the details that we've discussed in the last time between now and the last time we had a quiz.

356
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:05,570
Right. And again, this is to their open book to three.

357
00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:08,980
Familiarize yourself with some of these concepts. Okay.

358
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:10,450
All right.

359
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:22,000
So next time that we meet on Thursday, there's no pre there's a background reading, but there's no paper where you have to do a lot of reading.

360
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,120
It's vitamin D, vitamin D and immune function.

361
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:34,780
And this is a really interesting and fun thing to study on vitamin D supplementation

362
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:41,540
or usage or how vitamin D deficiency might be related to immune suppression.

363
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:47,989
So we're going to talk about that on Thursday. And that's all I have for class today.

364
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:55,190
Is anybody have any comments and questions before I let you go? All right.

365
00:45:56,180 --> 00:46:05,100
I'll see you all Thursday. Well.
