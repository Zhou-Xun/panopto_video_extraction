1
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:09,050
Okay. So we're going to continue along our set of lines, the cancer risk part,

2
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:17,510
cancer risk and epidemiology modeling with looking at smoking models, smoking being the largest preventable cause of cancer.

3
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:23,120
And that's a really important risk factor. So let's talk a little bit about the history of tobacco.

4
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:28,380
So as you probably know, tobacco is plant.

5
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:37,190
It's in the Nightshade family and it's native to the Americas and has been cultivated by native peoples for centuries long as history has reported,

6
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:50,300
but was not introduced into Europe until about the 1500s and really began becoming a cash crop in the American American colonies and around the 1700s.

7
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:58,850
And tobacco was very popular in many forms, many of which we don't see so much today.

8
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:07,610
But pipe types, back out, cigars, snuff, which is a powdered tobacco that is in healthy the nose cigarets.

9
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:16,370
And of course, these days many more ways that tobacco and nicotine can be imbibed.

10
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:27,890
Smoking has been essentially ubiquitous, with 80 to 90% prevalence of tobacco use in the around the early 1900s.

11
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:37,550
In the world, wars in particular propagated smoking both within the armed forces,

12
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:46,070
but also in the places that they were famous for this kind of entrenched smoking, both in the U.S. and globally.

13
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:51,050
And that's continued with like the Korean War and such.

14
00:01:52,910 --> 00:02:02,990
However, we have known for a long time that there have been indications that smoking is not necessarily a super healthy activity.

15
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:08,630
So as early as 1600s, Sir Francis Bacon notes that smoking is addictive.

16
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:19,190
It's hard to stop. Since you started in a non-Western context, some U.S. Chinese scholars suggested that smoking will,

17
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:23,150
depending on the translation, blacken or scorch the lungs.

18
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:34,370
I'm not sure if this is actually based in like light medical or in from like actually opening the people's lungs.

19
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,560
Or if it's just from the sense of the smoke,

20
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:52,790
I think really some of the largest we began entering the sort of medical ideas around the 1760s with John Hill suggesting that far from snuff,

21
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:58,400
which is, you know, powdered tobacco, I mentioned in encourage nasal cancers, that people are turning up their nose.

22
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:10,280
It's causing cancer of the nasal passageways. Somebody in Maine, around 800 A.D. 19, correlation between pipe smoke and lip cancer.

23
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:18,410
Of course, at this time, there's not a lot of kind of formal epidemiology and a lot of it's kind of anecdotal based on medical case reports,

24
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:25,880
about 1830s, tens of thousands of people die of disease of the lungs from tobacco smoke.

25
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,390
But, of course, this hasn't was kind of largely dismissed.

26
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:40,100
And even beyond this point in time, smoking is becoming ubiquitous and essentially nothing was happening.

27
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:49,009
So by the early 1940s, even just kind of mentioning this in public or probably even medical communities suggesting

28
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:54,800
a link between tobacco cancer is like saying there's an association between sitting cancer.

29
00:03:55,010 --> 00:04:01,340
It's kind of like laughable, but it's really hard to measure the associations.

30
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,870
Even smoking is ubiquitous.

31
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:17,540
So those of you who are in epidemiology know that it's can be challenging when risk factors are either like almost nonexistent or almost ubiquitous.

32
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:26,130
There's also a long amount of time between the risk factor and causing cancer, and it doesn't happen rapidly.

33
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:33,290
And there was really little institutional support or funding. And that's the sort of thing that we see now with firearm violence.

34
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:41,150
Very little research around that. Just because it has been kind of taboo from a funding perspective, it's beginning to change.

35
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:47,390
But even today we can see that the influence of the lack of institutional support.

36
00:04:50,130 --> 00:05:03,420
But this kind of change starting in the 1950s with a number of really landmark studies with Dole and Health published in the British Medical Journal,

37
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:16,350
the case control study of almost 1300 men in London and other UK cities and just found this like huge association between smoking and lung cancer.

38
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:26,520
So much so that the principal investigator quit smoking himself and this study was replicated in the U.S. basically.

39
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:33,750
At the same time we had, for whatever reason, we really focus on Darwin Hill as being the original readers,

40
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,050
even though underground we're doing pretty much the same thing at the same time.

41
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:47,040
But it pays to be first, I guess, followed up with the British doctor study again until a couple of years later.

42
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:53,370
And they were really expecting to find that the case control studies weren't right,

43
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:59,070
that they were, you know, too small, that that they're just effects of other correlation.

44
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:07,050
And this is really only possible because of centralized health databases.

45
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:14,430
So we talk about a lot of medical records and that, you know, the big data around medical records and it is super useful.

46
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,490
We began to see that here in this study.

47
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:25,260
So they sent questionnaires to almost 60,000 doctors and got responses from about 40,000, which is a really huge response.

48
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:36,180
And then because there was also a national death database, it was easy to follow up to see who died, who died and cancer.

49
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:47,010
And this was the point where with this perspective design, people said, okay, we actually have to kind of start with this.

50
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:52,139
Guess what was on the questionnaire to the doctors? What were they asking about?

51
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:58,740
I mean, in addition to sort of basic the like demographics, like smoking use and history,

52
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:03,630
on the top of my head, I don't have a very specific thing today.

53
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:07,470
What was that like of their patients? Know of themselves.

54
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:14,040
Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah. I'm sorry. This is this is asking the doctors themselves their own use.

55
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:19,770
Yeah. And a follow up to this.

56
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:27,300
Um, there's a modern day UK doctors and nurses study that actually has been helping.

57
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:34,650
We're going into this later in the semester, helping us to really understand some of the more biological parameters around the tumor,

58
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,940
but the dose response between smoking and cancer.

59
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:43,049
So the reason that A, doctors really doesn't have anything to do with lung cancer,

60
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:49,340
it's just a convenient population and a community population who is more likely to respond to.

61
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,830
In the US context,

62
00:07:54,820 --> 00:08:09,280
really the landmark is the Surgeon General's report in the 1960s and they reviewed 7000 articles under 50 consultants and this really put,

63
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:18,430
you know, this was kind of a stamp of smoking causes cancer from the perspective of the health community.

64
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:24,640
And and so moving forward, it's not a matter of whether smoking causes cancer, but what to do about it.

65
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:28,090
How do you control it and what do you do about prevention?

66
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:36,570
And, of course, this is still maybe not smoking is not as ubiquitous as it is a little bit earlier in the century, but it's still extremely high.

67
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:48,200
Here's a picture of a bunch of men in a room deciding what to do about health before that changes.

68
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:53,030
And since we know why.

69
00:08:54,830 --> 00:09:03,410
So as I sort of opened this talk with Juan is that we know that tobacco really is the largest preventable cause of cancer.

70
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:11,450
And it's not just of lung cancer, although cancer is the largest sort of fraction of cancers caused by tobacco.

71
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:16,580
But there really affects sort of system wide.

72
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:24,530
Some of the ones that really pop up include bladder cancer, although off the top of my head,

73
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:29,630
I don't know what that is, but I assume it's metabolites of smoking sitting in the bladder.

74
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:36,890
But of course, also things like nose and throat cancer due to exposure in the smoke.

75
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,650
But a lot of the rest of it, that's not a cancer biologist.

76
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:48,620
I should hazard too much, but I assume that inflammation and sort of the products of smoking.

77
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:55,420
Okay. So I'm not going to like read through this list too directly,

78
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:06,100
but it's been kind of a long and fairly tortured path towards tobacco control in the U.S. We're kind of like every inch of control,

79
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:15,940
sort of like the hard fought dragging policymakers kicking and screaming and sort of being fought by the industry at all times,

80
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:24,280
because, of course, the tobacco industry is extremely lucrative and that's, well, well-funded for lobbying efforts.

81
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:29,170
A couple of important ones.

82
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:35,250
So the health warnings is important. The ban on certain advertising is extremely important.

83
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:39,970
We're starting to see more laws against public use.

84
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:46,240
The 2009 Tobacco Control Act is another huge step,

85
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:54,190
and which this gave the Food and Drug Administration authority to regulate cigarets and has

86
00:10:54,190 --> 00:11:03,110
really kind of issued in the most recent era of tobacco control and sort of more recently,

87
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:10,870
action on menthol cigarets. Although the tips that recommendation was over a decade ago and that too to

88
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:19,540
ban menthol cigarets and because it's the cooling sensation of menthol masks,

89
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:24,940
the harshness of tobacco smoke, making it easier to initiate, particularly for young people.

90
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:32,920
There's also a large racial disparity because black Americans tend to use menthol cigarets at much higher rates.

91
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:42,970
More recently, we're also seeing a movement towards things like tobacco 21 and low nicotine and cigarets.

92
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:55,910
Okay. Couple of. So how has this how is cigaret consumption evolved over the years?

93
00:11:56,210 --> 00:12:03,200
Again, not going to look too much here, but you can see that the surgeon general's report is really happening just around the peak.

94
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:08,510
Let's see what other things we want to point out here.

95
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:19,010
The master settlement agreement is a large legal case of the government against tobacco companies.

96
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:23,540
I mean, here we have the Tobacco Control Act that I mentioned.

97
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:34,190
And so we're really on the downslope. But as you get closer and closer to elimination, each additional edge becomes much harder.

98
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:46,940
Once, once saying that I think that I remember about the smallpox elimination is that the last inch is as hard as the first mile.

99
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:53,440
Um. Let's see. So that was the U.S.? Global.

100
00:12:54,250 --> 00:13:01,090
Globally. Haven't seen quite as much of a peak, particularly driven by low and middle income countries.

101
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:08,080
Um, its data is a little bit out of date, but just beginning to see a potential, um, peak there.

102
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:15,460
Um, and global lung cancer deaths are really just continuing to increase exponentially.

103
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:27,910
And so even if, you know, we can say, oh, tobacco, it's a known issue, we've largely solved it in the U.S. There's not that many smokers.

104
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:37,870
Well, it's certainly still an issue, um, from a global perspective and in the U.S., because there are still hundreds of thousands of smokers.

105
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:46,330
So this is a causal model. Um, how has modeling impacted how we think about smoking?

106
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:53,140
So what, like I mentioned, and we'll all look at this a little bit more later in the semester,

107
00:13:53,470 --> 00:14:00,490
but we've models have been able to characterize the dose response relationship between smoking and lung cancer risk.

108
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:04,089
And so the question is, can you smoke? But what matters?

109
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:10,090
Is it just that you're smoking at all? Is it that you smoke like really intensely?

110
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,870
Is it that you've been smoking for ten years, 20 years?

111
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:25,030
It's this question of increase of risk as a function of both duration and dose intensity sort of came up with this concept of pack years.

112
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:30,520
So a pack here is smoking a pack a day for a year.

113
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:36,540
And that's a pretty typical metric.

114
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:41,500
Um, and so when we're talking about people who are getting lung cancer screening,

115
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:48,370
we're often talking about ten, 20, 30 pack years is the cumulative exposure that many people have had.

116
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:55,020
Um. Of course, quitting smoking does reduce your risk.

117
00:14:55,530 --> 00:15:01,650
And so people are always encouraged to quit smoking even later in life.

118
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:08,290
Smokers, people that smoke may say like, oh, well, you know, at this point it doesn't matter.

119
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:11,880
Well, actually, it does, even for people that are that are diagnosed with cancer.

120
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:20,700
Stopping smoking improves outcomes. Yes, but again, similar predictions for secondhand smokers.

121
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:26,550
Jason Eggleston Yeah, absolutely.

122
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:33,330
So I don't know, um, I don't know of any specific model studies on top of my head,

123
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:43,410
but I will say that like there had definitely been studies characterizing risk from second hand and second hand and also like third hand smoke,

124
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:48,840
which is like being in rooms where people have smoked even if it's not have actively.

125
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:55,290
So there is a sense of risk for those, at least from an epidemiological perspective.

126
00:15:55,290 --> 00:16:01,500
I'm less sure from a model perspective. That's a good question. Um, right.

127
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:16,049
And so what's challenging about, um, thinking about risk factors like smoking for cancer is that it's this extremely volatile.

128
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:24,780
Exactly. But, um, people don't have a constant, uh, use like they can.

129
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:30,840
They can they start, they start at some age, maybe they ramp up intensity, they quit briefly.

130
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:33,780
So their risk starts to go down, but they kind of start again.

131
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:41,490
And so this is much more complex than something like being infected with Helicobacter pylori as a risk factor for stomach cancer.

132
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:51,330
Um, because that's either you have it or you don't and you generally people get it when in their infancy and then have it for their entire lives.

133
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:56,310
And so that's a fairly easy to model risk factor, very different for smoking.

134
00:16:57,090 --> 00:17:02,490
Um, so this is from kind of individual level dose response down from the population level,

135
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:09,810
which is a lot of what we're going to focus on in this class is thinking about characterizing prevalence and forecasting problems.

136
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:14,460
So how do you know if your policies are going to make a difference?

137
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:18,000
Well, modeling is one way to help with that.

138
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:23,010
Um, translating smoking trends into morbidity mortality projections.

139
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:29,610
This is important because of course there's a big lag between exposure and outcomes for cancer.

140
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:36,270
Um, and like I said, it says the impact of enacted policies and the potential impact of proposed strategies.

141
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:40,470
And so we might say there's a proposal to ban menthol.

142
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:52,830
What is that going to do in terms of reducing smoking and increasing or reducing like years lost and having those sorts of projections help?

143
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:59,460
Regulators say this is what we think is going to happen and go to Congress and say, make it happen.

144
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:08,400
Okay. So there are a lot of smoking models, mostly just want you to have these here in case you ever want to come back.

145
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:17,430
And look, we're going to be talking about Mendez and Warner. Mostly, there's a set of Senate smoke models, which has been David Levy in Georgetown.

146
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:25,680
Um, sort of developed those in the late 1990s, originally for the U.S., but they've been applied to many, many countries.

147
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:31,980
So there's a whole suite of sin smoke models. Um, and now there's this sin smoke model with vaping as well.

148
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:38,670
Um, New Zealand, um, tobacco policy model is notable, lots of others.

149
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:44,070
But those of us in public health have to be a little bit careful because the

150
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:52,170
tobacco industry is starting to publish their own papers and it's you don't want

151
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:57,840
to just sort of take those at face value in terms of either have the assumptions

152
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:04,290
or and or that the parameters that they're using are often being used in.

153
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:13,010
Like nefarious way is essentially. So let's talk about as an Warner.

154
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:15,260
So this was developed in City, Michigan.

155
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:23,330
David Mendez is currently a faculty member in the school public health and Ken Werner is retired but still around.

156
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:31,070
This was a dynamic model intended to forecast smoking prevalence among U.S. adults,

157
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:40,010
really by tracking the inflow and outflow of smokers through initiation, cessation and death.

158
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:47,420
As we'll see, it's actually a fairly simple model from in terms of the processes that it's using.

159
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:57,320
This is originally from 1998, but using data about since 1965.

160
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:02,570
From the National Health Interview surveys, there have been several iterations of this model since then.

161
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:08,350
But we're going to start with the basic one. Here are some references, just so you have them.

162
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:20,840
Again, the original version, which should also be available on canvas, because we're going to be reproducing it sort of for lab three.

163
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:26,240
A couple of follow ups.

164
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:33,860
So let's start to get into some of the details here, because this is a class which you're actually going to be doing this.

165
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:39,079
This is this model is an annual discrete dynamic model.

166
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:42,560
So it's a multistate transition model with discrete time.

167
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:49,639
So we're going to find the value, meaning the prevalence at the time,

168
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:56,030
step X and plus one depending on prevalence in the current time step and and some parameters.

169
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:04,850
See, that may also depend on time. So those are going to be evolving initiation, cessation and death.

170
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,510
So we're just very simply thinking about it.

171
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:15,110
There's some multiplicative thing that we both like against the current smokers, and they give us the smokers.

172
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:25,700
In the next year, we're going to incorporate death rates that vary by age year and smoking status.

173
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:32,480
And we're going to say that all so initiation occurred before the age of 18.

174
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:36,440
It's not entirely true, but maybe.

175
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:45,330
Again, this is the reason we did this for a lab to have this idea of fitting a model to data.

176
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:49,820
That's what's going to happen here. We're going to fit the prevalence, the peak,

177
00:21:49,860 --> 00:22:00,900
the prevalence as our data and find the parameters that give us the right or best fits of the data and then use that to make predictions.

178
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:05,330
And this combines men and women, you know,

179
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:15,360
maybe not the best assumption for exactness is because prevalence in men is quite a bit higher than women, especially earlier on.

180
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:22,500
It is very loud. Okay.

181
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:26,940
So here is the model diagram. Pretty straightforward.

182
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:32,820
There are three states. So either you're a child or an adult.

183
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:37,320
You're an adult total.

184
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,470
That is the total population. I guess this is maybe not quite the right.

185
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:45,120
Uh, I think this is supposed to be adult non smokers.

186
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:55,680
Um, adult smokers and smokers can die or they can quit smoking and the adults and children can die.

187
00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:07,770
And we account for the prevalence by taking, um, current non smokers and current smokers together and estimating the prevalence specifically.

188
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:12,450
So it's kind of talk through exactly what's going on here.

189
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:18,750
So we need to initialize how many people are in each birth cohort, right?

190
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:26,250
Because those change over time. So the number of people that were born in 1965 is not the same number of people that was born in 1985.

191
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:36,810
And so we're just going to set an initialize our cohort, and then we're going to remove people that die.

192
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:45,150
And so here is our previous number of people.

193
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:51,840
And we're going to multiply that by multiply that by the people that the fraction that have not died.

194
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:57,750
So this is the death fraction, one minus. It is the fraction that stay alive.

195
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:07,950
And that's what I get. Then multiply that by the current life gives me the next life and it gives me how many people are in the cohort at any time.

196
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:18,030
We also are going to track the number of smokers over time. We have to initialize this again.

197
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:24,420
So we're going to set the number of smokers based on the prevalence at age 18.

198
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:27,569
And again, that's going to be data that we're using.

199
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:36,600
So again, a higher prevalence of smoking age ten times the population of age 18 gives us the current smokers straightforward.

200
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:42,480
This is a little bit more complicated, but also still fairly simple.

201
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:47,460
We're going to remove the smokers who have quit or died. The died is similar.

202
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:55,319
So here's the death rate for smokers. Death rate for smokers, probably not the same as the death rate for the general population.

203
00:24:55,320 --> 00:25:00,570
So that might be different, but the smokers can also quit.

204
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:11,940
So here's our term for removing the people that have quit, and then we just multiply that by the previous year's number of smokers.

205
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:23,890
So again, pretty straightforward. I mean, it's divine so it can prevalence as summed up over the cohorts that are alive at that specific year.

206
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:29,410
So these are all the number of smokers and divided of population remaining.

207
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:34,120
So number of smokers evidence as the cohort gives us prevalence.

208
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:40,750
Um, I don't know. R is prevalence and P is I guess population.

209
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:44,530
So that's probably not how I would have progressed it.

210
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:58,270
But that's not me. Um, we also are going to take into account that cessation probabilities likely change over time in response to things like policy.

211
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:08,800
And so the authors pick two different they said that they said cessation.

212
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:12,640
It depends on year. So up to 1980 and after 1980.

213
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:19,840
And it depends by age. So younger people, middle aged people and older people are different probabilities of quitting smoking.

214
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:26,230
And so we have six between these two combinations, six different potential cessation rates.

215
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,390
These are the only parameters in the model. Everything else is data.

216
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:39,830
So what is this data? So data comes from the National Health Interview Survey.

217
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:50,300
That's a government sponsored, nationally representative survey of many things, not just smoking, but doesn't quit smoking.

218
00:26:53,330 --> 00:27:00,890
And we had they took the age specific death rates which were published,

219
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:12,200
and they estimated death rates for current smokers based on this extension and National Health Interview survey,

220
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:22,310
the National Mortality Follow Back study. And so that estimated estimation of age and gender specific death rates for current smokers.

221
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:28,080
And then they just kind of extrapolated from there.

222
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:35,880
And so what this ends up looking like is for every year they've picked out every four here just to make the table easier.

223
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:40,350
They have prevalence of smoking among different age groups.

224
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:46,670
Prevalence is actually estimated by age. But we're just going to show in this people and groups that.

225
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,840
So how did they fit their model to this data?

226
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:58,930
Was 1998 and they did it in Excel, which just like gives me a headache, even thinking about it.

227
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:06,220
We'll make our lives much easier by doing this. And ah. Like I said, they estimated the six cessation rates.

228
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:11,240
But if you're doing estimation, you need a cost function, right?

229
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:14,800
To say how well your models fit. Fitting the data.

230
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:20,920
They did weight in the squares between their model and the observed prevalence,

231
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:25,600
and they weighted by the estimated variance of the prevalence for each agent each year.

232
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:34,090
Um, we're not going to be so fancy. Um, I think, I think we're just doing that regularly.

233
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:40,899
Squares. Um, and so their goal was to find the six decision rates that minimize the weight,

234
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:48,790
at least squares to explain how cessation rates were changing and at both date time and age.

235
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:51,670
And so that's this is them here.

236
00:28:52,900 --> 00:29:04,110
So the two time periods, 1970, 80 and after 1980, where the three age groups were 18 to 30, they actually found a negative cessation rate.

237
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:12,770
What does that mean in the context of the model? They would have a guess.

238
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:24,000
More people are taking up smoking. That's right. So the parameter.

239
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:32,190
This is the cessation parameter. If it's negative, then one minus, it is actually greater than one.

240
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:35,250
So the number of current smokers increase that was.

241
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:46,170
Um, and so this kind of just means that their assumption about initiation all happened before age 18 wasn't exactly true,

242
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:54,570
but they're still able to estimate it. Um, and they did the same for these other rates.

243
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:03,030
And so recall correctly, they were concerned that cessation had slowed down.

244
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:08,190
So slide about that. Um, go back to that in a second.

245
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:14,580
But here, it's just a thing that sometimes studies fail to do, just like show that you fit the data.

246
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,790
Well, this is their fitting.

247
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:30,150
The data are at these points with error bars and their model follows this line with that kind of break after 1980, as the cessation rates changed.

248
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,470
So once we see that they're feeding a reasonably well, we can have a lot more confidence in their projections.

249
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:45,430
And here are their projections. So depending on four different values of.

250
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:55,350
Prevalence at age 18 years sort of moving forward.

251
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:06,910
So depending on how well you reduce youth initiation, um, they are projecting what prevalence will likely be, you know, up to 2050.

252
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:17,380
So if 20% of youth were smoking at age 15, then we'd expect, given sort of cessation trends,

253
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:25,600
the sort of low smoking prevalence of about, uh, well between 12 and 30%, that's all correctly.

254
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:33,880
I think we're somewhere in, this is where sort of true prevalence is around 14, 12 to 14% currently.

255
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:44,410
But if smoking initiation among youth actually increased or I don't actually remember what it was in 1980,

256
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:50,140
um, but we could see a fairly high, um, smoking prevalence.

257
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:54,070
Why do these lines kind of level out?

258
00:31:54,910 --> 00:32:07,090
11 Like out? Because this system is kind of going the steady state, which happens because the, the,

259
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:12,100
they're, they're not changing the inputs around kind of like cohort birth rates anymore.

260
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:15,819
It just becomes this confidence result.

261
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:26,890
And three states in the model unlikely to be sort of like actually true because everything kind of changes as a function of everything else in life.

262
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:37,120
But it's a way to actually even begin to answer the question of where do we expect smoking to be in 50 years?

263
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:47,350
Regarding that? Yes. So does that mean anything after dozen 55 was considered useful information?

264
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,080
Do we just assume that all of the models eventually stabilize?

265
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:57,110
Due to the nature of the input.

266
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:05,870
So under the model assumptions, they're saying that at some point smoking prevalence is not going to is going to stop declining.

267
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:18,950
It's going to reach a steady state due to the assumption that initiation is it reaches a steady state at age 18 so that every cohort,

268
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:26,930
25% of youth are smoking. And that's assuming that there's more interventions or policy staff reports.

269
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:32,930
Exactly. Exactly right. So, again, we don't believe this is what the true future is.

270
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:39,110
This is saying under this set of assumptions of 25% prevalence at age 18,

271
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:47,870
and that this sort of general approach to thinking about a smoking cessation and that there's no change in cessation rates,

272
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:57,050
then this is what you would see. Again, we don't think it's exactly true, but it's the starting point for a conversation.

273
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:05,020
I guess. And then this happened in 1998. So now let's ask, did they do a good job?

274
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:12,190
And I find this table very confusing to read.

275
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:16,090
But this is the actual prevalence.

276
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:21,460
In 2005 and 2010, it was 20% and 19%.

277
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:33,390
And what they had projected with their model calibrated through 1995, 20.9% and 19.9%.

278
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:39,070
So they were within 1% of the actual their projections,

279
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:47,290
within 1% of the actual true smoking prevalence in the U.S. They recalibrated their models in 2005,

280
00:34:47,800 --> 00:35:00,490
which is when the next NHS data came out and their 2005 projections did a little bit better of hitting the actual 2010.

281
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:06,040
So that tells us there were some differences in the smoking cessation rates and that needed to be recalibrated.

282
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:15,240
So we'll just pause. Other questions about the Memphis murder model.

283
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:22,750
I'm sure you'll have questions when you start to work with it. Three But that's fine for now.

284
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:30,310
And so I think it's worth talking about how do you kind of approach these population level models?

285
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:38,890
Um, here we're thinking about smoking prevalence, but if you care about cancer, you care about other sort of topics.

286
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:48,900
There's sort of similar things that you want to think about. So one piece is what is the goal of the model?

287
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:52,600
What are you trying to do with that? Are you trying to forecast?

288
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,350
That's what they were doing here, projecting smoking rates into the future.

289
00:35:56,950 --> 00:36:03,160
That's not all you can do. You can do intervention assessment and you'll be doing that in lab three as well.

290
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:17,710
What's the difference? Is it better to spend our money to have the prevalence age 18 reduce initiation, or is it better to double cessation rate?

291
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:25,740
Let's just say that we know that those cost the same amount. It's probably not an easy thing to know.

292
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:31,140
But we can say which of those will have more of an impact. Counterfactual assessment.

293
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:35,700
What would have happened if you did something differently?

294
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:43,470
What if they had banned menthol in 1980? What if they had actually banned menthol in 2012 and when it was recommended?

295
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:52,980
How would smoking prevalence look different? How would the number of cancers be different and different formulations?

296
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:59,759
And these are the kinds of numbers that policymakers like to see to actually be able to say, Oh,

297
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:07,100
this is what we're going to do this policy, because we're going to save 3000 lives a year because.

298
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:11,600
Okay. So you want you know what you want to do. How do you do it?

299
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:15,650
To start thinking about what states need to be included here?

300
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:19,700
They just really are thinking about never smokers and current smokers.

301
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:33,110
But if you want to think about how are electronic cigarets affecting initiation cessation and it's different for people that are using e-cigarettes,

302
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,740
well, maybe you need to have a current e-cigarette smoker, comedian,

303
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:42,920
have a dual user like we were doing and what to what processes need to be included here.

304
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,780
We had the initiation cessation death.

305
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:58,040
But if you're including model products, when you think about product switching excuse me or other potential processes,

306
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:00,440
none of them are jumping out at me around smoking.

307
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:07,880
But depending on your process of interest, it could be your topic of interest and other processes might be relevant.

308
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:16,990
What covariates do you want to include in order to improve the ability of your model to get at heterogeneity?

309
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:27,200
Here they had different fairly like broad age groups, three three age groups for smoking.

310
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:33,920
I would probably include gender generally speaking, but there if you were looking at menthol,

311
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:44,990
you would probably want to include race and race and ethnicity to kind of hit those targets for better, I guess what is a better way?

312
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:49,110
While trial compared to. Intervention assessment from.

313
00:38:51,990 --> 00:39:02,520
Yeah. So a randomized controlled trial is a study design in which you say,

314
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:09,960
I have a population of participants and I'm going to randomize them to a control or to an intervention,

315
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,970
broadly speaking, in their sort of other studies.

316
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:24,330
And you say what are the outcomes and the control group and what are the outcomes in the intervention group and what's.

317
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:30,350
Let's. Let's let's think about it. The intervention is.

318
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:40,650
We're going to give you an e-cigarette and see if that helps you quit smoking.

319
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:47,730
That's the intervention compared to someone that just gets like health messaging.

320
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:53,049
That might be the control saying, oh, you should quit smoking and then the intervention gets you should quit smoking.

321
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:56,620
And we're getting an e-cigarette and we see what the difference in smoking

322
00:39:56,620 --> 00:40:00,430
cessation is for the group that have e-cigarettes versus the group that did not.

323
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:06,490
And that might tell you something about like the cessation rates that would go into the model.

324
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:17,810
The but that does not tell you that tells you about a very specific population and the outcome of a very specific intervention.

325
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:22,880
Right. It does not tell you what's going to happen at the population level.

326
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:30,110
And so this modeling is in many ways a generalization of the information that you get from studies like

327
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:38,960
randomized controlled trials to say what are the implications of what that study said for the full population?

328
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:47,930
Does that make sense? So if I understand correctly in the randomized controlled trial experiment.

329
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:56,400
Make. Assumptions of how the intervention could impact on a population.

330
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,720
So the randomized controlled trial is not doing that. That's what the modeling is doing.

331
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:09,140
The randomized controlled trial is actually one of the worst study designs for generalization.

332
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:15,990
Yes. So the intervention assessment, I mean, in terms of modeling, we are making a lot of assumptions, too, right?

333
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:25,830
Yes. So how can can you clarify how you make that generalization when there are so many assumptions and even with the target population for study.

334
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:40,280
Right. So what you might do is say, um, you might say, um,

335
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:51,950
the randomized controlled trial told us that dual users of cigarets and e-cigarettes were like 20% more likely to quit cigarets.

336
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:56,750
Okay, but it was a very specific like age group.

337
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:58,820
It was a specific geographic setting.

338
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:11,000
And so what we need to do in order to put it in the model is to say we are making the assumption that there is no geographic difference in the effect.

339
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:26,310
We you might say that there was a gender effect and we're going to use that as in the model, we might say that way.

340
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:35,750
Like there was some indication that the effect was reduced in older adults, but the oldest person in the study was 50.

341
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:40,490
So we're going to have to extrapolate that some way that for people that are 70 or 80.

342
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,140
And so that might be an assumption.

343
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:55,660
But the bottom line is that the randomized controlled trial is not telling you anything about what would the implications at the population level.

344
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:59,150
It's telling you what happened to this specific population.

345
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:07,260
And the modeling is now saying. Given that information, what would happen in the future that health.

346
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:13,470
My question is for modeling. We can also.

347
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:19,700
One conclusion about causality. Okay.

348
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:34,210
So. What I would say is that we're generally making the phrases about getting myself in trouble.

349
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:47,960
When we put like transitions in the model, we're assuming some amount of like mechanism.

350
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:56,660
I am not going to say the mechanism is exactly the same thing as causality,

351
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:08,330
particularly in the sense that like a transition to sort of never user to current user, that's a sort of a mechanistic process, let's say.

352
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:13,400
The question is then like.

353
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:23,530
We don't necessarily need to say that. Like, what's the causal?

354
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:34,810
Initiation is different for men and women. What does it mean to say that gender is causal in that context?

355
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:41,260
I'm not sure that I'm actually well trained and happy enough myself to to really be well conversant in that.

356
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:49,840
But what I would say is that, like from a data perspective, there is a difference in the associations and that association is going into my role.

357
00:44:53,870 --> 00:45:08,180
What I would say is there are physical approaches like using tags and Amazons that kind of try to get at these kind of questions of causality.

358
00:45:10,730 --> 00:45:16,340
That's really a different ballgame than what we're doing here, which is thinking about.

359
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:31,460
Given some assumptions about. About mechanism and about assumptions and associations.

360
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:36,080
What are the implications for that a few years down the road?

361
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:40,910
That's what we're thinking about in this kind of population model. Yeah.

362
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:47,040
So so I think a lot of things that you're bringing up are actually inputs to this type of model.

363
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:52,650
Great questions. Question about the mortgage. So.

364
00:45:53,230 --> 00:46:00,310
So if you if you were put in I could be using those mortgages based on assumptions from my previous study using investments like that.

365
00:46:00,610 --> 00:46:03,760
So the idea is that you can your models can be flawed.

366
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:10,750
If you if you give me a copy of your template like sensitivity analysis is good, you can do.

367
00:46:11,290 --> 00:46:18,940
Yeah, good question. So this there there are no like hard and fast rules is what I would say.

368
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:29,820
Let's let's look here so that this model, the Mendez Werner model, did not separate by gender,

369
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:37,050
but they did a pretty darn good job of estimating overall prevalence because that's what they that's what they were hitting.

370
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:45,480
But their model cannot tell us about differences by gender, for example.

371
00:46:46,590 --> 00:46:57,240
And so they're going to miss if there are important changes like cessation changed in and benign women or vice versa.

372
00:46:57,450 --> 00:47:03,870
That gets missed here. In their estimate. They're fitting of their model to the data and projecting.

373
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:12,870
So it could be that this overall prevalence is right, but their distribution by gender is completely off.

374
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:24,270
And so the question is, if it matters to you that your gender estimates be right, then you want to put gender in the model, right?

375
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:38,500
Generally speaking, I take the approach of keep it simple, stupid, at least to start with, and you make it more complex from there.

376
00:47:39,310 --> 00:47:53,770
So what we're doing in Lab two, we started with just smoking transitions and e-cigarettes transition by gender, and then we added gender plus income.

377
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:58,540
But we could also do gender and income and race, ethnicity and education.

378
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:04,840
And but as soon as you start getting into these really tiny cells, everyone being really specific,

379
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:11,290
it can be more challenging to kind of like hit all of your targets correctly because you start

380
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:18,010
to see a little bit of the breakdown of of your assumptions that matter less than you like,

381
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:26,440
the whole population level. So modeling is both an art and a science and.

382
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:37,510
I always recommend to be kind of judicious in how you think about it.

383
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:41,500
Think about what's involved. Think about what absolutely has to be involved.

384
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:48,310
And think about how much work it takes to get to where you're like from your needs to your wants.

385
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,210
Like if you have a list of like this needs to be in the model, this I want in the model.

386
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:59,860
Do your needs first, then see how much additional work the wants are and what you can get in terms of your goals.

387
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:07,390
So unfortunately, there's not like a really good answer.

388
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:10,240
I think that maybe once we start diving into it,

389
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:21,640
you'll start to get more of a feel for what goes into it and how to make the choices around these questions that you're asking that make sense.

390
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:28,840
Great. These are great questions. So more things that we might think about.

391
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:33,370
This is kind of to this cohort versus like a simulation approach.

392
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:39,550
Do you need to model individuals or can you just model everyone in the population of the same type?

393
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:43,450
Is the same? Do interactions matter?

394
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:50,410
So we know that they do. And in some sense even for smoking, because there are network effects, peer effects.

395
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:55,960
But if I'm looking at a population level, how do you even think about including those?

396
00:49:56,980 --> 00:50:01,960
And so really the scope and the scale of your model may impact some of these things.

397
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:07,030
At the same time, if you were doing an infectious disease model at the population level and you're like,

398
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:10,990
Oh, well, I'm just going to ignore interactions because of the population level.

399
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:15,489
Well, your model is not even going to work because that interaction between susceptible,

400
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:22,540
infectious people is so inherent to the process itself that you can't drop it.

401
00:50:25,850 --> 00:50:30,470
Okay. Time. What kind of time?

402
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:35,420
What time of model you want to use? I mean, sure, what I'm saying there.

403
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:40,670
Type probably a stochastic state transition model.

404
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:46,280
Do you want an ordinary differential equation model to look at time in a continuous way?

405
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:54,680
Then you start thinking about specifying your interventions or your counterfactuals

406
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:59,240
because you need to actually put in numbers into your model to say,

407
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:04,760
okay, well, my net, my, you know, intervention is initiation.

408
00:51:05,090 --> 00:51:13,310
That is, reduce the initiation rate by 6%. This is where sensitivity analysis really comes into play because you often want to just pick one.

409
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:21,980
You're like, how does my how have you how sensitive is this output to my change in initiation rate?

410
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:26,930
Great. You might take a step back and just think about sensitivity of the model outputs

411
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:32,330
in general to your parameters before you even get to the intervention question.

412
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:36,350
But again, you can have an intervention that's an initiation rate,

413
00:51:36,350 --> 00:51:42,620
increasing cessation rate or initiation rate being reduced, decision rate increased.

414
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:48,170
Even if you compare interventions, how do you define which one is best?

415
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:54,110
Right. In their model, you might just say like lowest smoking is best.

416
00:51:55,540 --> 00:52:04,519
Well, but do you want to do it by life, years and life years gain probably depends on age.

417
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:10,550
And so you're probably going to preference reducing smoking among younger folks rather than the older folks.

418
00:52:11,210 --> 00:52:20,780
And so your choice of how you do your measurement is affecting which you think which intervention is more optimal.

419
00:52:22,190 --> 00:52:27,410
We saw that in the screening, too, right. And we saw that lung cancer screening.

420
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:31,010
The more screenings you give, the more cancers are causing by screening.

421
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:34,970
But you're also saving people's lives by catching those cancers earlier.

422
00:52:35,670 --> 00:52:39,500
And so how do you define what's optimal in that context?

423
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:45,440
Sometimes the question of normality is not a question for the modeler, but for the policymaker.

424
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:49,010
And the model there just says, Here is my table of outcomes.

425
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:56,690
You tell me which one you like the best timestamp.

426
00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:01,120
So that's something like you want to do it by year. Time horizon is another question.

427
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:05,150
Are you doing this at 50 years? You're doing out of 300 years.

428
00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:10,800
Do we even care what's happening because our country has burned to a crisp by 300 years?

429
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:15,740
Is that a relevant question? Because we know everything about our mechanism has broken down by that point.

430
00:53:16,070 --> 00:53:23,120
So what's a reasonable time horizon? Often 30, 40, 50 years is what we're thinking.

431
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:31,360
Okay. This again here comes to your kind of question about covariance.

432
00:53:31,630 --> 00:53:40,420
How much complexity do you want to use? If you have more, complexity often means better fits but becomes so much harder to parameterized.

433
00:53:40,990 --> 00:53:49,510
And it can result in kind of overfitting where you're saying, you know,

434
00:53:50,590 --> 00:53:57,520
your parameters are giving you more flexibility and so you're able to hit the prevalence or whatever your outcomes are,

435
00:53:58,180 --> 00:54:03,130
but they're not actually like real. There's not real effects.

436
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:12,100
You're just kind of fitting the noise in some sense, your model parameters, some of them are going to be assumed.

437
00:54:12,610 --> 00:54:18,410
So you're going to say. Like.

438
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:23,030
So, for example, they're saying we're assuming no initiation. Initiation is zero.

439
00:54:24,770 --> 00:54:37,550
But you might say, oh, I'm going to calibrate my parameters to the data which is which is kind of a fancy way of saying fit them for the initial step.

440
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:45,890
And then always what they what data is available either to make your assumptions or to do your calibration.

441
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:59,760
Time here. So let's take a moment here to get to small groups and talk about these questions.

442
00:55:00,090 --> 00:55:05,610
So the first question is what information would you need to develop a model of a different risk factor?

443
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:12,540
We can pick a risk factor that you like or you might say have the alcohol use or HPV infection.

444
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:21,360
How would what would you want to do to think to think about developing that model?

445
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:26,950
What states would you use? What processes go into it?

446
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:34,080
What data is needed to parameterized it? And the same question is the thing about the smoking model.

447
00:55:34,350 --> 00:55:43,950
What do you need to do to incorporate feedback? So let's just take 10 minutes or so to talk about those questions.

448
00:55:45,330 --> 00:55:49,170
Come back to a group and then I'll let you have the rest of the time to continue to work to.

449
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:55,510
Okay. Cause they're recording, and we'll come back to it.

450
00:56:04,258 --> 00:56:10,498
So let's let's start with drawing some diagrams around some other risk vector models.

451
00:56:10,548 --> 00:56:16,468
Want to tell me about a risk factor that they talked about?

452
00:56:21,718 --> 00:56:25,498
Yeah. Okay. So we are talking about the heavy alcohol.

453
00:56:25,828 --> 00:56:31,568
Okay. And so we're thinking about like how you would define like heavy alcohol use.

454
00:56:31,588 --> 00:56:38,768
Okay. And so we were kind of thinking you'd have to scale this to like potentially the people's weight or like, okay,

455
00:56:38,938 --> 00:56:45,898
height or size because like someone smaller may not have the same number of glasses or a number of drinks per week,

456
00:56:45,898 --> 00:56:49,078
but they could still be considered heavy alcohol use for that person.

457
00:56:49,258 --> 00:56:54,238
Like it's different for each person. So that was kind of what you were thinking about.

458
00:56:54,778 --> 00:57:02,928
And then also having it on like a scale of like casual use, moderate use, heavy alcohol use and kind of having those things.

459
00:57:04,698 --> 00:57:20,618
Yes. Well, the other one is casual, yet casually casual snowfall, like you said, moderate, heavy.

460
00:57:27,438 --> 00:57:34,488
Like I wasn't sure if heavy alcohol abuse would be defined as like alcoholism or like just counting number of drinks.

461
00:57:34,488 --> 00:57:38,688
Because I know people do have like they can be officially like alcoholics.

462
00:57:39,408 --> 00:57:44,298
So I wasn't like, like is their only clinical diagnosis.

463
00:57:44,688 --> 00:57:47,838
Yeah. Or like something where it would show up in data.

464
00:57:47,838 --> 00:57:51,258
I'm not really sure, like how that works.

465
00:57:52,258 --> 00:58:02,828
Great questions. Um, yeah. So I, what I, what I love about this is that this is starting to get at the really operationalization.

466
00:58:03,388 --> 00:58:10,078
Uh, let's now follow are there operationalization of, like,

467
00:58:10,078 --> 00:58:18,418
how we do the modeling from information that we have in the data or in the literature from the modeling perspective.

468
00:58:19,138 --> 00:58:23,548
Right. So the question first question is how do we even define these states?

469
00:58:23,818 --> 00:58:28,738
What does it mean to be a casual social light drinker? Is that defined the number of drinks per day?

470
00:58:29,548 --> 00:58:34,888
What does it mean to be a heavy drinker is that there's just CDC guidelines for drinking more than

471
00:58:35,368 --> 00:58:44,208
14 drinks four per week for a man for 45 minutes and seven for women not dependent on weight.

472
00:58:44,228 --> 00:58:45,807
That CDC does not depend on the weight.

473
00:58:45,808 --> 00:58:54,028
But maybe there are other guidelines that are, um, does your data have weight if you want to want it to be about weight,

474
00:58:54,508 --> 00:59:05,458
is there a clinical diagnosis actually coming out of my head? If there's a clinical diagnosis for alcoholism and even if there is, is it commonly.

475
00:59:08,498 --> 00:59:12,278
You know, it's not like you go to the doctor and get diagnosed at all.

476
00:59:13,328 --> 00:59:29,698
You get diagnosed with like cirrhosis. And then can you go straight from nonuse to heavy use or is it only back and forth between things?

477
00:59:30,698 --> 00:59:37,828
Kind of unclear, right? So I would probably let the data try to help decide whether it looks like you've

478
00:59:38,828 --> 00:59:42,158
progressed and regress or whether they're actually kind of like jumps back and forth.

479
00:59:43,328 --> 00:59:47,588
Awesome. That was great. Um, so does why mean HPV?

480
00:59:48,608 --> 00:59:56,828
You know, HPV. So we had, we had already seen that in history, like the the infection associated cancers.

481
00:59:56,858 --> 01:00:02,658
Of course. Yeah. So we had three states that we never infected, apparently infected.

482
01:00:02,678 --> 01:00:11,578
And so cleared infection. Yeah. Okay.

483
01:00:11,938 --> 01:00:18,658
And yes, Miss Marlowe, you couldn't you can't straight you can't jump straight from tender to take the next step.

484
01:00:21,358 --> 01:00:27,208
I think that's. Oh, yeah, that's a good point. You know that. Um, yeah, great.

485
01:00:28,648 --> 01:00:34,078
What, um, and ask about this.

486
01:00:34,828 --> 01:00:40,138
So in some ways the definitions are a little bit clearer, right? Because you either have HPV or you don't.

487
01:00:40,828 --> 01:00:44,438
What are the implications for being weird?

488
01:00:46,008 --> 01:00:54,198
Yeah. So I just like looking at this. I feel like the states don't account for, like, how many infections you had, how many times you went there.

489
01:00:54,648 --> 01:01:00,228
So maybe either defining states that are like first infections, second infections and so on,

490
01:01:00,588 --> 01:01:04,858
or like having something to keep track of each individual in the long.

491
01:01:06,968 --> 01:01:12,228
All right. Yeah. So let's say first current.

492
01:01:16,278 --> 01:01:25,348
The first clear. The second and current second and third.

493
01:01:26,378 --> 01:01:32,198
Okay. But if you have multiple genotypes at one time is got matter to.

494
01:01:33,378 --> 01:01:42,388
Um. How about. I do this, and I.

495
01:01:43,348 --> 01:01:53,848
I like this idea. The question is, do you mean like, what's the risk difference for a second current?

496
01:01:55,978 --> 01:02:04,228
Versus a first time round. Does it matter? Does it matter enough to justify the extra work of modifying it?

497
01:02:05,728 --> 01:02:06,958
That's a good question.

498
01:02:09,478 --> 01:02:24,148
So having done a lot of HPV work myself, I know that the thing I would probably not do this, but what I would do is include a persistent state.

499
01:02:27,078 --> 01:02:31,478
Because the persistence state is the one that leads to cancer.

500
01:02:37,548 --> 01:02:41,628
How do we want to do vaccination in this model?

501
01:02:45,628 --> 01:02:52,988
He probably wouldn't have done this, but there was that moment.

502
01:02:53,388 --> 01:02:59,698
Yeah. Yeah. So the vaccination is in with the four genotypes.

503
01:03:00,718 --> 01:03:06,858
Is it with the nine genotypes? Well, if you get infected with one of these different types, then one of the ones that vaccinated.

504
01:03:08,998 --> 01:03:17,958
So is this now a genotype specific? Or just any any other.

505
01:03:22,488 --> 01:03:26,928
So there are no right answers necessarily here.

506
01:03:27,198 --> 01:03:34,608
The point of this discussion is really just to say to just kind of get started thinking about

507
01:03:34,878 --> 01:03:42,348
what goes into defining these kinds of models and the complications that can quickly arise.

508
01:03:42,648 --> 01:03:45,918
And you can see how you have to start making decisions. Right.

509
01:03:46,428 --> 01:03:50,908
And the decisions are made depend on what your goal is.

510
01:03:50,938 --> 01:03:59,328
So is your goal to for any TV, for example, to say how is vaccination going to impact cancer down the line?

511
01:04:00,228 --> 01:04:05,028
Is it how is this screening going to impact cancer down the line?

512
01:04:07,008 --> 01:04:11,558
There's this sort of vertical transmission from mom to you.

513
01:04:11,868 --> 01:04:22,638
So is do you want to think about. So this is a very kind of like no interaction type of model.

514
01:04:22,998 --> 01:04:34,638
Do we want to think about. Vertical transmission, but not even a vertical transmission, but just like population level transmission.

515
01:04:36,518 --> 01:04:43,298
Okay. If we want to think about transmission, probably like h dependance matters for that.

516
01:04:46,338 --> 01:04:50,238
But forgive my cameraman here. I amazing.

517
01:04:50,418 --> 01:04:59,028
This. Independence and risk profile.

518
01:05:04,368 --> 01:05:13,218
So you care that people are sort of like, uh, low risk sexual, like people that are not having sex.

519
01:05:14,268 --> 01:05:26,838
People that have, uh, um, a single partner or multiple partners or are using or not using different, um, barrier methods for STI prevention.

520
01:05:27,378 --> 01:05:37,558
And so you can start to see how these models quickly become, um, there's a lot of interaction, but a lot of complicated things around.

521
01:05:37,578 --> 01:05:45,288
So, um, this is why I often keep it simple to begin with and kind of build a complexity.

522
01:05:47,778 --> 01:05:52,938
And the other question is, this has been great and that you guys are engaged.

523
01:05:55,578 --> 01:06:01,217
If not, that's all I have for today. I need to make sure I have at least a little bit of time because it's only like 5 minutes

524
01:06:01,218 --> 01:06:08,508
but I will stick around until three aren't the the questions to keep working on lab to.
