1
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,100
I mean, I don't know, you know.

2
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:41,320
No. All right, let's get started.

3
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:47,899
It is noon. Nice to see you all. I missed you last week.

4
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:56,180
I missed the session last week. I heard it was a good one. All right, here we go.

5
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,300
Good, good, good, good. Good.

6
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,380
All right. It's great to see all of you here. I hope you're having a good day.

7
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,320
I missed you last week. I was away at the APJ meeting, which was fun.

8
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,290
Big meeting. It was a cool meeting to go to. Really, really big.

9
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:19,959
So I'm glad you got to hear from Joe and Rachel about governmental public health last week.

10
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:24,670
I hope that was a good one if you haven't. Many of you were probably here, so you probably saw it.

11
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:27,760
But for your friends who aren't here, make sure they tell them to watch the recording.

12
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:32,579
It was a good one. All right. So today we're going to talk about the apex.

13
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:40,510
So it's more about those final assignments. And this is the last class session to focus on getting ready for submitting that apex assignment.

14
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,050
And you've kind of gone through the steps. So this is sort of getting you towards the end of getting ready for submission.

15
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:50,600
And then so this is this is the plan for today.

16
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:59,230
I will just go over what assignments remain for this class to get a satisfactory grade for this class and to basically complete the apex requirement.

17
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:04,420
And then we'll take some time to basically work on the assignment. I mean, if you haven't started it, you can do it.

18
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,869
We can work on it today and we're here to basically help answer questions.

19
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:10,989
While you do it, we want you for those of you who are here right now,

20
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:16,510
we want you to feel ready and prepared and even almost done with it if you're not if you haven't started it already.

21
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:22,360
So that's what we're hoping to do today. And then let's see, are there any questions?

22
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,660
I was hearing just some questions about 516. I've been hearing it.

23
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:29,260
I know you're all going to be working on registering for your classes right now.

24
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:32,530
I will be the lucky instructor teaching public health.

25
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:40,359
516 Your core class is about leadership and interprofessional skills, so I'll be teaching that that one's online.

26
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:45,640
It was going to be in person, but turns out it's online. There's two sections the registrar is sort of in control of.

27
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,770
How many seats are in each section.

28
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,970
So I know that I tend to get a lot of emails asking if you can view one section or the other, but they try to like.

29
00:02:55,090 --> 00:03:02,469
Even out the sections is what happens. So I only have so much power, but then at some point you just have to get in to the section that's open.

30
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:06,160
So it'll be fine though. It's a it'll be a fun class.

31
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,000
I'll look forward to seeing many of you there. Any questions about that or anything?

32
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,160
Okay. All right. So answer anyway.

33
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:18,660
Yeah. Yeah. Good.

34
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:24,010
I know. I hear like degree audits are going on right now, and I know you're all thinking about the poster session,

35
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:27,280
too, so that's a big thing on your mind right now as the poster session.

36
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:31,120
How are you all feeling for that? Dominique says you're all doing great.

37
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:34,300
She says she's the one that stressed about it, but you're all doing really well, she says.

38
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:43,310
It's going to be great. It's always really neat to see what you guys do for the posters.

39
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:48,860
Okay, so today, just first of all, just do a quick review of the assignments, kind of a reminder,

40
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:56,330
and then we'll just get into working on the apex and thinking about how we're mapping competencies and what that means.

41
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:00,590
And you've seen lots of examples already, but I want to just make sure you go step by step with you all.

42
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:07,620
All right. So you're mostly done. You've already done you've done your individual development plan assignment.

43
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:13,799
You've done the Apex Practice product proposal, which is really just to help prepare you, make sure you are on the right track,

44
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:19,590
make sure you had the right competencies and practice partners and that you were feeling ready for the final submission.

45
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,500
So what you have left are two assignments.

46
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:29,610
One we haven't talked a lot about, I'll mentioned it today is the individual development plan progress report pretty straightforward,

47
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:34,830
but it's really just allowing you to have some reflection on the goals you set back at the beginning of the semester.

48
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:42,780
You'll just reflect on those. So I'll go through that in a minute. And then of course the Apex Practice Product submission, which is due on the 16th.

49
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:49,860
So those are the final assignments. And just as a reminder, to get a satisfactory grade for this class is basically completing these assignments.

50
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:56,580
And so you're you're there. And for those of you, if you're missing anything, you have a chance to catch up on them, too.

51
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:01,150
You just got it. We got to get everything done by the end of the semester. Okay.

52
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,459
So that's where you're at. Okay.

53
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:09,960
So just a brief introduction to make sure you know about this and it's on your radar to work on the progress report for your individual,

54
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,640
individual development plan.

55
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:17,189
This is a professional development class, and professional development does mean a lot of different things for different people.

56
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:25,169
But a big part of it really is reflecting on your own progress and getting your own skills into reflecting and trying to move yourself forward,

57
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:32,490
setting goals and things like that. So that's sort of the purpose of this is to help you think about your own approach to professional development.

58
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,110
Take some time for reflection and just let us know what you've learned.

59
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,200
So it's basically just pretty simple. Go back to your old assignment.

60
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:48,840
Copy the the goals that you wrote for the last one. You can just copy and paste them right into a table and then just talk about how how it's going,

61
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:54,899
what were the challenges is okay, honestly, if you didn't get anywhere in them, that's fine.

62
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,900
Just say, you know what? And this is a very common one that I see.

63
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:01,800
I underestimated the time it was going to take me to do all my work for class.

64
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,860
No problem. That is actually very common.

65
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:09,730
And then, you know, what are the next steps while maybe thinking about more realistic goals or understanding, you know,

66
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:18,340
my what I've got going on or just taking time to allow for unexpected challenges or things like that, like that is okay.

67
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:22,410
It's just the point of it is to just go through it and let us know where you're at.

68
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:27,980
I use a table format so that I can like. So when Dominique and I work, we can actually follow what's what.

69
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:36,450
That's why I like those little table formats. And then there's a couple reflection questions that talk about just what you learned and

70
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:40,259
things that you may be proud of that you were able to accomplish and things like that.

71
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,780
So it's nice. Dominique and I will take a look through those.

72
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:47,400
We enjoy reading those because we get to know a little bit more about you through those assignments.

73
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,180
So that was pretty straightforward. Any questions about that one?

74
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,520
Any clarifications? Okay.

75
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:59,320
All right. That one's pretty straightforward. That one is due December 6th. So if you could get that done.

76
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,610
By then, that would be excellent. Okay.

77
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:10,790
Okay. So what you're really probably more interested in is the apex practice product submission.

78
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:15,110
You've been hearing about this all semester and even since last year. So you guys already know this, right?

79
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:20,060
If you could tell your colleagues what is the apex? It's a requirement for all schools of public health.

80
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,270
It's how you're applying your competencies you learned in the classroom,

81
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:28,850
and you're applying that to making tangible products that meet the needs of practice partners.

82
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:31,610
So you have to submit to practice products.

83
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,709
They're created with the practice partner, and they're linked to five unique competencies, of which three are of the foundational competencies.

84
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:43,190
They could all be five foundational, but at least three have to be foundational.

85
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,150
You guys know that? I've told you that so many times. You probably see that in your sleep at this point.

86
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:54,649
Maybe not, but. Okay, so it's due December 16th.

87
00:07:54,650 --> 00:08:01,700
And the assignment, as you know, from the canvas page is basically uploading the practice products to the canvas page as

88
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:06,710
well as another worksheet with my one of my tables in it and some reflective questions.

89
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:13,970
And that's where we can see how you what are the five competencies and how you link them to the product.

90
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:20,550
So here's the blank worksheet. You've seen this before. You're probably starting to work on it.

91
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:24,690
Maybe. Who's the one done? Like, all done. Filled it out.

92
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:31,409
Ready to go? Okay, I see a little hint. Maybe you don't want to tell your colleagues that you're done, but I'm good, so that's good.

93
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:39,090
And if not, I want you to work on it here. Okay. So you'll think if the alignment is a little different than the proposal where we started off with,

94
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:44,940
what was the product, who did you work with and what competencies do you think you'll meet now?

95
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,900
Ideally you've done it. You're like in the ramp up phase, you've done most of the work.

96
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:53,880
So now it's organized so that we can see the five unique competencies.

97
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:59,559
You tell us what the practice partner was. Of our interest.

98
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:03,760
We want to know if it's internship related or not. That's nothing to do with a requirement.

99
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,290
It's more for our own data gathering. And then this is where the meat of it is.

100
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:13,810
What are the activities that links the competency to the practice product?

101
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:21,640
Not go into that in a little bit more detail. This is just descriptions of what you did and how you're showing that when you made this product,

102
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:25,810
it showed that you did this competency because sometimes it can be a few a jump.

103
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:32,950
When I look at a product and I see what your competency you're saying you used the activities helps me see where that is.

104
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:38,169
And then what is the actual product? Okay. And then, of course, the reflection part.

105
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:46,350
So one is just describing a bit about working with the practice partners and you know, how did you find them?

106
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:50,960
And that's one thing we're curious about. What was it like working with them? Would you recommend people work with them?

107
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:53,170
We won't feed this back. This is internal.

108
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:58,180
So we're not going to go back to the partner and say, you know what, the students really don't want to work with you.

109
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:04,089
Again, we're not going to say that as more of our own data gathering or really just highlight who you if it was a great experience,

110
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:08,380
you know, we would maybe use that as something to highlight for students in the future.

111
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:15,970
And the other piece of this here for the practice partners is describing how your work was useful to the practice partner.

112
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:23,320
So what is it that you did that really met a need for them? So understanding their need and how you can share that you helped to meet a need.

113
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:30,420
Or at least try to. You're on their knees. Their knees may have changed. You know, things could have gone off in different directions.

114
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:36,060
But you were attempting to meet a need that was just described by the partner.

115
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:41,550
And then the reflection is what you learned overall process, the challenges,

116
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:47,639
oftentimes people face challenges they were not expecting and kind of what what they learned about themselves during their project,

117
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:52,680
how you faced challenges or what it was like working with different organizations, different people.

118
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,700
So you tend to have a lot of interesting things that you've learned along the way.

119
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:05,770
So that's the worksheet and this is the rubric that we use and it really basically goes through all those requirements.

120
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:10,059
So the two products, at least three are foundational, two additional.

121
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:13,690
So they used five unique ones between the two products.

122
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:20,889
And then that there's some alignment between how you describe what you do between the practice products and the competencies.

123
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:23,170
So like it makes sense, like what you said you did.

124
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:31,840
It all matches up what we're looking for and then some about the reflective pieces and that it was an actual appropriate practice partner,

125
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:37,150
which I think by this point with the proposal, hopefully we've helped you see that that you have that.

126
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:42,729
So our hope is after having done the proposal. You feel good about all this?

127
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:47,110
And it's just figuring out. I think probably filling out the table part is where you might be at.

128
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:52,629
So what I'm talking about, I think you're you're getting what I'm trying to say.

129
00:11:52,630 --> 00:12:02,650
But, you know, so someone if they tell me they're going to turn in their product is a health education curriculum plan for some organization.

130
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:07,870
That's a practice partner. That's a great product. Are you telling me the competency that you used for that,

131
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:15,880
that you applied in making that product was they number 22, apply systems thinking tools to a public health issue?

132
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,490
I need to know, how did that go together?

133
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:25,300
How were how did those things go that may or may not be apparent or you could potentially use all of these competencies in some way.

134
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:32,550
So what is it that you exactly did? So one example, and this is what I mean by linking them and mapping them is.

135
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:37,970
Okay, so describe that. Well, when, when I was building this health education curriculum plan,

136
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:44,690
I use the concept map and talk to different stakeholders to to understand what was needed for their curriculum.

137
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,890
And to me, that's a systems thinking tool.

138
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:55,190
So I can see, okay, you actually use the tool you applied what you learned about systems thinking in this product, in this project.

139
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,540
So just a very simple description of what you actually did.

140
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:10,830
All right. So. Let's look at first, let's look at together, which you probably have already looked at this,

141
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:17,040
but this is the example of a completed assignment and this is just an example.

142
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:23,730
So you could do a better job in this one. You know, you don't have to do it exactly like this, but it's just to help you see what what might work.

143
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:31,409
So you'll see here that there's the five competencies listed just for maybe just to help standardize it.

144
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:38,639
You'll notice that the foundational competencies are just like number three, number four.

145
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:44,520
But then if you happen to use a concentration competency, they tend to be like G five.

146
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:51,390
That helps us know. So we are like looking at the right ones. I kind of know the competencies by number out of my head, but not all of them.

147
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:57,480
So some of them I can recognize. But it's helpful if you tell me like, okay, I'm doing 81 or.

148
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:02,560
What else is there? Oh. Oh, you want like that helps me know.

149
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:08,860
That will help us know if there's a concentration camp and you're using or just the foundational ones.

150
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:14,010
We tend to just put like the number. And then the practice partner internship related.

151
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:21,450
So you'll see that in this one. I think you can figure out here that the practice product was a surveillance system evaluation report.

152
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:27,150
And so through that, there were three of the competencies were mapped to that product.

153
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:35,870
So the number three, number four and number 21. They were all with a local health department that was through an internship.

154
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:41,730
And then here's the here's the part that we're really looking at to have it all makes sense.

155
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:50,360
So how did you perform effectively on an interprofessional team in order to make a surveillance system evaluation report?

156
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:54,140
So what are the things that you actually did in that meeting?

157
00:14:54,170 --> 00:15:01,970
So here the person talks about participating in regular meetings that had different health, professional and other professions on the meeting,

158
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:11,510
looking at evaluation findings, seeking feedback, you know, the techniques they use that you might have learned about working into professionally.

159
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:17,590
So those are examples of activities that you might have done here.

160
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,589
Let's see, let's look at another one. Number 18. So this is for a different one.

161
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:29,020
You see how this one goes to an infographic. So select communication strategies for different audiences and sectors.

162
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,710
That was with the local food bank. It was not through an internship.

163
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:38,920
And how did they how did that infographic work with Competency Number 18,

164
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:44,680
which I think is a common common product and common competency that is selected for your apex products.

165
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:50,110
So this person says, based on a literature review and another team's key informant interviews,

166
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:55,749
I assisted in the creation of an infographic that demonstrated the benefits of a home delivery meal service and then also

167
00:15:55,750 --> 00:16:02,139
describes the person's specific contributions in creating what they actually did that relates to the communication,

168
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:05,170
so creating the text content and editing and updating.

169
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,180
And also talked about a final check for accessibility of the document.

170
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,030
So it's where you describe what you did and specifically what you did.

171
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:17,140
So many of you may have worked on a group project. That's great.

172
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,580
You can just talk about the part that what is it that you did for that for that product?

173
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:27,130
So that's one example. And I'm going to have you all work.

174
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:32,060
I won't put you in those peer groups. You'll just work with whoever you want to. You'll find someone to partner with.

175
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:36,550
But we could try one together if you want. So let's try that.

176
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:44,960
Did I open? I thought I opened it. Ready to go? Oh, yeah.

177
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:48,600
Here's my going. Okay. Do you guys want to try one together? So we do one together.

178
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:57,200
Who has maybe a practice product or whether it's one of yours or just one you can think of what's a practice product we should think about.

179
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:08,980
Who has won. Anybody have one?

180
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:19,200
To go ahead. Okay.

181
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:24,790
Good. All right. I know exactly what she's talking about because I was on that trip with her and we did just get this.

182
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,400
That was well-timed, wasn't it? It was on my to do list to say sorry.

183
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:30,790
I think we need to reach out to. Okay.

184
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:37,870
But she just emailed us with this final report for the Caspir evaluation that we did at the beginning of the semester.

185
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,310
Okay, so what's your practice product? What do you want to call? That was a.

186
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,220
Casper. Report.

187
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:55,260
Okay. All right. So what is the competency that you want to link to that?

188
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,280
And we can. Oh, good.

189
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:07,800
Dominic is bringing the mic to what you said perform effectively number 21, right.

190
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:14,040
Perform effectively on interprofessional teams. Okay.

191
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:20,610
The right one. Yes. Oops.

192
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:34,250
My copy paste in a workbook perform effectively.

193
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:40,570
And interprofessional teams and who is our practice partner for that?

194
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:49,469
I listed OSHA Johnson and then Kentucky public how because that's part was under but yeah I think you

195
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:54,330
can see the CDC as well you could probably say I'm kind of just doing this like quickly up here.

196
00:18:54,330 --> 00:19:05,400
So you could say like CDC, you could say Kentucky local health departments and state health departments and and the contact for us.

197
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:11,020
Was. Oh, say Johnson, right.

198
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:15,280
With Johnson, who was our incident command officer from the CDC.

199
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:22,770
That was not in terms of related. So let's think about an activity.

200
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:28,380
So for that one. So this beautiful Katherine report, which really was like a lot of work,

201
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:35,120
went into that and and I know the parts that the area contributed to, but I also know that a lot of that was also beyond what our team did.

202
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:39,030
It was like a huge, huge effort from this big team and a final report that was given.

203
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:45,810
But I know that many of our students were performing effectively on interprofessional teams.

204
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:49,560
So how did you do that? How would you describe that? What are some activities?

205
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:56,580
And we could help you think about it too. Like if you imagine yourself out on a team where you were working with people.

206
00:19:56,610 --> 00:20:06,980
We had nurses. We had different types of volunteers. We had health department workers, we had law enforcement, we had emergency preparedness people.

207
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:14,460
There's probably other people I'm forgetting right now. We had mental health health professionals that were there with us, too.

208
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:18,990
So what were some of the things that you did to help?

209
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:26,570
I mean, I think one simple thing is maybe just describing the team, the teams that you were working with, that might be one.

210
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:31,650
So first to say like, I won't type it out here because I won't make you all suffer with me typing up here.

211
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,610
That's like, weird, but just talk about who you worked with. So who was your team?

212
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:41,070
And then what else?

213
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:48,350
Maybe you'd say something else about like how you actually what were some just because you were all together doesn't mean you performed effectively.

214
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:53,170
So what were some of the strategies that you might have used to try to perform effectively?

215
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:59,290
Um, one thing I did on my first day is I was with Angie from Birth County and she didn't

216
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:03,879
exactly understand like the sampling procedure that we were supposed to follow.

217
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:10,260
So we had like a pre like before we went out, we had a talk about what exactly we wanted to do and how we were going to do it.

218
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,420
We went through everything again, just by ourselves.

219
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:17,680
Oh, that was it was so chaotic to if you were there, some of the teams, they were like running out.

220
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:22,890
So I love your team. We were all in different teams. I was feeling I was trying to solve this.

221
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:25,240
Where's all the students going out with panic myself?

222
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:33,940
A little bit, but I'm glad to hear that your team was not so chaotic and actually took a minute to basically kind of debrief and set goals together.

223
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:43,880
Seems like. Mm. Um. You know, maybe like answered questions, made sure everybody understood everything.

224
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:49,820
I'm sort of shortening it up here. Probably.

225
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:54,620
You know, I think part of what you're saying is like thinking about jargon and different

226
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:58,940
terminology and making sure people are using a language that everybody can understand.

227
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,470
So I wrote it in shorthand up here, you know, but you can see it.

228
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,940
You don't have to go into very. It doesn't have to be a long essay.

229
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:12,670
It's just a couple of phrases that we can see that connection.

230
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,610
Does that make sense? That pretty straightforward. I think I think you guys get it right.

231
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,300
So that's that's what we're looking for.

232
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:28,930
And you can decide, like, if, you know, it's up to you, but you could like if all three of these competencies came from the same thing.

233
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:33,190
Where's my merge? I'm trying to merge. You can merge these.

234
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:37,820
Can't find it up here right now. More actions.

235
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:47,120
Anyway. You could, like, merge them if they were all the same. You don't have to repeat the same thing, or you could just repeat it.

236
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:54,830
We'll figure it out. But you can see in my example. Like some of them where they repeated, I just merged the rows together.

237
00:22:55,730 --> 00:23:01,530
What questions do you have about this? Okay.

238
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:06,150
So I'd like you to work on this with each other, and I suggest maybe.

239
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:10,350
Maybe pull a worksheet yourself and start start typing in it yourself.

240
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:15,610
But what I'd like you to do is, is get together with one or two people over.

241
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:21,899
It works out. And then first, if you don't, you some of you may know each other well already, but if not,

242
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:27,389
you know, maybe share briefly some background about what what you what your work was.

243
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:30,480
So what are the products like? Where'd they come from? Who did you work with?

244
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:37,409
What are you planning to turn in? And then once you do that, figure out we'll pick a couple of competencies you'd like to talk through together.

245
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:42,060
Maybe you've got the same one you're each going to use for your products and talk about how do you describe that?

246
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:48,090
Take some take turns and pick it. Pick a few of the competencies, describe the activities and then give feedback.

247
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:51,660
Does it make sense? Is there something that you could help describe it more clearly?

248
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:59,810
Maybe something that's obvious, like even the obvious thing you did, if it's like quantitative analysis and you did some data, like just that's okay.

249
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:03,060
Just put it, say exactly what you did and then help each other think through it.

250
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:06,180
So I'd like you to get together and work on that.

251
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:13,169
Dominique and I will be around to answer questions, to look at them with you, to help you see, does this book right?

252
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:18,299
Does this sound right? Well, ah, we can help you brainstorm descriptions.

253
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:21,870
We want to help you. So whatever it is, you're like, there's got to be a way to link them.

254
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:25,440
We want to help you figure out what that is if you haven't figured that out already.

255
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:30,150
All right, so let's work on that for a little bit and we'll come around, get yourselves into some pairs here.

256
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:44,610
We'll help you with that. Yeah, right.

257
00:24:48,330 --> 00:25:02,790
Yeah, I know what that is.

258
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:08,270
That kind of stuff. Yeah.

259
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:13,840
Yeah, it's. It's a little bit.

260
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:53,780
Well. I think we have to have a target for, you know.

261
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:19,330
I know. I don't even want to buy this now.

262
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:32,690
I mean, I don't.

263
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:21,750
You got? Yeah.

264
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:38,489
Oh, that's right. I have one quick tip.

265
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:42,090
I want to give you a good question that came up, but I forgot to say this earlier.

266
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:47,159
So after today, I recommend, like once you get these done, turn them in, once they're ready,

267
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:54,060
you don't need to wait till December 16th tournament tomorrow, today, whenever we'll start reviewing them on a rolling basis.

268
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:58,259
If we see something that doesn't look quite right or is like I don't quite see

269
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:01,740
this or can you explain this activity or there's something that just seems off?

270
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:07,670
We will get back to you. As long as there's time before the end of the semester, we'll say, Hey, why don't you fix this?

271
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:09,900
If we put comments into canvas,

272
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:17,610
please look at those and then respond to them and then you can upload it and fix it and then hopefully it'll all be fine from there.

273
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:21,280
If, you know, we have people sort of getting towards the end of the semester,

274
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:25,800
it's like deadline for grades will end up for the people who don't have it done.

275
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:32,840
It'll be an incomplete grade and then you'll fix it and finish stuff later and it'll be satisfactory with a little AI.

276
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:35,010
Next to it is how it looks on your transcript.

277
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:40,590
But if you get it here and I honestly think you're all going to do especially, you know, you've all been paying attention and working on it,

278
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:44,850
but if there's something that needs to be fixed, we'll let you know and we want you to fix it.

279
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,200
So just yeah, get them in as soon as you can and we'll start doing them on a rolling basis now.

280
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,740
Good question. I.

281
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,920
I got my.

282
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:44,490
And I might have broken.

283
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:10,820
So. That's not.

284
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:31,300
It is. Yeah.

285
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:46,880
Oh, no. I wanted to talk about.

286
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:56,790
Course. There.

287
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:19,300
And. So I just.

288
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:46,430
So it's like right now, what are you doing?

289
00:31:48,990 --> 00:32:02,640
Oh, there you are. You know what I mean?

290
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:18,270
The. I mean.

291
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:31,360
Well, no.

292
00:32:55,070 --> 00:33:17,400
Yeah. My in law.

293
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:35,320
Right. It's not really going to be for.

294
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:48,710
Yeah. That's what I want.

295
00:33:57,570 --> 00:34:10,600
You're going to. He was able to make something.

296
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:33,750
Exactly. I'm looking for.

297
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:49,360
She could. Three things you might not know.

298
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:52,780
You are. That.

299
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:41,330
When they come. Know you're talking.

300
00:35:56,730 --> 00:36:15,440
I suspect. Wasn't all.

301
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:30,060
She didn't know.

302
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:50,630
So I wasn't aware that her husband was in.

303
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:23,920
Possibly. Yes. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

304
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:33,510
Yeah, I know. He's.

305
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:54,580
Yeah. I'm actually looking at.

306
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:20,910
Yeah. So.

307
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:31,500
But I it honestly now there's so much happening that way.

308
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:41,490
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

309
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:52,440
Oh, my God. Yeah.

310
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:18,970
Oh, yeah. Because we're all working on that we want to make.

311
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:44,070
Oh, yeah. It's always.

312
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:02,250
I. Yeah, right.

313
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:13,030
We're. I.

314
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:35,470
Were then. Now you.

315
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:51,550
Like. He has gotten that.

316
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:08,650
So. All.

317
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:30,880
And. I find.

318
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:57,300
Literally. I think that's almost like a huge.

319
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:08,050
Oh, my God. I think a lot of.

320
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:17,480
Oh, yeah. Yes, I heard.

321
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:41,380
Oh, what a great.

322
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:51,840
Perfect for you, please. Yes, actually.

323
00:42:56,540 --> 00:43:03,350
But you still have a great now.

324
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:21,280
You know, I was quite involved to figure out.

325
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:27,580
I don't know.

326
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:43,450
So. I.

327
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:58,190
I. I think.

328
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:18,450
It's not putting everything down.

329
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:28,130
That's. Yeah.

330
00:44:38,900 --> 00:45:02,300
I. I.

331
00:45:31,450 --> 00:45:47,100
I work. I just left.

332
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:16,490
I feel like I.

333
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:53,040
Got it. We have been doing this for years and years of hate crimes, crime.

334
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:09,530
Just that. He said.

335
00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:18,130
It's just. Yeah.

336
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:28,870
Yeah, it's.

337
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:57,040
Yeah. I mean, I, I just I felt like.

338
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:03,800
Oh, my God. Was like.

339
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:37,560
Yeah. So I find it very hard work.

340
00:48:44,930 --> 00:48:51,300
Yeah, that's what I like.

341
00:48:54,700 --> 00:49:04,990
Yeah. I.

342
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:14,350
You know, that person's life.

343
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:25,020
I, I was very funny, but then I was like.

344
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:40,960
So you. You don't have.
