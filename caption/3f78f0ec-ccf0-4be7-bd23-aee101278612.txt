1
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Okay, Hello, everyone. Good morning. that's got started so First of all, let's go for the very quickly.

2
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You are again. You all did really well, we'll go over very quick.

3
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:56,000
But if you have any question please let me know

4
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Okay, So it's it's pretty straightforward as you can see The first question is asking the meeting.

5
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You just add them up and divide by the number of data points, which is 10, so that not make the calculation fairly easy.

6
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:17,000
The answer will be 5.4 so you all did it right, but I won't spend time here.

7
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,000
The second one is asking for the median, so you just need to one of them from the smallest largest.

8
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You can just look at it. 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, and 5.

9
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:44,000
So the fifth and sixth number of post 5. So the meeting will be the average of the fifth and the sixth, because we have even number of data points here, So that will be or the next question asking about the property of me on

10
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:51,000
meeting and the standard deviation. So once you have this number, you will change 2 to 4. right here.

11
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You need to look at 2 is the smallest number. I would change the smallest number.

12
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Oh, wow! So the men will always change, because it depend on the total farm, and the standard deviation will always change as well, because it depend on every single number.

13
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:17,000
So the median usually will not change. But if you really, you know, change the number of so dramatically that you move it from the left side of meeting to the right hand side of the meeting the medium, my shift a little bit if

14
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
you just change the number of still stay on the same side of the meeting.

15
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It will now change in this case from change from 2 to 4 will not change, because the meeting is 5, so the medium will not change.

16
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So. so the crack answer will be me, and the standard deviation will change them would not change.

17
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:44,000
We have a comment in the chat. Would you be able to share your screen with everyone?

18
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Oh, i'm so sorry bye bye bye

19
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Let me

20
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Sorry. Okay, Sorry about that. Pretty even realize. Okay, yeah, very quickly.

21
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:14,000
The first line is 5 point, 4,Â s, one is 5. This one is me, and the standard deviation will change.

22
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And last one. So here we have a real data type about borrow load of pile of fee, You know 231 man, right?

23
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
In Southwestern Michigan, and then they measure measure, a lot of data.

24
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
So we have our data. We'll have 231 measurements, right?

25
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:41,000
We're not showing about data here. we show you the summary statistic, the mean, the Median, the standard deviation Iqr, and A.

26
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Whether they are you know what kind of a distribution, and what kind of a shape of the distribution.

27
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:57,000
So Here we see the mean is larger than the median, and by fairly significant amount, right?

28
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
The difference is, about 500 is about like a quarter.

29
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Oh, 20% of the measurement so I mean as far as the meeting that's addressed is the rise queue The mean will be directed by the tail of the mean it's on the right hand side of the medium

30
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
which means these wise skills, and also you can double check with the Iq. R.

31
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You see the Iq. R. the post will send her around Median.

32
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:27,000
By the left boundary of the iqr is clothing with a medium than a right ride boundary with the Iqr.

33
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:34,000
So that's also a indicate the the life student so essentially the distribution you think about it will stretch more to the right hand side.

34
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:41,000
But it'll be right field. so so he's not the metrics. Now, rock labeled so by modal by model means.

35
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
There are 2 piece of the distribution, really, we cannot tell, because none of this measure, how many peaks.

36
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
So usually the distribution we deal with at one peak.

37
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
In most cases, but occasionally they could have 2 peaks or more peak.

38
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Right. So by model time model. that means they have one on one.

39
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Take the only one tick that's called un model so here we just cannot help from this summary statistics.

40
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:12,000
So. can any of you give me a Because on hold of a buy model distribution

41
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:20,000
The diagnosis of inflammatory ball disease it's fine mobile distribution.

42
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Okay, yeah, i'm not familiar with Dr. g explain why this time model.

43
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
So typically it's diagnosed in each is like 15 to 25.

44
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And then it peaks again around age 50 so there's this lower incidents, and like pages 30 to 40.

45
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I see. Thanks. How are you? thank you very much yeah i'm thinking about?

46
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You know, if you if you look at for example yeah, I mean we had an example right where the car accident rate right?

47
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:04,000
We see that it's you shape right a new shift distribution where the young people and the Elderly they have a higher accident rate when driving.

48
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:15,000
So that's the by model and also i'm not sure. but you know, if you look at the for example, human height, right in both male and female, they are unique model for view.

49
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:22,000
You could look at the overall population right? So there is many and a female together where you, where you put 2 unit model distribution together.

50
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Sometimes they give you a buy monoton disability sometimes they don't.

51
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,000
So this case I'm not sure for human height but You know. if you have 2, you can think about you have 2 separate.

52
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You need model distribution, and the peak, you know the most separate by idle bar.

53
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Where you mix them together, you sometimes get time on the distribution.

54
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:45,000
So it it happens occasionally, but not frequently any question. before I move on to the new lecture.

55
00:13:45,000 --> 00:14:09,000
You all did really well here so on so there's not much I I worry about

56
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
So today we're going to talk about lecture 4 so the the first few lectures they are relatively for.

57
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
So that's why we do one lecture a day the later lecture.

58
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Some of them are longer, so sometimes we do 2. One lecture spent 2 days, but all together.

59
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:36,000
We have 15 days 11. That true so lecture 4 it's on phone polling.

60
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,000
So we've now so far we talk about introduction to overview the visualization and the summary the testing.

61
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,000
And those are all you can. You know the the visualization of summer statistic put together.

62
00:14:48,000 --> 00:15:00,000
We call them the exploratory data analysis. So usually, when you have the data, right, you want to look at some summary that they want to look at some visualization to get a sense holiday to look like that that would be telling me how do we

63
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:18,000
model the data and analyze the data. sampling concepts goes back to the study division and the question we're trying to address is this this: This lecture is it's not long, but his pretty

64
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
essential to everything we do in statistics so it's conceptual.

65
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,000
So sometimes it's a little hard to get so that's Why, I was a little bit down here. make sure you got a content here.

66
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Actually, but those Coronavirus. So there, there is this cycle of technical analysis, or even, you know, the way, you know, we we do sign.

67
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Usually when we be on experiment, especially in epidemiology there's the population that we interest we will be going through exercise, you know, to identify the population of interest.

68
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:01,000
So the population of interest usually it's very big so you just, not logistically, all cost wise feasible to to study the population.

69
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
That's sometimes the population not only big but there's also evolving.

70
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
So, you know, unless you can take a snapshot usually that's not practical.

71
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
You really cannot study the population because things by the time you started it's already changing. right?

72
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
So. the definition of popular sometimes is a little very so.

73
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:28,000
The way you do that is, you draw some you design. an experiment Draw a sample from the population, and this that is pretty important, although we Won't be focusing a lot on this.

74
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
But you want to sample to have some good poverty which we'll talk about later.

75
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
So draw a phone call is finite sample size. Where are you kind of?

76
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:46,000
You know, logistically handle in your in the scale of your study, depending on budget, of course, and manpower, and you draw a sample from the population, and then you you you can documents right?

77
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Sometimes it survey. You have questions sometime, and you follow up biological sort of a lab lab measurement inside those right?

78
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:02,000
So it can be all different kind of measurements, basically on the learn something, some variable from the pump hole. once you, you, you measure that you got a data type.

79
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
So this this data set is the measurement from the sample which is the table.

80
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
We just show right. Each row is the subject in the Temple, hey?

81
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Jacob is the variable you'll measure right you have to predefine how to draw the sample.

82
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
What's the sample size which matter of variable you want to measure right?

83
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Those should happen in the study design phase it's very it is a bad idea to do not specify you know, sample size and downloading scheme, and the variable to measure beforehand and then you try to you

84
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:39,000
know, chase a moving target that will be pretty pretty hard on that bad practice, unless there's a you know real reason for doing that.

85
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:49,000
So once you have the data set, you do some something like explore, 3 data analysis where you you visualize, you know data, and you run summary statistics on every single variable pairs of variable.

86
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:58,000
And so on, and so forth, basically get a sense How the data look like right, whether they are outliers, whether they are missing values, you know whether they're, you know, different kind of things.

87
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:06,000
So. So this is for you to get a sense of of your distribution of your data and the social potential association.

88
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
And then that will guide you through the later that you go out.

89
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:22,000
So this is for typical I would say pilot study or or you know, explore 3 study or for scientific.

90
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:29,000
You're back to application things like that so this this whole framework, right? explorers on all of this, and then decide what to do.

91
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Actually go against another principal in statistics, which is that you need to prescribe.

92
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
You analysis. so as you see i'm talking about 2 different velocity. One is that you've got the data.

93
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You'll learn a lot from the data that decide what to do next.

94
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Yeah, this is good. You know your last is or Taylor to the specific data. This works well when you don't really have a very good idea what the data might look like. like.

95
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,000
You're doing a piloting sort of a work right you're pioneer in the in the new problem.

96
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Another kind of analysis is actually the other pace when you like them and run clinical trial.

97
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
You already know exactly. You have a you have a a vaccine.

98
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:13,000
You want to see what the impact of not right. a clinical trial Actually, the best practice is that you'll prescribe your analysis. you prescribe.

99
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
You know this is the data I want to clock. This is the analysis I want to run on.

100
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
It. i'm gonna run this particular model and you know so on so forth.

101
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
It's not like we cannot change but it's better that you don't change.

102
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Of course, if you if the data you know you collect doesn't you after your email, you know, doesn't really follow your your your assumption, you know there's a big deviation, you know in fact, things happen you still have to change

103
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I Ideally, you want to prescribe your analysis, and Fda require that.

104
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
And the reason is because I will talk about it all, you know.

105
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:55,000
If you make your analysis adapt to the data, you have a chance of inflating a pipeline error, rate, which means that you haven't chance of finding false positive finding.

106
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
So. So there are 2 extremes right in in case you want to do some learning.

107
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
You want to report big part in the office and adaptive to the now it's good on the other hand.

108
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
If you just want to validate the weather back then it's working on.

109
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Now that's simple most important question now you actually should prescribe your analysis.

110
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:21,000
So there's a 2 extremes so you reality you know, unless you're running a political trial. you're required by Fda to You know, police corporate analysis that you need to write a private you know hundreds of paid the

111
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:27,000
report saying, this is exactly what i'm going to do if I write into that, you know, in the worst case, if things go wrong way wrong.

112
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I don't. have a sort of a war right we will discuss, and, you know, revise our analysis and ask for reapproval from Fda.

113
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
But if everything goes well we'll just do exactly what we prescribe. There are people you will see the data.

114
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
So that way. you have actually guaranteeed one hourly that'll talk a little about that later.

115
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
But don't get confused. There are 2 extreme usually we are somewhere in the middle.

116
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
So once we call the data analysis which is what we're doing here.

117
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:57,000
You know, we got understanding the data right? And then we started to think about, how do we analyze the data?

118
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:03,000
So what we do is here, you know, we talk about, and the draft 2 weeks here, you know, build a physical model and run some some analysis.

119
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Finally we can get some conclusion. The conclusion usually is the what you're conference like P.

120
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Value about passing or confident evil will go over all of them, depending on type of data.

121
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Finally, those in print. The The very important thing about those inferences are, first of all, before you design a experiment right?

122
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
You have a question in mind, so the inference is you free about the question.

123
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:34,000
You already have right, apparently. once you see the data you might actually raise new questions.

124
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
That's that's that's cool right and you can study those as well.

125
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:45,000
But that's not the same usually you you should have a question you might beforehand right, because also draw the farm hole, and which they're able to measure.

126
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Depend on what you want to study in the first place you you Don't have a goal.

127
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,000
You need to have a question in mind so that's the Usually we call the primary amount of it.

128
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
When you write a graph, propose or something, you need to have a primary analysis.

129
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Say once I have the data, This is the number one question i'm gonna look at.

130
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Of course, if there are new, interesting coming up, I can do some, you know, secondary or tertiary on all of this right?

131
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Those are totally fine, but you need to stick to your apartment at least.

132
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Right, so the inference will be all about the primary and that's number one thing number 2 is that any inference.

133
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Any conclusion, any interpretation you draw from this data, and an analysis involved with the data to do with the population, because the population is is the real question.

134
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:37,000
You want to study, Not a problem, right? You use the phonehole to correct data, how you use the data to make inference about the population right?

135
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Keep that in mind because the phone always always run them, which means everything you do with the tunnel.

136
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
You mean your conclusion is actually random, so that's why we need to quantify the uncertainty.

137
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:54,000
We want to know how reliable, how can we system the our conclusion will be if we draw another sample and another one another one.

138
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
So this this crucial cycle and concept is called, you know, sampling framework.

139
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
It is very important throughout this course and trial statistics.

140
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
So make sure you you hope clear what i'm talking about here.

141
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
If you have questions, you know, I will repeat again again.

142
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
But you that question that you Do you think you know you need a call rotation?

143
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Please let me know

144
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Okay, i'll move on So because the data is random so we need to use probability to model the data right?

145
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:34,000
That's why part probability is the foundation of of statistics so so far we have been here right?

146
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:44,000
So we have the data. We do something far enough. it's like visualization summary, and then your future actors will do the the next step where we rebuild them into the models to analyze data right the model will depend

147
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,000
on the type of data and the question of interest. Therefore, we have so many different tools.

148
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,000
This course will overview from the most widely used ones, like 2 sample comparison.

149
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:01,000
One sample comparison, you know, regression model those kind of things right, and also for continuous and the binary and categorical variable.

150
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
So we review the most basic. This thing goes beyond way. more than this core right?

151
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Many of the physical cores you can learn from this summer school, and also from you know the department about statistics or epidemiology.

152
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
They? Some of the courts just deal with different kind of data.

153
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:25,000
For example, in both statistic, we have a course about survival data analysis where which happens with their data sort of a survival time, right?

154
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:38,000
How long a patient live. And so on. so forth that missing data analysis. And you know, longitudinal data Now, So basically each kind of data we'll have a in the it's on court to just talk about how to do with that kind of

155
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
data. But once you'll go deep so today we're gonna go go into this box.

156
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Talk about. How do we? I identify the population of interest and design?

157
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:57,000
A pumping scheme right, and the draw. The pumble is a pretty short lecture, as you see. only 18 pages. so!

158
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
But I will slow down a little bit because it's all conceptual it's it's cool.

159
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:09,000
It's gr show that you understand the concept. Okay, So the population is defined as the entire group of subjects.

160
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,000
You're interested in studying sometimes the population is very easily identifiable.

161
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Right. so you want to study Michigan. right. then.

162
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Then all the Michigan residents will be your population right if you want to study all Michigan children living below the policy line, then all of those people are party.

163
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Napoleon population. But you say we Hogg?

164
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
All right. Whatever you use, study, you need to have a a clearly defined population.

165
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I see if you say all Michigan children living below the poverty line.

166
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
They need to say, What do you mean by Michigan children? right?

167
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,000
They need to be Michigan right away, or or they live here, but they may not not necessarily be resident, Right? And then children right.

168
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
How do we define children below as under 18 under 12?

169
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
And there, you know, 8 needs to define right, and also 11, you know, below the poverty line.

170
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,000
How do you define the poverty line? right? So all of this need to be clearly defined.

171
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:05,000
For what study to to be carried out. and again.

172
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
You know there are many questions. Right? are you at women over age?

173
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,000
30 with hope. You are that addiction all us gay males with obstacles, all of this right?

174
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
So any question you want to address, you need to prescribed.

175
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
What population is that interest gear? And you can think about The population is actually changing.

176
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:26,000
The the number of people in the population is constantly changing.

177
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Whatever your study is, study some lot of snapshot right when the look when the study is carried off.

178
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Right. So basically, what i'm saying you do the study right now, or you do the study.

179
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:44,000
20 years ago, if 20 years later you might got different answers, and I might, because the population actually changed.

180
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:54,000
So keep that in mind, and then for any of this typical population interest It's just not feasible to study everything or subject in that right.

181
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:01,000
If your population, you know, if everybody in the in a school then it's possible you track on everybody right collect information.

182
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:16,000
But when we talk about this kind of a population it's just not feasible to to clack data from everything or one of them. So what what we usually do is to draw a sample a sample is defined as a subset of population you can.

183
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Actually afford to study, and the key idea is to sample by itself is not of interest.

184
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:34,000
It only serve as a means what was probably populations, or only studies comfort, because we cannot possibly study the population right just, not feasible.

185
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:43,000
So the interest is about the population of the sun who is crucial, in a sense that it's really the the data we are studying, and also the promo size. I will later talk about.

186
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:54,000
So there are 2 sides right we're talking about Why is the population size the size of the population, usually very big, and also usually something you you don't have a setting number. huh?

187
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Yeah, you can estimate that maybe like 1 million here to a meeting here, but you don't really have a number by that point.

188
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,000
So I thought that as well show later as well as the population side is very large.

189
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
By large I mean really large, like a 100 times larger than a thumbhole, you know.

190
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Basically otherwise very large. It doesn't have an impact on the uniform and analysis.

191
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:23,000
We can't consider that infinity so really the 5 but if the popular side is very small, then you have to be cautious, right.

192
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:29,000
If the population size is 1,000 and assembled as 500, then actually everything is higher in the course.

193
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,000
The analysis do not really apply to those cases. But you know you need a special technique.

194
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Usually here we we can see the population, which is large like 100,000, a 1 million even more. So in that case it doesn't really matter.

195
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Oh, the sample size is crucial because the size of the sample deterior power, an uncertainty.

196
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:58,000
The larger the thumbs are, the more power, the less uncertainty, but also, on the other hand, right the sample size, the size of the sample determining your cost. right?

197
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:07,000
So it is a direct inverse. relationship. right the more money you'll spend the lot of time as you have the the more power and the last I 30. you have So that's a that's a direct conflict in there, so you

198
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,000
have to strike a balance So i'll talk about it How do you design a study right?

199
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
So usually, you pretty scribe, a power, or your prescribe uncertainty.

200
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I know you inversely pick out the tables that you need right.

201
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:28,000
For example, if if a new agency trying to run a election poll, they want to see Oh, they want to, you know. draw some hole.

202
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:35,000
They want to narrow down the confidence. For example, they want to estimate the the support of one candidate versus the other.

203
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
They want to estimate that to the precision 1%, then they can universally figure.

204
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Oh, that you know Thomas has a 5,000 then they run the sample 5,000, so that's how how they determine the sample time.

205
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
It's required some power analysis that will show a little bit later on.

206
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:55,000
How to do that by in the end. the sample itself although it's the one you directly work with is not the one of interest.

207
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:01,000
The phone is random. Okay, So your goal is to use the sample to make inference.

208
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:10,000
To describe the rest of population you did not actually observe, so they can be anything because you don't see them, but because the thumbhole is is well-designed and randomly drawn.

209
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
You can actually save the rest of the population which you don't be with high confidence.

210
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,000
So we can now say for sure they look like this. They can look like anything you can use.

211
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Math to say I have high confidence the rest of the population although I don't see should have this property.

212
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Okay, that's the power of you know statistic so the summary right?

213
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Usually we have a question regarding population interest with summer as a question.

214
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:48,000
In a few numbers, we call them parameters of interest so parameter for the numbers about the population that of infect It's something we don't know, but we are up interested.

215
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Okay, and then, i'll show example later, on right now it's just confidence, right?

216
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
So the host. This is an analysis that use characteristics.

217
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:10,000
The phone alright. This thing in reality is just called the statistic. The number you'll calculate from the problem is called the statistic use statistics to make inference about a corresponding members in the population auto ,

218
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:18,000
the statistic parameter right statistic or the number you'll compute from the sample parameter the number you want to learn in the population.

219
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
So this 2 terminology is going to use them from now on.

220
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Make sure you understand when I say no. any question on these plot

221
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Could you just go over how you said

222
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Samples. Size increases, the the amount of costs will increase, but also the not a parallel increase.

223
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Yeah, Yeah, exactly. right. So the larger the sample you'll collect the more money you'll spend on collecting them and studying them right?

224
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
On the other hand, you'll gain more power so essentially everything.

225
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:08,000
So all the inference you make about the population we'll be more accurate with a larger sample time.

226
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:22,000
But how is it inversely related to one another, though

227
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
So. so essentially, for example, if I run a poll, I I pull 1,000 people.

228
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I can say, Oh, I know the the support rate of a particular candidate up to like 3% or 5% accuracy like that.

229
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Some of those are 5,000, I can say down to 1% accuracy, Right?

230
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
So basically I I have more tight inference about the primitive interest.

231
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
That's why I say, let me yeah you think about assembled as a power.

232
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
They are hard, they are positively cardinal, right proportional.

233
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
But you can talk about assembly and the precision.

234
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Then they are inversely right or not. Precision of the uncertainty right.

235
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
The larger the sample that smaller the uncertainty that's the number.

236
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Sorry I'm not making that clear how about that certainly. here.

237
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Any other question. Yeah, don't so I want to make make it clear.

238
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:12,000
So the characteristics of the sample can take also be called parameters.

239
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:27,000
All in the the characteristics of the population. can you can say again, Sorry, i'm not sure sorry So the parallel parameters means the characteristics of the population.

240
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,000
What we want to study, so can the characteristics we came from.

241
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,000
The sample also called parameters, no parameters.

242
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:47,000
The parameters is about the temperature. in the population. parameters on the number of interest, or we don't do not directly observe that's quite a parameter.

243
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
So everything to do with the sample is cause of statistic.

244
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Okay, thank you, because it's not probably because in the sample we can compute.

245
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
That's why the term statistic and the problems are very important crucial here.

246
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:10,000
So make sure you understand the distinction between them that this is the number we compute from the data we collect from the sample where i'm in the number we navigate while we make an inference on so this one is of interest but

247
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,000
this one is the way we directly observe. At some time we have a pair of them.

248
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Oh, just make an example. Right? for example, you want to study the average height.

249
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Oh, for example, Michigan Mail, the average high that Michigan male is something you want to you.

250
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,000
You want to know, or you never directly observe so that's a parameter.

251
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:38,000
You start if you draw a random sample of Michigan mail and capture the sample mean the average in the sample. Right?

252
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,000
That's the time when you already talk about that is the testing. you See that these 2 numbers are very closely related.

253
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:53,000
They both measure the average high of michigan male but this one is the number you'll calculate from the pompo, and the other one is the one you want to measure. like you have a seat right so usually they call me

254
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
impair. Use some statist to admin a parameter right?

255
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:04,000
This one is a fixed number. You are interest, but you don't observe this one is a random number, because each time you draw something.

256
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:14,000
You got a different average. This is why the random number So you can imagine this tool number will be close to each other, but not the same.

257
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,000
That's why we use digital model to draw uncertainty we know this number is close without one.

258
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:26,000
We don't know how close it is you know probability and statistical tools to quantify the difference between the 2 number.

259
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I was surely Now, so that's the essential idea once you get through this idea, everything follow, don't you know, down the road will be coming more and more.

260
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Last night, right? because each time we just use different 2 but central idea always like, Think about what is the primary interest, and what is the what you're using

261
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Any other question.

262
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Okay, You you can always, you know, come back to me later.

263
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
So this is the the, you know illustration of what we are exactly doing, right?

264
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,000
So this is the population. Each thought is a subject apparently.

265
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:16,000
I only draw like plenty here, but in reality. it could be like my meeting right, and I use the color to denote different kind of subject.

266
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Apparently everybody is different. You need right so I should use infinite number of callers.

267
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:34,000
But let's say we are interested in some sort of a property, and for that property we kind of really dipotomize, or you know, if you know just sort of clock, right? for example, want to study a particular disease, and there

268
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
are different kind of their healthy they are, you know, mild.

269
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,000
They are severe. Right so use different colors to denote different kind of a subject in the population.

270
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Interest. So you want to study something to do with this particular class in the population?

271
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Say you want to study how many people in the population have this particular disease.

272
00:36:53,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Alright. So that's a problem with them so once you have a question you can formulate into some parameter in the population.

273
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:09,000
So again, we cannot. If we can measure everybody in the population that we can directly computer paradigm.

274
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:16,000
We don't need a specific. We just need them you know a calculator, but in reality we cannot study everybody in the population.

275
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:23,000
So we design a study. we draw a sample. There are many, many sampling schemes for different pros, and counts for the simplest.

276
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
One is also the most widely used one it's also the one we're gonna stick with.

277
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:36,000
In this course. it's just called a simple random sample Okay, which is the simplest one in the sense that a simple random sample.

278
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:49,000
We would cool, You know, subjects from the population in substitute that everybody in the population had an equal chance, being being included in the bomb. Right?

279
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Say, this is 1 million, and this is 100. Then everybody here has 100, over 1 million.

280
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:03,000
That will be 10,000 right, one over 10,000 of chance being included here, and they are independent.

281
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:13,000
So so I being included, has nothing to do with the chance that you being included So it's like, you know, just this is the back of of 100 B.

282
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:27,000
And you randomly draw 10 of them. blindly that's the way of think for random sample work, right So in this case, because a simple random example we can imagine, if the sample size is not too small the sample will be so

283
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:34,000
called quote unquote representative. So you would imagine if there are 4 color here, and you're drawing a number of 10.

284
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:42,000
You would imagine almost every caller being included of course There's a small chance that you only you know you draw tennis.

285
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:48,000
All of them are green, but the chance is so tiny that it can be ignored. Right?

286
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Typically you have a The sample will be representatively represented front representative in the sense that you know things about the population.

287
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:05,000
You will see a smaller version here. So anything you can you want to measure in the public parameter.

288
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:18,000
You can copy the same thing in the sample of what I'm saying, If you regarded the sample as a smaller version of the population, the tiny version of the population, you can study whatever you want here now, right because you have the data

289
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:26,000
this one you don't have the data here you have the data, and then everything we we study here call the statistic, and then, later on we'll use the statistics.

290
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I think I'm just repeating myself, so I will move on that you you have questions .

291
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I mean no fine. Can I ask something about the for example, if you know that the parameter that you want to study in your population has like in general less for I ability?

292
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I cannot think of an example right now. But does that mean that you can?

293
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Accept the smaller sample size. Yeah, yeah you're right I mean the sample size is the crucial port.

294
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:06,000
It's a crucial number in your study design right so we usually need to inversely pick out the sample type.

295
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:13,000
But the samples, you know the samples are needed depends on the particular question you're asking on a feature in the population.

296
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Yeah, you are absolutely right. When we design a study we need to figure out the sample size, Bob.

297
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
When we do that, we need to basically make assumption about the quantity.

298
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,000
We're trying to study. Sometimes we need a larger time of that sometimes we need a smaller one.

299
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:35,000
You're absolutely right

300
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Or what makes a good sample. What make a bad example?

301
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
I just talk about simple random tumble simple random sample is pretty good.

302
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
That's Why, the most widely used although sometimes it's not so effective.

303
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,000
That's right. people, have more statistics assembly design right, which is beyond the the the scope of this course.

304
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
But here i'm just telling you what what makes a sample good model, right?

305
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:02,000
So you want to sample to be representative in a sense that it looks like a mini version of the population.

306
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Therefore everything you know in the population will sort of a applying the tumble, and especially for the for the quantity, for the feature.

307
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:18,000
You want to study in the population, you know the sample will mimic that as close as possible.

308
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:25,000
In that sense. if the sample is representative, whatever you learn from the sample, you can see the same thing.

309
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Probably similar things happening in the population right that's called the generalizability, right?

310
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Because in the end you only study the example. If the sample is not representative, you just cannot, you know, make conclusion about the population Very well, right.

311
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
They want to sample to be generalizable, which means you have to be represented.

312
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
In the first place, which means that the sample should be reflect.

313
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Every type of subject might lead in the population. right? so ideally, if you draw the sample randomly, it will usually started by the other representatives.

314
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I mean, I think. Why is it stop? I can you know discuss with you and show you that even a simple random tunnel?

315
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:13,000
It's very hard to get all sometimes almost impossible so you can only get a, you know, close sort of a version of it.

316
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,000
You can never get a perfect, simple, random sample i'll talk about that later.

317
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:30,000
But you know, lack of planarizability. is to buy it, which means that if you only you have a biased option, which means a sample, is not representative right, then if you still think it is rather than the the the inference, you'll

318
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
make about a sample will not be generalizable for the population.

319
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
You introduce bias, and so on, so forth, which is basic embarrassment is all right.

320
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Your estimate will be all that's bad right but if you're aware of you.

321
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
You'll have a bias you can feel trial back to correct abyss.

322
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:50,000
But the worst part is that you're not aware of your bias. you think you're still getting a good representative sample.

323
00:42:50,000 --> 00:43:00,000
But actually you have a buyer sample that's the word because your conclusion not only will be off it'll be off with high confidence in the sense that you think it's on right on on the father actually dog that will me

324
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:08,000
feed you and make wrong decision. Right? So this takes, you know, to move on here shows a very good example.

325
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
For example, there are 4 kinds of subgroup in the population, right?

326
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Showed by 4 different color. Well, somehow, you're drawing sample which only include 2 colors which means that you are including nobody from the other 2 colors in your temple. you have no information whatsoever, about those 2 soft groups so whatever

327
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:37,000
you'll learn here. you know nothing about the other 2 top group except for your assumption, right?

328
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:43,000
If you assume they behave the same. No, of course you can say something about it by if you already know they behave the same, you know.

329
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Why do you even need a draw example right but i'm saying usually you don't know about them.

330
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I don't you know. include them. your example. Then you learn nothing about them in the time you have no information.

331
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:59,000
You just cannot say anything about them right that's the bioterrorism cartoon.

332
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,000
You bomb. Hold on. That means that shows you you know when your phone boys buy it.

333
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Everything you'll learn will be buying it's not generalizable.

334
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:15,000
All you can say from this sample is it's about this 2 sub group in the population, it can say nothing about the other 2 subgroups.

335
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Right that's Why, nowadays? when you write a you know ground proposal from Nih proposal, they will ask you, what's your study design?

336
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
What's the effective form of that? they will also ask you you know?

337
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Are you exactly include So both genes and I already, and the children, and you know different kind of racial groups right in your study.

338
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,000
So by default, you should include everybody make sure you're finding apply to everybody.

339
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:50,000
But sometimes it's just not feasible. or not possible or not immediately equal to that for everybody they need to justify. For example, you'll study prostate cancer, You say, oh i'm not going to include any email in the study because it's about the

340
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
transition right? We just pulled into the Bible right?

341
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Sometimes the study, you know you need to give me the consent.

342
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Then you're saying, i'm not including children right things like that so you have to justify if you're not covering the whole population

343
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Now let's run on example. I Suppose we want to study all us children in a 4 year high school.

344
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,000
We know the for you High School, or you know, Freshman, top of our junior senior.

345
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
We have the full caller there, Right? This basic case will happen on the previous slide.

346
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,000
I will create through quickly, Right? We can other studying at you.

347
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Run high school in a number. I draw some of 10 students, but turn all that.

348
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:48,000
They are all I would say, freshman platformer.

349
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:55,000
So I I run into many problems here. So number one problem is that I only study here on high school.

350
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:05,000
I just cannot say anything. You know a lot about it. All us children right, unless you assume you are high school, is the very representative time of the Us.

351
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Children I mean I i wouldn't tend to see the high school or children, but nevertheless, so we have a lack of representative needs here, right if you're a high school in a number you just it's not represented second thing

352
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:31,000
is that you only include platform and the crash manual sample They don't really know a lot about Junior Senior finally assembled at the 10 usually too small.

353
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:46,000
For you to make any quality quality, conclusion because your variability will be so high that anything you'll learn we'll have a high uncertainty around right because some of that is 10. There's a chance that you are meeting a lot of the

354
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,000
information. So there are. there are many problem with this study. divine.

355
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:56,000
You can think about it

356
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:04,000
So. so in this particular case the quality of interest is the average, you know, anxiety by about having to college.

357
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I suppose we we ask them 10 students a question there from 0 to 10 greater anxiety of going to college.

358
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,000
I got to answer 2.5. This has nothing to do with the question.

359
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Interested. I I that Junior Athena will be much more anxious about going to college and then software, more impression. right?

360
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:34,000
So this this is way off from the quantity. you really want to measure and different school in different region. Probably differ quite a bit about its anxiety as well. Right?

361
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Okay, it's just a very you know toy example to show you how important the representative sample is, and the second, the usual I already mentioned.

362
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,000
A little bit is a sampleing variability, hey? In the center.

363
00:47:47,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Your sample may be representative, which means is unbiased, which means, on average right. the number you you measure the statistical measure from your sample will be off right, will be, will not be the same as the parameter of of the

364
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Intro, but it doesn't have a tendency of going one way, but the other it will center around.

365
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:13,000
It will, you know you'll scatter around because the sample oh, sample is random, you know, but this is random right.

366
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,000
So every time you got a number you could repeat a study but there's no tendency for you to go one way or the other.

367
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:29,000
So which means there's no buy-in However, you may have a big sampling variability which had something to do with your automobile and other quantity like the variable.

368
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:36,000
You'll be trying to measure. so the summary of our ability is the hardest contact for for beginner.

369
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
I think statistics because you can think about right you'll draw a sample.

370
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,000
I want you draw some. you measure them. You got the data test all the number already.

371
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
There. Whatever you compute from the data side is already there.

372
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
You got a number, and now i'm saying this number has a variability.

373
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:58,000
So you've got a 2.5 out of the sample I say there's a 100 around right that's that's that can make hard to understand what's on thursday.

374
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Is about so i'm certainly about this so called sampling frame, because you're sample is just a random talk that hypothetically.

375
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,000
You could run your study again, get a difference of that. and again again again.

376
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:17,000
You could do it a union time in for the time and each time, because your sample is random.

377
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:24,000
The statistic right. it's cool point 5 it's a time for me which is a statistic because Samo is random.

378
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:29,000
The data is actually random. Then anything you compute from the data, including your statistic, is random.

379
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Even your final conclusion is random. you have to think about this randomness.

380
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:41,000
It's building from hypothetical repeated experiment

381
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:50,000
So there is an uncertainty around. it's called the sampling variability, which means that if you sample many, many times, you got a a lot of different numbers.

382
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:55,000
There's a variability alone, So this is a little phyllotopical.

383
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
So I don't wanna go to deep or too much into it.

384
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:13,000
You know this, this concept of the company many times it's called a frequentist approach. So everything we're learning the frequency approach as we in this class, as we we we do, we manage the digital cost they started in breakfast

385
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:21,000
approach. They guarantee you that whatever you learn from the example, if you repeat the whole analysis, you know, repeat the whole sampling plot.

386
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:31,000
So the a lot of analysis afterwards. many many times there's a guarantee that the conclusion made will be correct with high frequency.

387
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:36,000
So that's why it's called a frequency approach frequent business approach.

388
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:50,000
So like I said, Everything you got from the sample is random, including your conclusion. so your conclusion may be wrong, for the frequencies approach guarantees you that if you replace the whole process, in pulling sampling under

389
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:57,000
analysis like a 1 million times the with high probability, with high frequency, the conclusion will be correct.

390
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Still you cannot guarantee this particular conclusion is correct.

391
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,000
You can never guarantee that. Oh, you have a high confidence there.

392
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
So that's called the frequencies approach and it's a little philosophical.

393
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:13,000
But there's a parallel pro for the bayesian approach which is that popular than the frequencies post.

394
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
But still many people use it, for it has its own benefit.

395
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:22,000
I have been there both decades, and there are courses invading, and some common university they, you know.

396
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:28,000
For example, do you university They are they're full of basins they they they favor based on so pay in versus the frequencies.

397
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:38,000
There's a big argument for that case right i'm not going to write in there, but just so you know there are different philosophical approaches to do with the statistics in these course we're gonna cover mostly frequencies

398
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:47,000
approach So basically, i'm saying, here, right if you draw another sample. you got a 10 different number.

399
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Then the number. your computer may not be 2.5 anymore.

400
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Maybe 3, maybe 2, point 5 that's right if you just think about the potential repeated sampling.

401
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Now you understand the company variability any questions, so far

402
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:16,000
I do have a question, but i'm not sure if i'm worrying this correctly.

403
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Like many times, I have a hard time like when I think about generalization, would like epidemiology studies.

404
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Like when it comes to wake Basin in the city.

405
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:43,000
They did say there was a study like for example. the the nurses study Then the wild bed was a cooper, but it didn't include like people of color.

406
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:49,000
So then I have a hard time saying like, Okay, There was a study done.

407
00:52:49,000 --> 00:53:01,000
It was white women, you know. they collected a lot of like health information like like at first.

408
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:11,000
I wouldn't say they Oh, it's not generalizable to the bronze, because that lack of race ethnicity public.

409
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:16,000
How do we go about like thinking about the stuff that they did collecting?

410
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:22,000
How? I to the larger to the larger population.

411
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Okay, Thank you for asking. I think it is a very important question here, let's talk about it Right?

412
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,000
So in this case, if you only study 2 subgroup.

413
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:40,000
You know very well about the total group. Your data has no information about the other to stop group, which means that if you want to say anything about them is purely your assumption.

414
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:46,000
For example, if we study some particular disease, and all was on hold only in include the white.

415
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Why, you know, population which has been the tape actually in the past many decades for for logistic region.

416
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,000
For example, you know, the study is conducted in the area.

417
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Where is this mod majority wise right They just don't Go out to the to the black man's neighborhood or the other minority in the neighborhood for convenience?

418
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Or you know, a lot of times to conduct study. Usually you need to.

419
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,000
You need to study, study and enroll a lot of volunteer, right?

420
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Maybe the volunteers are mostly wide right, just happening due to the logistics, you know, or practical, usual in the past.

421
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Many study are including majority wide population and it's just like this right? when you're 30 more generally wide population, you'll learn a lot about that population for anything you can say about the minority, population because it's not in your data

422
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:40,000
you're based on assumption for example you'll study long disease. You learn managing about the wide population right? their behavior to do with long disease.

423
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Anything you say about the other minority group. You are making a country.

424
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:48,000
I think they behave. Similarly the assumption may work in some cases or not the other.

425
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,000
So in recently we have figured out, you know, a lot of times.

426
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:59,000
We learn sort of a behavioral impact, or you know, or even treatment. You know the treatment to do with outcome.

427
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Many things we learn in the white population when you generalize to other population.

428
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:09,000
The generalizability sometimes is high, but many operates low right.

429
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:19,000
For example, you can say this particular drug i'm just making up the example, this particular drop when you when you give to the white population, it's a you fact in this it's a 80% impacting but people.

430
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Often find if you give the same drug to other population like black or Asian other population, the effective drop sometimes the seventies that 60, sometimes even the 2030, really depend on a particular job you're using there's no control, because everything is based on

431
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,000
assumption, this, this assumption, that they all behave the same is really now eat.

432
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Sometimes you cannot even check the function right so that's Why, having a representative time in the first place is very important.

433
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:53,000
That's why, in the past, you know 5 to 10 years and my age, they start to require you to to include you know, representative samples as much as you can New York study.

434
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:58,000
If you cannot you have the that one you cannot or Why, you wouldn't do that. that's a very good question.

435
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:07,000
I hope i'm asking the question you know clearly but by basically, if your family is not representative, you have no control about the rep of generalizability.

436
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Sometimes it is generalizable, but after it is not, but nevertheless you have no control.

437
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Thank you so much. Yeah, that that that helps a lot. Thank you.

438
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:26,000
You welcome any other question?

439
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Yeah, I I think you can imagine right, actually, Matt, Many of the thing we learn right now, for example, smoking with lung cancer. The association actually is differ in different racial group.

440
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:49,000
And you can think about, for example, things like, a fine screen and a scheme cancer, you know, anything to do with green color actually has even more variability than different racial groups. right?

441
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:58,000
So depend on the particular question of interest so so sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't, and you you just don't know whether it work or not.

442
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:06,000
So it's better that include the reference to sample in the first place.

443
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Okay.

444
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Now let's talk about you know different quantities that will impact variability.

445
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Right. So there! there! there are many parameter. We consume, but 2 important one.

446
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:31,000
The first one is the pompo. 5. right? So how many subjects you, your including your example?

447
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:38,000
So the second one is, how noise is the value in the population is a originally right.

448
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
So that give you the question of interest. Right? So, for example, to think about.

449
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:47,000
If you want to study block pressure or versus you want to study

450
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Bmi you can think about. Probably Bmi has a wider range of variability in the population than the blood pressure. right?

451
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,000
So the the variability of the variable you want to study in the population.

452
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:05,000
The first place also has about playing here so let's just stick with this 2 variable.

453
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Why is it tumble? dies? One is the the how noisy, or how variable we call the population variant right?

454
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:21,000
So how variable the the quantity of interest in population So let's see if we want to reduce something vulnerability. right?

455
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Basically, we try to, Booth, our power or radio uncertainty.

456
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Do we prefer a greater population variance or less of population areas?

457
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Anybody wants to make a good nice sir, that's the operation right? absolutely. Yeah.

458
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:45,000
So the family of our benefits depends on the population are in the first place.

459
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:49,000
So that's why you know for a different kind of variable. You are studying.

460
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:55,000
You need a different sample type to reach the same power, because, you know the variable determined, the population variance.

461
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:05,000
And secondly, thing that if you want to reduce something about a better, do we need a larger sample that's smaller than all that. I think you all know we need the largest time of that, right and these 2 are connected right, If this one is

462
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,000
large. Then you need a given larger time of time to achieve the same company.

463
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Vulnerability.

464
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:18,000
I'll go through quickly here. you know it's about the time to take a break.

465
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:25,000
So suppose we want to study You know the the age of population, right?

466
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:30,000
So there are 2 population interest. One is our children paid from 2 to 5.

467
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:37,000
One is the adult rate from 18 to 95 want to study the average age in the 2 population.

468
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Apparently. The second group has a larger population marin i'll begin with.

469
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:59,000
So now, if we clock Pumphole and we draw the distribution of Hitler grammar sample, we'll see in the in the children case we have a much tighter people ground, but you know

470
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:04,000
doubt population sample. we we have a much wider pitel ground that's understandable right.

471
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:11,000
I'm just fine i'll show you this one has a population of our farther to be given than this one.

472
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:15,000
And then so post from our sample 40 adults here.

473
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:24,000
The demo guys are 40 right, and the we draw many, many humble.

474
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:29,000
So now this histogram is not one sample, but rather from repeated sampling.

475
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:35,000
So we rock conductor, study many time. each time draw a sample size 40.

476
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:43,000
I will compute the sample mean. And then the sample mean will have a distribution.

477
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,000
So this is the so called the sampleing distribution.

478
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:51,000
You can see this distribution only when you conduct a study many, many, many times.

479
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Usually that is not done so. this distribution exists, but only hypothetically.

480
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
But here, because, you know, we are just talking about hypothetical situation.

481
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:03,000
We could, so conducted by the time, then we actually have it right.

482
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,000
So this is the sample. Mean distribution is the sum volume, distribution of the sample mean.

483
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:13,000
You see that it has a different distribution here, the ranger from 39 to 43.

484
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:17,000
But here it's actually you know I didn't show it but this is so.

485
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:22,000
From 18 to 95. right? so they are a different distribution.

486
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:36,000
So my question is that if, instead of 40, if I collect a sample type of 400, I make the same histogram of the tumbling distribution of sample mean, What would it look like

487
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:42,000
You actually look like the yellow one. so it'll become narrow so they still center around the same place.

488
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:46,000
But you see, these Pixel Gram is pretty much random, right

489
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:57,000
But they send at the same place, but otherwise much tighter in the sense that if you increase the sample type, then the sampling variability of the statistic will be smaller.

490
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Actually we can quantify how my did later on. So the standard deviation of the the yellow one versus the blue one.

491
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:19,000
We can know how small it is without even conducting requirements like this. Mathematically we can't take it off

492
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Okay, so that's why sample sizes are important The more data we have, the more confident we have about anything.

493
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:36,000
You know, we study with the data, and also the more confidence we have about whether our conclusion will be replicated.

494
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:43,000
You know. you know, repeated Experiment in a retailer study, even though we don't need to do it.

495
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:52,000
So in this case crystal grab in the same stand there, but the yellow one is much tighter that's because we have a larger fumble size here.

496
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,000
In the tumbles. As we talk about 4 versus 400.

497
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:59,000
It has nothing to do with. how many times you will repeat you can review it like a meeting time.

498
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:06,000
It doesn't matter. The histogram you know once you repeat, the more time the program just gets finer and the final like a curve rather than it.

499
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:12,000
There, but the shape is still the thing right, the shape of the heel ground.

500
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:21,000
If this harmony by the time and the population If you do this for children rather than adults, they will, they will be much narrow, or both of them will be much narrow.

501
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:29,000
To begin with, but still the the relative ratio of the same

502
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:39,000
So now we see that once we increase the tumble type from 40 to 400, we really reduce the sampling variability by a factor of 10.

503
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:54,000
So that's why, when when I talk about inversely related right when you increase the sample size, you reduce the variability, and they're proportional for the variability by effective 10, here we are talking about on the scale

504
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:59,000
of variance, not on the scale of standard deviation. If you still remember the tool.

505
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:05,000
The variance is the sum of the square, the different deviation for the standard division, the square root of the variance 2.

506
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Here the fact of 10 is on the scale of the variance.

507
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:16,000
So if you want to study the you know variability on scale, standard deviation, you have to take square root, grow to the t is about 3.1, so which is safe.

508
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:29,000
The width of the yellow one is about no the west of the blue line is about 3 times, and the width of the yellow one not 10 times, although the family that is 10 times more.

509
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:34,000
So that's why both standard deviation and events play along you know, in statistics.

510
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:39,000
So vulnerability is measured by barriers that's inversely proportional to the tambo time.

511
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:45,000
But standard deviation is just a square root of that actually I should say standard error here, because it's about adding it.

512
01:04:45,000 --> 01:05:00,000
I think I Have 2 more slide. but I I like to take a break now, so I don't watch. and let's come back in 10Â min.

513
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Thank you.

514
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Okay, let's continue so here i'm talking about a general principle, something on the sample size, and you know something vulnerability.

515
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:56,000
And I use sample mean as the the example. right?

516
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:03,000
So here sample means the statistic we use and the population means the parameter of interest.

517
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Yeah, I'm using this tool as example by in reality could use study other quality.

518
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:21,000
You could use other statistics as we'll see later on, however, surprisingly or unsurprisingly, this relationship, this inverse relationship, right where you create the sample size, the summary vulnerability of the statistic you

519
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:31,000
use will, decrease performance. This relationship actually hosts for huge for almost most of the statistically work with not all.

520
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Some. some of the this has weird poverty, but I would say most of the statistics have this inverse relationship.

521
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:41,000
So you have you you have expect that when this when you're double assemble.

522
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Sorry to somebody. Variability of the particular statistical use. Not necessarily.

523
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Some of me we'll reduce by 2 Paul if it's not happening.

524
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Then there's some specific you know reason there will be interest to figure out a more of time.

525
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:59,000
It happens. Okay, So these are the more general than just the sampleing. I'm: trying to say, here, Yeah, no on the next slide.

526
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Next 2 slides I will, you know, basically show why that is a set case for someone who use mathematical formulas right for those of you who are familiar with math.

527
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:16,000
You can follow through meetings Basically, i'm trying to show why it is this case, not with the last.

528
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,000
You don't have to follow the map. you just you know you need to understand.

529
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:25,000
And you know, intuitive. understand this, it is the case, and whatever I show here only apply to sample.

530
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,000
We right? So for other statistics I have to show other formula.

531
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:36,000
If it turns out that this particular universe proportion relationship actually applied to a huge amount of solution.

532
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Okay, let's just study the sample and see why that's the case, right?

533
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,000
We we again we use mathematical notation. So Xi.

534
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Up to y 10. They are the sample measurements. right?

535
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Let me take the average we call the X bar, which is one over N, and sum up all the x right?

536
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:58,000
So those are not familiar. This is simply x one plus x 2 all the way.

537
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Pascal, and then divide by a so that's a sample. And once you do that, remember the sample standard deviation is capital.

538
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Using this pointer, Each Xi subtract the X bar, does wire it, and then some of it over, divided by 1 one over n minus one.

539
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:21,000
The sample that minus one is almost like averaging, but by a slide smaller number.

540
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Finally picks word.

541
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:34,000
So this and and the variance of the sample is of the sample

542
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:40,000
This sack square. This is assigned deviation. If you square, it is the is the parents.

543
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:45,000
So this statistic laws that describe whole sample, new, variable among many studies.

544
01:17:45,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Right. So, for example, we can show dot there there's some poverty, you know I cannot really rigorous pool here, because I haven't established them the mathematical foundation of me and the variance but we

545
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:16,000
can show that adding quality because it's random It has a mean, He has a variance or standard deviation, which means that the the act itself right, but each data point itself because it's random he has the variance.

546
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:24,000
We call the Sx Square, which is this one for the son who means X bar is also random.

547
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:30,000
It also has a variance which is the virus of the sample distribution assembly.

548
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:43,000
It turns out that because actually, because X bar is the average of all of this, you can use my math to prove that the various of X bar is the variance of X over M.

549
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Divided by him. The various expon is related to the population.

550
01:18:47,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Variance and inverse. Read it with the sample size That's just something you can prove based on this and the basic probability theory that shows, you you know, the sample mean is proportional to the population variant you know the virus

551
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:11,000
of the sample means proportional to the population variance of the tax itself. Also numerous proportional to the sample size.

552
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:25,000
When you take square root standard deviation, right this is the the standard deviation of the sample mean will be proportional to the standard deviation of the of the population, and you're inversely proportional to the square root of the sample

553
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:35,000
size. So this kind of property is very nice, and also, if we have a different formula for a different statistic, you can actually generalize it.

554
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:49,000
This also. You know this kind of a red initial, as well also apply to other statistics, which means that if you increase, assemble 5, you would expect the variance of the statistic to decrease proportionally on the

555
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:56,000
standard deviation to decrease approximately, but to the square root of the sample side.

556
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Okay. So, for example, if we want to study average law pressure of music, of of of Michigan residents, right?

557
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:12,000
We draw a sample of 100 Michigan resident and we measure the block pressure.

558
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:17,000
We got a average about, say, 101 as opposed to something vulnerability.

559
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:23,000
There is, you know, the same division of that estimate is like a 10, so 120, plus minus 10.

560
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:44,000
If you want to reduce that 2, 5, can someone tell me how big a sample we need if we want to reduce the standard deviation of the of the ATM bye bye 2

561
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Is, Is the classroom clear? So to reduce the sampling that you know standard deviation of this, of this, of the statistic by a vote of 2.

562
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:59,000
How big are a sample size, Do We need it's 2 times more is 3 times more.

563
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:11,000
It's 4 times more. How bigger 4 times more yup exactly right. That's the you say it is a good news.

564
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:17,000
It's also a bad news, right? a good news in the sense that you can always increase your sample size to reduce the sample variability.

565
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:21,000
The bad news is that you need to squared the the change right?

566
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:34,000
You want to reduce your position, you know you reduce your uncertainty by a part of 10 that you need to increase the sample cost of 100, which is, you know, I would say it's supposed to be new some venues But

567
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:40,000
that's that's what the math tells us so That's why you know all those again.

568
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:46,000
The election posts right, they usually go down to a precision of 1%.

569
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:57,000
They would like to go down to like point 1% But they just cannot afford it, because that will take like tens of thousands of subjects, or even even more a 100,000 subjects. it's.

570
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:03,000
It's so expensive, right But with with all those subjects. Usually they can go down to a precision at once to 2%.

571
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:09,000
So that's a that's good enough

572
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:12,000
And final, like a final slice. Just show the formula right?

573
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:17,000
Because the standard deviation of X Bar is the standard deviation of X, divided by squared over N.

574
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:27,000
We plug in a formula for standard division X, which is here, and you can move in that's the polynomial for the standard So the standard deviation of the sample mean we have a name again the standard

575
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:33,000
arrow the mean, or has em right? So these are different from So basically, S.

576
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:37,000
X bar is not the same as Sx. Sx. is a sample standard division.

577
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Sx Bar is the standard error of the sample

578
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:49,000
That's What happened? Okay, because they are they're they're They're standard division to do with different distribution.

579
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:53,000
This is the population distribution, and this is the sampling distribution.

580
01:22:53,000 --> 01:23:11,000
I will come back to them later on right So again for those who are familiar with Math Piovas. understand this, although you know this course do not really require you to fully understand or memorize this or access that doesn't require math

581
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:20,000
directation, but it will helpful if you can follow but for the rest, you know it's totally fine. If you just want to ignore the map, and that's kind of you know fundamental concepts.

582
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:30,000
It doesn't really have an impact on how you how you probably learn the concepts and know how to do that don't exercise that's all for the lecture.

583
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Any question before we move on to the exercise. I I have a question.

584
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Does this mean that the standard error of the mean is somehow measure of the sampling variability?

585
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:47,000
Okay, Okay, the sample of our ability of the mean right?

586
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:52,000
But when we talk about variability we usually talk about a on a scale variance.

587
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:55,000
In that case it will be the square of this time ever the mean.

588
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:59,000
But nevertheless they are, as you see, they are highly related.

589
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:03,000
So sometimes we use the sample of our ability a little loosely bye.

590
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:13,000
But you know, rigorous speaking, something. Vulnerability is the square of the standard error

591
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Okay, if there's no more question i'll move on to a to a project.

592
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:27,000
So just like yesterday we have 2 projects and this time is 4 B gonna be submitted.

593
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:33,000
But we'll do both we'll do 4 v first and 4, 80 for a time, and then there's also a post-lack request.

594
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Please send me that tomorrow. so both probably and the quiz is still tomorrow morning.

595
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:46,000
So yeah, right now, we're running while after a day that's why we have one quiz and the one project a day or later on.

596
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Sometimes we have one lecture for 2 days so you don't really have a quiz every day, or you know submission every day.

597
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Oh, you have more material to to absorb it's the balance.

598
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:05,000
So let's start with 4 b because that's the one going to be submitted

599
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:11,000
Are we open that

600
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:19,000
Great

601
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:39,000
I think you can see it now. So 4 B is to do with a manuscript of Rohabi Rock Bar at all is providing on the on the page here, which is how long this manuscript right

602
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:43,000
here. it's about the loaded pentagon harrying among us adults.

603
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Again. You don't have to read the whole paper but read the corresponding part that is asking to leave.

604
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:56,000
So there are questions about methods about figure one about table one and table 2 right?

605
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
That's just going into breakout rooms again.

606
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:04,000
25Â min and do it together and come back just like before I I did some research yesterday.

607
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:09,000
Seems like, you know, my hope of fixing up breakout room every day.

608
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:13,000
Just do not work, because you know Zoom only remembers you.

609
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:22,000
If you log in use your how many of you do not log in use account for some reason, so it remembers some of you, but not all of you.

610
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:26,000
So just have to, you know, for those who always log in with account.

611
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:30,000
You. You will get your room always every week, and next week I will try new ones.

612
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:34,000
But for the rest, I cannot remember so just randomly as I have 2 different rooms.

613
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:41,000
I I apologize for that. But you know there's just no way I can get around this zoom do not basically Zoom Do not remember you by your name.

614
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Zoom remarkable account. I don't know somehow some of you do not. And the zoom doesn't record on account all the guys.

615
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Hopefully, you can still have fun no different default each day, so we still have 5 rooms.

616
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:05,000
I'll send you there any questions before I send you to the rooms

617
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Okay.

618
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:44,000
Dr. sharing alright. Hi, this is trixie Coleman.

619
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:50,000
I didn't get assigned into a group today i'm normally in group 5 every day.

620
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:56,000
Hi: Yeah, I think I sent you to Room 5, could you?

621
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:01,000
Yeah. Could you go to the Hello? Your zoom there?

622
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:05,000
So should be yeah, Link, to break how long you're already assigned there.

623
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:10,000
I'll send you. No, I cannot send you again you are you assigned to Group 5.

624
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:16,000
And you're not yeah I haven't seen anyone I don't know how to get in.

625
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Yeah, if you go to, you know the top of the window.

626
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:28,000
There are some more, and then there's Okay, see that?

627
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:33,000
I don't see breakout rooms is it under meeting settings.

628
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:38,000
No, not a setting, I think not I it's hard for me to see your screen after, even if you share.

629
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Let's see but for for the participants it's, but usually at the bottom, the bottom bar bottom bar.

630
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:53,000
Yeah, there is a breakout room on the bar if it's not there.

631
01:30:53,000 --> 01:31:00,000
There's a 3 dots 20 more which should be could be there, Basically, there's a button called the breakout room once.

632
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:20,000
You click that hmm might be up I don't see that, and i'll send you directly

633
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Oh, I see it join breakout room I that's it

634
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:28,000
We were saying a lot of things were I don't know how to do anything.

635
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:58,000
But there's a little like where but results discussion that actually points out the or even again.

636
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:26,000
Okay, hello, welcome back. So now let's go over the questions. I hope you had a chance to work on most of them.

637
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:32,000
If not all. Question number one is about the map of this.

638
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:38,000
Discuss the sound bowling of how how the sample will collect it under my 3 areas of potential bias.

639
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:54,000
So i'd like to half the rooms you know each room Probably talk about one bias and maybe start from room one

640
01:53:54,000 --> 01:54:11,000
Yeah. So for room one, we talked about a number of different biases, one being the fact that we they were obtaining their data from like just a very specific organizations overall data set as opposed to kind of a national

641
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:19,000
distributions. So the people in that specific subset were nationally like derived.

642
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:26,000
But I don't know how the survey chose the people that they chose initially.

643
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:32,000
Thank you. Yeah, that's what i'm talking about right in in, in in principle. right?

644
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:39,000
I've been thinking about the population interest raw random sample it's very simple, but in reality is actually much much more complicated. Right?

645
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:44,000
How do you really reach out to the population in an equal likely way to everybody?

646
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:50,000
Is actually not hard to recall. So here that you some survey, you know the star right definitely.

647
01:54:50,000 --> 01:55:01,000
You know those organizations definitely do not cover everybody in the population, we'll probably cover a a big amount. And for you know, for cost wise, maybe not safe from all the costs.

648
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
But yeah, you have to think about. How do you really reach out?

649
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:06,000
And you can easily define the population by reaching all this car.

650
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:11,000
Thank you. And group 2. Do you have any other

651
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:16,000
You know, potential bias that you you identify. We do just 1Â min. Sorry.

652
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:31,000
I just wanna mention that, like for God anything related to us it's very, very hard to get information just because of current legislation.

653
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:42,000
So like, even if, like, this survey is not like the best one, they could still give steps information regarding this.

654
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:51,000
This caring I was gonna say I like bring up attention a little bit.

655
01:55:51,000 --> 01:56:02,000
And addition to the being younger respondents, or or just having a not perfect sample.

656
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:07,000
I wanted to say that the surveys were sent only by email.

657
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:18,000
So this is leaving out people who potentially don't have access to emails, or they're not as like computer savvy

658
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:28,000
Also, in addition to what was said, they were younger, female, unmarried lists, educated and living and metropolitan areas, and for disease

659
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:39,000
Other people who may not have this characteristics. Yeah. Yeah.

660
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:44,000
I told her. You agree. Thank you. I mean I I I see several things.

661
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:47,000
You know, being mentioned here right? So how do you reach out?

662
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:53,000
The population is, is a hard issue. you you could run, you know.

663
01:56:53,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Things like send males to every single household or make phone calls to to register phones.

664
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:07,000
But that that'll be a waste right because you're talking, targeting a small population here, and using this sort of a national register or organization.

665
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:12,000
It is help you save cost. but you know if there's a bias field in here.

666
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:23,000
And using email definitely introduced bias. But whatever you use, right, you use phone calls, land, phone self phones.

667
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:33,000
Whatever you use there will be bias, there that's Why, you know all this, even run the run running a pope. It will be hard, because if you use the landline, probably it will reach you over their population that that cell.

668
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:36,000
Phone right email way, you've been reaching younger population and you use a Facebook.

669
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:45,000
It's you know, Twitter it's even younger right So whatever means you use, there is a bias building due to the user of that population.

670
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:52,000
Yeah, and the full focus for gun ownership. Right? you. You could use the the National registry or police, you know, registry.

671
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:55,000
But first of all, those are not complete either right? So many of the download are not ready to start.

672
01:57:55,000 --> 01:58:01,000
So I you know, Basically, it's easy to say or once you really start conducting a study.

673
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:05,000
You people There's a lot of that difficulties so group 3.

674
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:13,000
Do you have any other vice to to add, on having

675
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:19,000
Yes, I can answer that. we thought that different areas in the U.S.A.

676
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:25,000
Were not specified in this study, but different out areas may have different answers to the credit.

677
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:30,000
This plan, so it might have might be a limitation as well.

678
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:36,000
Yeah, Regional: Yeah. cool. So yeah, I just wanted everybody to have a chance to talk.

679
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:47,000
So group 4 or 5, anything to add or

680
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:53,000
Well, anyone from any group. So yeah, if you notice they they have a table sort of showing, you know.

681
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:59,000
So for any survey. there's a chance people don't reply.

682
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:07,000
Don't reply They have a response. rate of 55% honest. And it's pretty high Now, this model survey actually don't have 50% response rate.

683
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:12,000
And if you think about people who respond or not respond okay it's not random right?

684
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:20,000
For example, if you you know this here I think they give some incentive to respond.

685
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:23,000
So usually, I think nowadays we all got many emails about surveys right.

686
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:27,000
Some. Sometimes they have a incentive saying, Oh, you have a chance to, you know.

687
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:31,000
Drawing some Amazon gate cars, things like those right.

688
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:37,000
So I have to say, you know, when I when I like back to 15 years ago, I was like a steel, and i'm honey time.

689
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:44,000
I respond to many survey later on I was easier. So I respond to survey when they there are so sort of an instant there.

690
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:48,000
But now this i'm so busy that you know I got actually a lot more survey.

691
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:55,000
I don't know whether it's just because me getting more exposure, or because, you know, just there are more survey running nowadays.

692
01:59:55,000 --> 02:00:00,000
I got almost a 30 every day. Things like those I just literally have no time to respond, so no matter whether they're inside even now, right?

693
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:06,000
So I only respond to those which I think you know the topic of their service of my home.

694
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:11,000
Personal interest. So I think you know, depending on age, your your you know your your the job.

695
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:22,000
The kind of job you know how easy you are and you know by the way, Particularly incentive make, you know, is it's a big incentive to you personally, so you can think about the kind of people who will respond to survey will

696
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:33,000
have a personal, specific characteristic, And that's also a bias so so basically, I just want to say there are tons of bias. But it's not so simple to this study to anything right?

697
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:36,000
You have only tried to reduce the device, but you can never fully be limited.

698
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:44,000
Now, right? So a simple, random sample is is easy to say it's almost a model. Impossible!

699
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:47,000
Again. So the best way to do Actually, if you look look, look at the paper carefully.

700
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:53,000
They actually do a to do a weighted analysis in the size that they look at the people in their.

701
02:00:53,000 --> 02:01:00,000
You know Survey, and also people who reply, trying to see what kind of people reply.

702
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:13,000
And then they turned out into a weight, in their analysis they do not really treat everybody equally for people who tend to reply with a hot They'll have a lower way, or people who tend not to reply will have a highway so that's one

703
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:17,000
way to adjust for the potential mind. Right? So you you you!

704
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:26,000
You. you take a survey some polling course. involved statistics. they'll teach you a different kind of soundpointing on different way of, you know, correcting for bias.

705
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:32,000
So if the real world, you know, a sampling and analysis is much more complicated than a single random sample.

706
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:35,000
And then same whole analysis I would talk about in this course.

707
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:48,000
Okay, just so, you know, there there are complications in in reality any questions so far

708
02:01:48,000 --> 02:02:01,000
Alright, so that's that right we still have to conduct studies. So the best is that to try to reduce bias in sampling and try to be aware, and the correct bias in analysis is needed. right.

709
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:09,000
Those are much better than just now you'd be run the survey and thinking you're getting a so that's the take home message.

710
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:14,000
I think it's not surprising right in the past 2 Presidential election.

711
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:19,000
It turns out most of the poll running by the different, you know. news.

712
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:25,000
They are off some offline like one or 2% some of them even more right. So they're trying to do a good job.

713
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:29,000
You just so hard to get on my sample nowadays.

714
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:34,000
You think about. you can, You know, you can do everything Internet email phone call everything.

715
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:40,000
But in the end people who don't reply and they have a poweristic it's not like a people randomly do.

716
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:46,000
Some people do not require more like not other people and that's very hard to correct you.

717
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:59,000
You are basically trying to correct the unknown. Okay, now, going back, explain the information is provided in a bigger one. Let's go.

718
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:21,000
Take a look at Speaker One so maybe Group 4 Your turn anyway, in Group 4 trying to say what you read from a bigger one

719
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:29,000
I think that the So the y-axis is showing a percentage of people who carried a gun each of those number of days.

720
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:39,000
So like the very first dot to the left, I think, is showing that between 5 and 10%, maybe 7 and a half percent of people.

721
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:51,000
K. carried a gun between like one, and 2 days and and then there's a 95% confidence interval that goes somewhere between 5% and 10% of people.

722
02:03:51,000 --> 02:04:03,000
Yeah, any any other things go add from other groups

723
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
So I i'm explain a little i'm you're absolutely right.

724
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:09,000
Right it access. I think it's pretty clear the number of days carrying about 30 days.

725
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:14,000
I think this come from one question. They have a question there in the hand, right?

726
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:20,000
So this come from A. You know past 30 days. How many days have you carried a hold of? done this? come from this, you know.

727
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
Answer to this question. I think they give a number from 0 to 30.

728
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:30,000
Right So that's how they compile the data So the y access are the number of weighted proportion.

729
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:38,000
So it's waited, because again the survey is biased. So that's why the way the answers right not simply count.

730
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:49,000
So there are many, many interesting things personally they give a confidence interval. and if you know this, that the family level is narrow, if the if the percentage higher is why they're we'll talk about why huh?

731
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:55,000
You know later, black traveling, trying to learn how to build competitive vote for percentages. right?

732
02:04:55,000 --> 02:05:01,000
So that's that's expected and second things that the y access is on the log scale.

733
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:04,000
They don't have to I would Think about if they don't put it on the log scale.

734
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:13,000
This thing is like 30%. All of these are below 1% right. If they don't put a moscow, this number will overwhelm everything else.

735
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:18,000
You can now even see the difference among this lower percentage is anymore right?

736
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:21,000
Actually, you can see many things, all of it. So pause.

737
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:31,000
The answer should be a number between 0 and 30, right and But yeah, you see, this very sort of a strange power.

738
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:38,000
Yeah, you can imagine how this happens right If you were asked to answer this kind of a box type in 0 to 30, right?

739
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:42,000
So you do your kind of person carry every day of course you put 30 easy.

740
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:46,000
That's why there's 30 so high thank you kind of person put a 0.

741
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:54,000
I don't Think there's 0 right but if you're kind of personal, who carried like 5 to 10 days a week, or 10 to 20 days a week.

742
02:05:54,000 --> 02:06:03,000
Personally, I will not remember How many exactly. days. I I carry right I wouldn't remember 13 for the 14. so I would simply put 0 5, 1015.5, right.

743
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:09,000
That's why you'll see this 5 1015 2025 months so high?

744
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:22,000
Because people just round up and also if you look at there's not given a number at this is 10 right so there's no number at 11, no number of 1213, no number at 1314.

745
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:27,000
So people think only for the 1012, 15. This is probably 18 and 20. right?

746
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:36,000
So this this is called the recall. bias we'll have a data you got don't believe it is perfectly true, because some people don't remember right.

747
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:49,000
So I believe that the the real date people carry probably have a smooth curve than this motor curve. but somehow you only got data points at 1012, 1580 in the 20. because people don't remember other numbers.

748
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:55,000
So when you analyze it, keep that in mind don't just pick without a data, you clack that's the truth right?

749
02:06:55,000 --> 02:07:00,000
There's a recall bias any comments so far this question.

750
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:15,000
So. So with this. Might that question have been better worded as putting them into buckets like giving people the option of you know, saying, you know one to 3 days, or you know 5 to 7 days or or something that's more I guess

751
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:18,000
reasonable right, because I don't remember if I carried for one week versus 2 weeks.

752
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:24,000
But like you said I don't know if i'm gonna remember from 7 to 8 days, So might have been better if they had done that.

753
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:29,000
That's my first question. My side question is Why are there confidence intervals.

754
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:34,000
Are the people being counted more than once, like our individual respondents being counted more than once.

755
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:39,000
Okay, good questions. I'll ask you a first you know first question First, you're absolutely right, Right?

756
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:42,000
I mean most of the survey. They they they brackets, right, you know. Answer.

757
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:48,000
But they could also bracket later afterwards. Right? I mean, before they analyze the day that they can.

758
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:51,000
This is the continuous data, but they can put them in as well. Right?

759
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:55,000
So you You can do that later on as well. I think that will smooth all the little things right.

760
02:07:55,000 --> 02:08:03,000
Second question is that why are there a combination? of the common interval is not about the number, because the number they're not really showing the number here.

761
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:06,000
The number is not, it's just a estimate from the data.

762
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:11,000
These? Are they trying to ask them the population sort of the percentage, not the sample.

763
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:22,000
When you ask me the population percentage using the number from the sample, you have a certain that's why they are common in the most, and this is not even the the person that they got from the data because they waited.

764
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:30,000
Right. So this is the way they estimate it's not really the data you can call the statistic by it's actually a estimate of the number in the population.

765
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:40,000
That's Why, they have common number. Okay, So so when you'll see a company involved in a figure, right? they could say some homeime plus minus sample standard deviation.

766
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:52,000
Those are number, you observe, or you're calculating right but if they say you know some whom you plus minus 10 arrow, that there, after the sample is not really just assembled, me it's the estimate for the population I

767
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:55,000
mean, plus my minus the standard error for that animation. right?

768
02:08:55,000 --> 02:09:01,000
So really depend on how you how you pull that I think here that there they're actually putting the commonly level.

769
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:07,000
You can say these are just come from the standard hero, from the happy name

770
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:13,000
So sometimes people don't distinguish whether you're putting, just put in the data or put it on update right?

771
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
But the data is estimated for the population quantity.

772
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:19,000
So all the confident, you know. actually they are common in them for the Fdm.

773
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:23,000
Not the common number of the data? I hope that answer a question.

774
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:35,000
Yes, so did thank you. Welcome any other comments regarding these speaker

775
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:43,000
So the next question right for each starting a bigger one i'll make a reasonable gas, because they don't provide the exact value.

776
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:46,000
Right has been a medium number of days. Karen.

777
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:51,000
So on the path third day. So so what's going on is that

778
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:56,000
If you look at it right, there are maybe 7% carried.

779
02:09:56,000 --> 02:10:02,000
Monday. 8% here today, and so on. So for 40, 30% carried 30 days. right?

780
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:10,000
If I ask you the medium number of days people carry what would be your gas?

781
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:24,000
How many days? Maybe group 5,

782
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:29,000
We said, 2022, 22. Yeah. could you?

783
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:39,000
Briefly, tell us how you've got that number So So we originally bought the confidence intervals where

784
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:59,000
The amount of people like that set it per day. So we set 20 to 22, because they have the largest confidence intervals, but also the 4 already the 30 day one. was also probably gonna oh, would it pull it cause that's

785
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:06,000
me. yeah, maybe it's a little bit lower than 20 to 22.

786
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:09,000
Yeah, Thank you. Yeah, I mean, this is I would look at it.

787
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:15,000
I mean, basically, you want to. You want to find a day where 50% people carry less than that date and 50% carry more.

788
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:21,000
If you do it from the right hand side is a little hard, because I cannot even read whether this is 30 or 40, right?

789
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:24,000
It's just so close to there. so I would try to do from left.

790
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:27,000
And side. say this, I say, this is 7. this is 8 or 9.

791
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:34,000
I keep adding, and do I got like a 50 right so it's probably somewhere here.

792
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:46,000
I will say what is it hard because it's hard to read the numbers right? But if you do from the right hand side, it really give you a lot of uncertainty, because I don't even know whether this number 30 or 40 that's a

793
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:53,000
big link, right? So you know, log scale give you some benefits, but also give you some all problems, right?

794
02:11:53,000 --> 02:12:01,000
It's hard to read on the logo but the question was about the number of days carried, not sort of the way.

795
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:10,000
They proportion. So what I did was just counted, the number of dots left to right, being 24 dots right, and then went to

796
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:18,000
Dots 12 and 13, and took that number which I thought was around 60.

797
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:22,000
Yeah, I mean, I I think the idea is around 15 to 20 or something where that's all.

798
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:27,000
Both of your hands are probably lying there. I don't know the exact amount of the number.

799
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:36,000
But the question here is asking, I mean, the question is asking, the media number of days carried in the past 30 days of those will carry it by on.

800
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
So in principle, if you have the raw data, right?

801
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:41,000
So the survey. maybe you have, you know, 10,000 people.

802
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:49,000
Each one has a number. You got those 10,000 numbers you'll you'll find the media right in principle.

803
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,000
You can find on media using the raw they've append all the numbers.

804
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:53,000
But we don't have the rod at all we have this summary.

805
02:12:53,000 --> 02:13:02,000
That's why we do the accumulation But Indiana I think it's probably 15 to 20 somewhere. here.

806
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:12,000
Okay, Any other question. Comments.

807
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:18,000
Okay, the next one. So suppose we don't get a meeting Now we got a meeting right again.

808
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:25,000
If we have the raw data of 10,000 numbers we can easily get a mean. Now we don't have it just from the figure.

809
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:30,000
Suppose we all will, captain the mean? and the the question is that do you think the mean will be larger than the meeting?

810
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:37,000
Or still another meeting from this speaker

811
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:48,000
Based on I was gonna say I was gonna say based on the data, especially because you have, I guess, like outliers or like higher numbers.

812
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:53,000
It would probably mean that the mean is gonna be higher than the median.

813
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:55,000
Okay cause like that, like 30 day one where you see such a like a higher number.

814
02:13:55,000 --> 02:14:01,000
That's been a pull. it towards the right company what the medium most likely is so.

815
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:16,000
I think the mean will be higher than a median. Yes, Anybody has different ideas

816
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:21,000
Okay, yeah, it could be. I mean this: This number is so big, right?

817
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:31,000
But obviously I don't know cause this is not really a typical situation where we have a long tail to the right right.

818
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:36,000
This, this: This is capped at 30, so we have a basically the distribution.

819
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:41,000
How do I draw it? I will have to use my

820
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:54,000
Hi, pat give me a second

821
02:14:54,000 --> 02:15:05,000
I thought that since the number of like the weighted proportion of people telling guns, less number of like current gun spoilers number of days like less content is more so.

822
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:10,000
Maybe it's

823
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:17,000
Yeah, yeah, this whole thing convertible. His program ritual look like, you know, this is log scale, right?

824
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:26,000
So if you have a pistol grant on the original scale, because the locks goes really hard to see on the regional scale, this is 0.

825
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:36,000
This is 30, right? You have something like, you know, star from like a 10 or something, and then go deeper and fever. and then finally, you have a high spike here.

826
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:49,000
Right. Oh, I wouldn't call you the rice field because it's not a typical rice view or that skill, but this whole spike at 30 will have a we'll play a role in in dragging you to the right side a little bit

827
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:54,000
right, so I I think the mean might be a little bigger than a medium, but because it's not a typical case of a humanist.

828
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:57,000
I don't know for sure you know I don't have to have the data to compute. it.

829
02:15:57,000 --> 02:16:06,000
Right. You have the number. you can computer any other comments.

830
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:10,000
Yeah, just very hard. You see, the log scale is is good, right?

831
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:26,000
Condensing the information but it's also hard to we've got a sign on how I would rather either get a law data or kind of original scale that makes sense

832
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:33,000
Next one. let's now go to a table one among adult gun owners.

833
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:45,000
Yeah, i'm sorry it's about time for a break. Let's finish this one. and then have a great. So for adult and owners, what characteristics appear to be more common in those who carry guys where the do not?

834
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:49,000
So that's payable one, hey? Well, why is cute let me make this smaller.

835
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:57,000
So maybe now you know, every group has went over. I just want people to come up talk about. So you certainly want to look at.

836
02:16:57,000 --> 02:17:05,000
They? They collect all this data in the survey. right you want to look at those characteristics where there's a striking difference between who carry a knock.

837
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:13,000
Harry, anyone identify any property.

838
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:23,000
More males than females yeah let's look at here for gender right male female is 65, or the 35.

839
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:36,000
I mean not carry, but no ae to planning wasn't carry. there is a difference. and if you look at your confidence interval right so, for Mao is 68 62 to 68 in the lock harry

840
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:43,000
group 72 to 83 in the carry group there's 2 companies will do not overlap, which means the deference between the full group is significant.

841
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:53,000
Roughly means that that's cool yeah, any other characteristics No, his sonic light. Yeah.

842
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:56,000
So So yeah, by the way, I wanna take back a little bit.

843
02:17:56,000 --> 02:18:00,000
We are now trying to compare mail versus female, because the male apparently carrying more.

844
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:08,000
We are trying to come. Compare, You know, the interaction between the characteristic and the 2 group right here, even just for mail.

845
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:15,000
Oh, you know. there's a lot more male you know Carry the group.

846
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:18,000
So we want to compare, you know. Probably 2 columns, not a P.

847
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:23,000
2 May on a female. Okay, yeah. Sorry you were talking about. Why, why not?

848
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:27,000
Hispanic wide. But then that won't be valid right?

849
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:33,000
Because the current group is, and the non average group in manuscript.

850
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:39,000
No, he's finding Why, you see here is 78, this is 77.

851
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:43,000
They actually overlap. So I I would really say there's a big change.

852
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:56,000
Yeah. I was. I was comparing between, like like between the races, not Hispanic

853
02:18:56,000 --> 02:19:15,000
Any other finding. Yeah, the known who carried downtown to have tend to have the up the fair tap on the they tend to have hand count and long gong more than the man who Then the people who

854
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:24,000
did not carry of the arms and the at the 24 person say I didn't overlap Yeah, that's full count on this one.

855
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:27,000
Yeah, you're right you'll see that people who have a hand on.

856
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:34,000
Only tend not to carry, I mean relatively, than the people who have like along those as well.

857
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:41,000
I guess when people have more than one guns they're more like a gun you know lava right?

858
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:46,000
So they tend repairing more. Yeah, thank you any let's find a problem.

859
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:56,000
More. Anyone you're gonna take turn we have chat Yeah, I was going to save the same thing their political identification.

860
02:19:56,000 --> 02:20:09,000
It's librarial or conservative yeah it is not, is Oh, yeah, here, yeah, conservative.

861
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:14,000
Carry more and Liberal cabinet carry last right.

862
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:20,000
Mother is like in the middle, Cool? Yeah, I mean this this things you you would imagine, even expect right before you would have the data.

863
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:33,000
So sometimes it's very helpful. to have a hypothesis, or even expectation, before you plug the data, and you still collect the data on those to verify right? So which means they are your data quality is high So there

864
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:40,000
were someone else who, talking about another one

865
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:53,000
Whether you've been threatened by a handgun in the last 5 years in the last 5 years, and not to carry right.

866
02:20:53,000 --> 02:21:04,000
No recent buyer actually tend to carry. Yeah, we some buyer tend to carry

867
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:08,000
Alright, I think, Yeah, I think. No, there. There are many interesting characteristics.

868
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:16,000
Right. for example, younger people tend to carry right. Older people tend not to carry.

869
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:28,000
And education level doesn't seem to play a role. but income level doesn't seem to play a role.

870
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:33,000
Yeah, you can look at every single one that you'll make a decision.

871
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:39,000
Okay, cool, finally, cause I really want to take a break based on the information.

872
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:44,000
Probably the people, too. do you think the state can see you carry long you know I'm sorry I think that we should take a break.

873
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:48,000
Now let's continue this after the break okay let's come back in 10Â min.

874
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:55,000
I'm sorry for Friday night. this probably take take a few more minutes than I needed.

875
02:21:55,000 --> 02:22:25,000
Yeah, let's take a break

876
02:31:57,000 --> 02:32:07,000
Okay, let's continue. So the very last question Mike might take some kind of time and stuff that's why I want to do it after the break. So that will be 9 rush.

877
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:14,000
So based on your information providing table 2. Do you think the State can see you carry law or effective policy, provide evidence?

878
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:21,000
I think the key part is provided evidence you could have you know either a conclusion I'd like to see your argument.

879
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:28,000
So Table 2 is here. So you take a lot of time to read.

880
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:37,000
But essentially you know the state some of the States has concealed carry law, and some, you know, have different permits status, right?

881
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:45,000
So they break it down by by space. and these are all stays on restrictive days, and shall issue no discretion.

882
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:49,000
Shall, you should limited expression, and they so different kind of states right?

883
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:53,000
And then they see whether the distribution are different.

884
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:58,000
It does so Remember, there there's a huge bias in terms of sample, and so on, and so forth.

885
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:07,000
Nevertheless, that's. the you know the numbers actually they vary right to see the percent of conceal carry or made holder is definitely a different tool.

886
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:15,000
So the question is how whether you think having different kind of law, we'll have a human app and which direction we have

887
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:18,000
Anyone want to start. I mean this gonna be a discussion.

888
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:31,000
So feel free to to jump in and talk about what's your thing

889
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:35,000
Well, I can just give my observations that I see from the data.

890
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:46,000
So when I initially look at it you would think that the conceal carry laws are working, because, you see the States all those different States.

891
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:53,000
They have 40, you know, between 40 and 50% of people that are carrying in those permits in the game.

892
02:33:53,000 --> 02:34:01,000
When you look at those, conf but when I look at the conference intervals, they're pretty like 54% 54, 52.

893
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:08,000
So i'm not sure how significant that data is thanks you think it's working.

894
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:18,000
Because in I see. So really, this is talking about concealed carrot or me holder, and not holder. right?

895
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:24,000
So these are people who have the permit, and they carry these other people who do not have the permission they carry right

896
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:30,000
So you see that? Yeah, I guess if you look at the people who do not have the perme.

897
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:44,000
They carry. they're definitely much lower. in. those you know restrictive States versus those numbers and Similarly, for the people who have to permit. Well, I would say, this is a much more involvement story.

898
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:48,000
I mean, i'll tell I will say what I think later on. but now I want to hear about what you think so.

899
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:55,000
Any other comments. Yeah. So for me, the caveat to all of this is the fact that people are self reporting right?

900
02:34:55,000 --> 02:35:08,000
Nobody's verified whether they have they have permits or don't have permits. one and 2 you got a subset of people who are saying I have I have a gun, but I don't have a permit right I mean they

901
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:15,000
basically incriminating themselves. So I think I think a greater percentage of people are more likely to have a gun and not report.

902
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:23,000
But I don't have a permit yeah it's it's hard to tell what what the actual truth is in these numbers.

903
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:31,000
Yeah, I I that's exactly what i'm trying to say, yeah, I totally agree, although this is a survey supposed to be an ominous for research.

904
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:37,000
Only but if I were those people right I don't have a permit i'm carrying against the law.

905
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:41,000
I i'm i'm i'll be hard that you're telling the truth, even in a survey like this.

906
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:46,000
So this number are probably underreported. right Why, are how high they are in all of you.

907
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:51,000
I don't know about you have to think about like they they could be on the report.

908
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:57,000
Any other comments

909
02:35:57,000 --> 02:36:07,000
I think it's interesting that even though this is self reported the concealed carry permit non holders are greater.

910
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:13,000
Then concealed. carry permit holders because there's 933 of them who don't carry it permanent.

911
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:25,000
507 that do. you are talking about the here right Yeah, I'm actually very interested about this number in this case.

912
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:30,000
There are totally unrestricted right so you don't need a permit to carry.

913
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:35,000
If i'm understanding crappy nevertheless most people, Gary, you know.

914
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:41,000
Oh, this, this, this, this are different numbers. I I think.

915
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:54,000
So this number, you see that they do not add up to 100%, you know, says that this is not a person people who carried that had it for me. This is not a pep presented people who had it for me that carries I I guess

916
02:36:54,000 --> 02:37:01,000
that makes sense. Because if you have a if you have a permit, then the reason you've got a permit is that you want to carry right.

917
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:06,000
Otherwise. why do you bother that? So of course this will be higher than this?

918
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:15,000
But I I just don't understand in those other tricky States. Why do they even need to gather from me in the first place, I mean, I don't really i'm not that familiar with that.

919
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:20,000
Let's do it. what? Why, bother applying for the permission?

920
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:26,000
That's my question I mean there are 500 of them right

921
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:33,000
Hi! suspect this is a much smaller number. So, although so, this is 500 probably cover everybody.

922
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:39,000
So this group probably has a very small number, therefore, the percentage is not accurate.

923
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:40,000
It's, you know confidence intervals much wider than the rest.

924
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:51,000
So this 40 maybe 4 out of 10 people that's what i'm, saying, Well, that's why it's 40%, but only there are very few people there cause I I don't want to start why you need a type of permit you know state which

925
02:37:51,000 --> 02:38:00,000
is not, you know, requirement

926
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:06,000
Or or this doesn't really mean that the requirement for me just say everybody apply will automatically be given one.

927
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:13,000
So he still need to apply like you know they will automatically give you something like that. I mean, I have no idea how the wall works here.

928
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:27,000
So if i'm on assigning along these I know the common

929
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:34,000
So just to piggyback on the last comment. So if you look at the end, the total, the total number of participants right?

930
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:42,000
There are 14 and 140, the 1,400 4,900 of them, or 930.

931
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:49,000
3 of them do not carry permits. Yeah. but but of that.

932
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:59,000
So of that 9, 33, What? fifth, Only 15% of them live in unrestrected States?

933
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:03,000
No, I think this you know Yeah, it's a little hard to read these numbers.

934
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:06,000
So I think what it means that you know the are right.

935
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:13,000
900, all the 1,400 do not have a permit which is not surprising, because I don't have a permit. you know It's kind of hassle to got it from.

936
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:23,000
Me. but this 15 means that, for some, for those, all of the 900 living in States unrestricted states, 15% of them.

937
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:32,000
I think 15% of them the value 15% of them.

938
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:37,000
Do not sorry and see this is carrying concealed loading.

939
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:57,000
Now. Oh, yeah, 15% of Okay, So I don't know out of 933 there may be 100 people in this State, and the mama 115 of them actually carry without a permit this

940
02:39:57,000 --> 02:40:03,000
is the act of carrying. So all of these are people who carry conceal the load.

941
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:10,000
Economy. Think all of this. People would say, yes. So yeah, the number are not twisted on this time.

942
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:20,000
But that's what I think they they need this is basically 15% people that are honest, right Now, yeah, go ahead the way that I understand kind of the gun caring laws.

943
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:30,000
It's just that some people may go to different states for things like hunting, or for other purposes, and so they may have it concealed to carry.

944
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:40,000
I see permit in their own state, so that but then travel to like, so that they can travel to another State that has a concealed to carry like law.

945
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:42,000
So they may live in an unrestricted state.

946
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:47,000
But being traveling somewhere where it's more restrictive yeah that that that's a good point.

947
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:52,000
It's, just definitely more complicated I I guess i'm I'm, Just not that familiar with what I restricted states me.

948
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:55,000
I'm, for example, Michigan right michigan is open Here is day.

949
02:40:55,000 --> 02:40:59,000
You can carry open without coming, but if you carry, conceal, you need a person.

950
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:03,000
So this answer restrict. It means that you don't need a permit to carry.

951
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:11,000
Conceal. Why is that they they will graduate from it without any? I mean, that's that would be the shell usual state. right?

952
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:15,000
So probably i'm assuming you Don't need a permit to carry Pennsylvania.

953
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:20,000
That's the case. Then these people are really you know these people are really, you know they need a permit a couple of other days.

954
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:23,000
I I think you are right. Yeah. have to read more about this.

955
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:37,000
The law, you know, it's very complicated now yeah about the fact that you know this percentage. they do not add up to 100 horizontally or or vertically. That means they are the percentage in that particular group right?

956
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:40,000
This is 15, all of a 100 people in this group, hey?

957
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:45,000
Karen so that's my understanding

958
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:52,000
Yeah, another. you know the question. If you go back to the question, the question is asking whether those conceal carry law.

959
02:41:52,000 --> 02:42:00,000
Really you fact it being effective, right? and in reducing a number carrying illegal right.

960
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:06,000
First of all, there is a you know report bias that people don't tend to report their their ego activity.

961
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:15,000
But I think there's also a so going back to what we learned. Possibly this is an observational data, you know.

962
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:19,000
Ignoring all the selection buyers recall by, you know, reporting bias.

963
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:28,000
It is observational data. Therefore you cannot say that the law being effective because there could be other implementation.

964
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:32,000
Yeah, you know, in terms of interpretation. point vampa.

965
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:40,000
In those days where there are a lot of people carrying without permit or things like those you can imagine.

966
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:44,000
It'll be harder to pass the law in the first month.

967
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:47,000
Right. So now I think it's chicken causing the ad.

968
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:50,000
But in the end maybe the egg is caught in the chicken.

969
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:58,000
In the first place, right? even if you you see there's a correlation or association between 2 variable You cannot say one is calling the other.

970
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:03,000
You can already say the the law is being exactly because you know, you have to think about the law being path.

971
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:06,000
The black people. The lobby have, in the first place, right?

972
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:10,000
That has something to do with the the behavior people in that state.

973
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:19,000
So if it's more complicated once you draw any you know see many calls or invitation right once you'll see the law.

974
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:27,000
It's being you packed here that's some sort of something like a call, though interpretation which is very powerful, because reality is much more complicated than that.

975
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:44,000
So that's that's my take on this any comments

976
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:53,000
Okay, I think this helps. Now, remember to turning or 4 b you know you don't have to write a lot just playing whatever you have to be sufficient.

977
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:56,000
I'm gonna remind you to do the quiz tomorrow and for the rest of today.

978
02:43:56,000 --> 02:44:17,000
We'll do this for a but you don't have to ride, or turning it just an exercise that's open turn for 8

979
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:26,000
And let me share 4, 8,

980
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:36,000
So for a ask. You suppose the American Public Health Association is offering 1 million dollar to fund the health issue, And you want to write a grant with your group. Right?

981
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:44,000
So is it a group project? So I want you each group to discuss narrow area of research.

982
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:54,000
I basically identify a interesting question. You would like to pull The proposal trying to get a 1 million dollar funding, And you want your to spend the one meeting in one or 2 years right?

983
02:44:54,000 --> 02:45:04,000
It's a lot of money to spend in one or 2 years, and then, basically, i'll write down the population of interest being as specific as possible, Right?

984
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:08,000
And then think about how do you design the sampling?

985
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:15,000
How do you draw a sample? right? caution is that is not as simple as you would imagine.

986
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:20,000
So you have to put down. How do you want to really contact those people of interest?

987
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:23,000
Right. Don't just say I would draw a phone call that's not specific.

988
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:28,000
No. And finally, all you can think about from those subjects in your sample.

989
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:35,000
What kind of a variable you want to imagine right. and also, for example, your study, you know, trying to be specific, right?

990
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:37,000
Do you want to do a prospective or retrospective?

991
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:39,000
You want to do a call call or case control anything right?

992
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:43,000
So basically put down things you you have already learned you know study design.

993
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:47,000
You don't have to really carry out a study but here, you know.

994
02:45:47,000 --> 02:46:00,000
Basically, this class will kind of propose, you want to write so i'm thinking of giving cause, you know we're short on high, giving each group 15Â min to discuss, and then we'll come back and I want to hear about your your

995
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:08,000
proposal any question, or you know, suggestion.

996
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:18,000
If not, I will send you to breakout room for 15Â min

997
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:48,000
Alright. see you in a bit

998
03:01:59,000 --> 03:02:03,000
Okay, and i'll come back I hope I know it's a little that bush.

999
03:02:03,000 --> 03:02:07,000
I hope you had enough time to at least talk about the basics.

1000
03:02:07,000 --> 03:02:13,000
So let's now go over the the room the rooms, and each room.

1001
03:02:13,000 --> 03:02:18,000
You can talk about Hope you know it's group right throughout the course.

1002
03:02:18,000 --> 03:02:21,000
Everybody got a chance to to talk about right so I don't want to. just one person.

1003
03:02:21,000 --> 03:02:48,000
But you know, if you want to talk, of course. so maybe Group one, was your proposal

1004
03:02:48,000 --> 03:03:11,000
I think we were group one I could talk about the project that we decided to go with. So we wanted to look into Covid vaccination rates and vaccine hesitancy within a population was cool So

1005
03:03:11,000 --> 03:03:18,000
Yeah, you you may talk more about how you kind of sample or you know what's the but but in general right usually you have exposure and allcon.

1006
03:03:18,000 --> 03:03:22,000
Right. So vaccine has so vaccine rate is definitely the

1007
03:03:22,000 --> 03:03:32,000
The outcome. So i'm not understanding why you want to study the reason for hesitant or what kind of variable. you're gonna flacking on this awesome home.

1008
03:03:32,000 --> 03:03:37,000
Yeah, we wanted to identify different reasons for hesitancy.

1009
03:03:37,000 --> 03:03:47,000
And then look to have an intervention later on to address, and then to see whether or not the Covid vaccination rates would increase.

1010
03:03:47,000 --> 03:03:59,000
Okay, So that sounds like 2 study to me already. So so for the first one you want to, basically, your study population is the whole whole state.

1011
03:03:59,000 --> 03:04:07,000
Yeah, So I was thinking we could do the state of ohio which we're in right now, just to keep it specific.

1012
03:04:07,000 --> 03:04:17,000
How do you Go ahead! Draw the sample

1013
03:04:17,000 --> 03:04:20,000
Yeah, my I mean anybody can. I was kind of counting my question Is that so?

1014
03:04:20,000 --> 03:04:25,000
You're going to do a Internet survey or you know what kind of a format you're gonna clack data.

1015
03:04:25,000 --> 03:04:32,000
So we were going to do both. We were gonna mail out surveys as well as have an online version.

1016
03:04:32,000 --> 03:04:40,000
We could have an online version as well, so that we could increase the potential number of respondents

1017
03:04:40,000 --> 03:04:50,000
So that will be some kind of a sort of a I I would call it like a call horse study, maybe retrospective, you know, because you're asking whether they have taken or not.

1018
03:04:50,000 --> 03:04:58,000
Right. So yeah, because it just a story probably it doesn't take a lot of money.

1019
03:04:58,000 --> 03:05:05,000
So you're probably thinking of sample size. pretty large like pens of thousands, or at least thousands, is all right.

1020
03:05:05,000 --> 03:05:15,000
Yes, or tens of thousands anything to add on from group one or any question from other groups regarding the group.

1021
03:05:15,000 --> 03:05:22,000
One project.

1022
03:05:22,000 --> 03:05:25,000
Alright, I think our whole goal was to use that first.

1023
03:05:25,000 --> 03:05:36,000
I know we did design 2 studies, but our whole goal was to use the answers for the first one, to then create some sort of intervention to the and boost the the vaccination rates, and we'll study that

1024
03:05:36,000 --> 03:05:45,000
again prospectively let's do it so so you want to figure out the reason that's that's totally I think reasonable and important question.

1025
03:05:45,000 --> 03:05:49,000
But you might have some high quality about what might be the reason. Right?

1026
03:05:49,000 --> 03:05:53,000
So you have to build that in your data. collection so if you don't ask the right question.

1027
03:05:53,000 --> 03:06:03,000
You couldn't really figure out the reason that you have in mind So what kind of reason you think might be there, so that you can design a question to us to to collect information eventually.

1028
03:06:03,000 --> 03:06:10,000
Intervention. So what are the possible reason for hans i'm having mine?

1029
03:06:10,000 --> 03:06:28,000
Some of the ones that we have discussed where one access 2 vaccine and then the other would be fear of side effects more. not enough knowledge in regards to of the vaccine.

1030
03:06:28,000 --> 03:06:35,000
Okay, now, that's that sounds probably reasonable for me So suppose you figure out these are the reasons, right?

1031
03:06:35,000 --> 03:06:39,000
So what kind? What are the positive intervention you might put in to address this?

1032
03:06:39,000 --> 03:06:46,000
I mean that's the second study but you can get another grant yeah.

1033
03:06:46,000 --> 03:06:58,000
So. So one of my things was looking at hesitancy around around the fact that people felt they were healthy, Right? So a lot of people did not get vaccine because they felt they were healthy right so so what

1034
03:06:58,000 --> 03:07:03,000
are the things that we've been doing locally here in Michigan, or where I work is that

1035
03:07:03,000 --> 03:07:10,000
We've been educating people about the hospitalization rates of healthy people when they were infected.

1036
03:07:10,000 --> 03:07:23,000
Right. And so. And then the problem that creates which is that you have decreased inpatient space like I talked about yesterday like I can't see actually sick pages, because my possible is full of healthy people who are sick with

1037
03:07:23,000 --> 03:07:32,000
Covid who project potentially could have been prevented with a vaccination, and then sort of that effect on the population.

1038
03:07:32,000 --> 03:07:40,000
So it would be education. I guess the intervention would be education on the stressed to the system of healthy people getting Covid.

1039
03:07:40,000 --> 03:07:48,000
Yeah, I think that's something that people really don't understand to be honest with you, thank you, Yeah, I I totally agree.

1040
03:07:48,000 --> 03:07:52,000
Alright. Hello, Paul! any any, any comments from anyone on the group?

1041
03:07:52,000 --> 03:08:01,000
One project.

1042
03:08:01,000 --> 03:08:14,000
Okay, Thank you. Group one. And now group 2,

1043
03:08:14,000 --> 03:08:25,000
I think that was up. So we had wanted to focus on open city and high school children across the Us.

1044
03:08:25,000 --> 03:08:41,000
So we were thinking of, you know, kind of evaluating different factors that contribute to this and dividing our Problemup originally to account for socioeconomic senses.

1045
03:08:41,000 --> 03:08:54,000
And then end of sending out a survey similar to the group, one doing a retrospective study with would evaluate like waste a conference tight weight.

1046
03:08:54,000 --> 03:09:10,000
Exercise abbots deciding like what their diets consisted of daily. potentially like what resources were available in their neighborhoods like where there are a lot of fast food restaurants.

1047
03:09:10,000 --> 03:09:20,000
What kind of versus stores and Other things are available like What is the food and security situation?

1048
03:09:20,000 --> 03:09:26,000
Thank you cool. So wow! So I guess it's a national live.

1049
03:09:26,000 --> 03:09:39,000
Are you gonna do run a survey like a volunteer base or you're gonna reach out to cause you talk about high school, and you can actually reach out to different department and education different school that States by they can reach out to schools right i'll

1050
03:09:39,000 --> 03:09:46,000
go up top down approach rather than going on that he turned out and calling people sending males. Because I think running on National Survey is not easy.

1051
03:09:46,000 --> 03:09:49,000
Okay, So have you? I mean, anyone from your group can answer.

1052
03:09:49,000 --> 03:09:58,000
But have you talked about? Think about the software and design, And you know, just take the book of making it happen

1053
03:09:58,000 --> 03:10:02,000
Yeah. So we thought we talked about a few different study approaches.

1054
03:10:02,000 --> 03:10:07,000
And and we went with the one that was the cheaper one.

1055
03:10:07,000 --> 03:10:20,000
The survey, but ideally it will be better for us to go ahead and go to the schools. So we know that's gonna be a little bit more logistics, just so that we could increase the number of people that we would have But we

1056
03:10:20,000 --> 03:10:28,000
also talked about like doing taste, control, study, to to see the prevalence of it.

1057
03:10:28,000 --> 03:10:33,000
And then the one that I really wanted to do was to do an intervention.

1058
03:10:33,000 --> 03:10:48,000
At least across a couple of high schools, to see how we could lower obesity, and thus preventing other conditions in the future.

1059
03:10:48,000 --> 03:10:51,000
Cool that's that sounds very interesting. So you actually mentioned 2 potential other study.

1060
03:10:51,000 --> 03:10:55,000
Wise case control. So I suppose here. But the case are obese.

1061
03:10:55,000 --> 03:11:00,000
High school kids and the control are non-obes in the regular case, right?

1062
03:11:00,000 --> 03:11:04,000
So the benefit of you know you don't need a very big sample size.

1063
03:11:04,000 --> 03:11:11,000
Now you can actually have a much smaller sample size that's cool, and the second one is intervention intervention.

1064
03:11:11,000 --> 03:11:22,000
Yeah, So it's a little bit tricky because no matter what you do, you cannot really do a randomized control trial here.

1065
03:11:22,000 --> 03:11:48,000
I guess, because there's no plus table right right of a like a convenient sample, like just intervention of C, who we can get to the the needs and would be also because 2 was mentioned in lake the logistic the

1066
03:11:48,000 --> 03:12:00,000
logistics of it like if we do an intervention we have to consider like, like the visibility of a like after school hours or school hours, P.

1067
03:12:00,000 --> 03:12:13,000
Hours, or like any other night. ask if students, you know they have other things going around like different now, and parents and and things like that.

1068
03:12:13,000 --> 03:12:17,000
Yeah, I mean I i'm thinking I think that's that's probably reasonable.

1069
03:12:17,000 --> 03:12:22,000
I'm thinking like, if you do in the if you do it on the individual scale. right?

1070
03:12:22,000 --> 03:12:31,000
That will be hard, because, you cannot force people to take intervention right if you let them up in.

1071
03:12:31,000 --> 03:12:36,000
Then there's a bias field in because people who opt in for a program like this already are motivated.

1072
03:12:36,000 --> 03:12:48,000
Why, it's likely to. have an in fact right so that that's confounding on the other hand. If you do an intervention on the school level. so you'll pick 10 schools you give intervention to pick randomly take another pen school as a

1073
03:12:48,000 --> 03:12:52,000
control. So everybody in the school got the same intervention. That case.

1074
03:12:52,000 --> 03:12:59,000
I think you somehow. you know, somehow a draft the compounding issue at the individual level that's just my pay.

1075
03:12:59,000 --> 03:13:05,000
Yeah. yeah. So so ideally that the if we went with the intervention that would be the approach that we would like to take.

1076
03:13:05,000 --> 03:13:31,000
But yeah, it's exactly what you said thank you any other comment from group 2, or you know, question from other groups for for group 2 project

1077
03:13:31,000 --> 03:13:35,000
Thank you group, too. very, very nice job. so that's now move on to group 3. Yeah.

1078
03:13:35,000 --> 03:13:46,000
I mean each group. You can have one on one people talking I mean I don't mind the more people talking about who 3

1079
03:13:46,000 --> 03:13:52,000
Yes, I can go here. but if you hear my dog marking excuse

1080
03:13:52,000 --> 03:13:58,000
We thought about doing a research on effects of Cbd.

1081
03:13:58,000 --> 03:14:03,000
On anxiety. We thought it's a hot topic here in the Us.

1082
03:14:03,000 --> 03:14:07,000
And our sample would be adults higher than 18 diagonals.

1083
03:14:07,000 --> 03:14:27,000
At least during the life with anxiety, and as it is a new intervention, those patients must be followed by a psychiatrist or psychologist, and we will do it as a randomized controlled trial with 3 groups I

1084
03:14:27,000 --> 03:14:36,000
guess one place evil, one receiving typical medicine to treat anxiety and the other one.

1085
03:14:36,000 --> 03:14:43,000
Our and study group would be the CD. group and

1086
03:14:43,000 --> 03:14:54,000
We were. We thought of collecting the data prospectively, because, the patient would need to come back to regular appointments with both.

1087
03:14:54,000 --> 03:15:02,000
Okay, I We are not sure we did not talk about the money.

1088
03:15:02,000 --> 03:15:06,000
I think this type of intervention would be This type of 30.

1089
03:15:06,000 --> 03:15:11,000
Sorry, would be very expensive, because it might involve an integration and possible groups.

1090
03:15:11,000 --> 03:15:22,000
You know the conventional thank you yeah I mean You're, You're absolutely right.

1091
03:15:22,000 --> 03:15:26,000
Intervention study a much more costly the observational study.

1092
03:15:26,000 --> 03:15:34,000
That's why we need both right. We need observational study to to drive the hypothesis formation, and you know, collect initial evidence association.

1093
03:15:34,000 --> 03:15:38,000
But we need, you know, in the measure study to confirm what we find right.

1094
03:15:38,000 --> 03:15:52,000
Finally for trial. So usually 1 million dollar not only support a small scale pilot sort of the Internet study, but if if you see a fact there, you know that can drive you to design a much larger clinical file right which which is more

1095
03:15:52,000 --> 03:15:58,000
costly. but you know we'll finally collect the final evidence Support this information.

1096
03:15:58,000 --> 03:16:12,000
That's cool that's cool any so So I believe the sound only will be sort of a lot in here based right?

1097
03:16:12,000 --> 03:16:19,000
Yes, I think it would be patients that have been through both, or psychologists also.

1098
03:16:19,000 --> 03:16:31,000
Countries who wanted to do like this straight in specific trade

1099
03:16:31,000 --> 03:16:46,000
So any any things to add on from from Group 3

1100
03:16:46,000 --> 03:16:50,000
I just wanted to mention that it sounds like a really cool study.

1101
03:16:50,000 --> 03:16:55,000
Because it it it might expand and add to our understanding.

1102
03:16:55,000 --> 03:17:19,000
Aside from like General Western medicine. Thank you. Any questions for 2 group, 3

1103
03:17:19,000 --> 03:17:36,000
Alright, thank you. Group free. How are group 4 so our group didn't really collaborate, but I figured I would bring my idea, which is something that i've tried to explore in the past, but public health

1104
03:17:36,000 --> 03:17:46,000
issue for me that I wanted to talk about or explorer would be food and security specifically in the P. pediatric population.

1105
03:17:46,000 --> 03:17:53,000
And I would probably do a prospective study.

1106
03:17:53,000 --> 03:18:01,000
And I wanted to specifically look at the patient population that presents to the emergency department, because that is where I work.

1107
03:18:01,000 --> 03:18:07,000
And so, you know, with the 1 million dollars I feel like I wish or I I would hope to be able to expand.

1108
03:18:07,000 --> 03:18:13,000
But i'd probably start small, maybe within a state or a few States, if possible.

1109
03:18:13,000 --> 03:18:25,000
If I can collaborate and one identify the prevalence of food and security in the Pdf of population that presents the pediatric emergency department by use of a screening tool all there's a

1110
03:18:25,000 --> 03:18:40,000
validated 2 questions reading tool that we could use in the emergency department. And then the type of data that I would probably collect would include like demographics as well as how many visits to the emergency department.

1111
03:18:40,000 --> 03:18:43,000
So i'd probably do that in buckets so less than one visit in the last 6 months.

1112
03:18:43,000 --> 03:18:50,000
One to 5 or one to 10, maybe, and then greater than 10 in the last 6 months.

1113
03:18:50,000 --> 03:19:01,000
Trying to look at. You know how many of these patients that are food insecure, or how, you know, Are they more likely to be patients that frequent the immense department?

1114
03:19:01,000 --> 03:19:04,000
And I think you could then explore that further, even but

1115
03:19:04,000 --> 03:19:11,000
And then, like there are awareness or utilization of resources that are present in the community.

1116
03:19:11,000 --> 03:19:15,000
If they are aware of them, if they utilize them.

1117
03:19:15,000 --> 03:19:23,000
And then their interest in resources from the emergency department is kind of what I would look at.

1118
03:19:23,000 --> 03:19:28,000
This is something that i've explored before but living in Michigan.

1119
03:19:28,000 --> 03:19:38,000
Especially with Covid. I also wanted to look at the difference in like, since pre-pandemic and post pandemic, which then would have been more of a retrospective study.

1120
03:19:38,000 --> 03:19:45,000
But yeah, I know that's kind of scattered but that's something that I would have wanted to do.

1121
03:19:45,000 --> 03:19:51,000
Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, I mean with the Pre and past Covid.

1122
03:19:51,000 --> 03:19:59,000
Probably you can see the difference. I have the impact on Covid, and there are. Covid is the you know, everything to do is, it will be the exposure.

1123
03:19:59,000 --> 03:20:04,000
But if it's just a prospective that you talk about So what was the exposure there?

1124
03:20:04,000 --> 03:20:09,000
Specifically.

1125
03:20:09,000 --> 03:20:36,000
Exposure, I mean 2 variable. I want one you know how come the otherwise the calls right or petrol could be the cause so causing the insecurity

1126
03:20:36,000 --> 03:20:42,000
Haven't thought about causes I was working on prevalence.

1127
03:20:42,000 --> 03:20:48,000
And usually they don't present to the emergency department with food and security as their concern.

1128
03:20:48,000 --> 03:20:57,000
Now, how do you really? you find the population, though you You have a lot of kids going through emergency room.

1129
03:20:57,000 --> 03:21:02,000
But how do you? he's all those who you think are fully in secretly related?

1130
03:21:02,000 --> 03:21:12,000
I mean, I would screen all right from the age of birth to 18. and granted, the tool that is validated is for like 12 years and older, to be able to answer themselves.

1131
03:21:12,000 --> 03:21:22,000
And then those that are younger, their parents would respond. You know there are a lot that I mean. obviously there's a lot of nuance to this right, because, depending on

1132
03:21:22,000 --> 03:21:34,000
You know, we found that people are more likely to respond honestly depending on who asked them, and how they ask, etc. whether or not their children are present in the room.

1133
03:21:34,000 --> 03:21:42,000
And so those things are, you know, factors to take into consideration when you develop this type of a survey and or swinging tool.

1134
03:21:42,000 --> 03:21:56,000
Yeah, as far as like a cause right I I don't know that I was looking at I I might understand why actually, in in what you described sounds for me that the food Instagram was the exposure that the emergency.

1135
03:21:56,000 --> 03:22:03,000
Room visit was actually outcome. So in India you can actually establish the no test in the in the Insecurity Case group.

1136
03:22:03,000 --> 03:22:20,000
They have any. You know a elevated emergency room visit? Yeah, that would be something that I would want to look at, which my my hypothesis would be those that are food and secure that identify as frequency kara would be more likely to make one.

1137
03:22:20,000 --> 03:22:33,000
Thing emergency department. But I see then, this actually if you if you really frame this way. This actually sounds to me more like a case control study because you're only look at the kids who who go to emergency right actually i'm there

1138
03:22:33,000 --> 03:22:43,000
you'll pick up more for the incur for not in the first place, so ready to establish the association. You need to have a sort of a population level prevalence for the Institute.

1139
03:22:43,000 --> 03:22:56,000
In the first place, so you're not seeing those who do not go to So that's yes, I would. I? Yeah, So I guess I would if I wanted to compare those that come to the emergency department versus those that

1140
03:22:56,000 --> 03:23:07,000
don' data that's available that's categorized into pediatric versus non pdf, or you know, adults and etc. But like I don't know that I can compare yeah, I guess it

1141
03:23:07,000 --> 03:23:15,000
would be to the general population. Thank you very much i'd like to you know I enjoy the discussion with all of you on this

1142
03:23:15,000 --> 03:23:25,000
Any comments from anyone in the room. I guess i'm not a physician, or anything like that.

1143
03:23:25,000 --> 03:23:37,000
But like, I guess. i'd be curious if you could break an example of like, Are you trying to see what resources could be allocated for that population?

1144
03:23:37,000 --> 03:23:45,000
Yeah. So I my system, you know we know that there are children who are food insecure, who identify as students care.

1145
03:23:45,000 --> 03:23:50,000
And I think there have been multiple interventions at like the primary care level.

1146
03:23:50,000 --> 03:23:56,000
So when you go in to see your regular doctor visits but there's a subset of kids that don't see their Pcp. on a regular basis.

1147
03:23:56,000 --> 03:24:02,000
But they come to the emergency room pretty often. and I I believe there is.

1148
03:24:02,000 --> 03:24:09,000
You know, room for us to be able to help those that are food and scared, that come to our emergency department.

1149
03:24:09,000 --> 03:24:21,000
And I wonder if there would be ways for us to connect them to the resources that we have available for these families or other inventions that could be done to help address food security at the level at that level.

1150
03:24:21,000 --> 03:24:30,000
I think it's a really cool idea. But Yeah, so like kudos to you connecting resources services.

1151
03:24:30,000 --> 03:24:36,000
Yeah, I I agree, too. Thank you so much. Sorry I I did a mean to take over the conversation on the Il.

1152
03:24:36,000 --> 03:24:41,000
We'll have to see the rest of you ask questions and comments on.

1153
03:24:41,000 --> 03:24:45,000
Yeah, please jumping, and also I apologize i'll always take the order of 1, 2 group 5 tomorrow.

1154
03:24:45,000 --> 03:25:06,000
Make group 5 first hopefully don't mind so now group 5

1155
03:25:06,000 --> 03:25:22,000
Anyway. Group 5 on the talk about it. Your project

1156
03:25:22,000 --> 03:25:25,000
I can talk about what we discussed.

1157
03:25:25,000 --> 03:25:33,000
So we were talking about looking at the kind of the rates of nicotine use in high school students.

1158
03:25:33,000 --> 03:25:43,000
And whether or not an intervention targeted at those students would have an impact on continued nicotine use after the intervention.

1159
03:25:43,000 --> 03:25:49,000
With defining the population of interest. It would really probably just be limited to high school students.

1160
03:25:49,000 --> 03:25:57,000
And then I mean with a 1 million dollars, seems like a lot, but probably would be limited to like a single State, or to a few States like in maybe the midwest region.

1161
03:25:57,000 --> 03:26:13,000
As far as how to actually collect the data we talked about using a survey as kind of collecting pre data to see the the current rates of nicotine use in the population designing some type of intervention which we

1162
03:26:13,000 --> 03:26:28,000
didn't really get into the specifics, of but performing an intervention and then doing a post survey probably at the 2 year Mark afterwards to see how how many people were still using nicotine or how many had stopped or how

1163
03:26:28,000 --> 03:26:31,000
many had started, you know, whatever the case may be.

1164
03:26:31,000 --> 03:26:46,000
We talked quite a bit about how to gather that data without having it be skewed by patient reporting, because, you know, if you're kind of following a specific set of people if they answer yes, in the pre data they

1165
03:26:46,000 --> 03:26:58,000
may not want to be followed up on down the road, because that may disclose to their family, or to whoever that they've been using a nicotine product, and they may not want that so to kind of get

1166
03:26:58,000 --> 03:27:07,000
around that we talked about having kind of a, you know, multiple questions on the survey that says, you know. Have you use nicotine in the last 3 months?

1167
03:27:07,000 --> 03:27:21,000
Have you used nicotine in the last 2 years, and kind of comparing to see if it people are still using, or if it's more of a remote past kind of thing to get a to get around that not letting

1168
03:27:21,000 --> 03:27:34,000
people feel like they're losing their anonymity I guess we kind of said it was more of a prospective type of study, because we were following it from through an intervention and into post.

1169
03:27:34,000 --> 03:27:38,000
But then, obviously with a survey, it's a bit retrospective as well.

1170
03:27:38,000 --> 03:27:44,000
So it's a little bit of a combination of the 2.

1171
03:27:44,000 --> 03:27:48,000
Thank you. Yeah, I have a a couple of questions very quick. one.

1172
03:27:48,000 --> 03:27:54,000
Is that what kind of nicotine usage? are you supposedly talking about any kind of, or or or are you talking about e cigarettes?

1173
03:27:54,000 --> 03:28:09,000
Because that's the so yeah we we initially But then somebody brought up vaping and a cigarette. So that's why I was just saying nicotine in general whether you know whatever form they're choosing to use

1174
03:28:09,000 --> 03:28:13,000
in. I agree. I think vaping is a much bigger issue in our high school students currently than cigarette smoking.

1175
03:28:13,000 --> 03:28:18,000
But certainly people are still using cigarettes, too.

1176
03:28:18,000 --> 03:28:23,000
Yeah, I mean, I I also want to apologize to take on this very important question.

1177
03:28:23,000 --> 03:28:25,000
Actually some anecdotes is how how was you know?

1178
03:28:25,000 --> 03:28:32,000
I'm not going to discuss any detail. but you know some of them.

1179
03:28:32,000 --> 03:28:36,000
Talk about this problem, right? these cigar usage.

1180
03:28:36,000 --> 03:28:42,000
Yeah, and turns out that is very hard problems study like you said, because it's easy ego in underage population.

1181
03:28:42,000 --> 03:28:48,000
So. whatever you do, your data is, if it will, you know, subject to reporting by as things like those.

1182
03:28:48,000 --> 03:28:52,000
So. So if you're studied this problem you know it's usually being being criticized.

1183
03:28:52,000 --> 03:29:03,000
Being you know your your methodology is now, good enough so the way people do is that they kind of honest and you know we're not gonna focus on this underage population, because it's already you know But the point is that it's

1184
03:29:03,000 --> 03:29:14,000
there right it's getting even more so it's it's a super important question, but it's it's hard to study, so I I hi I praise your you know you already.

1185
03:29:14,000 --> 03:29:35,000
Are. You'll talk on this problem, thank you and the any comments from group, 5 or from other people in the room

1186
03:29:35,000 --> 03:29:39,000
Yeah, you hear that's alarm remind me it's time to stop.

1187
03:29:39,000 --> 03:29:50,000
So if there's no no comment. thank you very much for being here today, I enjoyed all the hearing a volume project, and remember the attorney in the project for B.

1188
03:29:50,000 --> 03:30:07,200
And also do the quest i'll see you tomorrow morning that's the last day of the week, and then we'll have a break of the weekend.
