Hello, this is Teresa Roscoe back with the EHS five, nine six podcast.

2
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:18,370
I'm returning to our discussion with Lesley Slavitt, the managing director of the Boston Society for Architecture.

3
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:24,220
Lesley, thank you again for joining us. I really enjoyed our last conversation and wanted to follow up to talk about some

4
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:29,110
opportunities to develop more climate resistant building materials and designs.

5
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:35,860
What are a few of the ideas currently being explored in these areas? Hi Teresa. Thanks so much.

6
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:44,680
Likewise, I enjoyed our conversation. I think one of the most exciting and important building materials being reviewed

7
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:51,220
and looked at today is what's called mass timber and mass timber is a sort of

8
00:00:51,220 --> 00:01:00,460
structural building products made from and recycled sort of materials through forestry

9
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,960
and other sort of well-planned natural resources that can actually replace,

10
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,250
to some degree, the use of concrete and building materials.

11
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:13,450
And from a structural point of view, in concrete, as I'm sure you probably know,

12
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:27,780
it's one of the most sort of anti-climate but important building materials historically in the built environment for both infrastructure and building.

13
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,560
And what is the source of this new material?

14
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:42,840
It's wood, but it's wood that's well planned in terms of how you have types of growth forests that make it a very sustainable material.

15
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,860
And given the way it's produced, it's also lighter.

16
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:51,150
It's not produced in a way that's environmentally damaging,

17
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:55,020
and it can really be in a very important offset that also doesn't have the kind of embodied

18
00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:01,020
carbon that concrete does much less the negative climate effects of its production,

19
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,800
of which concrete is really sort of off the charts it.

20
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:13,890
And as you probably know, a good, you know, 50 plus or minus percent of embodied carbon and CO2 production is from the building industry.

21
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:18,990
So it's really critical we find solutions and that we spec buildings and actually

22
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:23,940
infrastructure much differently if we're going to reach our net zero goal.

23
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:31,070
And are you seeing this used in new construction or renovation and kind of revamping, re-use of existing structures?

24
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:33,270
Where is it being utilized?

25
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:40,950
Well, I mean, I think they're really looking at it from a new construction point of view, because when you talk about adaptive reuse,

26
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:49,290
you're looking at things that tend to have more mechanicals in buildings or other sorts of different sorts of specs like windows.

27
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:56,010
You know, you're building enclosure, for instance, which you can do differently. And so you can adaptively reuse current structures that way.

28
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:05,260
But if you're looking at new construction,  foundations. You know, structures and so you really want to replace as much concrete and also, you know,

29
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:12,400
I-beams the sort of steel of buildings with the concrete and steel and building those which are really looking to get replaced.

30
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:20,800
And of course, if you try to replace those things, you don't have much of a current building depending on how you look at it.

31
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:28,180
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Are you seeing was used to kind of. I realize that it's a newer material, but are you seeing it used widely?

32
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:36,280
And if so, where is it being used in terms of by kind of wealthier building construction areas?

33
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,710
Is it being used in some affordable housing options? Where where are you seeing it?

34
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:48,130
Well, you know, it's an interesting question because, you know, we're just sort of dipping our toe in the water in the United States.

35
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:53,440
It's something that's more well understood, more well used in neighborhoods,

36
00:03:53,440 --> 00:04:01,090
in housing from a sort of regulatory point of view in Europe and the US is just sort of getting at that now.

37
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:05,680
And I think we're really at the pilot phase and there's some early grants,

38
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:14,560
some early sort of efforts to look at different types of projects that could make use of of mass timber.

39
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:24,310
And so those really can be a lot of different sorts of products, but they need to sort of be of scale,

40
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:30,070
to be of use and so on the individual sort of, you know, unit basis, that's hard to do.

41
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:34,570
So you really do look at taller buildings. And so what are taller buildings?

42
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:42,400
They tend to be, you know, places where you're changing out areas that have a higher land value.

43
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:49,570
And so central city more historically. I mean, I think as you think about types of affordable housing units,

44
00:04:49,570 --> 00:05:00,820
then that become developments which are sort of less sort of singular from a affordable housing point of view and less individual units,

45
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:05,350
but more sort of aggregate solutions which require a lot of broader resources.

46
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:14,920
So there's a bit of a disenfranchisement, if you think about it in that regard, also, I think we need to really be honest with ourselves.

47
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,470
This is a newer building material.

48
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:27,400
We are piloting this and I think we really need to be thoughtful about the notion of experimentation and how we value,

49
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:34,960
treat, respect and secure the safety and well-being of communities as we explore these different building materials.

50
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:42,790
And there's a lot of sensitivity given real historic injustice and sort of the legacies of racism in our country that we have

51
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:51,220
to be really thoughtful about and really participatory in how we pilot and test these kind of new building technologies.

52
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:57,340
So I'm hearing really about the importance then, of kind of engaging with communities to maintain to ensure that they are a

53
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:03,730
part of deciding when and where and how to use some of these newer materials,

54
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:08,350
when sometimes they may not be as economically feasible,

55
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:17,140
but as we want to try and experiment and use them in areas that that could be better in terms of addressing climate change issues.

56
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:24,250
And in the long run, help us mitigate some of the potential impacts of climate change overall.

57
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:31,550
Absolutely, and I think it's really an opportunity for the architectural profession because architects are the folks that stamp buildings.

58
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:37,600
You know, they spec the buildings out and that's part of what their role is in the building process.

59
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:45,940
And so I think, you know, as architecture really thinks about climate and justice and equity,

60
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:52,810
it's really an opportunity to to collaborate and to sort of ensure that the built environment is the

61
00:06:52,810 --> 00:07:00,180
solution for a lot of historic injustices that we have in our country and in our cities and communities.

62
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:07,620
Great, thank you so much. It's really wonderful to talk about how health and health professions and public health can interact with

63
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:14,190
architecture and other fields as we think about climate change and how it affects our communities overall.

64
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:19,320
Thank you so much and we hope to have you back. Thanks so much, Teresa.

65
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:27,680
Thanks. Bye.
