1
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:05,200
Okay. Hi, everybody. I'm so excited.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:14,560
Today we have Dr. Marianne Rosenberg, who is an assistant professor in the Department of Systems, Populations and Leadership at the School of Nursing.

3
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:20,980
She got her BSN at the University of Buffalo and M.A. and Ph.D. at the University of Washington.

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:26,050
She's also a fellow at the American Association of Occupational Health Nurses.

5
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:30,820
And Dr. Rosenberg co-leads the Michigan Healthy Meal Salon Cooperative with me.

6
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:35,860
Her research is focused on occupational health and optimizing the health of low

7
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:41,230
wage service workers at risk for experiencing one or more chronic conditions.

8
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:45,130
And today, she's going to talk to you about cardiovascular things in particular.

9
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:49,030
So with that, I'll let you take it away. Dr. Rosenberg, thank you.

10
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:55,460
Sure. Hi, everyone. And it's great to meet you all.

11
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:01,570
So just for something that I like to do, so, Josh, Bridgette and I don't know how to say is a G.

12
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:08,620
J. Can you guys just put your camera on for one minute so I could see who I'm talking to?

13
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,370
You guys can go back to being a mute, if that's possible.

14
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:17,450
Hey, very nice to put a face to the name.

15
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:21,790
And Josh, whenever, that's fine. And then you guys can go back to being hiatus.

16
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:27,630
But at least I know I'm not talking to blank walls. Thank you guys for joining.

17
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:39,250
Let me share my screen here. And I was talking and I was telling Dr. Lee that I plan on changing my setting for.

18
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:42,720
Can you guys see this? Yeah.

19
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:47,940
From my resume. Because no matter what I do, I'm still I still look like I'm in the dark.

20
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:55,499
So as Dr. Lee mentioned, I am an assistant professor here in the School of Nursing,

21
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:02,970
and I am the newly appointed associate deputy director for the Occupational Health Nursing Program.

22
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:10,940
Okay. Thank you. Dr. Lee just said she put the slides in week 11 of the module.

23
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:21,139
And today I am going to briefly cover some cardiovascular disease risk factors relating to worker health and well-being,

24
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:25,400
and then I'll share some of my scholarship with you as well.

25
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:33,980
So by the end of this talk today, what I want you to take home in your knowledge bank is, one,

26
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:41,270
the ability to describe various the various models that capture psychosocial stress at work,

27
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:44,510
which I'm sure Dr. Ali has mentioned throughout the class so far,

28
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:52,640
being able to list some key determinant factors that may increase one's risk for cardiovascular disease and other chronic conditions,

29
00:02:53,090 --> 00:03:02,420
and also being able to list some established measures, too, that are used to capture psychosocial stressors and physiologic responses.

30
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:10,750
So the premise behind this whole presentation today is the importance of context.

31
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:18,400
It is important to understand individual contexts, organizational contexts, societal context, as well as global context.

32
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:25,090
As we are fully ingrained in this paradigm, a movement towards globalization and technology,

33
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:31,720
the changing nature of work, it is important for us scholars and professionals to understand those nuances.

34
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:37,440
And how we can address them in order to optimize the health of workers.

35
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:42,230
So here we go. If you take a look at this picture here.

36
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:52,420
First glance, if you were to look at, you know, the guy who's looking through this lens, the camera.

37
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:58,060
Just looking at this, you would think that this person is trying to harm this one.

38
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:03,790
But then when you step back and you see it's the other way around, he's just wearing a pointy shoe trying to run away.

39
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:10,600
Well, it's the other way around. So really understanding that a single picture doesn't really tell the whole story.

40
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:15,410
Here's another version of that. Right.

41
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:23,060
If you were to go to a museum and let's say we're all miniature folks and we're at a museum with this giant elephant here,

42
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:29,180
if each one of us were to be at a separate window, we would only see one part of it.

43
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:35,210
But then you step back. You see that you're looking at an entire elephant while you're just looking at one section.

44
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,290
Other than this, this area here, you wouldn't be able to see what you're looking at.

45
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:50,410
And again, lastly, in terms of context, really important for you to think about stereotype and what that does to how you provide care,

46
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:59,170
how you put implementation in place in terms of intervention to protect the health of individuals.

47
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,420
So with that in mind,

48
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:13,670
let me put myself into context so you can understand why I do what I do and why I'm here today engaging you in this conversation.

49
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:19,819
And please feel free to put any questions you have or any comments in the chat or interrupt me at any time.

50
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:26,440
Okay. I consider myself as a first generation Asian immigrant.

51
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:30,850
This is me on a beautiful beach in Haiti and me holding my niece.

52
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:36,690
And I'm a mother. A minus one, a miss. I have a son now.

53
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:40,090
So he's missing. My wife.

54
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:46,380
I am a teacher. So these are my undergrad students.

55
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:52,139
This is my community, my, my, not my leadership seminar students.

56
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:57,990
And I always look like a student on everybody. And this is my population health course students.

57
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:05,680
And I consider myself as a research scientist with a heavy focus on occupational health disparities.

58
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:12,280
And basically, this is what we do a lot a lot of typing. And of course I am.

59
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:19,000
I consider myself as a lover of life, equity and fairness in terms of context for education.

60
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,120
Dr. Lee sort of mentioned my background.

61
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,959
So I am a nurse by training from the University of Buffalo where we have the Niagara Falls.

62
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:33,370
Hopefully you guys haven't been to Niagara Falls. I have my master's in communities and population health from the University of Washington,

63
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:41,440
Tacoma, and my Ph.D. at the University of Washington, Seattle, funded by Nash as a fellow.

64
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:48,970
And then I transition here to the University of Michigan as an aged 32 fellow, again focusing on worker health.

65
00:06:49,240 --> 00:07:02,400
And now I am a faculty. So why am I steering all of this?

66
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:09,830
Let me see. Make sure that I am not. So why am I sharing all this personal information?

67
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,930
Right. My work looking at worker health actually started since my undergraduate studies where I worked on a

68
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:24,540
project looking at the safety of nurses who work who provide care to incarcerated persons in prisons.

69
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:32,700
My Master's in Community and Population Health. My thesis focused on pathogen exposures among health care workers and their communities

70
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:38,400
and looking at the presence of pathogens on nurses scrubs after a regular shift.

71
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,370
Billy. I think I see somebody who's trying to be a.

72
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:50,610
And for my doctoral and postdoctoral training, I focused on health promotion activities for health and safety.

73
00:07:51,280 --> 00:08:00,329
So as you can see, my personal experience and training really informed the core of my work, which focuses on addressing health inequities and social,

74
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:06,180
environmental and occupational factors that impinge on the health and well-being of working populations,

75
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:13,980
including service workers, many of whom are foreign born and are at risk of developing chronic conditions.

76
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:24,260
Also try to move forward towards intervention, development and also policy, as we all know.

77
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:29,210
Once you have policy in place, that's a high level way of addressing worker health.

78
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:32,900
And I am part of a team that actually we recently.

79
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:39,780
We recently published this guidelines for temp workers.

80
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:48,060
And, as you all know, temporary work, I don't know, but temporary workers usually are in the middle of.

81
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:53,799
A very difficult position.

82
00:08:53,800 --> 00:09:01,360
Right. So let's say if you're a temp workers and or you're a contract worker, you're hired through an agency for a company.

83
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:06,970
You get injured on the job. The agency often will say, well, you're not my employee.

84
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:09,520
I'm not responsible for for the for you.

85
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:17,860
And the home organization will say, well, you're on contract, you're not a full time employee, so we're not responsible for you.

86
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:27,819
And if you go back and just put that in the news, you'll see not long ago, a construction worker actually was severely injured.

87
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:34,390
I can't recall if they actually died because and from there,

88
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:44,320
neither the hired company nor the agency or the contracting agency actually were taking responsibility for that worker.

89
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,670
So this guideline is very important. I urge you guys to take a look at that.

90
00:09:50,350 --> 00:10:00,579
And so this is me, the NISA at headquarters where the Nash was holding a meeting on healthy work design.

91
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:07,300
And right here I lead the chronic health condition subgroup for Nora.

92
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:18,819
So why are we talking about contact so much? Right. I'm here to talk about, you know, cardiovascular disease risk factors.

93
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:25,299
But here I'm spending quite a bit of time on contacts when we can't when we talk about work or health and wellbeing,

94
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:32,980
including cardiovascular disease, health. It is important to understand where the worker lives, work and play.

95
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:39,489
While I was introducing myself, I highlighted several factors that could essentially,

96
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:43,840
essentially put me at risk for cardiovascular disease risk, as well as protective factors.

97
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:48,370
For example, I am an immigrant. I am a woman of color.

98
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:53,080
I am also of course, I'm a of a racial ethnic minority group.

99
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,980
I work in a highly demanding and stressful work environment.

100
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:03,760
Some scholars have dedicated their work to show historical impact of slavery on health outcomes,

101
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:07,930
particularly cardiovascular health, over time and over generation.

102
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,640
We'll take a look at that on the next slide.

103
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:19,840
So according to these scholars, because I am a descendant of slaves and I am individual an individual who has and continued to face hardship,

104
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,360
I am at risk for cardiovascular disease.

105
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:30,610
And although I had to have some autonomy more or less over what I do, I also get paid well above the minimum wage.

106
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,530
I would say that I have somewhat adequate access to health care.

107
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:41,670
So putting so all these factors as well put me into at an advantage.

108
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:51,969
Well, I'll stop talking. There's only the six of us here, so please take your time to share your context.

109
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:55,660
And when I say share your context, do similar to what I do.

110
00:11:55,660 --> 00:12:06,550
Share as much as you can, as little as you want. Focusing on what would put you at risk for poor health and what are your buffers or your protectors?

111
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:11,690
Do you want them to just, you know, like a new to raise their hand?

112
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:15,890
Right. Dr. Rosenberg. Yeah. They can just unmute, I.

113
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:24,560
Okay. I'll give the students a chance because they know a lot about me after this semester with the small class.

114
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:28,310
And we do all feel free to please share. Yes.

115
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:37,720
Just jump in or do you guys want me to call on people? I can jump in because I think about this a lot and how it impacts my work.

116
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:45,070
Um, so yeah, I am a white straight man, so that already gives me a really big privilege.

117
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:49,270
I come from a low income, moderate income family.

118
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:55,929
So that also is I've never really had a struggle for food access, health care access, all that stuff.

119
00:12:55,930 --> 00:13:02,260
So it's something that I was like, I don't know how those how that impact people on a day to day life.

120
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,530
Um, but then that's kind of what brought me to public health.

121
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:12,159
I got my Bachelor's of Science in Public Health, and that's why I'm here getting my MPH in health education.

122
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,600
Understand more just about the different disparities and how they impact different lives and

123
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:21,249
how massive public health professionals can kind of use some of our resources properly to

124
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:27,430
kind of take care and just write back on some of the disparities and kind of have an equity

125
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:32,530
in mind where our work is most needed to have the biggest impact across the populations.

126
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:37,930
Um, and then I guess, yeah, for how I am at risk for health.

127
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:45,069
Um, I think the biggest thing for me right now is just as a students, that health is something that's not on my mind a lot.

128
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:51,790
It's something I remind myself that it is okay to take time and, you know, do healthy activities and whatnot.

129
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:58,359
So but then again, I have good health care insurance and I have the access to it.

130
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,290
It's just the the limitation factor that it's not a priority for me right now.

131
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:06,350
But that's just my own motivation and stuff. So. Anything else?

132
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:10,760
Right. Do you go by Samuel or Sam? I go by both.

133
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:14,150
Sam's good, though, right? Thank you, Sam. Thank you for sharing.

134
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:23,840
Who wants to go next? You probably have done this exercise before with the other guest speakers, huh?

135
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:31,610
Not the same questions. And usually they're very chatty, so I don't think he's here.

136
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,969
Maybe it's because I was two chatting in the beginning. That's not. No, no.

137
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:37,970
I'm chatty all the time. Maybe just quiet today.

138
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,870
Let's go, Joe. I'm looking. You know, I'm looking at who. Who's next?

139
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:52,600
Got a text.

140
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:56,410
Do you want me to repeat the question? No, it's okay.

141
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:03,850
I'm just having a hard time answering the question because I.

142
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:09,320
I have very significant health issues. So.

143
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:20,299
I'm a white cisgendered female, so sort of similar to what Sam was saying.

144
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:25,550
Like that provides me a certain level of privilege to begin with.

145
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:40,150
So there's certainly a. The difficulty with being female in the world.

146
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:52,920
I generally have access to.

147
00:15:54,790 --> 00:16:02,680
Pretty good health care. So that's definitely one of those buffers.

148
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:11,040
Cardiovascular. Brisk, wise.

149
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:16,560
I mean, I have chronic illnesses that.

150
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:25,020
Certainly play a role in putting me at risk and.

151
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:36,210
I guess other buffers like in highly educated and.

152
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:54,240
I live in Ann Arbor, which is pretty safe and like.

153
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:05,470
Think health conscious environment. That's.

154
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,600
That's a good start. Yeah, definitely.

155
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:19,700
You mentioned quite a bit of things that would definitely either protect you or increase your risk for cardiovascular health.

156
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:25,129
And we'll mention that behavioral as well as co-morbidities are some risk factors.

157
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:28,670
So thank you for sharing, Joe. Who's next?

158
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,580
I guess if no one else wants to pay cash.

159
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:40,510
Hi. Yeah, so I'm from close to Michigan, which is about an hour north of here.

160
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:47,740
And so a very solid middle tier to like upper middle class white background for the most.

161
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:55,839
There was not a lot of diversity in the school I went to. I would do public school and my parents both kind of work in the medical field.

162
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,340
They're not doctors or anything, but they're real nurses or nurse nuts tests, stuff like that.

163
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:03,940
So I definitely come from a background of higher education.

164
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:10,210
However, my grandparents, my grandpa was a crane operator, so I kind of in terms of occupational health,

165
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:15,790
I kind of do have a little bit more of a focus on worker rights and all that kind of stuff.

166
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:21,790
And I kind of really got into public health more from an environmentalist slant where most of us can stay.

167
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:27,369
And so I was very concerned about the environment and kind of the Sierra Club and my as my

168
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:32,859
undergrad is more environmental focused and I kind of noticed the link between that and health.

169
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:40,989
And so kind of Melissa's with my personal beliefs by believe everyone has should have equal access to the environment and kind of commons

170
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:49,870
and is it really much shared good and and then so emails obviously come with a lot of privilege and I'm fortunate to be in Ann Arbor,

171
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:53,530
which is a very high health access area.

172
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:57,459
I do have some disabilities which has made my health a little bit more difficult

173
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:02,140
in the past couple of years because of COVID and little bit higher risk. So that kind of has made since different.

174
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:10,839
But yeah, I mean, yeah, there's definitely always a lot more that people can do to individually protect their health.

175
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:14,380
But also there's a lot of stuff that kind of just shapes context. And so I think you.

176
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:27,380
Thank you. Thank you, Josh. So, Bridget, you can just, you know, tell me what you're you are in the program and we can then continue moving forward.

177
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:35,010
I'm a second year in the Environmental Health Promotion and Policy Program.

178
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,300
Very nice. Very nice to meet you. Thank you. And who's the next student?

179
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:42,950
I'm sorry. I want to put your your name and my.

180
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:51,540
Yeah, my name is Jack. Hi, Jack. Please do share whatever you want to share in terms of risk factors and protect first.

181
00:19:51,840 --> 00:20:04,829
Okay. I'm a international students from China, so I guess the risk factor for me is like I need to get used to this unfamiliar environment,

182
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:09,270
including culture, language and all kinds of things.

183
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:19,290
But the poster size is I got I got it from this border from a research grant.

184
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:23,490
So my health insurance got paid for that.

185
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:28,170
I guess that's like the protective factor.

186
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:33,660
And also, Ann Arbor is a very safe place to live.

187
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:39,890
So I guess that's another protective factor. Yeah.

188
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:44,270
And, you know, I think a lot of times we don't think about those things.

189
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:53,250
We just go through life without thinking of some of the privileges that we have or have that would put us in a worse place than others.

190
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:58,040
Thank you. Thank you guys for sharing. And it's nice to meet you guys in your context.

191
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:02,629
So let's deep let's dive deep here again.

192
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:09,950
That's not it's not a lot of us here. And I appreciate your in advance your interaction.

193
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:17,510
So I'll ask some questions. So please jump in and we can finish in a timely manner.

194
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:22,880
What do you see here? I'll pause and let you take a look at this this figure.

195
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:42,980
Anyway. Oh, sorry. I mean, this seems kind of very classic of social determinants of health.

196
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:49,660
Yes. Yes. Right. And and again, we're talking about cardiovascular risk.

197
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:56,230
And then again, going back to context, you you see that it goes all the way back up and slavery.

198
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:03,550
So this team here from the College of Medicine in New York published this paper so you can look it up and go read it.

199
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:10,959
We see that there is some disparities in continued alarming disparities to cardiovascular

200
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:18,250
health and mortality among blacks and non-Hispanic whites compared to non-Hispanic whites.

201
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:26,379
Right. So this team here, they looked at county level slavery and slave density patterns in the year of 1860 and

202
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:33,850
compared them to stroke mortality rates for the years 2011 and 20 all the way to 2013.

203
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:45,640
So what they what they saw was that the areas with higher slave density back in those days showed higher rates of stroke mortality among blacks.

204
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,120
Right.

205
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:55,930
And the presence of county level slavery was strongly associated with an increase always stroke mortality rate when compared to non slave counties.

206
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:03,940
So this figure here is very important. Interesting, right. Because it shows you that from slavery, all the things that trickle down,

207
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:10,150
all the things that trickle down that we wouldn't think about and that leads all the way to stroke mortality.

208
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:14,170
Thank you for that. Dr. Rosenberg.

209
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,020
Yes.

210
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:25,420
So in the class, we talked a little bit about, you know, like the weathering hypothesis and that study about, you know, like infant mortality rates,

211
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:34,990
comparing white women from Africa and then, you know, first generation African American women and then their like, subsequent generations.

212
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:42,340
So I'm just wondering, like, maybe if you could speak from your own experience or maybe your own knowledge,

213
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:48,639
because I know, like Haiti has been has had slavery and has been colonized and all that kind of stuff.

214
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:58,390
So there's very few countries in the world that haven't either been touched by like slavery or colonization, including Vietnam.

215
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:10,590
But like, do you know? You know, are potentially like the cardiovascular outcomes of those folks who haven't had those historical dramas.

216
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:14,040
Are they significantly different? Do you do you happen to know?

217
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,390
So this is where we come as we show scientists where we say more research needs to be done right.

218
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:23,430
Given all we know with Haiti, for example, as as an example,

219
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:28,259
one would automatically think that there's high risk for high blood pressure and things like that.

220
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:31,410
And some of the few studies that have been done, we do see that.

221
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:41,670
But in terms of having strong, large data where we're able to look at the association of all these factors.

222
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:49,110
Right. And I think Haiti's just a bad example because I can't even think of protectors for Haiti because we're getting it,

223
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:54,720
you know, through through all from all directions.

224
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:58,760
So, yeah, we we need we need more data there.

225
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:08,820
What we know so far is definitely high incidence of blood pressure, diabetes and all those other things.

226
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:14,040
But yeah, I don't know if I answered your question.

227
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:19,290
Did I? No, that's okay. I may not have an answer, so I was just curious.

228
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,990
Okay, now you're going to send me back and I'm going to being in the literature.

229
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:26,090
There goes my afternoon now, actually.

230
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:36,719
So just briefly, in terms of cardiovascular disease from many forms of cardiovascular disease, including heart disease,

231
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,220
which occurs when you have a plaque filled up on the artery walls which can

232
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:45,810
cause blood clots and blockage of blood flow leading to heart attack or stroke.

233
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:52,350
And a person may experience a stroke when there is a lack of blood circulating to the brain.

234
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:57,330
The blood is carry, you know, that's carrying oxygen to the brain.

235
00:25:57,330 --> 00:26:01,319
So when there's a lack of oxygen, it is often the cells in the brain.

236
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:06,330
They die and they do not regenerate. And it with heart failure.

237
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:12,150
That's when the heart is malfunctioning and not pumping enough blood to carry oxygen throughout the rest of the body.

238
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:18,720
And then with arrhythmia, you have tachycardia and bradycardia, which is abnormal rhythm of the heartbeat.

239
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,640
And with tachycardia is when it's going too fast and then bradycardia when it's beating too slow.

240
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:32,450
A disease, as we know, is the leading cause of death for adult population in the U.S.

241
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:43,790
And actually, now, thinking back about your question, Dr. Lee, I do have a slide from another class that I did a lecture in where I show the top ten.

242
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:53,250
Top ten mortality issues across different countries.

243
00:26:53,580 --> 00:27:04,320
I will send you that slide maybe. And cardiovascular disease usually shows up and I'll I'll send you that slides so you could share with the students.

244
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:13,400
Okay. Sounds great. Thank you. According to the CDC, someone dies every 36 seconds in the U.S. from cardiovascular disease.

245
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:18,090
So that's very it's it's it's very impactful.

246
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:27,630
Each year, 655,000 individuals die from heart disease in the U.S., accounting for one in every three deaths.

247
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:34,400
A disease is very costly, as we can see, with costing about $219 Billion each year.

248
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:40,260
And that in that costs in accounts for health services as well as medicines.

249
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:46,259
And specifically with big into the workplace workplace.

250
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:49,590
We see that it's very costly really to work productivity.

251
00:27:53,200 --> 00:28:02,040
We see that it also. Leads to permanent disability among workers, as we know.

252
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:15,050
Vascular disease is a very for the national occupational research agenda, which is Nora and it is listed and detailed under Objective four,

253
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:20,180
which is to reduce chronic organizational related health conditions among workers.

254
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:25,850
And this document is also available for you guys to go see online.

255
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:36,210
Cardiovascular health metrics include modifiable and non modifiable factors.

256
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:43,230
So we see that the modifiable metric includes not only smoking.

257
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:51,550
Being physically active, having normal blood pressure, having normal blood glucose.

258
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:59,850
So here we're talking about the co-morbidities being our normal, normal weight, having normal cholesterol levels and eating a healthy diet.

259
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:03,670
So that includes the behavioral aspect as well.

260
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:14,470
And modifiable risk factors are things that you cannot control right your age, no matter how much we want you to stop aging, right?

261
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:20,980
Some of us. But you know, your age, your gender, a genetic predisposition as well as race and ethnicity.

262
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:27,620
We look at blood pressure, for example,

263
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:34,340
which from the previous slide is considered as one of the key modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease,

264
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:42,590
with a systolic blood pressure of less than 120 milligrams for mercury and diastolic of less than 80.

265
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:47,860
You have. You are. Looking at here, right?

266
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:54,900
You have a normal reading and you're less likely to develop cardiovascular disease.

267
00:29:54,930 --> 00:30:04,889
You're in the safe zone. But then once you start going here and we we actually have we've seen that things have changed because back in the days,

268
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:08,460
if you were at 120 over 80, you were considered normal.

269
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:15,140
Now, if you're at 120 over 80, you're actually considered pre pre hypertensive.

270
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:25,770
This data is from the Framingham Longitudinal Study,

271
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:33,480
and they found that behaviors across racial and ethnic groups increased their heart, their heart, age.

272
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:41,010
Right. So we're talking about accelerated aging, meaning that their heart is working at overcapacity or poorly,

273
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:44,640
thus having a major impact on their life expectancy.

274
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:57,540
I'll pause here and let you guys take a look at this table. Any comment on this table here?

275
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:10,520
You guys are bored. I mean,

276
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:19,040
you can certainly see or think of multiple factors that would potentially cause the differences between racial disparities and like heart factors.

277
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:22,970
I mean, I've seen research says stress is certainly one of them. Mm hmm.

278
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:29,570
For sure. For sure. And what what's interesting about this table is it shows you across racial,

279
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:38,060
ethnic minority, but also in terms of heavier smoking and comorbidities as well.

280
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:47,920
The studies have shown that the toll of cardiovascular disease actually varies across occupations.

281
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:56,470
Studies have shown that some occupations showing the highest risk include police and firefighters,

282
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:02,260
those in service industries and those in sales and administrative support.

283
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:09,370
The difference in occupation is also palpable when you start comparing blue collars versus white collar workers.

284
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:13,510
So, for example, in a study in 2016,

285
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:23,980
so natural not too long ago among 180 workers showed that the association between job strain which we'll talk a little bit more in a few minutes.

286
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:28,299
And systolic and diastolic ambulatory blood pressure.

287
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:33,100
And when I say ambulatory blood pressure is blood pressure that's measured across a 24 hour period

288
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:39,880
in not just a one sitting were stronger among blue collar workers compared to white collar workers.

289
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:44,340
There's definitely some occupational health implications there.

290
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:55,870
The notion of the relationship between stress, psychological stress and health outcomes date back to the early 1900s,

291
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:03,670
when William Osler noted that heart disease, such as myocardial infarction, were attributed to the wear and tear of life.

292
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:11,890
So that's a term that you'll hear. We start seeing a shift in the conversation about psychosocial stress at work in the middle.

293
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:17,139
During that time, the mid 1900s were scholars started to make the connection between work,

294
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:22,630
stress and cardiovascular disease, cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

295
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:32,890
I think Dr. Lee gave you guys some reading with Dr. Schnall and Lynn Burgess because they did that reading.

296
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:38,020
Both of whom actually have collaborated on Uncle Eric collaborated with.

297
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:47,829
The two school of thoughts when they highlighted when it comes to work related stress and cardio cardiovascular disease.

298
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:58,630
They talk about their review of multiple studies, underscore the significant association between job strain and those factors.

299
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:05,229
So in your reading, I think for the class also you look at the carousels job demand model, right?

300
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:11,260
Dr. Lee, we get background memories from 2007, but they're very similar.

301
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:16,000
Uh huh. So Carousel Karasick. Let me go to the next slide here.

302
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:19,390
You'll see the models suggest that.

303
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:35,730
The jobs that are characters characterized by high hijab, the man right hijab strain are definitely leading to risk for us.

304
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:40,260
Psychosocial strain and stress and thus poor cardiovascular health.

305
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:48,950
This is another model.

306
00:34:49,370 --> 00:35:00,760
According to this model rewards, which can include money, self-esteem, feeling valued, increased career opportunity, all will buffer.

307
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:02,420
We're talking about protective factors.

308
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:12,050
Well, buffer the negative effects of X of the effort spent in terms of psychological and physical load in the workplace.

309
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:22,879
Now, see, Greece has this figure here and I published a paper right here and I asked them for permission to use the figure.

310
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,209
And this is what you're seeing. This is from the paper model,

311
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:30,590
emphasize that when there is an imbalance between effort that you're putting in

312
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:35,450
the workplace and what you're feeling that you're getting back in terms of reward,

313
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:44,130
that creates some type of psychological stress for you. And increasing your risk for cardiovascular health.

314
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:52,780
I think these images are pretty intuitive. Yeah. Yes.

315
00:35:54,460 --> 00:36:00,940
So the relationship between job strain and cardiovascular risk has been evidence across multiple studies and work groups.

316
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:09,310
As I mentioned, in terms of strivers and police officers, the mounting evidence shows that factors such as hyper alertness,

317
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:17,440
hyper vigilance, the inability to relax all of these are associated with high heart rate during sleep.

318
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:21,460
All increases one risk for cardiovascular health.

319
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:31,810
Her bunch of studies, right. Have been conducted in not only in the U.S., but also outside of the U.S., such as Sweden,

320
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:40,510
where they showed hijab strain, which from the car sex model really are directly associated with cardiovascular health.

321
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:49,840
And also looking at confounders where they've included BMI, which relates to weight to weight,

322
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:55,540
race, age and behaviors among those workers with high job strain.

323
00:36:55,900 --> 00:37:04,450
Even when they add those confounders, they're actually more likely to have poor cardiovascular health showing sicker heart muscles.

324
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:13,180
This project is from a team from California where they look at hotel room cleaners,

325
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:17,990
which is a worker group that I that I have been working with for quite a bit now.

326
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:27,590
They looked at blood pressure and they found that hijab strain was highly associated with ambulatory blood pressure among those workers.

327
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:35,180
So we see that if they continue like this, they will definitely have some type of stroke or heart attack moving forward.

328
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:42,510
Let me see if I can. I'm chair my.

329
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:49,669
You know, you just have to remember, Dr. Rosenberg, to hit that button at the bottom.

330
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:54,080
That's like Cher audio from the from the video clip.

331
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:58,700
That's why I don't see. Who?

332
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:03,520
This play. Maybe I should.

333
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:09,560
Clyde's click it. Yeah. And then. It should open in a new window.

334
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:15,230
We don't hear. Okay, it's muted. Try to unmute.

335
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:21,889
At. Nothing.

336
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:27,140
You don't hear anything? No. So you have to share and then share your screen again.

337
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:33,780
And then at the bottom it should have like a checkmark that says share audio from slides.

338
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:44,840
So like you would think that I that I had this down now by now the thing is mostly focuses on punctuation spelling department.

339
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:51,170
This man now the can do a pass by on this conveyor belt and continue into the next room with the girls will packet.

340
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:57,950
Now your job is to take each piece of candy and wrap it in one of these papers and then put it back on the belt.

341
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:03,270
You understand? Yes, sir. Yes, ma'am. Oh.

342
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:11,239
Oh, wait.

343
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:15,870
Here. Somebody is asleep at the switch shoes.

344
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:22,360
What are you doing up here? I thought you were downstairs boxing chocolate. Oh, they kicked me out of there fast.

345
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:29,440
I. I kept pinching them to see what kind they were. The art department I've been in.

346
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:33,700
I didn't do so well either. Oh, right, girls.

347
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:41,230
Oh, this is your last chance. If one piece of candy gets past you and into the packing room unwrapped, you're fired.

348
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:55,290
Yes, ma'am. Oh, okay.

349
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:02,740
Oh, this is easy. Yeah, we can handle this. Okay.

350
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:54,610
I think it. You she have.

351
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:17,200
Fine. You're doing splendidly. Speed.

352
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:56,190
Eight. I love my new video because I think it relates to occupational health or stress.

353
00:41:56,190 --> 00:42:01,800
And let me pause and give you guys the opportunity to tell me what you think,

354
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:06,240
how you think this video really is to cardiovascular health, which we've been talking about.

355
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:13,710
Specifically. So what are some of the main organizational factors that can increase the risk for poor health from that video?

356
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:24,830
Do you guys think? You don't have to raise your hand, Josh.

357
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:27,100
Just you yourself. Have got to thank you.

358
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:33,320
I mean, I think kind of towards the end is kind of telling of like the she came back out and like, oh, you're doing fine, spit it up.

359
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:36,910
And it's like a lot of times coping mechanisms or just scraping by.

360
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:43,820
Sometimes it's like in terms of works, like workplace stressors, like let's say you are having a really hard time, but you are still managing.

361
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:50,000
People sometimes might view that as, Oh, you can take more. Or something like in terms of stress, kind of.

362
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:54,170
I think I kind of made that connection. Yes, definitely stress.

363
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:58,290
Right. The added pressure. Excellent. Anybody else.

364
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:13,410
I have the all time favorite from there. Uh, I mean, I would say maybe that job is less stressful than the one you and I have right now.

365
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:21,430
But you think so? I would. I love chocolate, but I probably obviously shouldn't be eating that much.

366
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:32,680
Right. Because then in that case, that would increase my blood sugar and affect not only my, like, liver and processing systems,

367
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:41,170
but also my cardiovascular health as well, just from all that added like butter, cocoa butter solids and fat.

368
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:44,649
Exactly. We're talking about behavioral health here. Right.

369
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:48,730
And and what all that consuming all that chocolate that they're eating.

370
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:54,040
But, you know, the fact that we're saying there's added pressure, we feel added pressure.

371
00:43:54,430 --> 00:44:03,040
But I feel like they you know, Lucy and her colleague there, they have that job insecurity in their mind that if they don't do that,

372
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:07,629
they could get fired right then and there, which is one of the things that we don't have.

373
00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:11,350
Right. We see the fire long term or not. Not immediate.

374
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:21,280
Yeah. Yeah, that's very true, because I'm definitely more outspoken for someone who doesn't have time here, then maybe I should be.

375
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:28,350
But a lot of times I joke with other people and I'm like, I don't dare them to fire me.

376
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:32,410
Wow. So, you know, there's so much control you and I have, right?

377
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:40,090
Yeah. So that definitely you don't have that supervisor, you know, like or your department chair, like, breathe breathing down your neck, literally.

378
00:44:40,090 --> 00:44:43,750
Yes. Yeah, yeah. Thank you for that. So.

379
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:51,170
I know. I think you guys have seen this straight talking about hierarchy or control from my ass.

380
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:55,680
And if you were to apply that specifically to cardiovascular health.

381
00:44:56,510 --> 00:45:07,760
Can somebody tell me what an example, you know, for one or each one of those that would help improve cardiovascular health for workers?

382
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:18,920
This probably isn't what you're looking for, but I think of substitute and it's like, well,

383
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:24,529
they don't have to be people doing that job, so it gets substituted for automation and stuff.

384
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:29,990
So we could just eliminate that stress, but that doesn't help the situation at all because people still see jobs.

385
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,320
Yeah, so. Right, it's a double edged sword.

386
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:41,389
So you think about, you know, substituting this type of job with with, you know, automation or robots or whatever or machines.

387
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:45,380
But there's also the job insecurity that you would create in terms of stress.

388
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:46,590
But, you know,

389
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:58,280
that's for a different conversation where there's talking about how we could have machine and humans work together in the same workspace.

390
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:06,970
So it's possible. Somebody else any any other example.

391
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:20,440
This maybe is a little bit far fetched, but I noticed that they they were standing and I mean, they didn't show their feet.

392
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:26,920
But I am curious, like what they're standing on and like what their shoes were like.

393
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:34,900
We've talked some in class about like ergonomic support and how that is just like really important for.

394
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:42,700
Like longevity of a worker. So, yeah.

395
00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:45,429
Yeah. So that's, that's a great example. Right.

396
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:51,580
And we started talking if we start diving into ergonomics from this, you know, just how do you think about.

397
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:58,750
Did they have engineering control come and actually even look at the height of the belt to the, you know,

398
00:46:58,990 --> 00:47:05,530
to Lucy and her colleagues height to make sure that they're not doing any strenuous

399
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:08,679
movement with their arms reaching out those chocolate and things like that.

400
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:12,330
All of these add to health and well-being of the workers.

401
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:15,890
Excellent. And educate rightly.

402
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:22,440
Think about the example for Lucy's video.

403
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:26,849
Educate about not eating the chocolate and what that could do, what that could do to you.

404
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:32,910
And also education about physical activity within the workplace, talking about workplace redesign,

405
00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:41,250
providing a work environment where people can have the opportunity to take a break and do some physical activity.

406
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:45,990
All of these would would lead to better health, specifically for cardio health.

407
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:54,290
So the total worker health really pushes forward the notion of looking at factors

408
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:59,750
within and outside of the workplace in order to address worker health and well-being.

409
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:04,880
I don't know if you guys have heard of the veteran burner social ecological model,

410
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:09,740
which posits that one's health outcome is dependent upon that person's context.

411
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:20,060
Again, right. We're back to context. That context can be the surrounding environment, neighborhood, family, the workplace, etc.

412
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:28,250
So some ecological conceptual maps include very specific examples, while others include broader concepts.

413
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:33,690
But if you look at all those entities, right, they're essentially saying the same thing.

414
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:39,510
So is this images from healthy people 2020? And this is specifically from the person from the CDC.

415
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:41,009
And they're saying the same thing.

416
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:50,610
You have to determine that the person at the center, you have to look at all these other parts in order to promote the health and well-being.

417
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,670
Now. They asked me to share some of my work.

418
00:48:56,970 --> 00:49:02,820
This is my framework for addressing occupational health disparities, chronic conditions among workers.

419
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:08,580
And I look at all the stress factors, and these are the outcomes or health outcomes.

420
00:49:08,910 --> 00:49:13,850
When I look at the factors, I look at the systems and policy, right?

421
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:21,060
You look at where somebody lives, their environment. We saw success in federal and state policies and local policies.

422
00:49:21,630 --> 00:49:29,090
Now, because we're talking about worker health, I had to remove this from here and really figure out what's work.

423
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:35,240
You know, work environment. And we're talking about work design, the type of industry we talk about, right?

424
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:43,200
How some industries and and workspaces increases one's risk.

425
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:46,290
We're looking at firefighters, truck drivers, etc.

426
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:52,920
And also work policies. And then we're talking about social identity, which I mentioned when I introduced myself.

427
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:57,990
Your socioeconomic status, education level, race, ethnicity,

428
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:04,440
all the isms that could impact your experience and increase or decrease your stress level and experiences.

429
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:06,210
And we're.

430
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:15,730
There is a big more push, push, push and movement towards, you know, epigenetics and genetics and how somebody's predisposition for health outcomes.

431
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:23,920
And looking at transborder. Look at the trans nationalism theoretical framework where we're saying that people who are foreign born,

432
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:31,060
they have the demands not only within their home country, but also their host country and all of that come into play.

433
00:50:31,450 --> 00:50:35,380
Their communities, immediate communities, families as well as coping.

434
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:42,040
Right. We talk about your diet, your physical activity, how you cope with stress, whether you do smoking,

435
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:45,460
whether you increase drinking, all of that increasing your risk for poor health.

436
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:52,239
And so far, I've looked at these static load accelerated aging,

437
00:50:52,240 --> 00:51:01,630
where I look at the blood biomarkers for particular individuals and there specific static load index where higher,

438
00:51:02,410 --> 00:51:07,900
higher score increases your risk for poor outcome and increases your risk for premature death.

439
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:13,360
We're looking at physical and mental health functioning, and of course, we talk about workers.

440
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:23,290
So we have to include work productivity because we know that's that's one of the key factors that would lead us to have employer buy in.

441
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:30,850
Right. Unless we circle back to the employer and say this is causing you money and this is decreasing your

442
00:51:31,150 --> 00:51:37,930
revenue and your profit directly relates to the employer is not only physically present at the workplace,

443
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:46,749
which is presenteeism, I mean, absenteeism or where they're at the workplace, but they're not really they don't have the mental capacity.

444
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:51,640
They're not functioning. They're they're thinking about other stuff. They're distracted, which is presenteeism.

445
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:55,700
This is another view of that.

446
00:51:55,910 --> 00:52:04,520
And I used this this this figure when presenting new nursing audiences or other disciplines that have embraced this socio ecological model.

447
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:10,370
And you'll see the same thing here. And you have the organization which includes the work place and the health outcomes here.

448
00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:19,700
I like to ask this question. Now, we're third year into COVID people's believer.

449
00:52:19,710 --> 00:52:25,530
You know, people are saying COVID is over, but we know that it's not.

450
00:52:25,830 --> 00:52:30,030
So always thinking about how quickly, how quickly we apply to this framework.

451
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:36,799
There have been since since COVID started. And, you know, from 2020, up until now,

452
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:47,000
there have been so much already published in looking at COVID added stress and what that's doing to different entities and individuals.

453
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:55,009
When you look at that, we have seen how COVID has significantly impacted different neighborhoods.

454
00:52:55,010 --> 00:53:01,730
Right, versus others. We've also seen how COVID has in its own more place spaces.

455
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:05,150
Dr. Lee and I are fortunate to be able to even do Zoom.

456
00:53:05,630 --> 00:53:09,080
Right. We're able to work remotely. Essential workers.

457
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:13,300
Other workers are not able to stay home and work.

458
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:18,770
They have to show to show and have the added stress of added pressure.

459
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:23,000
We really need to increase risk for exposure and infection.

460
00:53:24,650 --> 00:53:27,590
Reduced staffing, deal with job insecurity,

461
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:35,570
etc. And then we talk about social support and loneliness we've seen in the literature how and in the news, how people are dealing.

462
00:53:35,810 --> 00:53:41,930
There's increased mental health concerns, increased social issues concern.

463
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:47,690
A lot of it directly related to a sense of loneliness and isolation.

464
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:55,489
And then we see discrimination where certain groups were actually targeted directly with hate

465
00:53:55,490 --> 00:54:01,080
crime experiences because they're saying they brought on the virus and external threat.

466
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:07,430
So there's definitely a stress here. And you at work or in the center, I think there's there's added pressure.

467
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:20,710
So what are some other emerging trends that present a potential risk for worker health and added stress and.

468
00:54:23,770 --> 00:54:28,980
Can you guys think of any? Either what you've heard in your circle,

469
00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:36,840
some of the things that are emerging right now that you think could lead to increased risk for work or health.

470
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:49,130
I mean, I think you kind of alluded to it a little bit with I mean, work from home can be both a benefit and a minus.

471
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:54,850
I mean, if you have 2 hours of commuting in a day, then probably working from home will have a protective effect in your health.

472
00:54:55,750 --> 00:55:01,030
But some work from home situations are either people work longer hours than they would normally,

473
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:07,810
or there's some kind of isolation or a sedentary aspect. So kind of interesting how that works for sure.

474
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:14,020
Thank you, Jason. I am thinking about how little physical activity I've been doing all day.

475
00:55:14,030 --> 00:55:20,050
I've been in meetings back to back and barely think about getting up and stretching all of that.

476
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:26,890
Excellent. And then specifically relating to the occupational health conversation,

477
00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:35,440
I don't know if you guys have heard the increase conversation around gig work and nonstandard work arrangement.

478
00:55:36,970 --> 00:55:45,550
Remote work is considered as part of that contract work or all of that are things that we need to start thinking about deeper.

479
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:54,870
So. We've talked about the job content questionnaire right from the Carousel train model.

480
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:58,800
We talked about the sea grease effort. We were imbalanced model.

481
00:55:59,070 --> 00:56:10,740
But then we also saw all these there are specific questionnaires that can be used to to assess one's risk for poor cardiovascular health,

482
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:14,040
but also thinking about other questionnaire like the work life balance,

483
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:24,869
the family work, conflict, scale, all of these things are what scientists are using and researchers are using to subjectively,

484
00:56:24,870 --> 00:56:30,320
if you will, gain somebody's risk in other things that we haven't been thinking about, right.

485
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:34,769
Trauma, exposure, discriminate, experience of discrimination.

486
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:39,479
These are some of the things that we need to add as occupational health professionals in

487
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:46,260
our make when thinking about those things and also other aspects of structural inequality,

488
00:56:46,290 --> 00:56:50,130
inequities, neighborhood and workplace violence and bullying.

489
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:53,220
And this is why I appreciate the Tool Worker Health Initiative,

490
00:56:53,220 --> 00:57:00,960
because it actually calls for to go beyond those and include those other factors that usually we wouldn't we wouldn't think about.

491
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:14,920
So in the previous slides we talked about the importance of and how to capture stressors or risk factors.

492
00:57:14,950 --> 00:57:18,519
Here I am highlighting the various ways that you can capture the responses.

493
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:26,710
Right. We're talking about exposure versus response. Of course, you had the good old self report diagnosis rate.

494
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:37,660
If you have other if you have diabetes, high blood pressure, you're definitely at risk for poor cardiovascular health if you're sleeping poorly,

495
00:57:38,110 --> 00:57:43,120
looking at your blood pressure again, looking at your cholesterol.

496
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:47,430
Okay. Prediabetes or diabetes.

497
00:57:47,790 --> 00:57:51,300
Looking at your cortisol level, which is a hormone that looks like your stress level.

498
00:57:51,450 --> 00:57:57,300
Right. And then I will start a code, which is which is a composite measure of all these things.

499
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:09,910
And this is a model for a static load. Right. You look at the stress, the stressful environment, including the work place.

500
00:58:10,390 --> 00:58:19,750
Automatically you have your fighter flight. So essentially what we're saying, you know, homeostasis is your normal state, your body's normal state.

501
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:25,180
But then every time you're exposed to stress, you go to work, you're stressed, you're stressed, you come home your stress.

502
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:32,230
If your body never has the time to calm down going from that fight or flight response,

503
00:58:32,230 --> 00:58:41,740
and you're constantly staying at high, high level or fire flight, then you end up having high our static load.

504
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:44,110
You increase your risk for disease.

505
00:58:49,070 --> 00:58:55,490
And when you apply that specifically for a low wage worker, which is what I've done here, I include the stressors, right?

506
00:58:55,490 --> 00:59:04,010
Looking at the stressors from the workplace, non work related stressors, looking at how that your body starts responding.

507
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:08,390
Right. Your, your neuroendocrine system is starting to do something funky.

508
00:59:08,570 --> 00:59:16,250
You start having increased blood pressure reading your C-reactive protein is out of whack, your hemoglobin A1 sees cataracts.

509
00:59:16,490 --> 00:59:22,160
And then you know what I'm not why I didn't adhere are the behavioral coping mechanism.

510
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:32,610
Right? You you get stressed, you go home, you drink. I interviewed hotel room cleaner, actually, who has walked in on a dead person in a guest room.

511
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:37,400
Okay. And I said, so what the job do?

512
00:59:37,850 --> 00:59:41,389
The person said, well, they just sent me home for the day. Right.

513
00:59:41,390 --> 00:59:45,500
And then the next day they come back, the room was right.

514
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:49,939
What do you call the yellow tape, you know, with the police.

515
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:54,050
But then they were able to come back and nobody addressed what happened.

516
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:59,960
So there was no psychological or psychological support, no counseling services or anything.

517
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:07,160
And when I said, So what do you do to cope? The person said, Well, I just smoked my weed, so forget the dead person, right?

518
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:14,630
So just thinking about all those things, not only the behavioral factors, but the organizational factors that would lead to poor coping mechanism.

519
01:00:15,470 --> 01:00:27,740
I've also talked to a hotel room cleaner who during the COVID pandemic, actually hotels are blocking rooms to let that room air out, if you will.

520
01:00:28,370 --> 01:00:32,480
And if somebody checks out today, they don't clean out the same day.

521
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:38,450
They would clean clean the room four days after or five days after the room stays locked.

522
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:45,620
Now, one housekeeper said, well, this guy came and murdered his girlfriend, one of the hotel rooms.

523
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:53,240
And she said, we're lucky that that wasn't one of the rooms that were randomly put into a block room,

524
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:58,700
because imagine a dead body in a hotel room for four or five days.

525
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:03,310
That's that's that's not good. And then you're looking at your tertiary outcome.

526
01:01:03,670 --> 01:01:07,749
That's when you really start developing. Your blood pressure's elevated.

527
01:01:07,750 --> 01:01:11,080
You're not happy. You don't have high blood pressure yet, right?

528
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:16,209
You start looking at a whack. You don't do anything. Then you definitely end up developing the disease.

529
01:01:16,210 --> 01:01:19,480
You have poor mental health and anxiety, all that stuff.

530
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:24,650
And then. What does that lead to decrease work productivity?

531
01:01:26,190 --> 01:01:29,700
Are these hotels that are Rosenberg in the south eastern Michigan.

532
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:35,250
Am I getting murdered in the hotels here?

533
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:38,579
Is this should I be concerned? Oh, and you wouldn't you wouldn't.

534
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:45,030
You wouldn't think. And then you don't even talk to some of the people who work in the big hotels towards Detroit area,

535
01:01:45,030 --> 01:01:54,020
where they have the famous people come and they say they're the worst rooms to clean because there is there's already ads.

536
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:57,660
Yeah. But I mean, you know, right under our noses.

537
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:03,840
You know, I've talked to people who've been sexually abused and talking about the stress there.

538
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:13,500
And they because of fear of losing their jobs, they don't want to report to management because, you know, this industry thrives on customer loyalty.

539
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:18,890
Yeah, right. It's it's insane. We're talking about workers stress.

540
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:23,610
Wow. And here you are worried about bedbugs.

541
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:27,030
Yeah, yeah. Right, right. Wow.

542
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:35,550
And then other ways that we can look at, you know, cardiovascular health.

543
01:02:37,490 --> 01:02:41,720
Across all settings, including health care, exhibition of health and safety.

544
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:45,170
One can look at large data.

545
01:02:45,380 --> 01:02:48,680
That's another thing that we're moving towards, right? Looking at large data.

546
01:02:49,730 --> 01:02:58,490
And we can see that large state. I help reform its approach for technology use in practices to improve quality, care and efficiency.

547
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:06,559
Specifically to Uthealth, we can leverage data to guide our next step and release question.

548
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:10,010
That sent me thinking we need.

549
01:03:11,090 --> 01:03:19,760
Large data. We need enough research to really understand what is happening across industry, across country.

550
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:27,140
And there's definitely room for improvement, right? As you guys will see throughout your studies.

551
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:38,720
Surveillance system is important. Right. Organization having a clear surveillance system to identify near-misses, identify injuries in the workplace.

552
01:03:40,190 --> 01:03:42,200
We really need better sampling frame.

553
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:51,750
We need better study design where a lot of the data that are existing, they're not representative of the population.

554
01:03:51,770 --> 01:03:54,919
They're not inclusive. They're not generalizable.

555
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:57,950
Some of the data findings and also detail outcomes.

556
01:03:59,580 --> 01:04:05,969
And I also mentioned the changing nature of work with workers, robotics and tech.

557
01:04:05,970 --> 01:04:09,930
Says you one of you guys mention, you know, work life balance, workplace stress,

558
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:18,900
all of that are things that we are not doing a good job enough yet to capture work, exposure and health outcomes.

559
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:24,960
Almost done, I promise. Guys, I'm just rambling here.

560
01:04:25,990 --> 01:04:34,710
Now, speaking of big data, these are some large enough sites that are available that people can look at.

561
01:04:34,890 --> 01:04:43,980
Right. And they include some information by occupation as well as indicators on cardiovascular health.

562
01:04:44,790 --> 01:04:49,249
So, for example. A Behavioral risk factor.

563
01:04:49,250 --> 01:04:52,910
Surveillance system dataset is a national data set.

564
01:04:54,100 --> 01:05:06,190
They random they did a random digit dialed telephone survey and across to us and they gathered health related risk behaviors,

565
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:10,480
chronic illnesses and conditions among people who are 18 years and older.

566
01:05:11,020 --> 01:05:23,350
They include industry and occupation and occupation included industry and occupation mom mom's module, and that's included across 2021 states.

567
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:29,320
So definitely if you're in one of your courses, if you were to look at.

568
01:05:30,390 --> 01:05:34,760
Health outcomes for specific industries are occupation.

569
01:05:34,770 --> 01:05:38,400
Consider looking at those databases. They're helpful.

570
01:05:41,340 --> 01:05:46,629
Do we have time for a quick five minute break? Are you guys want to keep continue.

571
01:05:46,630 --> 01:05:49,780
That's the last activity. Yeah. Just continue. Just continue.

572
01:05:50,590 --> 01:05:56,550
All right. I guess you don't deserve a break. We usually don't take a break in this class now.

573
01:05:56,590 --> 01:06:00,700
Oh, okay. So I said zoom breakout.

574
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:06,190
But there's only, you know, there's not a lot of us. So can we just sit here and just talk through this?

575
01:06:06,310 --> 01:06:09,340
Yeah. Yeah. All right, so I'll pause.

576
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:13,029
I'll mute myself to let you guys reap this.

577
01:06:13,030 --> 01:06:16,600
And then anybody who wants to jump in to answer some of those questions.

578
01:06:22,590 --> 01:06:25,590
You guys are so quiet. I don't know if it's because I'm doing a terrible job.

579
01:06:25,590 --> 01:06:32,370
I'm talking too much. You guys are tired, you know, they're very tired of you in person.

580
01:06:32,370 --> 01:06:38,430
So, you know, the pros and the cons of going out on Zoom again.

581
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:45,810
Next time I shall show up and then I'll I'll just bring my my kid attached to me, and maybe [INAUDIBLE] help you guys talk.

582
01:06:48,980 --> 01:06:52,030
Are you guys reading it? Yep. Okay.

583
01:07:18,630 --> 01:07:39,370
Mine all the typos. Okay.

584
01:07:39,630 --> 01:07:45,120
So who can address her first question about key factors that increase Jessica's risk for CVD?

585
01:07:55,700 --> 01:08:00,230
It looks like she smokes and then she might.

586
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:12,050
That job might be stressful for her. And based on her A1 fear her blood glucose, she probably is diabetic and may or may not be diagnosed.

587
01:08:17,490 --> 01:08:20,980
Sorry. Go ahead. Yeah.

588
01:08:21,020 --> 01:08:26,479
Just sitting on top of that. The fact that she doesn't have health insurance also means she probably doesn't routinely see a doctor,

589
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:30,440
which means there's probably also different risk factors. And that is a risk factor.

590
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:34,130
And if the stuff. Great.

591
01:08:35,590 --> 01:08:38,630
Take one last one. It's just like her living environment.

592
01:08:38,650 --> 01:08:42,730
She's in a small apartment with her four kids and she doesn't feel safe to go out in the neighborhood.

593
01:08:43,780 --> 01:08:46,929
So that's just one other area that's just like like you were saying earlier.

594
01:08:46,930 --> 01:08:50,979
It's there's always in that fight scenario, some that were able to, like,

595
01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:56,710
really relax and just kind of let your body go into a normal stance for a little bit.

596
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:04,780
Very good. Well, what other pertinent information?

597
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:09,880
Just looking at this case, what would you like to know more about?

598
01:09:14,380 --> 01:09:22,120
There's a lot of information here. I think one thing I don't I miss is just like eating habits, nutrition that they're able to have access to.

599
01:09:22,510 --> 01:09:31,420
I assume that hopefully that she's able to get on some a food assistance program so she doesn't make much and she has four kids at home.

600
01:09:31,430 --> 01:09:37,180
So just understanding what nutrition values that they have at the home or what they have access to.

601
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:47,600
Very good. What about the work environment? Are there any pertinent information they would like to know?

602
01:09:47,910 --> 01:09:49,010
You know, with her jobs,

603
01:09:49,010 --> 01:09:57,050
or do you do you think you have a do you guys think you have a good grasp of what it entails to be a farm worker or working at a meat packing plant?

604
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:06,860
One little one that I'd want to understand is this kind of what safety measures she has as a hotel cleaner,

605
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:10,910
like using those chemicals day in and day out, cleaning 30 rooms per day.

606
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:16,260
She's gonna be exposed to a lot of different chemicals, so I don't know if that's going to be impacting her cardiovascular disease.

607
01:10:16,260 --> 01:10:21,990
I'm sure there is some evidence that it does. In fact, it. But just understanding that for other general health.

608
01:10:25,230 --> 01:10:30,180
Yeah, definitely. Anybody else.

609
01:10:32,810 --> 01:10:36,860
I had a curious AC. Like maybe what some buffer factors are.

610
01:10:36,890 --> 01:10:47,420
Right. So does she have coworkers support, for example, or does she have any like social capital that she can use?

611
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:51,800
Is there even supervisor support really?

612
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:57,470
You know, does she have any like satisfaction from her job at all?

613
01:10:57,830 --> 01:11:01,070
So things that kind of balance out the strain.

614
01:11:02,330 --> 01:11:10,970
Right. And of course, you know, here's to dreaming that her workplace would provide some type of card for a gym membership.

615
01:11:11,510 --> 01:11:20,940
Right. We've probably not. How what would you guys do to assess her, her risk?

616
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:30,030
We talked about the various ways that you can do an assessment or explore, you know, the risk for for cardio health.

617
01:11:32,930 --> 01:11:37,230
My answer for always when working with individuals and communities is talk to them.

618
01:11:37,250 --> 01:11:41,659
So just seeing what they think is high risk and just kind of learning about their day

619
01:11:41,660 --> 01:11:46,540
to day life and then understanding like those activities can lead to this for you.

620
01:11:46,550 --> 01:11:50,030
So just kind of doing a survey or interview with some to understand.

621
01:11:51,870 --> 01:11:55,500
Their day to day life and how it impacts are cardiovascular diseases.

622
01:11:57,630 --> 01:12:00,690
Yeah. So Sam says he would interview.

623
01:12:03,350 --> 01:12:10,569
What else would you guys do? I mean, I'm not a doctor, but I mean, if you were trying to assess cardiovascular health,

624
01:12:10,570 --> 01:12:14,710
I mean, you'd take blood pressure measurements, blood draws, stuff like that.

625
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:18,340
I mean, Brigitte mentioned that she might be pre-diabetic or diabetic.

626
01:12:18,340 --> 01:12:21,430
So blood sugar, potentially. Perfect.

627
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:29,499
Yeah. And and you remember in the previous slides we talked about, you know, doing all of those things, you know,

628
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:38,920
measuring the blood pressure, doing some blood draw, looking at those other associated co-morbidities would be great.

629
01:12:39,970 --> 01:12:44,170
What about some of the health related surveys that we talked about?

630
01:12:44,410 --> 01:12:50,209
Do you think any of those are worthwhile? Yeah.

631
01:12:50,210 --> 01:12:55,430
Let's do the MRI dry or even the job strain.

632
01:12:55,430 --> 01:12:55,810
Right.

633
01:12:56,060 --> 01:13:08,360
Because I'm trying to wonder, a worker like Jessica, would they even see, you know, the year I asked for the person to identify some type of reward?

634
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:13,650
What would be her reward? Oh, you know.

635
01:13:14,250 --> 01:13:18,150
Well, that one we can also assess, like over commitment as well.

636
01:13:19,770 --> 01:13:23,330
Uh. Definitely effort.

637
01:13:23,340 --> 01:13:25,290
We could assess the effort, the reward.

638
01:13:25,290 --> 01:13:35,940
There's you know, the dollars an hour is not enough, but there are some other benefits to the job that she feels like she has.

639
01:13:36,330 --> 01:13:43,580
Yeah. And what are some areas of intervention not only within the community but also, you know,

640
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:49,080
individual and level of intervention, also more importantly, organizational intervention.

641
01:13:50,380 --> 01:14:11,540
For Jessica. You guys think? I mean, the the easiest drawing probably would be the some kind of a any smoking intervention.

642
01:14:11,660 --> 01:14:20,290
I mean, ideally it'd be like get a help getter, a higher paying job and health insurance and that kind of stuff.

643
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:25,520
But I mean, the easiest right would potentially be intervening with the smoking ban,

644
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:29,240
potentially save some money to maybe shifters healthier behaviors.

645
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:36,290
Yeah, I'm with Josh. There's a lot of fundamental issues that's going on causing these behaviors to come out.

646
01:14:36,290 --> 01:14:43,249
So we can't fix immigration in the United States to help her get her husband back and stuff like that.

647
01:14:43,250 --> 01:14:51,360
So I think I like the other dimension of kind of just mitigating the risk factors that's in her life.

648
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:57,200
So smoking, drinking. If there's ways now I understand her, it's probably very stressful.

649
01:14:57,200 --> 01:15:01,190
So she just kind of showing new coping mechanisms and might be healthier.

650
01:15:01,820 --> 01:15:05,059
Yeah. Yeah.

651
01:15:05,060 --> 01:15:07,100
I think you guys are alluding to all those things. Right.

652
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:15,799
And more importantly, what what we're trying to push people to do is actually think beyond the individual work or what they can do.

653
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:22,790
Right. That's why the tool work health is really pushing for organizational change,

654
01:15:23,030 --> 01:15:28,910
because we can teach we can definitely do intervention where we teach Jessica how to code better.

655
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:33,590
But is the stress the source of the stress is not gone.

656
01:15:34,460 --> 01:15:40,730
She's got she's going to need some type of you know, it's it's going to she's going to continue to be at risk for her health.

657
01:15:45,820 --> 01:15:49,690
I said unionize. She Yeah, that's what I was looking at.

658
01:15:49,690 --> 01:16:01,600
The SEIU, SEIU iUe is a Service Workers International Union and my mom is part of that as a certified nursing assistant at a senior home.

659
01:16:02,620 --> 01:16:05,229
So definitely would like unionization.

660
01:16:05,230 --> 01:16:17,530
For example, they can lobby for better working conditions, higher pay, mandatory breaks, perhaps hazard pay if it's like in a covered scenario, right.

661
01:16:18,130 --> 01:16:24,310
Making, you know, collective bargaining and like working things out with management because I mean,

662
01:16:24,310 --> 01:16:30,340
like, you know, Sam and Josh, an ideal world, right? She would stop smoking, maybe eat healthier.

663
01:16:30,940 --> 01:16:39,430
Very seldom does somebody replace something like smoking, for example, with, like something super healthy, like jogging.

664
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:44,829
So, like we talked about in class, right.

665
01:16:44,830 --> 01:16:51,580
Taking less of the onus off of the individual, putting, like Dr. Rosenberg said, more on the organization.

666
01:16:53,340 --> 01:16:56,549
Yeah. And last but not least, you know, I realize.

667
01:16:56,550 --> 01:17:04,470
Very nice work. You guys were telling me about your contacts. You didn't tell me that everybody shared what tracker in.

668
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:12,660
And of course, we're trying to really move forward to towards interdisciplinary approach to work our health and well-being.

669
01:17:13,410 --> 01:17:17,720
Is everybody in the same program? They are not now.

670
01:17:18,220 --> 01:17:23,830
Oh, so this is great. So how does this real this case relate to your profession or current training?

671
01:17:24,010 --> 01:17:27,969
So first tell me your profession and then tell me how does this case relate?

672
01:17:27,970 --> 01:17:34,120
And this is an opportunity for everybody to share. And that's the last thing before we go.

673
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:42,870
Who wants to go first? Well, I'm in the investment promotion and policy track.

674
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:47,850
So obviously the higher level issues are kind of what I'm interested in is in living

675
01:17:47,850 --> 01:17:51,630
wages and unionization and all that kind of stuff and how it impacts health.

676
01:17:51,870 --> 01:17:58,109
So. Great. So this definitely relates to your profession, right?

677
01:17:58,110 --> 01:18:01,230
Josh And especially when we talk about the interventions that we would do.

678
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:13,270
Who's next? Should I call it?

679
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:19,650
What do you think? I'm from industrial hygiene.

680
01:18:20,620 --> 01:18:28,150
Program and. Let's thinking about maybe.

681
01:18:33,590 --> 01:18:43,280
There's. Working environments exposures that.

682
01:18:48,660 --> 01:18:55,740
Yeah. In somebody. Yeah. Somebody talked about, you know, the the the chemicals.

683
01:18:56,250 --> 01:19:00,060
Right. She's about the chemicals that they're using. That's definitely that.

684
01:19:00,270 --> 01:19:06,809
And I actually did a project with a post-doc from school public health, you know, in this area.

685
01:19:06,810 --> 01:19:16,110
And she's an industrial hygienist, I believe. And she looked at the toxic chemicals, you know, the viruses in there.

686
01:19:16,110 --> 01:19:23,370
And they were high presence of her aldehyde among the the room cleaners and specifically the laundry workers.

687
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:28,870
So you're right there. Yeah. Yeah. Who else?

688
01:19:29,290 --> 01:19:35,750
We have two more people to share. I can go quickly.

689
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:38,900
I'm in Health Behavior and Health Education Department,

690
01:19:39,950 --> 01:19:45,230
and I like how you challenge us to think about the organization itself instead of changing the individual.

691
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:51,660
That's kind of like. Where I think you can have, you know, wide stance change.

692
01:19:51,660 --> 01:20:00,600
So kind of looking at how we can approach these organizations to show them how it's mutually beneficial for them and the employees to have better,

693
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:03,720
healthier, better, healthier employees. So.

694
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:08,579
Yeah. Thank you. We lost. We lost a few.

695
01:20:08,580 --> 01:20:11,650
Mary Ann. Yeah, I see that. Well, we're we're.

696
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:21,170
We're done. This is the last slide anyway. I always like to push students to think about self care.

697
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:25,290
We're talking about worker health and safety, and we're talking about stress management.

698
01:20:25,740 --> 01:20:30,330
And, you know, we can't be sugar crowd if we're not doing it ourselves.

699
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:32,600
And I need to do a better job,

700
01:20:32,610 --> 01:20:41,519
a self clear just thinking about what your what does right currently and will your self care plan look during your studies

701
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:48,090
whatever year you are in your program and also in your future job as a health professional and public health professional,

702
01:20:48,450 --> 01:20:53,910
you know, what are you doing to maintain your mental health and well-being, your body?

703
01:20:55,260 --> 01:21:06,839
Identify your support system, spiritual, emotional approach to self-care, your personal model, and what you want to accomplish moving, moving forward.

704
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:10,560
And, you know, actually probably has heard me say this before.

705
01:21:10,860 --> 01:21:16,469
In the past, my personal motto used to be like one from the Maza, where it says Failure is not an option.

706
01:21:16,470 --> 01:21:19,850
And then I said, that doesn't make sense. Right? That's a lot of pressure.

707
01:21:19,860 --> 01:21:22,470
Failure has to be an action because that's how you learn.

708
01:21:22,890 --> 01:21:31,050
So now my motto is, is my mantra is from Finding Nemo, where, you know, Dory keeps saying, just keep swimming.

709
01:21:31,290 --> 01:21:35,370
So my motto is, keep swimming. Soccer is not an option.

710
01:21:35,670 --> 01:21:42,950
So just food for thought for you guys to think about. What would your self care plan look like if you don't have one?

711
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:46,950
Just start thinking about it. Thank you so much.

712
01:21:46,950 --> 01:21:51,540
And that's it. That's all I have left. You can see where she's on Meredith.

713
01:21:51,810 --> 01:21:59,850
Linda says thank you. Dr. Rosenberg, we thank you so much for taking the time to give this guest lecture today,

714
01:21:59,850 --> 01:22:04,040
because I know you're still on leave, so it's greatly appreciated.

715
01:22:04,050 --> 01:22:07,890
We lost a few folks, but I'm recording the sessions.

716
01:22:07,890 --> 01:22:13,350
I'll post a session on canvas. If they have additional questions.

717
01:22:13,350 --> 01:22:17,729
Can they reach out to you on. Yes, please. And you can give them my email address.

718
01:22:17,730 --> 01:22:23,160
I think it's on the slides, too. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Okay. Thank you so much again, Dr. Rosenberg.

719
01:22:23,850 --> 01:22:29,700
Thank you. Dr. Lee, thank you for your time. Thank you, everyone, for your attention, I.
