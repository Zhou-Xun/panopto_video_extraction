1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,691
In this session, we're going to discuss Cystic Fibrosis.

2
00:00:05,691 --> 00:00:11,283
Learning objectives are to describe the following attributes of cystic fibrosis.

3
00:00:11,283 --> 00:00:16,600
The basic epidemiology, symptoms and affected organ systems, the genetics,

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:22,072
including the mode of transmission, the genes that are involved in the mutational

5
00:00:22,072 --> 00:00:27,181
spectrum, the biological pathways that are disrupted and the treatments.

6
00:00:27,181 --> 00:00:30,996
You'll also describe the role of carrier testing and

7
00:00:30,996 --> 00:00:33,973
newborn screening for cystic fibrosis.

8
00:00:33,973 --> 00:00:40,116
And talk about the challenges associated

9
00:00:40,116 --> 00:00:46,969
with each of these public health approaches.

10
00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:48,578
So to start with some history, there's a quote that says,

11
00:00:48,578 --> 00:00:50,391
woe to the child which when kissed on the forehead, tastes salty.

12
00:00:50,391 --> 00:00:53,421
He is Bewitched and soon must die.

13
00:00:53,421 --> 00:00:57,644
Cystic fibrosis routinely killed children in early Europe and

14
00:00:57,644 --> 00:01:01,001
was identifiable by excessive salt in the sweat.

15
00:01:01,001 --> 00:01:04,584
And so when you kiss these kids on the forehead,

16
00:01:04,584 --> 00:01:07,191
you could taste that excess salt.

17
00:01:07,191 --> 00:01:12,260
Today many people with cystic fibrosis live well into their thirties, forties or

18
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:17,188
fifties, because of recognizing the disease early and being able to treat it.

19
00:01:17,188 --> 00:01:21,090
But it's still considered a lethal genetic disease, and

20
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:26,188
we want to catch it in childhood so that we can do everything we can to make sure

21
00:01:26,188 --> 00:01:31,871
that someone with cystic fibrosis has all the treatment options available to them.

22
00:01:31,871 --> 00:01:36,463
Also, ideally, we want to actually prevent the birth of

23
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:41,250
children that have cystic fibrosis because although it's

24
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:45,732
a treatable disease, it is one that causes very early death.

25
00:01:46,241 --> 00:01:51,512
About 1 in 25 people with European ancestry are carriers for

26
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:54,998
a mutation that causes cystic fibrosis.

27
00:01:54,998 --> 00:01:59,340
So, if you think about Caucasian Americans, for example,

28
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:04,032
about 1 in 30 actually are carriers for a CF causing mutation.

29
00:02:04,032 --> 00:02:11,138
And there are about 1 in 2500 births among people who identify as Caucasian or

30
00:02:11,138 --> 00:02:15,161
white, that actually have cystic fibrosis.

31
00:02:15,161 --> 00:02:19,629
The carrier frequency and other ethnic groups is somewhat lower.

32
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:24,604
So 1 in 46 in Hispanics, 1 in 65 in African ancestry and

33
00:02:24,604 --> 00:02:27,541
about 1 in 90 in Asian ancestry.

34
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:33,651
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend that all adults

35
00:02:33,651 --> 00:02:39,430
who are planning a pregnancy are screened for cystic fibrosis carrier status.

36
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:44,383
So this is an example where we're actually using genetic testing

37
00:02:44,383 --> 00:02:48,614
in adults of reproductive age to look at their genome and

38
00:02:48,614 --> 00:02:53,207
see if they carry mutations that can cause cystic fibrosis,

39
00:02:53,207 --> 00:02:57,257
even though those adults don't have cystic fibrosis

40
00:02:57,257 --> 00:03:01,881
themselves because this is part of planning for pregnancy.

41
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:05,719
And you would want to know, for example, if you're at risk for

42
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:08,046
having a child with cystic fibrosis.

43
00:03:08,046 --> 00:03:10,938
So the first line of defense and

44
00:03:10,938 --> 00:03:16,401
preventing cystic fibrosis is adult carrier screening.

45
00:03:16,401 --> 00:03:18,561
When children are born with cystic fibrosis.

46
00:03:18,561 --> 00:03:25,255
We also screen for that at the newborn screening stage.

47
00:03:25,255 --> 00:03:29,919
The discovery of the gene for cystic fibrosis, or

48
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:36,151
the CFTR gene was done in 1989 by Francis Collins who was at.

49
00:03:36,151 --> 00:03:43,037
The gene is called CFTR, it's located on chromosome 7q31.2.

50
00:03:43,037 --> 00:03:46,723
And cystic fibrosis is caused by having mutations in

51
00:03:46,723 --> 00:03:48,914
both copies of your CFTR gene.

52
00:03:48,914 --> 00:03:52,871
So it's an autism or recessive disease.

53
00:03:55,908 --> 00:03:59,568
The CFTR protein serves as a channel, so

54
00:03:59,568 --> 00:04:03,672
that chloride can enter and leave the cells.

55
00:04:03,672 --> 00:04:08,428
And when you have damage that chloride channel, it actually prevents chloride

56
00:04:08,428 --> 00:04:11,841
from being properly transported in and out of the cells.

57
00:04:11,841 --> 00:04:17,070
And that actually affects the wateriness of the mucus that are excreted,

58
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,865
for example, from epithelial cells.

59
00:04:19,865 --> 00:04:26,381
So people have looked at functional studies of the CFTR protein.

60
00:04:26,381 --> 00:04:31,414
To try to better understand the role that that protein plays in the cell,

61
00:04:31,414 --> 00:04:36,365
and how that loss of chloride movement actually brings across the overt

62
00:04:36,365 --> 00:04:38,282
signs of cystic fibrosis.

63
00:04:38,282 --> 00:04:41,411
So, what really is causing the symptoms?

64
00:04:41,411 --> 00:04:46,939
And it's also important to study the protein from the CFTR gene,

65
00:04:46,939 --> 00:04:51,160
because we want to know what kind of treatments can

66
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,395
restore the cellular function for individuals.

67
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:59,111
Here's the CFTR gene and protein.

68
00:04:59,111 --> 00:05:04,877
So here is the piece of DNA that contains the region on chromosome seven,

69
00:05:04,877 --> 00:05:08,671
the long arm that has the cystic fibrosis gene.

70
00:05:08,671 --> 00:05:11,335
And here is the gene and

71
00:05:11,335 --> 00:05:17,366
all of these little small white pieces are the exons

72
00:05:17,366 --> 00:05:22,424
that are part of the cystic fibrosis gene.

73
00:05:22,424 --> 00:05:28,365
And these exons make a protein product and the protein has different domains.

74
00:05:28,365 --> 00:05:33,279
And so when you look at the protein in a cell, this is the inside of the cell,

75
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:38,204
this is the cell membrane and this is the outside of the cell, for example.

76
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:43,152
And the protein actually is a transmembrane protein.

77
00:05:43,152 --> 00:05:48,346
So it goes in and out of the cell and through the cell membrane.

78
00:05:48,346 --> 00:05:52,981
And that is actually what causes it to be an ion channel.

79
00:05:52,981 --> 00:05:58,062
So when it's actually in the cell membrane, these pieces that are going

80
00:05:58,062 --> 00:06:03,331
through the membrane will actually come together and form an ion channel.

81
00:06:03,331 --> 00:06:06,602
There are 24 exons in the CFTR gene,

82
00:06:06,602 --> 00:06:11,519
there are 1480 amino acids in the finished protein.

83
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:15,772
It has two transmembrane domains two ATP binding domains.

84
00:06:15,772 --> 00:06:20,199
And remember that ATP is the energy for the cell.

85
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:23,388
And one regulatory domain.

86
00:06:23,388 --> 00:06:28,325
And in humans we have high levels of the CFTR protein on

87
00:06:28,325 --> 00:06:32,829
epithelial surfaces in many different organs,

88
00:06:32,829 --> 00:06:37,880
including the gastrointestinal track, salivary and

89
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:42,603
sweat glands, lungs especially prenatal lungs,

90
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:46,909
submucosal glands and reproductive organs.

91
00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:52,518
So here's a picture of the folded structure of the CFTR protein.

92
00:06:52,518 --> 00:06:57,355
And here again you've got the cell membrane, this is the inside of the cell.

93
00:06:57,355 --> 00:06:59,861
Let's say it could be an epithelial cell.

94
00:06:59,861 --> 00:07:01,741
This is the outside of the cell.

95
00:07:01,741 --> 00:07:06,206
And what's happening is that this protein forms a channel or poor.

96
00:07:06,206 --> 00:07:09,302
And the chloride can move, for example,

97
00:07:09,302 --> 00:07:15,068
from the inside of the cell out through this poor into the outside of the cell.

98
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:18,008
And actually this protein functions using ATP.

99
00:07:18,008 --> 00:07:23,102
So ATP needs to bind here and here for this protein to function.

100
00:07:23,102 --> 00:07:30,076
And so it's called an ATP-gated anion channel, chloride is the anion.

101
00:07:30,076 --> 00:07:34,233
The ATP when it binds drives changes in the protein

102
00:07:34,233 --> 00:07:38,294
confirmation that actually opens up the gate and

103
00:07:38,294 --> 00:07:44,450
allows those chloride anions to flow out of the cell or even into the cell.

104
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:51,812
Normally you're gonna move chloride out of the epithelial cell and into the mucus.

105
00:07:51,812 --> 00:07:55,150
There's also a site I wanna show you here,

106
00:07:55,150 --> 00:08:00,084
right here, by this ATP binding domain on the right hand side.

107
00:08:00,084 --> 00:08:04,091
It says in this picture site of common phenylalanine deletion.

108
00:08:04,091 --> 00:08:08,086
So we're gonna talk later about one of the, well really,

109
00:08:09,209 --> 00:08:15,281
the most important mutation in CFTR and it's called delta F508.

110
00:08:15,281 --> 00:08:21,311
And this is the site and the protein where that's located.

111
00:08:21,311 --> 00:08:26,266
So the affected organ systems are actually pretty widespread when you

112
00:08:26,266 --> 00:08:28,620
have a mutation in the CFTR gene.

113
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:34,774
So duct systems and other passageways and multiple organs become clogged and

114
00:08:34,774 --> 00:08:38,952
blocked with unusually thick secretions of mucus.

115
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:41,681
And that causes the most problems in the pancreas.

116
00:08:41,681 --> 00:08:46,031
So the pancreas delivers digestive enzymes to the intestines.

117
00:08:46,031 --> 00:08:50,503
And that becomes blocked really often in people who have cystic fibrosis.

118
00:08:50,503 --> 00:08:54,030
And that means that they can't break down food and

119
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:58,821
extract nutrients and they can have vitamin deficiency from that.

120
00:08:58,821 --> 00:09:03,700
The other really important place that is affected by mutations

121
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,473
in the CFTR protein is in the lungs.

122
00:09:06,473 --> 00:09:07,301
And the decreased chloride movement across the epithelial cells there,

123
00:09:07,301 --> 00:09:08,179
causes lack of mucus hydration and the mucus in the lungs becomes very thick and

124
00:09:08,179 --> 00:09:08,697
very heavy, and it decreases lung function or

125
00:09:08,697 --> 00:09:09,423
pulmonary function and people can't really breathe as easy.

126
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:15,369
And also it causes

127
00:09:15,369 --> 00:09:23,695
chronic colonization or

128
00:09:23,695 --> 00:09:28,057
infection by

129
00:09:28,057 --> 00:09:35,993
bacteria in the lungs.

130
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:40,250
So here is just a schematic of all of the different organ systems that

131
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:45,271
are affected by cystic fibrosis that some of them we've already talked about.

132
00:09:45,271 --> 00:09:48,955
What's also kind of interesting is that for example,

133
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:53,691
reproductive systems can be affected by cystic fibrosis mutations.

134
00:09:53,691 --> 00:09:59,591
So sometimes, there are a lot of different mutations for cystic fibrosis and

135
00:09:59,591 --> 00:10:04,674
actually some of them don't have any effect on the lung function or

136
00:10:04,674 --> 00:10:06,521
on the pancreas at all.

137
00:10:06,521 --> 00:10:09,912
Sometimes they just have an effect on the reproductive system.

138
00:10:09,912 --> 00:10:13,476
And so it you get these instances where for example,

139
00:10:13,476 --> 00:10:18,335
a man will be not able to have kids, will be infertile and they'll go and

140
00:10:18,335 --> 00:10:21,255
they'll have some genetic testing done.

141
00:10:21,255 --> 00:10:27,070
And what they'll actually find is that he's got mutations and

142
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:29,594
his CFTR encoding genes and

143
00:10:29,594 --> 00:10:35,093
actually the problem with the fertility is caused by that.

144
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:37,411
But he doesn't have any other symptoms.

145
00:10:37,411 --> 00:10:42,936
But most people with these mutations if they're affected it'll

146
00:10:42,936 --> 00:10:48,467
be in the pancreas, in the lungs and some of these other systems.

147
00:10:48,467 --> 00:10:53,471
The level of the expressed C FTR, RNA can vary

148
00:10:53,471 --> 00:10:58,888
over time from fetal development to adulthood.

149
00:10:58,888 --> 00:11:02,663
And it also varies by tissue type, and so

150
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:07,884
people have really thought about what actually might be

151
00:11:07,884 --> 00:11:13,343
modifying how much CFTR is made and how well it functions.

152
00:11:13,343 --> 00:11:18,101
So one thought is that metabolic factors might play a role,

153
00:11:18,101 --> 00:11:22,574
and this includes things like hormones and cytokines or

154
00:11:22,574 --> 00:11:25,917
the inflammatory signaling molecules.

155
00:11:25,917 --> 00:11:30,331
It's thought that these factors might influence the proteins,

156
00:11:30,331 --> 00:11:35,079
either gene expression or the quantity of that protein that's made.

157
00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:39,299
Or the functional activity or the quality of the protein that's made and

158
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:41,316
how well it functions in the cell.

159
00:11:41,316 --> 00:11:46,287
And it's likely that these influences of these different

160
00:11:46,287 --> 00:11:49,544
factors also vary across cell types.

161
00:11:49,544 --> 00:11:55,522
So one hint we have about hormones is the gender gap for cystic fibrosis.

162
00:11:55,522 --> 00:12:00,121
Females with cystic fibrosis tend to fare more poorly than males.

163
00:12:00,121 --> 00:12:02,391
So they have worse symptoms.

164
00:12:02,391 --> 00:12:08,485
They have a survival disadvantage and they have decreased lung function.

165
00:12:08,485 --> 00:12:12,576
And it's thought that female hormones especially estrogen,

166
00:12:12,576 --> 00:12:17,062
plays a role in the development of the lung function exacerbations.

167
00:12:17,062 --> 00:12:20,987
And so that could be through compromising the immune response,

168
00:12:20,987 --> 00:12:24,548
through reduction in airway surface liquid dynamics, or

169
00:12:24,548 --> 00:12:28,125
directly acting on bacteria that colonized the airways.

170
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:33,030
And because of that, because we think estrogen might exacerbate

171
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:36,787
the effects of having mutations in the CFTR gene.

172
00:12:36,787 --> 00:12:39,608
There's some new evidence that birth control

173
00:12:39,608 --> 00:12:43,944
hormones which actually suppress estrogen may help to improve lung function.

174
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:50,451
In the next section we're going to talk about CFTR mutations and their effects.

175
00:12:50,451 --> 00:12:57,104
So there's one mutation called the DeltaF508 mutation.

176
00:12:57,104 --> 00:13:02,312
That's the loss of just one amino acid phenylalanine.

177
00:13:02,312 --> 00:13:06,634
And this mutation at the 508th code on,

178
00:13:06,634 --> 00:13:10,475
in the CFTR protein is responsible for

179
00:13:10,475 --> 00:13:14,569
the majority of cystic fibrosis cases.

180
00:13:14,569 --> 00:13:19,201
It's just one amino acid out of the 1480 in the protein.

181
00:13:19,201 --> 00:13:24,754
But this slight change is enough to really disrupt the function

182
00:13:24,754 --> 00:13:29,584
of patient's lungs, sweat glands and the pancreas.

183
00:13:29,584 --> 00:13:34,337
So deltaF508 is the most common mutation when you look at CFTR

184
00:13:34,337 --> 00:13:36,548
mutations around the world.

185
00:13:36,548 --> 00:13:42,232
So when they look at people who have cystic fibrosis, 66% or

186
00:13:42,232 --> 00:13:50,091
2/3 of the chromosomes that carry a CFTR mutation actually have the delta F508.

187
00:13:50,091 --> 00:13:53,472
So this is a really ancient mutation.

188
00:13:53,472 --> 00:13:59,211
But there are in total over 1700 different mutations that have been identified.

189
00:13:59,211 --> 00:14:04,504
So most of them are private or found in only a very small number of people, and

190
00:14:04,504 --> 00:14:09,718
some of them are specific to certain ethnic groups, and some of them don't

191
00:14:09,718 --> 00:14:14,883
cause that classic CF with the lung function disruption in the pancreas.

192
00:14:14,883 --> 00:14:17,465
If you look worldwide, there are about 10 or

193
00:14:17,465 --> 00:14:21,056
20 mutations that we would consider a little bit more common.

194
00:14:21,056 --> 00:14:24,704
And that means that the prevalence or the allele frequency of them.

195
00:14:24,704 --> 00:14:27,999
When you look across cystic fibrosis

196
00:14:27,999 --> 00:14:32,684
causing chromosomes is greater than about .1%.

197
00:14:32,684 --> 00:14:37,996
In most European countries, you'll see an average of about 10 mutations account for

198
00:14:37,996 --> 00:14:43,111
about 80% of of CF alleles and that includes the delta F508, most of the time.

199
00:14:43,111 --> 00:14:48,196
And in some other countries, like Spain, Bulgaria, Greece and

200
00:14:48,196 --> 00:14:53,097
Turkey, you actually need about 25 mutations to account for

201
00:14:53,097 --> 00:14:56,348
about the same proportion of CF alleles.

202
00:14:56,348 --> 00:15:01,174
And so the reason why, is that these countries Were serving as historic

203
00:15:01,174 --> 00:15:05,050
gateways into Europe from the Middle East and Asia.

204
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:09,974
And so in those countries they have a mutation spectrum that's a little bit

205
00:15:09,974 --> 00:15:14,585
more diverse and richer because people who came up from Middle East and

206
00:15:14,585 --> 00:15:18,431
Asia, some of them might have stayed in those countries.

207
00:15:18,431 --> 00:15:23,191
And so you actually see more diversity in the CF causing

208
00:15:23,191 --> 00:15:26,092
chromosomes in those gateway countries.

209
00:15:26,929 --> 00:15:32,125
When you look at about 44,000 chromosomes that were collected

210
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:37,592
from populations around the world in people that have cystic fibrosis,

211
00:15:37,592 --> 00:15:42,697
what you'll find again is that the Delta F508 was accounting for

212
00:15:42,697 --> 00:15:45,495
about 66% of those chromosomes.

213
00:15:45,495 --> 00:15:49,904
The highest prevalence is in Caucasian or

214
00:15:49,904 --> 00:15:54,192
really just European ancestry people.

215
00:15:54,192 --> 00:15:59,100
The next most common mutation, G 542X accounted for

216
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:04,323
2.5% of the chromosomes that cause cystic fibrosis and

217
00:16:04,323 --> 00:16:08,406
the highest prevalence there was in Spanish.

218
00:16:08,406 --> 00:16:11,457
So you can see that there's a delta F 508 and

219
00:16:11,457 --> 00:16:16,240
then there's a few other ones that are at relatively high frequencies.

220
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,732
And if you look in certain populations though,

221
00:16:19,732 --> 00:16:24,809
you can find that some mutations that are very population specific.

222
00:16:24,809 --> 00:16:29,236
So for example, if you look at Canadian Hutterites which

223
00:16:29,236 --> 00:16:34,127
are a religious sect similar to the Amish in the United States,

224
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:39,755
about 70% of the chromosomes that were causing CF there had a mutation

225
00:16:39,755 --> 00:16:45,534
M1101K that was actually private to the Canadian Hutterite population.

226
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:52,136
The percentage of people with the delta F508 mutation varies across ethnic group.

227
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:57,278
For example, in South Africa, of the chromosomes that caused

228
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:03,599
CF had the delta F508 mutation but in North Africa it was closer to 50%.

229
00:17:03,599 --> 00:17:08,556
You can also see in Europe, the frequency of

230
00:17:08,556 --> 00:17:13,648
the delta F508 mutation varied from about

231
00:17:13,648 --> 00:17:18,170
45% of CF chromosomes to about 77%.

232
00:17:18,479 --> 00:17:21,900
If you look across populations in the United States,

233
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,874
the ethnic background also plays a role here.

234
00:17:24,874 --> 00:17:29,397
So if you look at Caucasians in general,

235
00:17:29,397 --> 00:17:36,322
65% of the CF chromosomes had the delta F508 mutation.

236
00:17:36,322 --> 00:17:40,871
But that proportion was lower for Jewish ancestries and

237
00:17:40,871 --> 00:17:43,784
higher for non Jewish ancestries.

238
00:17:43,784 --> 00:17:48,996
If you look at self proclaimed American Blacks, for

239
00:17:48,996 --> 00:17:54,326
example, the delta F508 prevalence on CF causing

240
00:17:54,326 --> 00:17:59,238
chromosomes was actually quite low was only about 37%.

241
00:18:00,256 --> 00:18:04,675
So if we look at the CF mutations and how they're distributed in the CF gene,

242
00:18:04,675 --> 00:18:07,930
we actually see there's a ton of different mutations.

243
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:11,036
Remember I told you there was about 1700.

244
00:18:11,036 --> 00:18:13,956
So here's the five prime end of the CFTR gene.

245
00:18:13,956 --> 00:18:17,844
Here's the beginning of the gene, here's the end of the gene,

246
00:18:17,844 --> 00:18:20,083
these are the 24 different axons.

247
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:23,954
And you can see that there are missense mutations,

248
00:18:23,954 --> 00:18:28,454
there are deletions, nonsense frame shift splice site and

249
00:18:28,454 --> 00:18:33,046
different amino acid variations across this entire gene and

250
00:18:33,046 --> 00:18:37,566
remember that this gene, there are different functions.

251
00:18:37,566 --> 00:18:41,353
There's the membrane spanning domain, the ATP binding domain,

252
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:46,092
regulatory domain and another membrane spanning and another ATP binding domain.

253
00:18:46,092 --> 00:18:50,706
And so what you're finding is that there's lots of different kinds of mutations and

254
00:18:50,706 --> 00:18:52,981
they're found all across the protein and

255
00:18:52,981 --> 00:18:55,466
they affect all of these different domains.

256
00:18:55,466 --> 00:18:59,099
And that's why the different mutations have different functions on

257
00:19:00,077 --> 00:19:01,355
the CFTR protein.

258
00:19:03,997 --> 00:19:07,744
So let's take a little bit of a deeper dive into the molecular

259
00:19:07,744 --> 00:19:09,834
consequences of the CFTR mutation.

260
00:19:10,035 --> 00:19:14,305
So here is a cell inside the cell is the DNA and

261
00:19:14,305 --> 00:19:17,893
this is the endoplasmic reticulum.

262
00:19:17,893 --> 00:19:23,793
And so what you get is you get the CFTR gene being expressed,

263
00:19:23,793 --> 00:19:30,283
the MRNA is made into strand of amino acids, it's translated and

264
00:19:30,283 --> 00:19:35,137
that amino acid chain gets folded into protein.

265
00:19:35,137 --> 00:19:41,015
And that protein is moved through the cell up to the cell membrane and

266
00:19:41,015 --> 00:19:45,761
this is the cell membrane here and the open space here in

267
00:19:45,761 --> 00:19:50,713
the middle represents the chloride channel being open so

268
00:19:50,713 --> 00:19:57,649
that chloride can flow through and this is the final CF protein in the membrane.

269
00:19:57,649 --> 00:20:01,953
And so there are five different kinds of CFTR mutations.

270
00:20:01,953 --> 00:20:04,483
The first one is no synthesis.

271
00:20:04,483 --> 00:20:08,077
And so there's no protein that's made at all.

272
00:20:08,077 --> 00:20:12,950
And here are some examples of the mutations that actually give no synthesis.

273
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:15,989
And so you have nonsense mutations and

274
00:20:15,989 --> 00:20:21,218
frame shift mutations that really messed up the entire protein.

275
00:20:21,218 --> 00:20:25,128
The second category here there's a block in processing.

276
00:20:25,128 --> 00:20:29,454
So the delta F 508 mutation actually falls into this category.

277
00:20:29,454 --> 00:20:36,031
So the MRNA is made the gene is expressed but it's not made into protein.

278
00:20:36,031 --> 00:20:39,200
In the third class there's a block in regulation.

279
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,712
The protein actually makes it to the cell membrane but

280
00:20:42,712 --> 00:20:45,143
it can't let the chloride through.

281
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:48,831
This could be from something like a missense mutation.

282
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:52,464
Other missense mutations might result in altered conductance.

283
00:20:52,464 --> 00:20:57,200
So some chloride can get through but it's not functioning in the way that it should.

284
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,177
So it might be that it's letting too much chloride through or

285
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:05,478
not enough chloride through or it can't be regulated properly.

286
00:21:05,478 --> 00:21:08,905
And then the last category is a reduced synthesis.

287
00:21:08,905 --> 00:21:14,305
So this means that there is a protein that works and is functional but

288
00:21:14,305 --> 00:21:19,439
it's not made by the gene in the nucleus as often as it should be.

289
00:21:19,439 --> 00:21:24,034
So it's reduced gene expression and each of these different types of

290
00:21:24,034 --> 00:21:28,648
mutations can be treated with different types of pharmaceuticals.

291
00:21:28,648 --> 00:21:33,411
So you can imagine that if there are pharmaceuticals that actually

292
00:21:33,411 --> 00:21:38,175
allow processing to happen where it's previously blocked that we

293
00:21:38,175 --> 00:21:42,513
might want people who have genetic mutations in this type two

294
00:21:42,513 --> 00:21:46,791
category to take that particular kind of pharmaceutical.

295
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:49,424
Whereas we might have a different strategy for

296
00:21:49,424 --> 00:21:52,867
somebody who already has the protein in the cell membrane but

297
00:21:52,867 --> 00:21:56,533
it's just not being opened or it's being opened and properly.

298
00:21:56,533 --> 00:22:05,182
So our pharmaceuticals can be targeted to the genetic mutations that the person has.

299
00:22:05,182 --> 00:22:09,217
So what we really wanna know when we're looking at

300
00:22:09,217 --> 00:22:13,448
the clinical implications of these mutations are,

301
00:22:13,448 --> 00:22:19,696
what is the relationship between someone's genotype and their phenotype or

302
00:22:19,696 --> 00:22:24,017
their actual trait, in terms of chloride conductance,.

303
00:22:24,529 --> 00:22:28,595
There are different kinds of genotype-phenotype relationships

304
00:22:28,595 --> 00:22:31,942
that are observed in people that have CFTR mutations.

305
00:22:31,942 --> 00:22:36,977
And so really you also have to understand that even though two people can have

306
00:22:36,977 --> 00:22:41,857
the same type of mutation, there can be different clinical consequences

307
00:22:41,857 --> 00:22:45,966
due to things like modifier genes or environmental factors.

308
00:22:45,966 --> 00:22:50,868
And so I think what's important here is that people have different sets of

309
00:22:50,868 --> 00:22:55,852
problems or different symptoms ranging from that pancreatic to pulmonary

310
00:22:55,852 --> 00:22:58,305
dysfunction to male infertility and

311
00:22:58,305 --> 00:23:01,887
that we wanna understand how genotype affects that.

312
00:23:01,887 --> 00:23:06,239
But also understanding that genotype is not gonna be the only thing

313
00:23:06,239 --> 00:23:07,990
that's coming into play for these folks.

314
00:23:09,048 --> 00:23:13,777
It's been observed that some symptoms of cystic fibrosis appear to be more

315
00:23:13,777 --> 00:23:16,566
directly related to genotype than others.

316
00:23:16,566 --> 00:23:21,429
So, for example, family and genetic data indicate that pancreatic function

317
00:23:21,429 --> 00:23:26,086
in cystic fibrosis is really more of a direct consequence of the genotype.

318
00:23:26,086 --> 00:23:30,702
And some evidence to support that are that affected siblings from the same

319
00:23:30,702 --> 00:23:34,872
family tend to have similar degrees of pancreatic dysfunction and

320
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:39,192
that when we look at familial concordance or familial similarity for

321
00:23:39,192 --> 00:23:41,656
pancreatic function, it's very high.

322
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:46,550
Some of the other symptoms or phenotype that we've talked about

323
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:50,764
like severity of lung involvement, age of diagnosis and

324
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:56,327
other things are not so clearly related to the CFTR genotype necessarily.

325
00:23:56,327 --> 00:24:00,876
This is a case study looking at the relationship between genotype and

326
00:24:00,876 --> 00:24:03,864
phenotype in patients from 14 countries.

327
00:24:03,864 --> 00:24:08,480
So they had 399 people who were compound heterozygotes and

328
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:14,796
what they had was they had on one of their chromosomes, the delta F 508 mutation.

329
00:24:14,796 --> 00:24:19,501
So everybody in the study had one chromosome that was delta F 508 and

330
00:24:19,501 --> 00:24:21,894
then they had one other mutation and

331
00:24:21,894 --> 00:24:26,147
there were eight different possible mutations that they had.

332
00:24:26,147 --> 00:24:31,102
Okay, they took these people and they matched by age and

333
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:34,485
sex, they matched them to controls.

334
00:24:34,485 --> 00:24:40,916
These are people that had two copies of the Delta F508 chromosomes.

335
00:24:40,916 --> 00:24:46,074
And what they were looking for was they looked at all of these different

336
00:24:46,074 --> 00:24:50,446
symptoms of CF and they tried to figure out these eight other

337
00:24:50,446 --> 00:24:55,274
mutations when people had them with the delta F 508 mutation.

338
00:24:55,274 --> 00:25:00,027
What was that like in terms of the effect on age diagnosis,

339
00:25:00,027 --> 00:25:05,167
sweat chloride, pancreatic function and pulmonary function

340
00:25:05,167 --> 00:25:10,614
compared with people who just had two copies of the delta F 508.

341
00:25:10,614 --> 00:25:17,835
And what they found was for example, there was this mutation R117 H.

342
00:25:17,835 --> 00:25:23,351
And when people were compound heterozygous for this R117 H and

343
00:25:23,351 --> 00:25:29,481
the DELTA F 508 versus people who had two copies of the DELTA F 508.

344
00:25:29,481 --> 00:25:35,621
Their age at diagnosis was later, their sweat chloride levels were less.

345
00:25:35,621 --> 00:25:40,226
They had a little bit better forced expiratory volume or

346
00:25:40,226 --> 00:25:45,918
lung function, but they had pretty bad pancreatic insufficiency.

347
00:25:45,918 --> 00:25:51,056
So the profile of symptoms and these individuals was

348
00:25:51,056 --> 00:25:56,795
different than people who had two copies of Delta 508.

349
00:25:56,795 --> 00:26:01,484
And that's the important piece here, is that we're trying to figure out for

350
00:26:01,484 --> 00:26:05,525
different genotypes, what do we expect the phenotype to be like so

351
00:26:05,525 --> 00:26:10,030
that we can better understand how to prepare to treat these individuals.

352
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:14,623
And also what kind of pharmaceuticals might be

353
00:26:14,623 --> 00:26:19,571
evolved to help with whatever symptoms are coming

354
00:26:19,571 --> 00:26:23,951
from these two different genetic factors.

355
00:26:23,951 --> 00:26:29,352
With cystic fibrosis, there is no cure really you can just manage the symptoms.

356
00:26:29,352 --> 00:26:35,427
And so that means that there are different exercises that people can do and

357
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,095
chest percussion.

358
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:41,663
And so that's someone sort of banging on the back of the person that has

359
00:26:41,663 --> 00:26:45,699
cystic fibrosis to break up the mucus that are in their lungs.

360
00:26:45,699 --> 00:26:50,310
We can use antibiotics and anti inflammatories to

361
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:54,702
help with the infections of cystic fibrosis and

362
00:26:54,702 --> 00:26:58,674
bronchodilators to help with breathing.

363
00:26:58,674 --> 00:27:03,707
There's a drug called to resolve inflammation fibrosis and

364
00:27:03,707 --> 00:27:10,322
bacterial infection and you can also do some dietary and pancreatic enzymes and

365
00:27:10,322 --> 00:27:15,176
vitamin supplements to help people may also need oxygen.

366
00:27:15,176 --> 00:27:19,995
There's also genotype specific pharmaceuticals that have recently been

367
00:27:19,995 --> 00:27:20,844
developed.

368
00:27:20,844 --> 00:27:25,355
So for those Class I mutations where you're actually not

369
00:27:25,355 --> 00:27:28,654
getting any expression of the CFTR gene.

370
00:27:28,654 --> 00:27:33,493
One thing that we can do is promote ribosomal-read through of those premature

371
00:27:33,493 --> 00:27:34,382
stop codons.

372
00:27:34,382 --> 00:27:38,845
So when the CFTR gene is trying to be expressed

373
00:27:38,845 --> 00:27:43,668
normally the cell sees a stop codon and it stops.

374
00:27:43,668 --> 00:27:48,753
But this drug Ataluren actually causes the cell to sometimes

375
00:27:48,753 --> 00:27:54,437
read through those stop codons and plug in just any old amino acid and

376
00:27:54,437 --> 00:27:59,042
that might restore some function of the CFTR protein.

377
00:27:59,042 --> 00:28:02,955
With class II mutations like the DELTA F 508.

378
00:28:02,955 --> 00:28:07,418
What we wanna do is promote the trafficking of that CFTR protein

379
00:28:07,418 --> 00:28:08,774
through the cell.

380
00:28:08,774 --> 00:28:10,555
So remember it's expressed but

381
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:13,464
that protein never makes it up to the cell membrane.

382
00:28:13,464 --> 00:28:19,836
So there are drugs like Lumacaftor that actually target those class II mutations.

383
00:28:19,836 --> 00:28:25,894
For class III mutations where you actually have CFTR protein in the membrane but

384
00:28:25,894 --> 00:28:28,346
it's not operating properly.

385
00:28:28,346 --> 00:28:34,447
You can use CFTR potentiating drugs that actually bind to that CFTR protein and

386
00:28:34,447 --> 00:28:38,699
opens up the gate to improve the chloride transport and

387
00:28:38,699 --> 00:28:42,305
the drugs for that are things like Ivacaftor,

388
00:28:42,305 --> 00:28:47,481
Kalydeco which was approved by the FDA for 9 mutations especially

389
00:28:47,481 --> 00:28:53,045
the G551D which is the most prevalent class III mutations in the US.

390
00:28:53,045 --> 00:28:59,405
And for the DELTA F 508 what they're looking at now is using a combination.

391
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:04,626
So if you use Lumacaftor to promote the trafficking of the CFTR up until

392
00:29:04,626 --> 00:29:09,671
the cell membrane and either capture to actually open up the gate and

393
00:29:09,671 --> 00:29:12,257
let those chloride ions through.

394
00:29:12,257 --> 00:29:16,016
So this is an example of pharmacogenetics because we're

395
00:29:16,016 --> 00:29:20,969
actually targeting pharmaceuticals to people based on their genotypes.

396
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:30,524
This is a database that actually gives some information about the clinical and

397
00:29:30,524 --> 00:29:35,409
functional effects of mutations for cystic fibrosis.

398
00:29:35,409 --> 00:29:40,026
So usually when we find mutations that aren't that common,

399
00:29:40,026 --> 00:29:42,655
how do we know what class it's in?

400
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:47,058
Is it a class I, class II, class III, how path pathogenic is it?

401
00:29:47,058 --> 00:29:49,927
What kind of symptoms is it associated with?

402
00:29:49,927 --> 00:29:54,784
This website is a database that provides information for patients,

403
00:29:54,784 --> 00:29:59,487
researchers and anyone who's interested about CFTR mutations.

404
00:29:59,487 --> 00:30:04,943
First of all, does it even cause any kind of CF, does it cause any kind of symptoms?

405
00:30:04,943 --> 00:30:08,707
And if it does what does it cause?

406
00:30:08,707 --> 00:30:13,501
What's known about its relationship to sweat chloride levels, lung function,

407
00:30:13,501 --> 00:30:15,804
infection rates and things like that.

408
00:30:15,804 --> 00:30:18,314
And you can actually go in and look for

409
00:30:18,314 --> 00:30:23,345
any mutation that you find in the CFTR gene and see what's known about it.

410
00:30:23,345 --> 00:30:28,930
And you can look at information about single variants or variant combination.

411
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:31,865
So if someone is a compound heterozygous,

412
00:30:31,865 --> 00:30:36,671
this database will give you all the up to date information we have about

413
00:30:36,671 --> 00:30:41,197
the relationship between that genotype combination and resulting phenotype.

414
00:30:42,229 --> 00:30:47,280
So we talked about cystic fibrosis and I told you at the beginning that

415
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:52,071
what we really wanna do, although we can do newborn screening for

416
00:30:52,071 --> 00:30:55,402
cystic fibrosis, people still die from it.

417
00:30:55,402 --> 00:31:02,336
And so we really wanna try to prevent people being born with two CFTR mutations.

418
00:31:02,336 --> 00:31:04,286
So what are the challenges for that?

419
00:31:04,286 --> 00:31:08,854
Well, I think you understand now that the differing prevalence is of

420
00:31:08,854 --> 00:31:11,770
the CFTR mutations across ethnic groups and

421
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:16,362
demographic groups make it really hard to design a screening panel.

422
00:31:16,362 --> 00:31:20,690
Or a set of mutations that we might wanna screen for when we're thinking about

423
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:25,221
adults of reproductive age that would actually apply to different ethnic groups

424
00:31:25,221 --> 00:31:29,229
to different demographics that could be used in different countries.

425
00:31:29,229 --> 00:31:32,640
We know we want to put on the Delta F508 mutation.

426
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:37,717
But what else, what other mutations should go on there And I hope you understand that

427
00:31:37,717 --> 00:31:42,797
there's kind of insufficient knowledge about genotype phenotype correlations,

428
00:31:42,797 --> 00:31:46,470
especially when you have private or really rare mutations.

429
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:52,863
And so carrier testing or testing report reproductive age adults before they have

430
00:31:52,863 --> 00:31:59,610
kids is the common strategy for cystic fibrosis, but it's not fail safe.

431
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:02,940
Newborn screening can also be helpful, but

432
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:07,890
the there's not really a lot of good evidence that treatments for

433
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:12,110
cystic fibrosis work well, especially in infants.

434
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:16,382
And also another weird thing about newborn screening for

435
00:32:16,382 --> 00:32:20,921
cystic fibrosis is that you can actually detect a lot of times

436
00:32:20,921 --> 00:32:24,837
whether that infant is a carrier for cf mutation, so

437
00:32:24,837 --> 00:32:31,600
not that they're going to get the disease, but that they have one cf causing alil.

438
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,357
And although we might want to do carrier screening on that infant later

439
00:32:35,357 --> 00:32:37,969
in life when they're around reproductive age,

440
00:32:37,969 --> 00:32:41,240
we don't necessarily want to know when they're an infant.

441
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,608
What kind of disease is there a carrier for

442
00:32:43,608 --> 00:32:46,931
that might be relevant when they reach reproductive age?
