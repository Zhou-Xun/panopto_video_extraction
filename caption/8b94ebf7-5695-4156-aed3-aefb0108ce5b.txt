1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:09,060
Internships can convert you and thought that might make you just go ahead and get started here today.

2
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:17,910
Happy Monday. Good morning. Obviously you're waking up and it wasn't too early for you guys to want to talk about decision trees.

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:25,890
And we talked a little bit about these last week to just kind of continue on and I guess last week theoretically how,

4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:32,640
you know, why are these decision trees reasonable and appropriate for helping you make better decisions and or uncertainty?

5
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:40,250
And today we'll walk through some examples, but also let's talk about the homework assignment of that video as well.

6
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:47,610
So just to go through a simple example, an intermediate example of what discrete distinctions and degrees of distinction.

7
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:53,640
So, you know, last week we went through this Lasik eye example, eye surgery example.

8
00:00:54,060 --> 00:01:02,190
We talked about surgery and surgery. You have complications or no complications and what would your vision outcomes look like?

9
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:08,640
And we kind of put probabilities into the tree where you would have to put probabilities in the tree.

10
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,810
You could rank order which outcomes you prefer or don't for.

11
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:20,520
And then the equivalence rule and substitution rule are really what is kind of rolling back the tree.

12
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:30,030
So kind of turning that more complicated part of the tree back into something a little simpler, near moving back towards the root of the tree.

13
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:36,410
So today I want to walk through a more simple example before I get out of the way.

14
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,750
Any, any questions you start with decision trees in general. What are they?

15
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,440
Were all the slope squares, circles, meaning and arms and.

16
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:52,750
Okay, so let's walk through a simple decision tree here.

17
00:01:52,770 --> 00:02:01,260
So let's say we're thinking about treatment for chest pain and we can either do surgery or medical management to do surgery.

18
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:06,390
It might be successful, you'll be healthy, or you might die during the surgery.

19
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:13,260
And if medical management, someone can get partial relief from medical management or no relief from medical management,

20
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:23,160
oftentimes that your decision trees will have kind of parallel structure so that the structure of the tree might be similar.

21
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,360
They might just have different probabilities, different costs or different outcomes at the end.

22
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,800
But in this case, we have different structures. That's that's fine, too.

23
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:40,560
So when I ask you guys, you know, how do you go about kind of solving a decision tree like this?

24
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:50,609
And actually, we don't have all the answers here, but we need to or what what additional information do we need in order to solve it?

25
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:55,780
It a tree like this. Yeah.

26
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,290
So we're going to need the costs of each of the results.

27
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,040
Yeah, we need to know. We know what are the outcomes here at the end.

28
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,299
So if you're and in the case of cost effectiveness, one of the things we saw was cost.

29
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:11,590
And so, you know. Yeah, what's the costs associated with the surgery of being healthy?

30
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:16,299
What's the cost of surgery and dying? What's the cost of medical management with partial relief?

31
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,690
What's the cost management? No relief. So that's yeah.

32
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,160
That's important thing we need. Yeah.

33
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:30,309
And then I guess if there's any more trees off of the because inevitably there'll be multiple different outcomes even for partial relief,

34
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,430
for no relief or so those could be useful too.

35
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,940
Or at least considerations are limitations as well. Yeah.

36
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:43,060
And then I think you should always ask questions when you're seeing a decision treatments like this, do I think the structure is reasonable?

37
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,330
And so if you get partial relief, what happens after that?

38
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:55,390
And do we assume you just live with partial difference your life or does something else happen towards or in the case of no relief,

39
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:02,320
what happens here after this? Do you have no relief from your life or did something else happen or does this change over time?

40
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:08,690
After I get and actually more interestingly, too, you can have signs with these trees, you can have subsequent decisions.

41
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:15,370
You could have another decision after no relief. They may get try medical management first and then I have another.

42
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:22,840
If I get normally, then I have a decision to be in surgery or not. You can make your trees more complex than that.

43
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:27,100
And in this case, also the structure here is you have partial relief or no relief,

44
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:31,810
but in different degrees of partial relief that you might have them.

45
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:38,350
So there are a lot of things we you know, whenever you see a tree like this is consider the structure and and is it do

46
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:44,320
we think it's appropriate missing anything how other questions are comments.

47
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:52,290
Okay. Well, in this hypothetical example, let's assume that with medical management,

48
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:56,190
you live with partial relief, which life no relief progressive like as well.

49
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,230
And what we are doing here is now somehow see,

50
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:04,469
we can get an overall sense of how do we feel about surgery overall, how do we feel that management overall.

51
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:11,150
So we want to control that back. So what I'd like to do is actually walk through this simple example today.

52
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:25,760
So most of you have computers, and I'd like you to go to our course website and follow along with this and sorry,

53
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:29,640
under the course website if you go to modules.

54
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:36,580
And under week two there's a simple decision tree example like you to.

55
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,900
Download that simple this entry example.

56
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:58,130
And so in this day and age, when you're doing decision trees, you know, you can manage, you know, in pencil and paper.

57
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,570
I want going to walk through some examples using spreadsheets today.

58
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:07,459
But there are other tools you can use as you maybe see on the syllabus.

59
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:10,130
There's some software called Tree Edge,

60
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:18,470
which is software particularly designed to help you do cost analysis and helps you kind of build these trees graphically and solve them.

61
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:28,320
If you're taking 654 or taking the class like that and taking some of the other classes on till 512,

62
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:34,700
513, I think you'll learn about Excel at it that you can use that help you build this increase.

63
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,660
So those classes are great. Please take those if you're interested.

64
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:48,440
But today in this class, we'll just use some kind of basic solving and decision trees without any extra add ins, which is which is totally fine.

65
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:55,790
It might be a little bit clunkier than if you had the add ins, but it should be able to do this all the same.

66
00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:02,690
So the way I've structured this template here is we have the kind of diagram of our.

67
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:07,089
Decision tree up here at the top. I have three worksheet tabs.

68
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:13,840
We have results, surgery and medical management. On this one, we're going to store our overall results in it at the end.

69
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:20,350
But then the surgery and medical management are the tabs where we're going to actually calculate

70
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:26,200
the expected values or kind of roll back the trees for surgery and for medical management.

71
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:33,640
It's not necessary. There's not necessarily a right or wrong way to do this. It's just the way I've structured it for the class surgery.

72
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:41,830
So here we have our tree, our decision tree. Here we have 2 minutes on that one.

73
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:52,250
So we have, again, untreated chest pain and here are some outcomes at the end of the tree here with cost effectiveness analysis,

74
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:59,780
typically we're going to have two sets of outcomes are we're going to have quality adjusted life years or some other kind of health outcome.

75
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:02,870
And then we're going to have cost $4.

76
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:12,170
And in this case here we have surgery will assume that you if you are a healthy result for surgery, you get ten quality adjusted life years.

77
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:17,690
It's the equivalent of ten years of perfect health. If you're dead, you get zero quality adjusted life years.

78
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:21,570
If you have medical management, you had 9.8 quality adjusted by you see your point.

79
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:22,970
That is pretty good, but not perfect.

80
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:30,559
And then if you have no relief from your chest pain, you get nine on the adjusted life years in the right hand column here we have costs.

81
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:38,810
So let's say the surgery, if you survived the surgery and you're healthy, you have $100,000 in lifetime medical expenses.

82
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:43,850
If you had the surgery and you die, the surgeons feel really bad.

83
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:48,740
The person died, so they offer you the surgery. Half price, $50,000 it costs.

84
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:54,260
You ever seen that? I didn't see that. But I'm making up the example so I can do that today.

85
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:59,090
And then medical management will assume you have $25,000 and cost for the medical management.

86
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:04,880
Either way, this is just a made up example, so don't try to read any more into that I guess.

87
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:14,250
And then the same probabilities here, 2% chance of dying of surgery. 60% chance of partiality with medical management excuse.

88
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:20,890
Any questions? Okay.

89
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:27,390
So let's go to the surgery tab here and we're going to calculate the the results for surgery.

90
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:33,520
So with the surgery part of our tray here, there are a couple of ways to resolve the uncertainty.

91
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:38,200
You can either healthy or dead. The properties of healthy and dead are .98.02.

92
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:48,370
The outcomes here. If you're healthy, you get ten quality just like yours dead zero and costs 100000 hours.

93
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:53,830
It cost, if you're healthy, $50,000 in costs if the person dies.

94
00:09:55,540 --> 00:10:00,010
So down here at the bottom, we're going to calculate the results.

95
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:10,750
And whenever I do examples in Microsoft Excel, you know, I created this template, my fingers move quickly because I've done this before.

96
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:16,540
And what I'd like to do is not just have me go up there and type stuff and you guys have difficulty falling.

97
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:21,010
So it's like a volunteer to help us do these calculations here today.

98
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:33,180
So if I don't get a volunteer, I'll just pick someone and maybe I'll pick our latest entrance entrance to the class.

99
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:42,580
Come on down. And with these calculations here. Yeah. You haven't had a chance to open up your laptop or something here.

100
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:52,380
It's already set up. So we're walking through a decision tree example here and calculations of calculating outcomes.

101
00:10:52,500 --> 00:11:00,510
So when you take a seat here and we've got this year, we're calculating the trying to compute the expected value results for this decision tree.

102
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:04,590
And so we're going to be multiplying probabilities, times, outcomes here, probabilities.

103
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:08,100
These guys have the quality just like figures in these properties times.

104
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:17,820
So we'll go down here and I've got the probabilities and costs here in cells 22, 23, 27.

105
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,750
So what I like you to do here is just kind of fill in the probabilities.

106
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:33,270
So just say equals and link that up to the healthy probability of a few rows in 2022 and then do the same thing for Dad here.

107
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:38,610
So we're going to have 90% chance of healthy, 2% chance of dead.

108
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:42,179
And then we'll link up the quality adjusted life years here.

109
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:48,920
So we have ten quality adjusted life years for healthy and zero for that.

110
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:59,300
Newspaper costs and this one solving decision treat for cost effectiveness analysis.

111
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:07,390
One thing that's slightly different than you might have seen in doing other decision trees is we have two sets of outcomes all the way.

112
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,810
Everything's exactly the same as you might have seen in other decisions.

113
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:13,810
We're kind of rolling this back for two sets of outcomes,

114
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:20,140
so we're going to be calculated to recognize for these two similar outcomes the costs and the quality adjusted life years.

115
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:29,050
So what I'd like to do is teach you, if you haven't already done this, a microsoft Excel formula that might be helpful.

116
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:33,040
So here in the end for the quality adjusted life years in the green expected values.

117
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,690
So let's use the Excel formula sum product.

118
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:42,430
So type in equals sum product product.

119
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:49,420
Yep. And what this how many of you see how many of you have used some product before?

120
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:54,580
Q Okay. So let me ask you guys. So what are some products?

121
00:12:54,590 --> 00:13:04,080
Do you mind supply? Like one thing that I didn't do that didn't make my decline, I think slow, but yeah,

122
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:12,579
it takes two arrays or kind of columns or actually you can do rows as well of data and each element

123
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:18,190
gets multiplied together and then added up and then those multiplied by factors get added up.

124
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:23,590
And so what we want to do here is we want to multiply the probability times of 25 years,

125
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,650
this probability times this quantity, just life and then add them up.

126
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:30,400
And that's really great for kind of weighted average or in this case, expected values.

127
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:36,610
And this this is kind of a simple, you know, some product probably overkill for just for sales.

128
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:42,760
But oftentimes sometimes if you have another 4 million, you've got, you know, 30 different probabilities and 30 different outcomes.

129
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,930
Some product can be really useful anyway.

130
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:57,189
So all do here is some product of the first column of probabilities and then comma, and then we'll put in the quality adjusted life years.

131
00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:05,420
So the second column, they're quality adjusted life years. He closed parentheses just a single time and enter.

132
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:09,190
And that gives us our expected value, quality adjusted life years.

133
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,800
Now, this was not rocket science. You probably should have done this in your head, right?

134
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:20,480
.98 is the probability times ten quality. Just five years is going to be 9.8 and 10.0 is going to give you the area them together.

135
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,500
You get that point. Okay. So that that was not rocket science. That's pretty straightforward here.

136
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:32,000
Any questions now? Is there any questions back there?

137
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:39,650
Okay. So now we need to do this for as well. One thing I like to do is I don't want to type something in again.

138
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:47,120
So let's go into our quality adjusted life years cell here and go into that formula actually double click and I think it'll show the formula.

139
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:52,909
I like to I don't like to type things again. I'd like to drag my cells around.

140
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:56,450
If I've got a similar formula, I want to just fill it in to do all the things.

141
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:01,430
And what I want to do for cost here is do the exact same thing we just did with quantity, just the life years.

142
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,749
So I'd like to be able to drain this formula over to the right, but if I drank it over to the right,

143
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:12,410
what's going to happen is it's going to put my colleagues by cost and I want to to high probabilities, times costs.

144
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:19,700
So what I can do is I can anchor these blue cells so that when I drank the formula over, it stays on.

145
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:29,390
It's keeps the probabilities, but then it moves the other column to costs ten probabilities instead of twice and costs.

146
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:37,250
So probably happens quite so. What I want to do again is lock in or anchor the blue cells.

147
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:47,629
And so if you are a windows machine, you can hit F4 and that will change this, or you can just manually put in dollar signs before the those things.

148
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:50,870
So we want to anchor both the C 36 and the C 37.

149
00:15:53,090 --> 00:16:01,190
Now if you did enter and then take that cell D 38 and just put your cursor in the lower right corner,

150
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:08,090
it turns to black plus drag over and you should get the expected value costs.

151
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:26,330
We pause for a minute. CB questions are. Okay.

152
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:33,560
So here we have a 9.8 quality just five years, $99,000, because 98% of the people are going to have $100,000.

153
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:38,930
Only 2% are going to have a $50,000 cost. So the average is going to be $98,000.

154
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:49,210
Okay. So this is our our surgery expected values. Let's go to the results tab.

155
00:16:50,290 --> 00:17:01,090
That's the one on the left. And if you scroll down a little bit, let's fill in our cost and effectiveness for surgery.

156
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:07,630
So there you can just say equals for surgery cost, and then go to the other tab and pull out from the surgery tab.

157
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:12,570
And that was the cost for surgery.

158
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:28,530
There are 98000 hours in greenhouse. They just had entered.

159
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:36,540
And you bet. $9,000 in surgery costs. And we can put in the effectiveness in 21.

160
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:39,840
And we link that up to the green cell on the surgery tab.

161
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:46,750
Effectiveness of the 9.8% interest in life years.

162
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,469
Okay. So we kind of have half of our results already here.

163
00:17:52,470 --> 00:18:00,440
We got the surgery results in this table, by the way, this is a common kind of results table that you'll see in a cost structure analysis.

164
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:06,989
You'll see each row is going to be a different intervention and we will track our costs and quality adjusted life years for each intervention.

165
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:10,710
Later on, we'll calculate income cost ratios if if relevant.

166
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:25,640
Okay. So now let's go to the. Medical Management tab, sorry, the tab at the bottom, we want to basically get the numbers for medical management costs.

167
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:31,650
Quite interesting. So if you can zoom in there so I can see that a little bit better.

168
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:45,930
But this is kind of a similar structure. To me, it's not even six months.

169
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:52,650
Actually, if you just hold the control and zoom, the click will. Okay.

170
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:59,190
So this is this structure here on this worksheet is very similar to the previous one.

171
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:05,009
We just have different outcomes for partial relief and no relief and different

172
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:08,639
properties and different quality of just like there's a cost associated with that.

173
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:15,360
But actually technically, you know, the structure is similar in that we just have a binary set of outcomes here.

174
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,370
So yeah, we can start filling in this table here.

175
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:25,830
So we have probabilities of 0.6, a partial relief, 0.4 of no relief, 9.8 quality adjusted life years associated with partial relief.

176
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:35,310
Knowing quite of life creatures associated with knowingly and then costs of in this case $25,000 each.

177
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:49,680
And then we can calculate the expected values here as well. So you can practice using that some product formula again.

178
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:57,129
And role playing in the probabilities times the outcomes we care about in the

179
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:00,370
first column D It's going to be quality adjusted life years in the second column.

180
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:18,060
B It's going to be more probabilities, times the causes. Okay.

181
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:28,930
Any questions so far? Let's go to results then and link up these with these numbers in our table there for medical management.

182
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:36,480
First. We have the costs, though. I think you.

183
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:50,210
Okay. So now we have surgery, medical management, we have the costs and the effectiveness there.

184
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:59,930
So actually, let's stop for a minute and think about this. So. So now we have expected 40 just five years in costs for each intervention.

185
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:04,160
How do we think about the value then of surgery medically?

186
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:11,780
Is one clearly better than the other now that we have some costs and the body adjusts spikers calculate.

187
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:28,120
Yeah. It's not super clear because effectiveness is not too significantly different from one another,

188
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,030
but the surgery cost is substantially more than medical management.

189
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:38,050
Yeah, so surgery is a lot more expensive, but it does give us more quality, just like there's been a ton of extra quality nurses like yours.

190
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:48,370
And so it might be kind of difficult to to answer this question here about, you know, which one is better surgery or medical management one.

191
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:52,060
You know, one is better in terms of cost, the other is better in terms of the health outcomes.

192
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:59,470
Um, so let's do something here though. Typically in this table here, things will be ordered from least costly to most costly.

193
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:06,459
So why don't you cut row 21 and just insert it below below the other one?

194
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:14,720
So let's just kind of cut that row and reorder the table so that medical management is the first row in surgery.

195
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:27,140
If you just cut that, you're. All right, Evan, Apple.

196
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:37,100
The problem is, you know, you really just highlight the row right click and to cut it in 23, just.

197
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:45,020
Controlling ethnic or racial interest. Okay.

198
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:51,010
Yeah. Apologize. Yeah. Things with Macintoshes and windows might be slightly different and a little confusing.

199
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:54,080
If you're having trouble with that, let me help you.

200
00:22:54,950 --> 00:23:05,720
Okay, so now we've ordered them from least costly, the most costly, and let's calculate the incremental cost and the incremental effectiveness here.

201
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:12,560
So n e 23 oh So for medical management, that's kind of the baseline.

202
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:16,700
So there's no incremental really for that one.

203
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:23,690
So we'll leave, leave the cells and 22 blank, but 23 surgery is more expensive.

204
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:28,879
And the question we want to ask ourselves is how much more expensive is it than medical management?

205
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,910
So let's, let's just do that simple subtraction.

206
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:36,020
So let's calculate the cost of surgery minus the cost of medical management.

207
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:48,230
That's our incremental cost. So surgery is costing us $74,000 more than medical management, and we can also do the same for incremental effectiveness.

208
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:54,110
So how many additional quality adjusted life years are we getting with surgery instead of medical management?

209
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:59,390
So we're getting an extra 0.32 quality adjusted life years.

210
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:05,540
And then in column G, we have the incremental cost effectiveness ratio.

211
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:09,860
How do we calculate the incremental cost effectiveness ratio? How do you think we do that?

212
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:28,460
It is the incremental cost divided by the internal cost of incremental effectiveness and no crazy square roots something to power a €17 calculus.

213
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:33,600
None of that, right? This is just a simple incremental cost over incremental attractiveness.

214
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:44,370
So how does the it's not formatted for dollars, but it's $231,000 or so for Claudia just fine.

215
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,959
So let me step back for a minute to what we did first with the decision tree

216
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:54,330
is we calculated the expected value costs and quality adjusted life years.

217
00:24:55,470 --> 00:25:03,240
So that's kind of one way to think about it is if you were risk neutral, that's how you would value those outcomes.

218
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:10,320
Another way to think about it is if there were tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that you might be giving this intervention to,

219
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:15,510
on average, those are the costs of quality, adjusted life years that they would experience,

220
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:18,960
that that population would experience on average kind of per person basis.

221
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,060
So if you had if you were a Blue Cross Blue Cross Blue Shield or Medicare, and you're saying,

222
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:28,530
should I give medical management or surgery to this population of hundreds of thousands of people?

223
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:29,910
On average,

224
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:40,140
medical management would be $25,000 in cost and 9.48 quality adjusted life years and surgery would be $99,000 in 9.8 quality adjusted life years.

225
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:45,960
We call this expected value. It's based on kind of assumptions that you're your risk neutral.

226
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:52,920
With that said, if you get surgery, do you get 9.8 quality adjusted life years?

227
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,980
No. We had you know, you don't you either you either get ten or zero.

228
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:05,400
Right. You don't get it. It's you shouldn't expect the expected value.

229
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:11,850
It's kind of a bad term. So I've heard other people talk about it as a certain equivalent.

230
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:20,729
So if you're risk neutral, you would say 09.8 quality adjusted life years and 99000 hours is a is a amount for

231
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:26,820
certain that's equivalent to a 98% chance of ten colonies and a 2% chance of zero points.

232
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:30,660
If you're risk neutral, that is your certain equivalent work will call it.

233
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:33,810
You use all series the term it's commonly used expected value.

234
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:39,000
But keep in mind though you net you don't necessarily get the expected value in the real world, right?

235
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,930
These are uncertain outcomes.

236
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:51,290
But we're going to say that surgery is if we're risk neutral here, evaluated and you know, this certain equivalent or expected value of $98,000,

237
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:58,739
9.8 quality adjusted life years and medical management has that certain equivalent or expected value of 25000 hours.

238
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:02,030
It costs 9.48 quality adjusted life years.

239
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:07,889
That was the first thing we did with certainty here is calculate those outcomes,

240
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:17,610
get those expected values for certain cohorts, I would argue, and many do that for, you know, large scale policy issues.

241
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:18,570
We probably, you know,

242
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:27,080
assuming your risk neutral and using these expected value asserted equivalence is a good approach for rolling back that essentially.

243
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:36,899
Yeah, there's a question. And so in this context, like the choice being like surgery or medical management, look to me, look,

244
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:41,910
I understand the decision process and I can see how it's like a helpful decision making tool.

245
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:51,780
But like, you know what, if the person is a smoker or obese or something that makes surgery like far more risky,

246
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:55,920
so like their individual chance of dying, you know, is, is much higher.

247
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:00,359
So so is this just assumed like a population average?

248
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:06,120
But like if it is that like in the U.S., like the South is like much less healthy than the West,

249
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:10,260
like how do you sort of think about how to actually apply these in the real world?

250
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:17,160
Or is this only helpful for like if you're the government or an insurance company where you're like thinking really only on the population basis?

251
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:24,959
You know, that's a really good question. And that's that's a really a broad kind of general policy question is,

252
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:30,570
is should we make policy for everyone or should we make more individualized, tailored decisions?

253
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:35,309
So should we say should we recommend surgery for everyone?

254
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:43,200
Should we recommend medical management for everyone? Or should we have more individualized and say, okay, Mr. Jones, who is obese,

255
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:49,200
smoker in South Carolina and 78 years old, he maybe has a higher risk of dying.

256
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:53,370
And so maybe the right answer for Mr. Jones is medical management.

257
00:28:55,560 --> 00:29:02,100
And, you know, so that's a good question. And I will say, though, oftentimes there are kind of blanket recommendations.

258
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:06,600
You know, you see CDC making some blanket recommendations about vaccination policy.

259
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:11,970
You see, you know, Blue Cross Blue Shield or Medicare saying we're pay for this, will not pay for that.

260
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:17,850
Sometimes there is some nuance. They'll say, we'll do this for this type of patient population or this this patient population.

261
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:22,980
So that's a good question, though, is, you know, how how much, you know,

262
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:31,410
should we be making more bigger blanket statements or should be making more kind of tailored recommendations in decisions for different populations?

263
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:35,969
So this analysis could be, you know, for a general population.

264
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:39,080
So it could be, you know, smokers age 72.

265
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:42,389
You know, maybe these parameters are relevant for smokers age 72.

266
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:46,020
And so maybe this is the right answer for a 72 year old male smokers or whatever it is.

267
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:52,890
Or maybe this maybe this analysis is using general numbers for the entire U.S. population,

268
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,520
which might not be relevant for the 72 year old male smoker.

269
00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:02,010
And so you want to think about that. It's not just just, you know, this simple example here.

270
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:06,659
I haven't given you any details about it, but in confidence for these analyzes,

271
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:13,770
you want to think about an intervention applied to a specific population, and the numbers might be different for different populations.

272
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:24,180
So that's that's something to, you know, be thinking of and kind of set out for this.

273
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:28,779
And and I will say, you know, we've been going off a little bit of tangent here, but, you know,

274
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:35,470
CDC is making recommendations for coronavirus vaccines and boosters and they face this challenge or struggle,

275
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:38,950
you know, is do we just make it easy to understand a blanket recommendation,

276
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:44,559
hey, everyone should get a coronavirus vaccine or should they make tailored recommendations and say, you know,

277
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:51,220
people who are over 85 really should get the booster and people who are under 20, maybe it's not as important for them.

278
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:57,790
And so it's a question of kind of ease of implementation and ease of communication

279
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:04,300
versus sometimes the the more nuanced recommendations probably are are more accurate,

280
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:09,370
but sometimes more confusing. And so that's that's sometimes a challenge.

281
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:16,910
So anyway,

282
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:25,670
the decision tree part of this is calculating these certain equivalent or expected value costs and quality just measures for each intervention.

283
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:32,780
And then the cost effectiveness part of this is calculating your rental costs, incremental effectiveness, incremental cost effectiveness ratios.

284
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:39,140
And and remember here, when we're calculating these cost effectiveness results, everything is incremental.

285
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:46,760
So I really just do not let me repeat do not let me say this the third time.

286
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:51,590
Do not take this cost and divide by this quality right here.

287
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:57,350
Those are not relevant. What is relevant is we're comparing medical management to surgery here.

288
00:31:57,650 --> 00:32:02,510
And so we want to know how is surgery different from medical management? We want to look at those incremental differences.

289
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:05,540
How much more expensive is surgery than medical management?

290
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:10,250
How much more how many more quality adjusted life years do we get with surgery versus medical management?

291
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:19,820
I kind of don't care how expensive surgery is. I care more about how expensive surgery is compared to the alternative that I'm going to choose.

292
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,600
I kind of don't care how many quality adjusted life years with surgery.

293
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:28,070
I care what how many more quality just like I'm going to get versus my best alternative.

294
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:36,859
Okay. And if we had a better alternative here, where we get where we get, where we got, you know, 9.79 quality,

295
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:41,240
just like that would make a difference about how how I think about surgery compared to medical management.

296
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:47,810
If medical management requires and only got one quality, just like it was medical management, that would change my perception of surgery.

297
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:53,480
So you always think about that compared to your best next next best alternative.

298
00:32:56,180 --> 00:33:01,370
By the way. So $231,000 per quality adjusted life years, is that a good value for money?

299
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:10,990
Europe's 500,000. Hmm. What was Europe's standard, like, 5000?

300
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:18,190
So that's a that's a good question, I guess I'll say. Kind of Europe doesn't necessarily have a standard I might be able to answer.

301
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:25,120
The United States doesn't have a standard. But the United Kingdom, which is, you know, does have have some thresholds that they use.

302
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:35,649
So in the United Kingdom, they explicitly have some thresholds and they use cost effectiveness analysis and they say we want our interventions,

303
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:48,219
new interventions to cost less than about £30,000 per party just for the kind of currency conversion that's roughly $50,000 per quality adjusted like,

304
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,180
you know,

305
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:56,080
what they pay for the National Health Service in the United Kingdom pays for is not necessarily what we should pay for here in the United States.

306
00:33:57,130 --> 00:34:04,240
You know, with that said, here in the United States, we routinely spend money on things that cost $50,000 per quarter in just the life year.

307
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:10,240
We routinely spend money on things that cost $100,000 per body, just like $150,000.

308
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:14,020
But I will say $231,000 in the United States.

309
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:19,360
A lot of people might say that that sounds pretty expensive. Again, there's no explicit threshold that you're in the United States.

310
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:23,500
Medicare does not have a threshold for what they pay for the age and have a threshold.

311
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:27,190
See, this is a threshold, but there's no explicit threshold.

312
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:33,460
But, you know, oftentimes when something is more than $200,000 per year, they start saying that sounds kind of expensive.

313
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:39,819
With that said, I was just talking to some pulmonary doctors and they say, oh, yeah,

314
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:44,020
there's this this treatment that pretty much everyone gets for a very specific lung disease.

315
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:49,090
And, you know, when you look at the literature, it's like $1,000,000 per party just like your.

316
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:54,540
But they routinely spend money and the insurance companies don't seem to be preventing them from spending money on that.

317
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:59,230
So, you know, part of that is I don't know if we're willing to pay more.

318
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:03,760
It's just something that's been excluded from the realm of being evaluated with cost benefit analysis.

319
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:14,679
Yeah, like in a way though, maybe $50,000 in the UK could be in a way some equivalent to a $100,000 intervention that's seen in

320
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:22,510
the US because of just like how subsidized medical treatment is or how much cheaper it is in the UK.

321
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,730
Well, yeah, and you're right,

322
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:32,680
the cost structures of medical care are very different in the UK and and I guess I would argue that because they use cost effectiveness analysis,

323
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:37,660
especially when there are no new interventions that come to market in the UK,

324
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:43,240
where there is something where you can kind of control the price, like the cost of a drug for medical management.

325
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:49,810
You know, when Pfizer goes to the US and UK or, you know, any Roche, they come up with a new drug and they say,

326
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:55,600
Deary UK National Health Service, please pay for this and they present their cost effectiveness.

327
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:59,050
Analyzes to the UK saying, Hey, our new drug is cost effective.

328
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:07,840
Typically when they turn that into the UK to get approval to get paid for their when they do the cost effective analysis,

329
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:16,210
it comes in at £29,999 per quarter just like your they they can adjust the price so that it meets that threshold.

330
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:20,110
Now when they just the price to meet that threshold that means that price is probably

331
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:24,729
cheaper in the UK than it is here in the United States where we don't use cost effective

332
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:30,940
policies and Medicare doesn't really look at at prices when they're considering

333
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:35,709
whether people do you think like Medicare would start looking at that in the future?

334
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:37,270
Do you see any like I mean, potentially?

335
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:43,960
So there's a lot of discussion recently about Medicare allowing Medicare to negotiate for drug pricing, not negotiate drug prices.

336
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:49,630
And so I think that would be interesting to see Medicare negotiate with drug prices.

337
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:53,740
Now, the interesting thing is, whenever you haven't even taken a class in negotiation.

338
00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:01,150
Is anyone heard of? Yeah. So as like a best alternative to a negotiated agreement as they refer to that.

339
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:08,680
So that's one thing that you're supposed to have when you when you go into a negotiation, you're trying to figure out something with with someone.

340
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:16,570
The one thing you should have in the back of your mind before you go into that meeting is what is my best alternative to a negotiated agreement?

341
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:20,560
So what if I can't come to an agreement with that person I'm negotiating with?

342
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:26,090
What's my best alternatives? Well for Medicare, when they're negotiating what's there,

343
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:31,880
what's their alternative to negotiating and coming to agree with Pfizer or Roche or whoever is on the drug price?

344
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:37,800
If they don't come to agreement, then what happens? They don't have it. They don't have the medication.

345
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:46,260
So Medicare, you know, so if Medicare is negotiating, they need to have an alternative of, well, maybe we just don't even pay for this at all.

346
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:50,860
So often as we think about Medicare negotiating for drug prices, it's going to lower drug prices.

347
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:56,280
Well, the only way it lowers drug prices is if Medicare sometimes says no to some sort of drugs.

348
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:02,190
Right. I mean, they're they're not a credible negotiator if they're going to say we're negotiating an initiative with you,

349
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:06,840
but we're definitely going to pay for your drugs. Well, they're saying it's $1,000,000 per dose or whatever.

350
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:13,680
Right. So they if Medicare negotiates for some drug prices, they're going to have to say no to some some drugs.

351
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:17,400
They're going to say, that's too expensive. We're not going to take your price.

352
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:21,620
Anyway, kind of going off on a tangent here.

353
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:31,610
But so the cost effectiveness ratio here is in this example here is $231,000 per quarter, just five year of it probably is.

354
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:33,439
Medicare did negotiate for drug prices.

355
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:39,200
I would argue that they should they should think of that in their mind is how much are we willing to pay for quality of life?

356
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:44,180
And if this drug company sets the price too high, then it's not worth it.

357
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:48,469
Then they're going to say no. We'll go with our best alternative to negotiate in this case.

358
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:52,430
If you're someone who is negotiating surgery price, we'd say no, thank you.

359
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,569
We're not going to pay for the surgery.

360
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:59,660
We're just going to stick with medical management or our alternative choice if the if the cost of our is too high.

361
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:08,870
Yeah, I think when it comes to like but the US health care market, at least in the US it's like it's all centralized under the NHS.

362
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:16,100
Well you're just so different because it's, you have all these millions of, or like thousands of hospitals, you know,

363
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:22,490
and they're all private organizations then, you know, all these pharmacies which are, you know, private companies as well.

364
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:25,430
So it's just really hard for them.

365
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:32,930
I feel like logistically to just to negotiate all those kind of well, yeah, certainly in the UK there's the National Health Service and they're,

366
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:39,920
they're the big player in that country and so know they have a lot of market power and yeah,

367
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:47,220
so if you're interested in economics you could look up monopsony. You know what a monopoly is, what a monopsony is.

368
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:52,070
Yeah. When there's a single buyer and there's a single buyer.

369
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:58,220
And so that's kind of like the NHS in the UK, you know, Medicare isn't a single buyer, but it's a pretty big buyer in the US.

370
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:02,930
But there are a lot of other buyers in the US as well actually.

371
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:08,210
I mean technically in the UK, if the NHS doesn't pay for something, that doesn't mean you can't get it.

372
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:13,700
You're just going to have to maybe have some private insurance or pay out of pocket for something, which of course is very expensive.

373
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:19,880
And so maybe you don't get it, you probably don't get it, but but it's not, you know, technically unavailable in the UK.

374
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,690
So there are some ways around that in the UK as well.

375
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:27,620
And presumably here, if Medicare didn't pay for something, people would find other ways too.

376
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:33,930
Some people would find other ways to to get access to some of these drugs. Yeah.

377
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:39,690
It's a complicated thing to be thinking about going back to our decision tree here.

378
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:44,520
Yeah. So we've kind of completed the decision tree here. We have costs, we have effectiveness.

379
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:49,800
We have for each intervention, we calculate incremental cost and quality, just the life years.

380
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:54,780
And then we come to this internal cost ratio that is telling us, you know,

381
00:40:54,900 --> 00:41:00,719
for every so if I'm buying quality adjusted life years by choosing surgery instead of medical management,

382
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,010
I'm paying $231,000 per quality adjusted life years.

383
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:06,170
If I think that's too expensive, by the way,

384
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:10,860
if I think maybe there are other things I can do with my money as a medicare or Blue Cross or whatever it is,

385
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:17,490
you know, I can spend the money on vaccines. I can spend the money on early childhood prenatal care or something like that.

386
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:25,770
You know, those things might give me bigger bang for our buck and I might say, no, we're not going to you know, we're not going to pay for surgery.

387
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,689
We're instead going to pay for medical management.

388
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:32,640
And then we're to use those dollars in other places where we can get better health outcomes for that our spending.

389
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:43,739
Yeah. I knew at the beginning of the semester you said that cost effectiveness doesn't tell you

390
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:48,890
anything about equity or sort of like how to judge those sort of other considerations.

391
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:58,140
And then I'm curious if people have tried to like shape cost effectiveness analysis in a way that would like give you some of those considerations.

392
00:41:58,170 --> 00:42:07,780
So like, like if you say, like because of my like racial and class identity that like my life expectancy is 80 years old and somebody else's,

393
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:12,420
you know, their racial cause, I guess my expected life expectancy of like 60 years old.

394
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:19,709
So like that person arguably like could potentially benefit like far more from this, maybe not so cost effective treatment.

395
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:23,520
Like how do you have that even tried to sort of think about it in those ways?

396
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:29,720
Yes. And so from 90% of this class, we're talking about cost factor analysis, ignoring equity.

397
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:31,830
But we do have a week near the end.

398
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:37,649
Once you kind of learn, all this will layer on this idea of something called distributional cost effectiveness analysis.

399
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:41,370
And we'll talk about how people are trying to incorporate equity into this.

400
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:45,390
I will say those methods are relatively new.

401
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:51,120
They're probably only been around in the last ten years, whereas this other stuff we're talking about has been around for 30, 40 years.

402
00:42:52,200 --> 00:43:00,480
So it's it's still I mean, I actually think the methods are interesting and reasonable, but they're still kind of new and they're not used very often.

403
00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:02,950
But yeah, we'll talk about those. Yeah.

404
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:08,490
And you can tell me what you think about them if you think they're good ideas, bad or maybe they're not great ideas.

405
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:11,190
I'm not. I'm not I'm not tied to anything. I mean,

406
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:16,440
I do a lot of this but I'm I welcome critiques of of this and distribution anyway thing we're talking

407
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:22,400
about here tonight so and this entire semester so my personal identity is what do I do about this.

408
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:28,230
It's not totally tied up to this. If you if what I'm telling you is if this is, you know, terribly ethically wrong,

409
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:33,960
you know, I'm open to hearing those arguments maybe going off a little bit.

410
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:42,089
So how did the US government negotiate a price with like Pfizer and Moderna regarding like the regarding buying these COVID vaccines,

411
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:46,020
although they like kind of funded creating them at the same time? Yeah.

412
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:49,160
So that I mean, I think I well, first of all, let me say this.

413
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,870
I don't know the of the outcomes of that, but you know,

414
00:43:51,870 --> 00:44:00,599
I think they they paid for them and they were going to pay for them when they were kind of emergency use authorization.

415
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:04,470
I think the federal government said, look, if if you develop these quickly,

416
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:10,500
we will we'll pay for them and we're going to pay for them not only for Medicare, but just for everyone.

417
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:17,160
Because I presume, you know, even if that even if, let's say, Operation Warp Speed didn't happen, you know,

418
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:22,139
Pfizer and Moderna could have developed the vaccines and then said, hey, Medicare, you should pay for these.

419
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:27,060
These are but but they would have been like emergency use authorization and maybe Medicare would have said,

420
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:32,879
well, the U.S. so we're do wait until you get full approval and it would have delayed things a little bit.

421
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:38,850
And so I think having Operation Warp Speed probably gave these companies an incentive to then they knew there'd be a

422
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:45,060
bigger market share and that they knew they'd get they'd probably get the vaccines out to people more quickly and get,

423
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:47,580
you know, get those sales more quickly. And actually, for me,

424
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:55,270
the biggest thing probably about Operation Warp Speed was it was a guarantee that the U.S. government would buy hundreds of millions of dollars for,

425
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:04,560
well, hundreds of millions of doses. And I guess if I were a drug developer in, you know, March 2020,

426
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:09,959
I'd be really excited about, you know, creating a new you know, this is a huge market.

427
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:15,270
You know, I'd be really excited about creating a vaccine. And there are some risks.

428
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:17,370
There's a risk that I try to develop the vaccine. It doesn't work.

429
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:24,390
But also a big risk is if I develop the vaccine, someone else will also develop the vaccine and it might be better.

430
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:29,870
And actually we've seen that right in the mean Johnson and Johnson spent a lot of money developing a vaccine,

431
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:34,310
and in the end, it wasn't as good as some of the other vaccines, you know, the Moderna or Pfizer.

432
00:45:35,330 --> 00:45:42,740
But yeah, Johnson and Johnson still got a big check because they they developed a vaccine and they they provided a lot of doses.

433
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:50,060
And so that was a guaranteed kind of payment that they would get if they could develop a successful vaccine that worked.

434
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:53,600
And so I think that was a that was another part of Operation Warp Speed.

435
00:45:53,600 --> 00:46:00,960
I think that it reduced some of the risk to the to the manufacturers in that they would, you know,

436
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:06,770
know that if they could develop something successful, they would get some market share or some sales.

437
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:11,050
And actually, I mean, I think the U.S. government, you know, bought a bunch of Johnson Johnson vaccines.

438
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:15,260
Some people here in the U.S. got them. Maybe some view this route.

439
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:20,210
And then I think they also shipped those vaccines to other places that also needed them as well.

440
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:25,550
Because that because the Johnson Johnson vaccine, you know, doesn't have to be doesn't have to be refrigerated.

441
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:32,680
Yeah. And actually, it's not necessarily a bad vaccine. It has a lot of good things going for it, you know, single dose, etc., etc.

442
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:36,680
Although some people would argue maybe shipment, you know, says all these things are developed so quickly.

443
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:42,830
Yeah. Okay.

444
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:47,490
So any questions about this kind of symbol of the centuries? Yes.

445
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:56,190
So I did. The whole basis of the street is using the qualities to make, you know, the determination.

446
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:59,219
So I guess it's just a little unclear.

447
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:06,959
And I guess you could tap into the details if you had more data. But like how I know those numbers, you know, how do you get the ten, nine, 20.

448
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,150
Yeah, yeah. That's kind of the whole yeah.

449
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:14,280
So we'll talk about that more in in about two weeks is how do you calculate these quality adjusted life years.

450
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:19,810
And that's the biggest challenge probably is just how do you put a quality of life value on life?

451
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:23,429
So you say, okay, I have partial relief for my chest pain versus no relief.

452
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:26,370
How do I feel about those, um, those outcomes?

453
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:34,499
And part of it goes back to what we talked about on Wednesday last week is this idea of that equivalence rule and saying,

454
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:39,180
okay, what if I am living with you?

455
00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:42,150
You can think about some sort of chest pain that you're living with and then think about,

456
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:46,710
well, what if I could live with perfect health or possibly die?

457
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:51,690
You know, how would what risk of dying would I be willing to take?

458
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:57,750
Would I be indifferent between that risk of dying and living with co living with

459
00:47:58,770 --> 00:48:03,410
chest pain versus a chance to get perfect health and a chance of dying know

460
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:08,890
what is the a certain kind of risk of of living or dying when I consider that risk

461
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:13,140
that uncertain outcome to be according to my certain outcome of living with,

462
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:18,780
you know, no relief for my chest pain. And that's that's one of the ways of doing that.

463
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:24,490
We'll talk about that one. But that's a good question.

464
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:35,200
And that's actually one of the more challenging parts of our cost analysis is trying to put a number on length of life, implying other questions.

465
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:42,610
Okay. Well, thank you for your time here. Thanks.

466
00:48:42,810 --> 00:48:47,590
And I kind of picked on you to just walk in the room. But, yeah, it was really good.

467
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:53,560
So next, I'd like to walk through another decision tree example here.

468
00:48:54,090 --> 00:48:59,380
And so go to the course modules. And there's one here called the intermediate decision tree example.

469
00:49:07,910 --> 00:49:14,300
And so this one is slightly different here.

470
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:20,060
It's still organized with kind of three worksheet tabs. And we're going to calculate results for next.

471
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:26,910
In this case, we're setting a different policy that's a little more complex to more better.

472
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:33,620
So we're considering a vaccination policy either vaccinate people or not vaccinating them.

473
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:41,510
And this example, you can become infected or not. There's a 10% chance of becoming infected if you don't get the vaccine.

474
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:46,310
2% chance of getting infected if you do get the vaccine. So it's it's it's actually not perfect.

475
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:53,210
If you get infected, you might be hospitalized. 20% chance of being hospitalized.

476
00:49:53,450 --> 00:50:01,370
And if your hospital has a 30% chance of dying. And then in the end, here we have our dollars and quality adjusted life forms.

477
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:11,000
So let's say it's a $200 vaccine. And then if you are not infected, you have no no costs.

478
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:15,320
You're not hospitalized, but get infected. You have $100 and cost me.

479
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:19,070
You have to take some Tylenol and some other things if you have an office visit or something.

480
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:23,750
If you're hospitalized, you have $50,000 in expenses.

481
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:34,160
So the costs up here are the same as down here, except here's another $200 in costs because everyone up here at the top got the vaccine in the bottom.

482
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:37,520
Here we say we had 30 quality of life years if we're not infected.

483
00:50:38,010 --> 00:50:42,280
So we lose 21 quality just like if we get infected and not hospitalized.

484
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:47,080
So 29, 25 years. And then here, if you die, zero 40, this is life years.

485
00:50:47,090 --> 00:50:52,010
And then if you survive, say it's 29 and a half. See, a hospitalization is worse.

486
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:59,150
You lose basically half of your perfect health equivalent to is that's what happens with your hospitalization.

487
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:09,050
Any questions about the structure of this example? So this is a little more complex than the previous one.

488
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:13,760
The previous one is pretty simple. Okay.

489
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:28,200
Who would like to volunteer for this one? Take someone who hasn't.

490
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:38,040
Stage. One small lunch.

491
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:43,019
Come on, you do have a computer. So I see your you're concerned.

492
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:51,930
You're like, oh, man, I wish I had my fingers on a laptop. What's going to up and and you can see how this plays out.

493
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:57,120
So we'll start off on the, the, um, the vaccination tab here.

494
00:52:00,210 --> 00:52:04,680
And so this one here, we're just going to calculate the results for vaccination.

495
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:11,430
And actually let me zoom in a little bit here so you can tell it's boundaries.

496
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:14,670
Okay. So here we have the vaccination part of the tree.

497
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:21,780
Here we have the first uncertainty is you infected or not infected probabilities are 20%, 90%.

498
00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:27,120
The second uncertainty here here is the hospital.

499
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:32,040
These are not and our probabilities there. And then the third uncertainty is whether you die or not.

500
00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:38,340
And those are the probabilities given hospitalization there.

501
00:52:38,370 --> 00:52:48,960
And then we have the outcomes here with our quality adjusted life, years for and costs for various outcomes at the end branches of the truth.

502
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:57,050
Okay. So the first approach and so I'm going to walk through kind of two different approaches here.

503
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:03,860
And if you scroll up just a little bit, we'll do the first approach here and that is kind of rollback approach.

504
00:53:04,910 --> 00:53:09,830
So we're going to calculate expected values and then kind of roll them back.

505
00:53:09,830 --> 00:53:13,960
So we're going to cover that kind of what's our expected value or certain equivalent at the purple

506
00:53:13,970 --> 00:53:19,790
node and then replace what we have here with what we got for the expected values of the purple node.

507
00:53:20,090 --> 00:53:25,160
And then we'll catch that a new expected value at the blue node or the dark blue node,

508
00:53:25,610 --> 00:53:27,980
and that's going to be the expected value of this hospitalization node.

509
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:39,380
And then we're going to finally calculate the expected value at the vaccination node here is going to be expected this times these items anyway.

510
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:46,280
So let's let's go to the the leaves of the tree, if you will, and we're going to calculate the expected values at the diner.

511
00:53:46,370 --> 00:53:51,710
So for to link up the probabilities of dying and surviving here.

512
00:53:52,850 --> 00:53:56,750
So yeah, so that's going to make you move around a lot.

513
00:53:57,950 --> 00:54:04,490
But that is let's be up 23.7 for.

514
00:54:15,390 --> 00:54:21,360
Okay. And then we'll put and then plug in our quality just spiders at the DAI node.

515
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:24,479
So that's the impact it has.

516
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:33,080
Flies die. Yeah. With their. See?

517
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:36,660
24. 27. So that.

518
00:54:36,930 --> 00:54:40,079
Yeah. I apologize. This isn't quite the Z 27.

519
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:46,970
So if you survived it. 25. Yeah.

520
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:04,200
So we have the probabilities. Yep. Yeah, that's good.

521
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:08,400
We have the probabilities of dying and surviving. We have the quality, just life years.

522
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:14,129
We have cost. And now we're to calculate the. So the sum product.

523
00:55:14,130 --> 00:55:26,170
Yeah. The expected values then. I'm.

524
00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:37,740
And by the way, I want to I want to thank our guinea pigs here in the front.

525
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:43,469
I know it can be a little bit tricky. You're like, you make a typo and then you got everyone watching you.

526
00:55:43,470 --> 00:55:48,420
Like, Oh, she clicked in the wrong place, so try not to worry about it too much here.

527
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:52,880
You're doing good under pressure here. I appreciate.

528
00:55:57,860 --> 00:56:11,920
Uses his mind. Oh, I think he's been kidnaped for a couple of times.

529
00:56:13,150 --> 00:56:26,330
Yeah. I would say.

530
00:56:26,630 --> 00:56:33,310
Yeah, exactly. I mean, it's.

531
00:57:04,510 --> 00:57:11,150
It's almost like cabarets, times the quality, just life here is getting an expected value or certain equivalent quality.

532
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:20,000
Just like years in costs. And now. You're in the purple cells here writing these cells.

533
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,420
I want you to stay in k 44 here.

534
00:57:25,830 --> 00:57:30,050
Yeah, right here. Let's, let's link these up to the purple numbers down there.

535
00:57:31,610 --> 00:57:43,880
So just remember that those are the qualities. Yep. So this is kind of what the roll back is doing here is we're taking, you know,

536
00:57:44,010 --> 00:57:49,229
this at least this last branch in the tree and turning that into a certain equivalent

537
00:57:49,230 --> 00:57:53,970
value and then replacing this part of the tree with that certain equivalent.

538
00:57:55,410 --> 00:58:00,090
Okay. And so now we're going to calculate the value at the hospital's node.

539
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:07,620
So that's going to be that 20% of our being hospitalized growth, 14.

540
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:16,240
Know, 14 actually the probability of being hospitalized, given that you're infected.

541
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:30,370
20%. Infecting.

542
00:58:41,990 --> 00:58:46,700
So that's the how. So if you're if you're hospitalized, if you scroll down.

543
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:57,600
So if you're hospitalized, we want the average or the expected value that you just calculated if you're hospitalized.

544
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:03,920
So that's the 20.65 and the 50,000 surprise or the 20.64 or five.

545
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:10,670
And then the costs are the $50,000, 50,000.

546
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:19,180
And then for non-hospitalized you like that off of the 29.9, Audie?

547
00:59:19,190 --> 00:59:25,630
Just the life years and the 30 infected.

548
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:30,589
Yeah. So if you're infected, you can see different hospitals are not hospitalized.

549
00:59:30,590 --> 00:59:35,390
Now we want to calculate the average or expected value for the outcome of just being infected.

550
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:42,350
And so that's going to be well, if you're hospitalized, these are the qualities and costs.

551
00:59:42,350 --> 00:59:52,960
And if you're not hospitalized, but you're still infected, these are the quality and costs as we're using this.

552
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:59,260
So now we're calculating the expected value of if you're infected.

553
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:08,469
So if you're infected, you can potentially hospitalized or not. And now we're catching the kind of average or expected value out the for this part of

554
01:00:08,470 --> 01:00:12,090
the branch of the tree here was infected and you potentially could be hospitalized or.

555
01:00:17,770 --> 01:00:33,070
That makes sense. So now this rolling back is a recursive process where we're kind of repeating something again and again.

556
01:00:33,430 --> 01:00:41,320
And we started off at the very end of the tree. We've turned these into an expected value for this kind of purple part of the tree.

557
01:00:41,650 --> 01:00:49,150
And then we have the expected value, had the dark blue part of the tree. And now we're going to calculate the expected value of of being vaccinated.

558
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:51,790
And if you're vaccinated, you have a chance of being infected or not.

559
01:00:51,790 --> 01:00:57,280
And we want to calculate that expected value or certain equivalent associated with being vaccinated.

560
01:01:03,470 --> 01:01:09,050
So here the probability of being infected is that 2%.

561
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:19,970
Yeah. And then if you're infected, you get these qualities and these costs.

562
01:01:24,470 --> 01:01:31,190
And then if you're not infected, you'll make that up with the I's and costs here.

563
01:01:31,550 --> 01:01:54,630
No. Okay.

564
01:02:13,330 --> 01:02:16,510
Okay. Cause for me to see the question.

565
01:02:16,750 --> 01:02:22,270
All right. So for the rollback method, it looks like you're just taking the vaccinated branch of the tree,

566
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:26,620
and so you get that from the first decision or whatever.

567
01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:31,340
You only take one branch at a time. Yeah.

568
01:02:31,350 --> 01:02:37,680
So we're rolling back the vaccinated up on the tree and then later on we'll roll back the unvaccinated under the tree and compare the two.

569
01:02:37,950 --> 01:02:46,580
Yeah. Yeah. So another approach here would be to just calculate the total probabilities.

570
01:02:46,820 --> 01:02:51,980
So the joint probability of ending up in each of the four leaf nodes of the tree.

571
01:02:53,720 --> 01:03:01,880
And so for here, what you can do is the first uncertainty, the probability of being infected is the is the point to.

572
01:03:05,150 --> 01:03:08,570
And so all those first three are going to be point to. Point to.

573
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:18,990
So very strong. Well, so anyway, if you actually if you scroll down to the bottom.

574
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:25,320
Okay. So if you're. So each row is a is a potential kind of leaf of the tree.

575
01:03:25,350 --> 01:03:29,730
So you can be infected, hospitalized and die. In fact, in hospital, I survived.

576
01:03:29,970 --> 01:03:34,140
You mean infected, not hospitalized. And while they don't have threads or.

577
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:38,800
Or you can just be not infected. Those are the four leaves of the tree you can potentially end up at.

578
01:03:39,310 --> 01:03:43,500
So. So these first three are all being infected.

579
01:03:43,530 --> 01:03:48,690
So we actually those are all actually. Well. So you just say equals point or two.

580
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:55,650
Because those are all those first ones. All have that same first uncertainty of having a 2% chance of happening.

581
01:03:55,950 --> 01:03:59,730
And then not infected is going to be the 98% chance of not being infected.

582
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:08,090
Okay. Now the second uncertainty is, are you hospitalized or not?

583
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:15,860
And so those first two have the hospitalized. Probability of recovery of being hospitalized is 20%.

584
01:04:19,530 --> 01:04:41,090
Yeah. And the third one is that up at the top, that 80% chance of not being hospitalized again and then for the first two into the.

585
01:04:41,870 --> 01:04:45,590
Yeah, so that one is the probability of dying given that you're hospitalized.

586
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:52,310
And so you can scroll up there and get that 30% chance of dying given the hospitalized.

587
01:04:54,510 --> 01:04:59,400
And then the last one is the 70% chance of not dying before hospital.

588
01:05:01,470 --> 01:05:04,710
And then what we'll do in column H is get the joint probability.

589
01:05:04,950 --> 01:05:08,160
So what's the overall probability of ending up with that leaf in the tree?

590
01:05:08,430 --> 01:05:12,000
And that's simply just the product of those three numbers times each other.

591
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:28,300
Then you can easily be able to drag the formula down or copy down, which means this one.

592
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:34,090
Yeah. And so you just fill in some ones for the cells.

593
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:44,090
So if you are vaccinated, what we're saying here is you have a 98% chance of being not infected.

594
01:05:45,380 --> 01:05:49,760
You have a 1.6% chance of being infected but not hospitalized.

595
01:05:50,390 --> 01:05:54,870
You have a 0.28% chance of being hospitalized. Infected, hospitalized and survive.

596
01:05:55,340 --> 01:06:03,350
And a 12 out of 10,000 chance of being infected, hospitalized and dying if you're vaccinated.

597
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:15,690
And then here you can just link up the quality adjusted life years and costs associated with each of those options here and utilize.

598
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:31,450
So we're going to go through, you know, this is a second approach to solving that decision tree.

599
01:06:32,210 --> 01:06:36,170
It should give us the same results. There's not necessarily a right or wrong approach to this.

600
01:06:37,010 --> 01:06:40,030
You can do it either way to solve this decision transfer.

601
01:07:04,060 --> 01:07:06,550
And now in this case, the some product is going to be there,

602
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:11,470
just this joint probability times of the qualities or the joint probability times the cost.

603
01:07:32,390 --> 01:07:38,750
So notice here we get the same the same outcomes in both these both these approaches should give us the same results.

604
01:07:39,230 --> 01:07:43,250
There's not necessarily a right or wrong way to doing this. Both approaches should work.

605
01:07:47,180 --> 01:07:51,560
There are 29.96 quality, just the bikers, $401.

606
01:07:53,990 --> 01:07:57,980
So we just did this for vaccination. Now we can do it from no vaccination.

607
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:02,360
Now, one thing that you will you know, this took a while to do it.

608
01:08:02,450 --> 01:08:05,900
And you're probably saying, hey, you know, finish this class on time.

609
01:08:06,620 --> 01:08:13,099
Well, one thing that I did when I set up the structure for this is I think I tried to make sure

610
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:18,170
that the structure of the worksheet here for vaccination and no vaccination was the same.

611
01:08:19,020 --> 01:08:20,990
All the inputs were in the same cells.

612
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:26,660
It's just that the values are slightly different, the probabilities are slightly different, and the cost qualities are all the same.

613
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:31,730
The costs and the probabilities are slightly different in this worksheet.

614
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:35,840
So what you can do is go back to the vaccination tab.

615
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:48,410
Yeah. And yeah, for the for this, you know, just copy all the formulas here from the 62 to J 66, for example.

616
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:56,330
Copy that. And then go to the 62 down here and paste formulas.

617
01:08:57,770 --> 01:08:58,580
No, it should be fine.

618
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:09,230
Yeah, but it's now when you go from one worksheet next, these are pointing to the cells on this worksheet, not the previous ones.

619
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:15,560
Okay. So here now, I mean, you could have done that.

620
01:09:15,570 --> 01:09:27,050
You can also copy paste in these cells as well. But here we can see let's just take a look at the results here we have now we have 29.8.

621
01:09:27,290 --> 01:09:32,390
All your $1,000 in costs actually must link up thing some of the results tab here.

622
01:09:33,020 --> 01:09:39,169
So what's going on here? Let's look up the costs and effectiveness for vaccination and no vaccination.

623
01:09:39,170 --> 01:09:51,320
So vaccination has costs of more than one dollars and the effectiveness of the 29.9 life years.

624
01:09:52,310 --> 01:09:56,970
And we can do the same for no vaccination. Zero.

625
01:10:00,590 --> 01:10:02,999
Now, how many of you at the outset and I apologize,

626
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:11,960
have been asked this how many of you at outset knew that vaccination was going to be cheaper than no vaccination on average?

627
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:21,090
It would one or two of you who who knew that at the outset you could just visually look at it, wheels turning and you had you figured that out.

628
01:10:21,330 --> 01:10:27,420
But I guess I would argue it is sometimes it's difficult to know at the outset

629
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:30,810
with these kind of complex decision trees with a lot of things going on.

630
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:34,799
You've got the $200 cost of the vaccine, but then you maybe save some money down the road.

631
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:42,600
If someone doesn't get hospitalized. It ends up in this example here that no vaccination is more expensive than vaccination.

632
01:10:46,410 --> 01:10:50,880
Now, which one has better quality just for life? Here's this simple example.

633
01:10:54,420 --> 01:10:58,620
So is there one intervention here that's better than the other one? Clearly better.

634
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:05,299
Yes. Yes. Vaccinations better on both those dimensions of things we care about.

635
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:09,000
It's better in the cost mentioned, it's better in the quality dimension here.

636
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:17,330
So this one, we actually don't even need to calculate a cost effective ratio because vaccination is better along both dimensions.

637
01:11:18,950 --> 01:11:23,620
Better qualities, lower costs. So vaccination. The center dominates.

638
01:11:23,630 --> 01:11:30,650
No vaccination. Better long options. Any questions?

639
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:38,990
This one's a little more complex. You know, I know it's a little bit tiresome to kind of go through that roll back process,

640
01:11:39,290 --> 01:11:47,209
but I think it is helpful to kind of think about how this is working here, what it's doing when we're solving the decision tree,

641
01:11:47,210 --> 01:11:56,870
where we're taking this really complex tree and we're simplifying it, we're saying, again, if we you know,

642
01:11:56,870 --> 01:12:05,120
if we are in this kind of complex tree, we're saying, okay, let's simplify this by summarizing.

643
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:07,969
Okay, what if we're hospitalized? How we feel about being hospitalized,

644
01:12:07,970 --> 01:12:13,730
where we can simplify that by how can expected value or certain equivalent of these two branches of dying and surviving?

645
01:12:14,810 --> 01:12:17,990
And then we roll that back and say, Well, how do we feel about being infected?

646
01:12:18,020 --> 01:12:20,120
What's our expected value, certain equivalent to being infected?

647
01:12:20,150 --> 01:12:24,890
Well, that's both like this branch times, this branch and this branch we've already simplified.

648
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:28,190
And then finally, how do we feel about vaccination overall?

649
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:34,220
Well, it's going to be this times, the value, this outcome, this times the certainty of this outcome.

650
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:38,120
And we can kind of roll the tree back, simplify the tree to get up.

651
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:42,290
How do we feel overall about vaccination versus no vaccination?

652
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:49,280
What do we how do we think about the total costs? What are the total expected or certain equivalent costs,

653
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:54,530
certain important quality adjusted life years associated with each of these interventions in terms.

654
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:06,820
So these trees, you know, using, you know, building the trees, putting all the properties and outcomes on it and then solving it,

655
01:13:06,820 --> 01:13:10,660
rolling it back helps give us clarity about which decision is best.

656
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:15,280
Before we went through, you know, half an hour ago, before we started this example and solving it,

657
01:13:15,940 --> 01:13:20,990
it wasn't clear which one was going to be better in terms of quality of life because it cost.

658
01:13:21,310 --> 01:13:29,600
Maybe conditions like yours was clear because giving us some more likelihood of getting better by this time year.

659
01:13:29,830 --> 01:13:33,670
But the cost, it wasn't clear which one was better or worse in terms of costs.

660
01:13:33,940 --> 01:13:37,990
This one has extra costs on every single node because we had to pay for the vaccine.

661
01:13:38,230 --> 01:13:42,670
But this one has higher probabilities of being infected, which are expensive, which is an expensive outcome.

662
01:13:43,490 --> 01:13:51,639
So but solving the decision tree helps us give that kind of clarity about how do we feel about taxation versus no taxation,

663
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:57,790
how we feel about those costs of vaccination or vaccination. How do you feel this tiny just life, yours vaccination resolution?

664
01:14:00,370 --> 01:14:01,479
Okay. Well, thank you.

665
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:10,450
I you know, I know it's difficult to be dragged up here in front and having everyone watch your every click and be recorded for posterity.

666
01:14:13,210 --> 01:14:20,890
But thank you very much to you both of our somewhat reluctant volunteers for coming out here to walk us through this.

667
01:14:20,980 --> 01:14:25,360
But I appreciate it, because if I tried to do this myself, I'd be quite well too quickly.

668
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:28,960
And then you guys were saying, wait, frustrating to me. So we'll see. What do you do that too?

669
01:14:30,490 --> 01:14:39,700
Okay. So in our last 5 minutes of class, I would like to talk briefly about the upcoming homework assignment.

670
01:14:41,090 --> 01:14:54,909
So that is one decision tree modeling and I guess I should say so there's this, you know, document here that walks you through this example.

671
01:14:54,910 --> 01:14:59,860
Here are the questions. And so they are all focused on decision tree modeling.

672
01:15:00,460 --> 01:15:03,040
Question one is about a minor disease.

673
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:13,330
People have this disease, a minor disease, and they can potentially have you know, people have a risk of contracting a minor disease.

674
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:18,580
If they get this minor disease, they have a chance of an outcome of fingernail discoloration.

675
01:15:19,090 --> 01:15:24,790
There's a new medication. It reduces the risk of contracting a minor disease.

676
01:15:26,650 --> 01:15:32,980
And. It reduces your risk of fingernail discoloration if you get a minor disease.

677
01:15:33,850 --> 01:15:40,780
And so you draw the decision tree, calculate the overall risk of fingernail discoloration and so forth.

678
01:15:41,770 --> 01:15:49,840
Then question too, we incorporate some disease costs and then question three You're incorporating some treatment costs.

679
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:59,860
So I think it should be relatively straightforward. What I want you to do to do this is click this link.

680
01:15:59,860 --> 01:16:05,200
It'll make a copy of a Google sheet here.

681
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:12,700
And across the bottom we've got a bunch of different tabs, version one A1, B, one C, one D and so forth.

682
01:16:13,810 --> 01:16:20,140
So question one A drawing, a decision tree. Question one B, you're capturing these risks.

683
01:16:20,410 --> 01:16:26,690
Now, this this template, there's not too much here, but I want you to just for the skin.

684
01:16:26,710 --> 01:16:32,040
And then here, instead of copy of first name, last name, you'll put in your last name and first name.

685
01:16:32,290 --> 01:16:36,790
And when you submit this, you'll submit just a link to that Google spreadsheet.

686
01:16:43,330 --> 01:16:48,670
Any questions? I think it should be pretty straightforward to uppercase.

687
01:16:55,500 --> 01:17:02,460
Yes. Do you have, like policies about like collaborating with people or is this like solo online?

688
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:07,300
Okay, great question. So in this class, I think 55% of your rate is based on a group projects.

689
01:17:07,770 --> 01:17:11,249
And so the homework assignments and quizzes are an opportunity for me to get a look.

690
01:17:11,250 --> 01:17:12,899
I mean, I'll get a little bit out from the projects,

691
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:19,680
but this is an opportunity for me to get an understanding of your individual capabilities a little more clearly than what I see from the project work.

692
01:17:20,070 --> 01:17:25,560
So I would like this to be this and again, your quizzes also to be individual assignments.

693
01:17:26,730 --> 01:17:31,670
Now, I realize you guys, you also study groups. You talk to each other and in fact, you talk to each other as part of your project.

694
01:17:32,730 --> 01:17:40,889
So if you do have conversations about the homework assignments, please make a note of that in your submission.

695
01:17:40,890 --> 01:17:47,370
Say, I talked to Judy about this question or whatever, so just let me know what I would not like you to be,

696
01:17:47,370 --> 01:17:53,450
you know, all work together and answer question one all together and then just copy it and turn all that.

697
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,200
That is that would be a no no.

698
01:17:55,590 --> 01:18:03,540
But if you have clarifying questions about, you know, how do you think about this or that, that's that's that to me is okay.

699
01:18:04,170 --> 01:18:09,270
But I will say, yeah, in the past for these homework assignments, a lot of this is kind of, you know, spreadsheets.

700
01:18:09,270 --> 01:18:12,780
And it's very easy to kind of copy a spreadsheet and share that with your friends.

701
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:17,129
And and 95% of students are great with this and doing it individually.

702
01:18:17,130 --> 01:18:24,000
Sometimes students are you know, they are out of town and also this last minute and they say, hey, can you help me?

703
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:29,870
And, you know, just emails the spreadsheet and then Judy puts her name on it and turns it around.

704
01:18:30,090 --> 01:18:39,360
So that is a no, no, please don't do that. These are individual again, designed to get your individual.

705
01:18:40,410 --> 01:18:46,390
It's actually for you to individually work through this and get the skills and show that too.

706
01:18:46,950 --> 01:18:53,820
So if you have some minor if you discuss this minor kind of questions with each other, that's totally fine.

707
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:59,520
But I don't want you kind of copying each other's work and and doing it all together.

708
01:19:00,690 --> 01:19:10,040
Any questions? That's a thank you for the question. So that's it, really.

709
01:19:10,340 --> 01:19:17,750
Thank you very much. And I will see you on as this is due a week from today and we'll see you on Wednesday or something.

710
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:32,030
Yeah, I think that's part of my job.

711
01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:40,220
But I do think notices often come on asking us what we're doing.

712
01:19:41,210 --> 01:19:47,870
Oh, and this intermediate decision tree example, if you were having trouble falling along on the course works on your module,

713
01:19:48,050 --> 01:19:58,782
there's a clean version so you can take a lot of computers to see all of your images.
