1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:07,200
No. No. I think otherwise.

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:55,590
I think, first of all, you have people in which I never thought I want to raise money to buy anything, but.

3
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:08,900
I know. I know. I mean, I met her yesterday.

4
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:28,770
Yeah. I don't know how to make this super nice.

5
00:01:31,650 --> 00:02:03,220
Yeah, I do. You know, you said I grew up like this before, and I was like, Oh, God.

6
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:17,219
I know. I was actually was so.

7
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:24,110
I don't know.

8
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:36,600
I got to make sure that I like trying to find my way.

9
00:02:37,760 --> 00:03:17,320
I, you know, I, I, you know, I don't know if I should sleep playing, but I think I'll try and I don't know.

10
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:39,390
You know, I wanted to ask you talk.

11
00:03:40,490 --> 00:04:09,820
You know, I think it was like my only hope is that I am.

12
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:17,580
Yeah. Most of my relatives live between what's going on, so.

13
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:24,710
Yeah, it sounds like. Of, like, know.

14
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:43,870
Yeah. I mean, I think, you know. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

15
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:58,460
What does that mean?

16
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:24,870
I didn't know what was going on on Monday night episode, so I just saw some oh yeah.

17
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:37,199
Relative. And I'm just saying, you know, I was like, Oh, everyone hear me?

18
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:48,480
All right. All I'm doing is obviously I mean, that was just welcoming to everyone and the new year.

19
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:52,560
My name is Mike Thompson. I will be the services, of course.

20
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:57,740
I'm assistant professor in the Department of Cardiac Surgery, so I'm actually primarily in medical school,

21
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:04,320
but I have friends here, so I've just lecture in this course for the past several years.

22
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,720
So it's my first time actually teaching the whole course.

23
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:15,120
So a lot of this will be lifted from our dearly departed Amy Ryan, who was faculty here for several years and is now at Brown University.

24
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:24,120
So but I'm very excited to be here teaching and look forward to this semester, so hopefully you all enjoy it as much as I'm sure I will.

25
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,599
So today will largely be kind of introductory.

26
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,030
Talk a little bit about the course, the goals for the course,

27
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:36,660
kind of how we're planning on running the course in terms of projects and grading and whatnot.

28
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:42,389
And then hopefully just I'd like to learn a little bit from you all in terms of what you're thinking,

29
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:48,540
in terms of the problems that we face in health care in the US as well as the issues that you think you would like to have impact on.

30
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:51,870
So, um, a little bit about me.

31
00:06:52,290 --> 00:07:00,299
I'm a health services and policy researcher. I'm an epidemiologist by training, but I do primarily health services policy research and my work,

32
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:05,580
my research largely focuses on identifying and intervening upon opportunities to improve health care,

33
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:09,420
quality and value, particularly for patients with cardiovascular disease.

34
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:15,420
But I'm the co-director of a statewide quality collaborative, Michigan Valley Collaborative,

35
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:22,940
and we work with health care leaders throughout the state and both the clinical side of the administrative side to identify,

36
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:28,350
intervene upon opportunities for for them to improve quality and value within their health systems.

37
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:33,209
So other things to know about me. I'm a native Michigander.

38
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:39,810
I was born and raised in Lansing. I've lived in Michigan essentially my whole life outside of a couple of years of living in Tennessee.

39
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:43,590
And of course, I am an unapologetic Michigan State fan.

40
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:52,709
So people are going to have to deal with that. I'm not going to tell you the totality of it, but that's largely because I was during college.

41
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:56,160
I was also a mascot for two years.

42
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:01,380
I was Sparty. So that effectively kind of gets deep and it's hard to kind of get up, get that up,

43
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:09,570
but also spend a couple a summer as a as a pro mascot for a lot while.

44
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:15,959
So a little bit about me. I have three busy and very curious children.

45
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:20,460
So no matter how many questions you ask me during class one, we never amount to the same about that.

46
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,850
I get asked every day, so please don't hesitate to ask a question.

47
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:31,499
I'm used to it. They are a tendency for and I'm currently watching Peaky Blinders and I think about that.

48
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:38,340
I'm several years behind, but I'm in season four, so no spoilers after that, but I'm very much enjoying that at the moment.

49
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:50,240
Okay. So 2023 edition of HP 601 will cover a lot of different things and hopefully had a chance to look through the syllabus,

50
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,640
look through some of the topics that we're going to be going over.

51
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:59,360
Kind of broadly speaking, we're going to focus a lot on understanding health care, quality and payment in the US.

52
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,629
So what is quality and how do we measure it? What is where is it passed?

53
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:05,540
Where is it worst? How do we improve it? Where do we improve it?

54
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:13,219
And related to that is how does how do hospitals and physicians get paid and ultimately how does that impact quality and value?

55
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,100
So those are very two things that are very tied together.

56
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:23,840
We spend a good amount of time on that and learn a little bit about the policies and programs that we use to improve quality and value.

57
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:28,070
So what are the major things that we're doing in the U.S. to try to improve quality?

58
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:33,050
Are they working or are they not working? How can they be improved? How can they be tweaked and even scrapped altogether?

59
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:36,800
And ultimately, also, what can we learn from other countries?

60
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:41,300
We have a certain health care system that doesn't really work like a lot of other places in the world.

61
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:49,129
So what can we learn from them? How do we maybe take what we are not so good at trying to improve upon it, those types of things.

62
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:54,620
And then the last part would be kind of like organizational strategies, like we know what quality is,

63
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,620
we know where it's not great, how do we actually do something about it?

64
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,479
It's often the hardest thing to do.

65
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:05,900
So what are some techniques that organizations can use to improve quality within their systems, within their clinical practice?

66
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:13,530
Those types of topics? So the first half is going to be largely didactic.

67
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:20,010
These are kind of the week to week, you know, class by class kind of lectures that we're going to be planning out.

68
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:26,399
Some of this may be kind of, you know, moved around based off of, you know, things that we as we move forward.

69
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,680
But this is largely what we're going to go through.

70
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:35,190
We'll start next week talking about the state of health care quality in the U.S., moving towards kind of how do we measure it?

71
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:40,260
How do we evaluate it effectively? And talk a little bit after that about payment systems.

72
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,389
We'll talk about the private medical billing in the sense that it has a really

73
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:50,280
important part of our health care system when it comes to thinking about networks,

74
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:55,799
how patients navigate the health care system and insurance system of alternative payment strategies,

75
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:01,210
public reporting, and then get into like, how do we actually do something about health care quality?

76
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:06,480
How do we improve it? What are systematic things that we can do? We'll touch on health equity and disparities a little bit,

77
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:13,770
and then we'll spend the last couple before the last couple of sessions before spring break talking about international systems.

78
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:18,510
How do we prepare? We'll have some activities around that. There will be no classes on February 9th,

79
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:22,709
so just make sure to keep that in mind and I'll make sure that we all would argue

80
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:28,500
that we're talking about the second half is going to be a little different.

81
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:32,990
It's going to focus on presentations. I'll go through that later.

82
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,880
But we're going to be spending several sessions of this course having groups present about specific things.

83
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:44,520
I'll get into that shortly, and then after those we'll have guest lectures.

84
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:50,429
This has been a kind of a tradition for the format for several years now where we had other experts within the health system

85
00:11:50,430 --> 00:12:01,110
here in the university talk about specific topics and kind of hot topics in health care and those that are experts in it.

86
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:09,480
I'm Rebecca, and Rebecca is an internist here at the university, and she does a lot of work on financial toxicity and equity channel.

87
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,790
Moodle is the director of virtual care here of Michigan Medicine and I worked with him on some projects and

88
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:19,110
[INAUDIBLE] talk a little bit about telehealth policy and how that impacts value and quality of care for patients.

89
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:25,259
Don't care. Nathan's a surgical oncologist and [INAUDIBLE] be talking a little bit about health care systems

90
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:29,750
and how we think about health care quality and value within the framework of health care system.

91
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:38,070
Uh, Dr. Lindsay Adnan is an OB-GYN here, and she does a lot of work on maternal health and the impact of health insurance coverage on maternal health.

92
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:42,240
And then Dr. Mike Inglesby is a transplant surgeon here,

93
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:48,839
is also the director of these of the Statewide Collaborative Quality Initiative Program here at Michigan.

94
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:53,040
And talk about how we use the collaborative model to improve health care throughout the state.

95
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,360
So this is what we have planned. There may be things moving around here and there. They're all clinicians.

96
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,719
So they have very busy schedules that sometimes are a little unpredictable.

97
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,620
So we will adjust as we need to. There will also be no classes.

98
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:11,040
April 13th. Again, I'll remind you as we have postponement, something to keep in mind and then we'll close with kind of a what have we learned?

99
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:21,280
How do we put it all together as we move forward? So this course is designed to kind of build on what you learned in HP 600.

100
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:26,200
So, you know, in HP 600, we talk about disparities in health care in this course.

101
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:32,020
We're hopefully going to learn a little bit about how do we do something about it, what do we learn in terms of value problems?

102
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,280
How do we change payment delivery system strategies to improve value?

103
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,360
And 600 you learned about quality issues or variation in health care outcomes.

104
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:46,180
Again, we're trying to learn and the systematic ways to improve that or how payment delivery systems can impact that.

105
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:53,920
So that's kind of what we're how we transitioned from 600, which is just kind of understanding the basics of it to how do we do something about it,

106
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,850
what are the levers for improvement, how do you measure it effectively? Those kinds of things.

107
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:05,960
So the concessions, at least in the first half, will include a combination of lectures.

108
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:10,550
We have some kind of design, small group activities, class discussions.

109
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:15,769
It's my job to keep it interesting, so I hope to do that. I think if I can keep it interesting,

110
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:22,219
everyone will hopefully in turn be engaged in and that will make the small group activities and discussions more lively.

111
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:28,460
So. So that's on me. So I will keep track of that. But I really want you to draw upon your own experiences.

112
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:37,760
I think well, you know, we all have very specific expertise as we're going through a program and health services and health policy.

113
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:44,000
We're learning kind of every on an academic level about health care, but we all have experiences from health care.

114
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,840
We've grown up in the health care system. Sometimes in the U.S., sometimes abroad.

115
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:52,430
And so I really would like to draw on those experiences. And we can we all have them.

116
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:57,169
I think that will help to contribute to others learnings in this class and hopefully mine as well.

117
00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:02,540
And I'm sure it will. And all classes that I read will have some sort of class activity,

118
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:08,359
whether it's a small group discussion or something like that, and those are usually embedded in the slides.

119
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:12,590
So if you want to get a sense of what to expect, we'll take a look at the slides and those will be in there.

120
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:20,120
So our to do is for you to I think you all know from last year.

121
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:28,700
So not alone. So I'm very thankful that for me this year because you will be a big help to me.

122
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:33,700
And so I'm sure you all have a chance to interact with or if you have a.

123
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:43,070
Okay. So let's talk a little bit about the grading part. So I want to do this just to to to kind of set the ground rules.

124
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:49,579
But a big part of this class will be class participation coming in class,

125
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:56,420
engaging in discussions as a person that has spent a lot of time thinking about incentives and how they impacts quality,

126
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:02,210
I think having an incentive for you to be here and engage in those discussions will lead to a better place.

127
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:12,350
And so really, this is intended to incentivize that behavior of coming here and working as a class and learning and learning together.

128
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:18,889
And so this will be a continual thing that will go throughout. But I just that's that's why this is here.

129
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:21,830
That's why it was designed here, designed to be a part of this,

130
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:26,540
because I think that will ultimately lead to a better learning experience for everyone.

131
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:32,800
So you'll have an opportunity to write a paper. This is not required.

132
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:41,980
I will go into this a little bit in detail, but the paper, if you so choose to do it, will be kind of a perspective piece.

133
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:51,549
You can see them in medical journals or New England Journal. They're usually 1000 1500 word essays relevant to a specific topic.

134
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:56,020
And really it's designed to just say, like, can we identify some sort of critical issue in health care,

135
00:16:56,710 --> 00:17:00,190
understand why it's why it is a problem or what the problem is,

136
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:07,120
and then propose some solutions to addressing this either in a system level or policy level or whatever the case may be.

137
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:12,730
And so this is something that is optional. It is not required, but I'll get into it.

138
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,700
How this all fits together. The large part of this course will be the group project.

139
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:22,160
So there are two options for this project.

140
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:29,490
One is a case study. So thinking about different topics in health care, and the other is an empirical analysis.

141
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:34,809
So a case study could be something like there's a list of them here.

142
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:40,390
And as we get through the process of like figuring out what was the case, that it will be 4 to 4 different groups,

143
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:44,500
there will be a whole list of them that you will be able to choose from and learn about.

144
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,760
And I'm happy if there are other things that would be interesting and happy to hear about those, too.

145
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:55,690
But, you know, understanding obesity management, Kaiser Permanente, new mindset for health care delivery.

146
00:17:55,690 --> 00:18:00,729
These are often based off of options that were written in Harvard Business Review or other health care journals.

147
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:04,450
So there will be something to work from. These aren't just going to drop into thin air.

148
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:12,810
So there will be a long list of them. And the idea will be and we'll talk about what the what the general kind of context is for the problem,

149
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,400
what the solution is in terms of this case study,

150
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:21,550
understand the pros and cons you know its potential whether it found anything and kind of implications for future.

151
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:29,290
And so as I said like kind of in how the class will be arranged, the idea is that there'll be two group presentations per class.

152
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:33,250
So roughly 30 minutes, 35 minutes, you know, give or take.

153
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:40,129
That's the kind of designed time for everybody. The other is an empirical project.

154
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:46,150
So this is where we actually get a data set and start working on some data. It's a little more of a research project.

155
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:54,580
Obviously, it does not have to be a published paper or anything like that, but would be to identify a data source,

156
00:18:54,790 --> 00:19:00,670
execute analysis and present the results, but be a little more traditional kind of academic project.

157
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,690
It would be really important if if a group chooses to do this,

158
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:10,060
that's one of the members of the group would have the experience be very difficult to do that without any aid experience.

159
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:17,080
And if people are interested in this as we go through the process of identifying the groups and the group projects,

160
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:22,230
if people are interested in an empirical project, I'd like to meet with all of you and discuss that just so that, you know,

161
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,790
we're not just throwing into the department, but we can actually work through some of those issues as we go forward.

162
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:32,980
It can be challenging, but it also can be very rewarding in that sense.

163
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,330
So it's something to think about.

164
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:43,570
And yes, I know group work can be challenging at times, but it really is an important part of professional development.

165
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:50,980
I don't know of anything that I work on or many in the health care system work on that does not involve a group in some way, shape or form.

166
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,300
And so the group will be between three and five students.

167
00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:00,040
You can request to have a specific group of people. I'm not going to just assign people.

168
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:03,850
So if there is a group of people that you'd like to work with, you can work through that.

169
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:09,670
There will be a survey that goes out that will help to kind of work through some of these things.

170
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:15,170
And then after we have kind of all the responses from the device, we'll kind of set out,

171
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:18,790
you know, what the groups will be, the projects will be and go from there.

172
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:21,820
So there'll be more to come that will be coming through the first month of this course.

173
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,500
Those things will be determined.

174
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:29,560
And then through February and March, you'll have the opportunity to work through those projects and present them at early, early to mid-March.

175
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,860
Another way to earn points in the class is to watch what are called flipped lectures,

176
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,639
essentially their recorded lectures from prior years of age 26 to 1.

177
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:46,350
For people that have presented, you can earn up to ten points.

178
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:50,280
There are short quizzes with each of the lectures that are worth two points each.

179
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:56,310
They're all on canvas. So you watch a lecture, answer a couple of questions, and you can get up to ten extra points just for watching those lectures.

180
00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:08,680
So those are all available on canvas and in the quizzes part. You also have the opportunity to earn points through reading quality improvement cases.

181
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:13,479
So these are short manuscripts that are available on canvas that you read through them.

182
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:19,809
It presents a quality improvement initiative that somebody that undertaken an exam,

183
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:23,320
really a short quiz associated with each of these that are all immediately graded.

184
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:28,750
There's no time limit on them. So you can go on, read through the case study to answer a couple of questions on those.

185
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:32,980
And those will be also a part of the opportunities to earn points.

186
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:42,919
So over the course of the semester, you can improve points for both.

187
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:51,710
Again, these mandatory and voluntary activities. You'll be able to earn the maximum number of participants for each activity effectively be graded.

188
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:56,060
And then the final grade will just be the accumulation of all these points from the various activities.

189
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,510
So excuse me, why are we doing this?

190
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:04,520
I think choice is important. I recognize that people learn in different ways.

191
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:08,990
I was a horrible test taker and that I just despise taking tests.

192
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:11,090
I know other people that love taking tests.

193
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:16,640
It doesn't mean that one is better than the other, but I think having the opportunity to learn and earn and,

194
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:21,740
you know, show your learning in those ways, in different ways is important.

195
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:27,470
And so I want people to be able to pursue interests, you know, maybe through two or three of these lectures on really interesting.

196
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:32,780
You can earn those points in those ways. Are you happy everyone got an A-plus?

197
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:37,969
I think that's my goal because that just shows that you're doing what you know is required.

198
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:41,450
And in your you're you're learning and you're moving above and beyond.

199
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:46,070
So I'd be happy if everyone got the four points possible and that I think that's ultimately the goal.

200
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:56,690
So how does this all kind of work out? So the first thing that will be do for this course that's required is a great planning exercise.

201
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:03,890
It's a short kind of an Excel document that just kind of maps out how you would kind of project to earn points through the year.

202
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:09,200
What things are you going to do? How many flip lectures do you kind of anticipate that you'll do just to kind

203
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,430
of give you a sense of planning for the semester that's worth three points?

204
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:19,700
Very, very straightforward. The second will be participation in class activities.

205
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:26,660
So showing up, engaging in discussion, those types of things that will be continuous and will occur throughout the semester.

206
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:33,379
Like I said, there's a paper, it's optional, it's worth 12 points that'll be due at the end of the semester.

207
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:36,590
You can turn it in. What, before that. But that is an option as well.

208
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:42,020
If you have something that you're working on that can be there for the project.

209
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:47,270
So here's the difference. When he's announcing the empirical analysis, his analysis is worth 40 points.

210
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:52,850
Empirical analysis because it requires more work and more time would be worth 65 points.

211
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:59,270
So greater risk, greater reward in terms of it just it would require more work, but you get a greater benefit for it.

212
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:04,370
So just something to keep in mind as you're moving forward that is the project

213
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:10,370
obviously is mandatory for the course is the flip lectures are optional.

214
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:14,270
Again, you can earn up to ten points. Those have to be completed by the end of the semester.

215
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:26,510
And the same thing with the quality improvement kind of case studies also worth up to 12 points and optional need to be done by the this semester.

216
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:32,990
So ultimately, if you do an empirical analysis, you have an opportunity to get up to 132 points.

217
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:39,380
The course is out of 100. So you could well exceed all of the points in the different course.

218
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,920
If you if you do the case analysis, you can get up to 107 points.

219
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:50,120
So again, well above the threshold for for for for the course in terms of getting the maximum number of points,

220
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:59,600
this is kind of the grand scale, pretty standard grading scale. So up to 107 points if you do the case analysis, A-plus as needed, 1797 points.

221
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,569
So you have a ten point buffer there in terms of what you would need.

222
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:08,299
So just something to consider as you're thinking through this and thinking through the grade planning exercises,

223
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:12,980
kind of thinking through how you want to allocate those points or what even kind of thing you want to do through the semester.

224
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:20,820
And hopefully with that great planning exercise, it's not just all at the end of the semester, you can sprinkle a few into the early parts,

225
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:25,590
sprinkle a few at the end, and then you're not kind of cramming for the end at the end of the semester as as I know.

226
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:29,050
I certainly, you know. Okay.

227
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:33,640
So let's get some examples. We have John here.

228
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:40,250
John decided to pretty much do the bare minimum. We did really well at the bare minimum.

229
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:44,260
He was great. So get all into the great planning exercise.

230
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:47,770
Did every class engage in every discussion?

231
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:53,549
Did a case analysis? Knocked it out of the park? But he didn't do any of the other stuff, didn't do a paper.

232
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:57,780
He didn't watch and flip lectures, didn't do the case studies. Walked through the C-minus.

233
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:04,790
Now, Paul, on the other hand, decided to go a little bit more.

234
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:10,540
So he again did the great planning exercise. He may have missed a class here and there and that's okay.

235
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:17,600
He still did really well on the on the participation decided to do a midterm paper did well in that

236
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:23,809
decided to do a case analysis again did well on that but didn't watch any of the flip lectures.

237
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:29,600
Didn't do it or watch a couple of them. You know he did in a few of their walks away with an A-minus.

238
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:35,210
And then we have Ringo. We all know Ringo's the star of the show.

239
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:41,629
Right. So, again, great planning, participation in class activities did really well.

240
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:47,420
Maybe. Maybe he missed a lecture here and there. That's all right. I did midterm paper did really well in that.

241
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:51,260
Decided to go all out he wanted to do the imperial project did really well.

242
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:57,380
I didn't watch any public lectures, did maybe one of the quality improvement case studies under five points.

243
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:02,719
So again, the purpose of this is to just show that there's not one right way to do it.

244
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:09,230
You can kind of pick and choose the way you want to do it. Well, maybe sounds the most interesting to you what you want to spend the most time on.

245
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:16,540
There are different ways to go about this. Okay.

246
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:22,720
Stop there. Does anybody have any questions about the class design, how it's set up?

247
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:31,860
Yes, I do reach out for attendance. So, you know, so today's not going to.

248
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:35,790
We're not doing anything today. There will be name cards that we will put out.

249
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:39,630
So when you come into class, pick up your main card, put in front of you.

250
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:46,350
Help me as well, because I want to actually be able to know your names. And so that's how we will kind of keep attendance through the course.

251
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,830
Those will start on Tuesday. Did the name cards look like this?

252
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:54,380
They would be great, but I don't.

253
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,980
We're going to we'll make sure everyone's got one. Right.

254
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:03,200
You get an extra point for today and say, Ronnie, this one says, Run, John, we're just fine.

255
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:06,930
I'll just have both. Something like that.

256
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:12,960
So that will start next week. And again, it's like if there are if there are issues, you know, unexpected absence that,

257
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:16,680
you know, something comes up the last minute, just let me know that that will help.

258
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:20,340
And I don't want to penalize people for things that are outside of their control.

259
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:24,990
Just just let me know and we'll we'll get that figured out.

260
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:29,400
But I certainly recognize that there are situations that arise at the last minute that can't.

261
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:39,020
Any other questions? Yes.

262
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:44,150
For the empirical study. Is there a list of previous possible topics to do?

263
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:50,060
That's a great idea. I can look into what was done over the previous years and maybe provide some examples of that.

264
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:57,590
So I think the short answer would, yes, I can I can make sure there are at least some examples to give a sense of what people are doing.

265
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:11,220
Yes. Is it possible to do the empirical case using Excel or what do you need to use?

266
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:21,329
That's a good question. I think it should be. I mean, there may have to be and that would be something that if we did if you decided to go that route,

267
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:26,580
that we can we can talk through that and figure out, you know, do we need something more than Excel or what would be needed?

268
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:35,129
So I think certainly for data visualization purposes, I think that would be fine for that kind of descriptive analysis.

269
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:39,210
Probably should design anything more in that will figure out so.

270
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:49,650
Questions. I.

271
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:59,010
Well, now it's time for you all to talk. This is intended to be discussion based.

272
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:06,670
We do have one of these things which I think is a pool check.

273
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:20,730
So I want to hear from you. What do you think are the biggest problems in health care, specifically around quality, cost values, service failure?

274
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:34,180
Because it seems like we should have a consistency.

275
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:38,270
Uniformity? Yes. Consistency in which way? Everything.

276
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,730
Everything costs.

277
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:45,870
Quality, just it's all over the map and depends on the health system. Depends on an area the size of the person.

278
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:54,430
Sure. Yeah, absolutely. And other problems all the way over here sometimes.

279
00:30:54,770 --> 00:31:02,340
Send it and send it. Well, I.

280
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:13,680
The fact that we kind of decide who deserves affordable health care place on the society or not, which I think is a big ethical issue.

281
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:15,780
Right. So equity and access.

282
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:28,950
Equity and insurance coverage and who who's, you know, who has and who has not if you don't have a job and deserve affordable, remained an easy one.

283
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:35,760
I think drug pricing is a huge issue, especially in the U.S. We pay a lot more for drugs than people do in other countries.

284
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:38,910
Yes. It's the famous Huber Reinhart.

285
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:43,500
It's the price is stupid, as anyone wants to know what that is about.

286
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:47,910
Everyone asks why health care is so expensive. That's a simple response.

287
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:51,690
It's the prices. But out of work? Yes.

288
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:59,660
Well, why do I think the wait times can be a really big issue, especially in specialty care?

289
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:03,690
It can be like six months at least to get an appointment.

290
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:07,530
And then if you like, have something come up that day, you're kind of screwed.

291
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:16,080
Yes, absolutely. So, you know, the availability in certain specialties and how able you are to get in the system,

292
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:22,440
you got some behind you, as you say, over utilization of care as well is another big issue.

293
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:26,849
People just getting care that they don't necessarily need and then that just contributes to added costs.

294
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:35,940
And people also may be finding out about things that they have and then going down this rabbit hole of getting constant error all the time.

295
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:39,540
Yeah. Overtesting. Huge problem. Yeah, I know.

296
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:47,429
That's that's especially been talked about a lot recently with the NFL player that had collapsed on the field.

297
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:51,780
And then it's student card checks. Should every athlete be getting these?

298
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:55,920
Many physicians and clinicians would tell you probably not.

299
00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:04,110
And that's a that's a really important, critical question, because it's obviously very, very in everyone's eyes right now.

300
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,529
It's not something we want to have happen, but overtesting.

301
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:13,680
And then ultimately what happens from that testing in the rabbit hole and kind of the continual testing is obviously a problem.

302
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:17,910
Yes, I feel like health literacy is also an issue.

303
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:24,240
It's pretty low in the U.S. and so a lot of people might not reach out for the health care that they need.

304
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:29,200
But like on the forms, they may not know exactly what certain words might mean.

305
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:34,920
They might just feel afraid to even ask or kind of admit that they need more help.

306
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:42,510
And so I feel like the words that are used in health care might be might not be as accessible for

307
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:47,580
people to kind of figure out what that means and really understand what they need for health care.

308
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:54,390
Absolutely. Yeah. Literacy, readability, understanding, comprehension, all those things are really important.

309
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:59,730
You know, we're working with some folks and understanding, you know, the websites that we have.

310
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:06,360
They're supposed to be meant to be accessible, but the reading level is often way off the charts for most people.

311
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:10,080
So obviously, when you talk about health disparities and equity, that's.

312
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,350
All right. Other ones.

313
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:26,979
A friend of a couple of rows up here, and I'll make sure your water is closed because it generally crumbles, but particularly evident in Michigan.

314
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:32,110
Mergers and acquisitions and consolidation. Yes, absolutely.

315
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:36,520
Yeah, that's been a hot topic here in Michigan over the past year or so.

316
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:43,360
You know, spectrum is now the core while health care and Michigan medicine merging, urging,

317
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:48,520
whispering and saying that's a yeah, that's a huge a huge topic of conversation, that's for sure.

318
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:57,070
I was going to say the cost of medical education and how it disincentivizes providers moving into primary care and underserved communities.

319
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:58,370
Absolutely.

320
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:05,560
So that will touch on a little bit when we talk about physician payments, because that is a huge problem when it comes to how physicians get paid,

321
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:11,260
what specialties they end up going to and what that means or how our health care system is designed.

322
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:19,460
Absolutely. It's pretty related to what she just said, I think just unnecessary hierarchy and gatekeeping medicine.

323
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:24,819
So, I mean, in some states, for example, NPS and Vas can prescribe things that they can in other states and things like that.

324
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:27,820
So and also placement consistency. But yeah, yeah.

325
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:33,010
No, that's a huge problem. And in my own work, we are seeing that a lot.

326
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:35,260
I do a lot of work in cardiac rehab.

327
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:42,520
And for anyone to attend chronically, you have to have to have a cardiologist on site, although the exercise physiologist doing most of that.

328
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:53,540
So there was a recent bill that was in progress that would allow exercise physiologist and PS to allow them to to conduct this kind of rehab visit.

329
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,940
But it was not passed.

330
00:35:55,150 --> 00:36:03,490
So which a huge problem for rehab is access, because you only have so many physicians, you know, only so many appointments and so forth.

331
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:15,319
So absolutely is it is an issue. CORNISH But not only with patients but also with employers.

332
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:22,940
I think there's a lot of issues around short staffing and burnout with employees because maybe they don't feel valued and heard by the entire city.

333
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:26,320
Yeah, yeah. I mean, COVID really put that into a bunker, right?

334
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:27,770
I think that was a huge problem.

335
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:36,829
And it is certainly rearing its head over the past couple of years that I don't know if anyone saw the news story or the tick tock Twitter of

336
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:51,290
the psych ward and the New York hospital and see that they had one nurse for 58 patients in the acute care site were quite short staffed.

337
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,920
A poor administration obviously 1 to 15.

338
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:59,660
A nurse patient ratio is not good, particularly for an acute care psych ward.

339
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:09,530
So again, these are pervasive issues that I think COVID certainly is a set of other professions.

340
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:20,840
I think also going along with health literacy, there's a lot of like lack of trust in the health care system in the general public,

341
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:27,620
especially because of all the profit driven incentives and misinformation that is spread like distrust in the health care system is a big problem.

342
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:32,390
Yeah. Yeah, I think we've seen that over the past couple of years for sure.

343
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,220
I had when I was I had the opportunity to, as a postdoc, to work in Memphis.

344
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:42,889
A huge problem that they were dealing with those communities is how do you build trust with those communities?

345
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:48,710
And so there's some interesting observations from that in terms of community engagement

346
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:54,290
that are really impactful programs that those that those health systems were doing,

347
00:37:54,980 --> 00:38:01,880
which I think certainly would be an interesting case study, is how you build trust within the community so that they're, you know.

348
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:06,030
They didn't feel comfortable in going to the doctor.

349
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:11,600
So. I think we got it.

350
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:18,430
Yes. Oh, that's crazy.

351
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:23,880
I don't want any injuries on the ground. That's what I say.

352
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:27,810
That's right. I'm more worried about the diving for it.

353
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:38,070
I would say that the lack of, like, public health and health systems not working together in the US specifically,

354
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:47,010
which has led to a ton of problems that other countries don't experience when they work closely with their public health departments.

355
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:52,110
Yeah, it's it's it is an interesting distinction in that, you know, the,

356
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:59,700
the the public health system is often parallel to the health care system and they often do not intersect, which is a real challenge.

357
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:04,620
I think that the in Michigan, at least with the collaborative quality initiatives that we've had,

358
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:09,930
we've tried to make more inroads with public health departments because it is such a crucial part of of that,

359
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:13,260
particularly for rural people that are really located,

360
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:17,880
because the rural the rural populations often rely on those those health departments for many things.

361
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:23,060
So it's certainly an issue that we have to do.

362
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:29,520
Three more in the next question. You know, the unpopular one that comes to mind for me and the unsolvable and really in the United

363
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:33,959
States is just the design of the health care system and the payer system in general.

364
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:41,280
Right. Because it kind of summarizes a little bit of everybody when everybody said, but everybody's at odds with each other.

365
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:45,450
The physicians are at odds with the patients a lot in terms of I didn't do this test,

366
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:49,139
but they may not have the right insurance and the patient's at odds with the insurance.

367
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:53,580
And and the doctor, you know, we have this third party payer system,

368
00:39:53,580 --> 00:40:00,930
and every solution that we come up with further inflates the system, makes it more expensive, more costly, etc.

369
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:07,529
Yeah, I mean, it brings up the, the quote, the system is designed to do exactly what it intends.

370
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:11,759
And everyone says the health care system is broken. No, the health care system is a system.

371
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:16,080
It just it gives you what you designed it to do this, right?

372
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:22,290
Yeah. So misaligned incentives, all these things are are really challenging because it does put and I'm sure we'll

373
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:26,370
see this through the semester and as you go through your careers that you know,

374
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:31,260
things aren't always working in the same direction. And so how do we fix that?

375
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:35,670
How do we get a lot of incentives or or policies or people to work together?

376
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:44,819
Couple more. It's very cathartic. You can all be very positive.

377
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:55,290
Start the new year. Yes, we're going to get all the problems out and then we're going to fix them all this time because, you know, it's Festivus.

378
00:40:55,290 --> 00:41:02,760
It's the airing of grievances because of the like structure.

379
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:08,970
Okay. So now we're going to get to the positive part, right? And so how do you want to make an impact?

380
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:14,070
I'm curious to learn from you all, because I'm sure we all have different phenotypes.

381
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:20,130
We all have different interests. I'm really curious to hear the things that you all are interested in, how you want to it,

382
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:30,210
whether it's as a physician or a public health official or as an analyst or, you know, nonprofit is.

383
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:31,110
I'm really good at that.

384
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:42,569
And that will help me to think about how I work through some of these lectures and decide where I feel like, I guess I'll start.

385
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:47,520
I just, you know, I, I look at the system that we have and like I said, it's kind of an unsolvable problem.

386
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:53,400
But I do see some people making big progress and there are a couple of systems like this, but Kaiser is the one that comes to mind.

387
00:41:53,730 --> 00:42:04,020
They have a model that really aligns incentives. You know, it's got a heavy focus on preventative care and it's they've done a really good job.

388
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:11,670
And I think that that's the kind of insurance integrated system that can be duplicated throughout the country or maybe even mandated.

389
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:22,110
We need to have more like regulatory policies, like insurance companies and drug pricing and all that.

390
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:29,880
It's just to hold people accountable. And yeah, no, I think, you know, that's a that's a big job.

391
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:34,350
We have an uphill climb, but I think there certainly is a lot of room for that.

392
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:41,879
I think that that will be certainly is a topic of conversation, which but not only the regulatory part,

393
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:47,340
but, you know, how do we effectively write policy in a way that is functional?

394
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:55,830
Yes, absolutely. I want to contribute to timber based health care and the push for that's allowing middle level and advanced

395
00:42:55,830 --> 00:43:02,300
practice providers to operate at the top their license and hopefully improve health care so very comfortably.

396
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:12,640
Right. Working in health policy research or advocacy to ensure or expand access to reproductive and gender affirming care.

397
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:19,120
Right. Yeah. Lots of people interested.

398
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:27,410
Are you going to change the world? Me? Behind all this.

399
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:38,930
This is probably not at all aligned with things like HIV probably, and their ability to be just reduced.

400
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:45,320
Having an older population means that you reduce the general demand for care, like across the board.

401
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:49,579
So that could be something that you could look into.

402
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:55,940
It's very, very upstream. But yeah, just population improve.

403
00:43:55,950 --> 00:44:02,540
Population health means that the problem that we're dealing with and changing the system might be a less daunting

404
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:09,050
task if we don't have this stream of health outcomes that are undesirable for the system in the first place.

405
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:16,340
It's yeah, it's a huge problem. Population health is such a sticky problem and we deal with this all the time when we talk with our hospital partners.

406
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:20,060
Everyone wants to reduce readmissions, right? Because that's a medicare penalizes them for it.

407
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:24,559
They say, well, we need to get more upstream on this. Further upstream, we want to.

408
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,850
Yes. And so it was always a question.

409
00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:31,190
They say, well, we need to reduce readmissions, so we need to get in before the person has the initial hospitalization.

410
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:34,070
So they say, okay, if you look for it back far enough,

411
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:39,139
most these people are probably hospitalized six months before or a year before that, two years before that.

412
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:43,700
So it's such a challenging problem because there is you know,

413
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:49,220
when you think about health care quality in the acute care phase, that problem is right in front of you.

414
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:58,480
But like moving the needle on a distribution of the population is a much more challenging problem because there is no time zero, right?

415
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:02,569
Everything occurs kind of as people are moving through their lives.

416
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:09,250
But it is absolutely has it's a very it's I applaud you for that because for trying to do that, because I haven't figured that out.

417
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:13,700
Nobody's it's really challenging to do it. And I think we certainly need to work in that direction.

418
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:27,499
Yeah, personally, I want to make an impact on mental health through like broad level mental health care strategy on policy.

419
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:36,440
But I have no idea as to why you and you and many others, I think, see that that problem certainly hasn't been fixed.

420
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:41,810
You know, I think we're finally to the point we're talking about mental health is like, you know, not taboo anymore.

421
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:52,050
And then I think we've certainly made some strides, but it is a very big problem, very big challenge.

422
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:55,100
So it's other hours of the world.

423
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:58,879
It's going to change the world. I've heard from the side. Let's get the microphone over here.

424
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:09,200
Who's been changed the world over here? I think a lot of.

425
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:16,700
Oh, they said another. Yeah. There was a speaker that came and spoke to us last semester that was working in the health system in New Orleans.

426
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:22,790
And one of the things that they were talking about was reinvesting back into the community, and they recognized that there was a nursing shortage.

427
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:29,030
So they were building nursing school. And those are the things that can help them as a health system, but also help the population.

428
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:34,090
Absolutely. This is a very interesting article that was written, I think,

429
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:42,530
in Politico several years ago about a Cleveland Clinic and Cleveland Clinic being located in one of the poorest neighborhoods in Cleveland.

430
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:49,010
And you know what? What responsibility is it for the health system to reinvest in its community?

431
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:53,270
So if you're interested in that, I would encourage you to look that up, because it is a very interesting piece.

432
00:46:54,350 --> 00:46:59,509
Yes, I'm interested in an academic medicine. So like the cross-section of education,

433
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:04,129
research and clinical experience is an area where we could drive a lot of new

434
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:08,040
improvements and giving patients the best experience and improving their health,

435
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:19,320
which we can look. So I have a very, very specific area.

436
00:47:19,330 --> 00:47:22,569
I'm doing a dual degree right now, so I'm also training to be a genetic counselor.

437
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:26,889
So I'll be a clinician when I'm done. And I am planning to be a prenatal genetic counselor.

438
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:30,250
So I'm extremely interested in abortion access policy.

439
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:35,290
So I think it would be really important to make sure that I could expand it because my patients deserve to have

440
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:40,930
all of their options on the table and then also protections for providers like myself who are doing our job.

441
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:44,100
We make abortion referrals absolutely right.

442
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:54,440
Meantime, you all are throwing high value in the health care,

443
00:47:54,980 --> 00:48:00,530
being like fluent in sign language and seem like the problems that they had in like something that

444
00:48:00,530 --> 00:48:05,179
really stuck out to me was that they didn't get interpreters from the hospital till they were seen,

445
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:06,620
but not the registration.

446
00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:15,500
So I overall want to improve the whole patient experience and make it more customizable to people and not just like say about why actually do that.

447
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:21,259
Yeah, no, absolutely. I think that's that's certainly has been a trend as I've seen at Michigan Medicine.

448
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:29,480
They've been trying to do more to get to that point of as soon as a patient comes in the door, they're understanding their needs.

449
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:35,450
And that's challenging because that's a big shift. Everyone's got processes in a SUSY DB for the process.

450
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:40,970
Everybody starts running around with their hair on fire. So making sure that those are available, it would be great.

451
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:50,510
Other things. London.

452
00:48:54,570 --> 00:48:56,459
I think Andrew mentioned how everyone's at odds.

453
00:48:56,460 --> 00:49:03,960
So I guess being part of, you know, initiatives that build bridges and just, you know, between specialties,

454
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:07,830
between different entities like health systems and like the department and things like that.

455
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:14,070
It's yes, that is absolutely a critical part of this.

456
00:49:14,070 --> 00:49:20,160
And I've learned, as you know, being involved in our statewide quality groups, soon as you get people in a room.

457
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:24,930
They're very amicable, very agreeable. They're happy to talk about how they can work together.

458
00:49:24,930 --> 00:49:28,170
And but getting them in the room together is always a challenge.

459
00:49:28,530 --> 00:49:35,250
And so it is a continual problem, but also is making sure you have all the right people in the room.

460
00:49:35,690 --> 00:49:39,090
It is a complex system, so it's certainly a challenge that we all face.

461
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:56,479
Couple more after two more. I think quality leadership is very important, especially in the management aspect.

462
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:05,480
So just understanding your staff and putting people in the right position to succeed will just increase experience for everybody,

463
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:08,510
really the patient and your staff and.

464
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:15,580
Yeah, it's absolutely. And that's for one more.

465
00:50:20,170 --> 00:50:29,680
Is ready is looking for the open person. I need one hand. I can, but we have to.

466
00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:38,570
Okay, great. Back in the front. Even better in the first place.

467
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:48,670
I think in particular, interesting information impact on your reporting systems and in terms of visits or testing and whatnot.

468
00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:54,219
I've done work at an individual specialty clinic and then that's now merging into Epic in the next couple of years.

469
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:56,740
And so talking about how that system, their own,

470
00:50:56,740 --> 00:51:02,200
is more coordinated to what they actually need to do versus the system they're being obviously pushed into.

471
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:06,790
And so kind of considering with all the mergers that are going on and anything like that,

472
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:11,380
that trying to coordinate these systems into one big field might not be the to do it because,

473
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:15,730
you know, certain fast plans for certain specialties and not for primary care.

474
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:21,159
And so I think maybe not trying to generalize that and actually looking at the individual details

475
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:24,970
of that would be something to think about moving forward as we combine all these systems.

476
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:34,660
Yeah, it's do you think we figured out health I.T. by now for how many years of to being part of the system at some point and.

477
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,329
Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

478
00:51:37,330 --> 00:51:44,590
So it certainly is a challenge, especially when you talk about mergers and getting systems to communicate with each other is a total mess sometimes.

479
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:51,400
And so I would certainly appreciate that you do a lot of the optimization of being able to communicate these things,

480
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:58,770
even this region, different specialties in the hospital systems for continuity of care of the patient.

481
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:04,839
I think it makes a big difference that they're all their physicians that they're seeing and they themselves are getting different information,

482
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:07,660
even though it isn't just the accommodations, language,

483
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:13,180
language is different between your point system that you get making plans and patient experience and then perspective as well.

484
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:14,680
Yeah, I think that's a key.

485
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:24,580
That's a huge area of growth and it's certainly, as you know, a systems in natural language processing get more kind of facile with the h.R.

486
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:32,770
And how those work together. And there was a report I can remember a couple years ago talking about how much duplicative material is in an MRI system.

487
00:52:32,770 --> 00:52:38,379
And it's just like millions of words are repeated because it's just copy paste,

488
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:42,070
copy paste, copy paste, which is not a good thing for patients and doctors.

489
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:49,740
So when you want more of the front end.

490
00:52:52,450 --> 00:53:02,710
Okay, I just wanted to say, I remember I read an article titled Racial Disparities in Equity in Health Care Research and Funding.

491
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:08,920
Mm hmm. So, you know, like we're focusing on different diseases and, for example, sickle cell,

492
00:53:09,370 --> 00:53:14,020
they don't focus on it as much as cystic fibrosis or the other way around.

493
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:17,620
So I think that's important also to focus on.

494
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:23,890
Yeah. I mean, just like, you know, how physicians and doctors get paid where the where the funding goes is where we learn more.

495
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:29,140
So there's certainly a there's a lot of a lot of room for improvement there.

496
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:36,399
Well, it's been great. So this is helpful. And, you know, I think the reason I wanted to go through that exercise is for two reasons.

497
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:40,900
One, so I can learn a little bit about what people are interested in, what people see as problems.

498
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:49,330
But ultimately, like the whole purpose of this course is to try to break those problems down a little bit.

499
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:52,900
All these problems have very specific, unique challenges.

500
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:59,930
We all have very specific, unique stakeholders and players and people that are involved, but they have a lot of overlap.

501
00:54:00,010 --> 00:54:05,530
I mean, if we're talking about mental health or we're talking about funding or we're talking about, you know,

502
00:54:05,530 --> 00:54:11,770
all these things, we'll have you know, there are there are lines that cross many of these problems.

503
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:17,020
And so my hope is that through this course, we can learn a little bit about the underlying foundational problems,

504
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:20,830
how those contribute to these quality problems. Clearly, we have a lot going on.

505
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:28,600
Our system is not perfect, not our. But hopefully we can learn a little bit about how we can improve it, opportunities and levers for improvement.

506
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,579
And then and hopefully you can walk away with this,

507
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:36,700
but with maybe a few nuggets of kind of this is what I can take from this and move on in terms of column change.

508
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:41,709
It will not happen overnight, but that is the premise, the whole point.

509
00:54:41,710 --> 00:54:45,550
And hopefully you can walk over that with some with some interesting kind of things to learn.

510
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:54,520
So with that coming up next week, again, this session was meant to be introductory.

511
00:54:56,130 --> 00:54:59,890
You know, people want to come chat afterwards, are happy to chat and mutual.

512
00:55:00,670 --> 00:55:06,520
There will be a great planning exercise that's on canvas. Take a look at it and then you can submit it there.

513
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:10,000
If you have questions about it, feel free to email pretty to RB.

514
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:19,210
We'll be sending out a Qualtrics survey which will help to kind of started the process around getting the groups assigned in the different projects.

515
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:23,770
So keep an eye out for that. Maybe in the next week or so. Again, you can form your own teams.

516
00:55:23,770 --> 00:55:29,170
So you already have people that you work with like. To work with? Well, that's that's certainly possible as well.

517
00:55:29,710 --> 00:55:35,950
And then next week, we'll be on Tuesday and Thursday kind of talking about the state of health care quality and value in the US.

518
00:55:36,190 --> 00:55:38,260
There's a few readings that will apply to both.

519
00:55:38,830 --> 00:55:43,330
So take a look at those, give them a read, or they'll be kind of a baseline of understanding where we're at.

520
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:48,870
And that class will cover those two classes will cover those issues.

521
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:52,090
So the slides are all up on canvas as well.

522
00:55:52,090 --> 00:55:57,490
So if those if you'd like. But we'll be going through those and questions.

523
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:08,310
One of the modules on canvas.

524
00:56:08,730 --> 00:56:13,180
We do the reading before we come to class. That would. Yes. So the idea would be to do the readings before.

525
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:19,169
There's usually a couple of prompting questions. Those are not intended for you to read and not say or think.

526
00:56:19,170 --> 00:56:25,740
But I think just thinking through the questions there will help kind of bring the readings together a little bit.

527
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:31,800
So ideally the readings would be done before class so that you can kind of have a foundational

528
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:35,610
kind of concept because many of those readings will be you kind of incorporating one as well.

529
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:39,240
So ideally, yes, and some are more.

530
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:45,300
There are optional ones that are just kind of extraneous but are maybe helpful or interesting if it's a topic you're interested in.

531
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:55,979
Other questions. Very well.
