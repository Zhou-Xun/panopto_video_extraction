1
00:00:04,735 --> 00:00:09,735
in cohort studies. First, let's think about how we define exposures

2
00:00:09,735 --> 00:00:14,735
in cohort studies and how we measure them. Recall from the previous part

3
00:00:14,735 --> 00:00:20,735
to this lecture session that cohort studies are often designed based on individuals

4
00:00:20,735 --> 00:00:25,735
exposure categories. And that cohort studies are extremely valuable in evaluating

5
00:00:25,735 --> 00:00:31,735
the effects of multiple different exposures on health outcomes. So in cohort studies, we

6
00:00:31,735 --> 00:00:36,735
are primarily concerned with how we define and measure exposures.

7
00:00:36,735 --> 00:00:42,735
In practice, exposure measurements are often reduced to a simple numeric study of a person's

8
00:00:42,735 --> 00:00:47,735
exposure history. So recall that throughout this course so far

9
00:00:47,735 --> 00:00:52,735
in all of our work examples, we have been using binary measures of a person's

10
00:00:52,735 --> 00:00:57,735
exposure status. So think about the two by two tables we've been looking at. We define people

11
00:00:57,735 --> 00:01:03,735
as either exposed or not exposed. A variable that takes on a value of zero or

12
00:01:03,735 --> 00:01:08,735
one. But in reality, the world doesn't work like that. And when people get exposed

13
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:13,735
to risk factors, it is really complicated. It matters the timing in a person's

14
00:01:13,735 --> 00:01:18,735
life when they are exposed to a risk factor, the length and the duration of exposure

15
00:01:18,735 --> 00:01:24,735
to that risk factor. The frequency with which they are exposed to it, as well as the intensity

16
00:01:24,735 --> 00:01:29,735
or dose of exposure that a person receives. And so while these zero one binary

17
00:01:29,735 --> 00:01:35,735
exposure measures have been really useful for learning purposes in the real

18
00:01:35,735 --> 00:01:40,735
world of conducting epidemiology, exposures don't actually work like that. So we need

19
00:01:40,735 --> 00:01:45,735
to think through very carefully how we actually define and measure exposures.

20
00:01:45,735 --> 00:01:50,735
Let's work through an example. Imagine we have a research question. What is the effect of poverty on risk

21
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:55,735
of heart attack? This is actually not a very good research question because it doesn't

22
00:01:55,735 --> 00:02:01,735
specify what poverty actually means. And we can define poverty and measure poverty

23
00:02:01,735 --> 00:02:06,735
in many different ways. And the examples that I'm going to give here refer to the timing

24
00:02:06,735 --> 00:02:11,735
with which poverty is measured. So we could do our cohort study. We could take we could recruit

25
00:02:11,735 --> 00:02:16,735
people into the study. And then we could assess their current levels of exposure to poverty at

26
00:02:16,735 --> 00:02:22,735
the baseline or start of the study. And we could simply define it as currently living under the poverty line.

27
00:02:22,735 --> 00:02:27,735
And so do we think that's a meaningful exposure? It probably doesn't capture a lot of

28
00:02:27,735 --> 00:02:33,735
variation or nuance in the experience of living under poverty, under the poverty line.

29
00:02:33,735 --> 00:02:38,735
If we wanted to look at poverty over a longer period of time, we could do something like take the average

30
00:02:38,735 --> 00:02:43,735
exposure. We could take average income for individuals across all years of the

31
00:02:43,735 --> 00:02:49,735
study. Whether or not we think that's a meaningful exposure is another question. Sometimes

32
00:02:49,735 --> 00:02:54,735
we think that exposures like poverty have an accumulated or cumulative effect.

33
00:02:54,735 --> 00:02:59,735
And so it would be a situation where it matters the length of time that someone is exposed

34
00:02:59,735 --> 00:03:05,735
to a given exposure. So we may think that living under the poverty line

35
00:03:05,735 --> 00:03:10,735
for a greater number of years might be associated with a greater risk of heart attack, in which case we

36
00:03:10,735 --> 00:03:15,735
may want to look at the cumulative exposure to poverty.

37
00:03:15,735 --> 00:03:21,735
The other thing that we need to take into account is lag periods between when the exposure is experienced

38
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:27,735
and when the disease outcome occurs and cohort studies set us up really well to be able to do that.

39
00:03:27,735 --> 00:03:32,735
And the lag period that we use is typically determined by what is biologically

40
00:03:32,735 --> 00:03:37,735
plausible. So at what point in a person's lifetime do we think

41
00:03:37,735 --> 00:03:42,735
the experience of living in poverty begins to actually have an effect on their risk of heart

42
00:03:42,735 --> 00:03:47,735
attack from a biological perspective? So we need to take into account both

43
00:03:47,735 --> 00:03:53,735
the induction period and the latency period of a chronic disease outcome when thinking about

44
00:03:53,735 --> 00:03:58,735
the appropriate lag period between an exposure and an outcome.

45
00:03:58,735 --> 00:04:03,735
So the induction period is defined as the action of the first component cause and

46
00:04:03,735 --> 00:04:08,735
recall from the Rothman's causal pies that there is usually a multifactorial

47
00:04:08,735 --> 00:04:13,735
etiology or cause of many disease outcomes. And this goes until the causal

48
00:04:13,735 --> 00:04:18,735
pie is completed and the disease onset occurs. And then, typically with most

49
00:04:18,735 --> 00:04:24,735
chronic diseases, there is a latency period between disease onset and clinical diagnosis.

50
00:04:24,735 --> 00:04:29,735
And during this latency period, the disease remains subclinical and does not yet express itself in a way

51
00:04:29,735 --> 00:04:35,735
that would lead to a diagnosis. So we need to account for these periods when timing, exposure, measurements

52
00:04:35,735 --> 00:04:40,735
with relation to when we start to measure the outcome.

53
00:04:40,735 --> 00:04:45,735
And defining exposures becomes more complicated when we think

54
00:04:45,735 --> 00:04:50,735
that chronic or accumulated exposure is really important. And so

55
00:04:50,735 --> 00:04:56,735
we often want to think about periods of accumulation of exposure. And so this would be a complex

56
00:04:56,735 --> 00:05:01,735
function of the intensity or dose of exposure as well as time. So going

57
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:06,735
back to the poverty and heart attack example, we would have to think through really carefully how to characterize

58
00:05:06,735 --> 00:05:11,735
accumulated exposure to poverty. And if this wasn't complicated

59
00:05:11,735 --> 00:05:16,735
enough, we often have to account for multiple levels of exposure. So

60
00:05:16,735 --> 00:05:21,735
recall that we've been defining exposure so far in this course as zero one binary

61
00:05:21,735 --> 00:05:27,735
exposures even here, this idea of exposure to poverty. It's a zero one exposure even.

62
00:05:27,735 --> 00:05:32,735
Either someone is in poverty or is not in poverty. But most exposures have multiple

63
00:05:32,735 --> 00:05:37,735
levels. There are gradations of the exposure and the number of levels that we look at

64
00:05:37,735 --> 00:05:42,735
is typically determined by the investigator. And based on our best knowledge,

65
00:05:42,735 --> 00:05:48,735
with respect to social and biological plausibility, in relation to our current knowledge

66
00:05:48,735 --> 00:05:53,735
of the etiology or causes of the disease outcome. And note here that we're using

67
00:05:53,735 --> 00:05:59,735
various Bradford Hill criteria to think through how we define an exposure with respect

68
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:06,735
to its plausibility for causation of the outcome.

69
00:06:06,735 --> 00:06:11,735
And finally, if all of this wasn't complicated enough, we need to think about the composite nature

70
00:06:11,735 --> 00:06:17,735
of many exposures that we look at, so many exposure measurements that we use in epidemiology

71
00:06:17,735 --> 00:06:22,735
are, in fact, a combination of two or more components. A really good example here

72
00:06:22,735 --> 00:06:27,735
is studies of smoking. So we often use a measure called pack years of cigaret smoking,

73
00:06:27,735 --> 00:06:34,735
which is in fact a composite of the duration and intensity or dose of cigaret smoke.

74
00:06:34,735 --> 00:06:39,735
So if possible. One thing that is generally good practice to do is to separately

75
00:06:39,735 --> 00:06:44,735
analyze the components of the composite exposure measurement. So in a hypothetical

76
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:50,735
study of cigaret smoking and risk of, say, dementia in later life, our primary

77
00:06:50,735 --> 00:06:56,735
exposure measure might be pack years. But then we may also want to conduct a supplemental analysis

78
00:06:56,735 --> 00:07:01,735
looking at the years smoked, which would be the duration and the number of packs per day, which would be the intensity

79
00:07:01,735 --> 00:07:06,735
or dose of exposure. So the intensity

80
00:07:06,735 --> 00:07:12,735
of exposure is one more thing I want to make a point about here. So there are multiple ways to think

81
00:07:12,735 --> 00:07:17,735
about characterizing the intensity of exposure. And this becomes more complicated if we're

82
00:07:17,735 --> 00:07:22,735
looking at a cumulative exposure that can vary over time. So we may choose to take

83
00:07:22,735 --> 00:07:27,735
the maximum intensity or dose of the exposure over the follow up period of our

84
00:07:27,735 --> 00:07:32,735
cohort study. So in the poverty example, we may choose to take the lowest level of annual

85
00:07:32,735 --> 00:07:37,735
income that a person experiences during the cohort study fall out, period. Alternatively,

86
00:07:37,735 --> 00:07:42,735
we could take the average intensity over the follow up period. And to do this, we

87
00:07:42,735 --> 00:07:47,735
may take a time weighted approach where we may weight specific measurements at specific points

88
00:07:47,735 --> 00:07:52,735
in time. If we think they are more important than that exposure at other points in time, and this implies that

89
00:07:52,735 --> 00:07:58,735
we need multiple measurements of the exposure over time in our cohort study.

90
00:07:58,735 --> 00:08:03,735
OK, so now let's simplify things a little bit and look at the measures of association that we can generate

91
00:08:03,735 --> 00:08:09,735
in cohort studies. In a cohort study, we can estimate both relative

92
00:08:09,735 --> 00:08:14,735
and absolute measures of association. And recall that this was kind of the key focus

93
00:08:14,735 --> 00:08:20,735
of the session we did on measures of association. So hopefully this should be really apparent to you.

94
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:25,735
So, for example, we could estimate cumulative incidents and incidents, density ratios for

95
00:08:25,735 --> 00:08:30,735
the incidents of outcomes. We could also estimate the risk difference, as well as the various forms of

96
00:08:30,735 --> 00:08:35,735
attributable risk. I will note here that these are not the only measures of association we

97
00:08:35,735 --> 00:08:40,735
can estimate in a cohort study. To be honest, we can estimate whatever we want using cohort data.

98
00:08:40,735 --> 00:08:46,735
But these are some of the most common and useful measures that we can generate from a cohort study.

99
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:51,735
Finally, a brief introduction to analytical methods and cohort studies. These

100
00:08:51,735 --> 00:08:57,735
are three types of models that are used to analyze cohort data or prospective data.

101
00:08:57,735 --> 00:09:02,735
Again, these are not the only types of models that we can use. But I want to briefly introduce them, because you may see

102
00:09:02,735 --> 00:09:08,735
these types of modeling approaches. When you read research papers that use cohort or longitudinal

103
00:09:08,735 --> 00:09:14,735
data. So the first is Poisson regression. We use Poisson regression to model count variables.

104
00:09:14,735 --> 00:09:19,735
We can account for confounders and Poisson regression in a multivariable model. And we typically

105
00:09:19,735 --> 00:09:24,735
use Poisson regression when the desired outcome variable is a rate or rate ratio. It is also

106
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:29,735
called a log linear model. We can also use pooled logistic regression

107
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:34,735
in cohort studies. We can use this when we have repeated measures on exposures

108
00:09:34,735 --> 00:09:40,735
at various time intervals. Finally, we can use Cox Proportional

109
00:09:40,735 --> 00:09:45,735
Hazards models in cohort studies. And this is the standard approach for survival analysis. When

110
00:09:45,735 --> 00:09:50,735
we have longitudinal time to event data, this is often used when we have mortality as

111
00:09:50,735 --> 00:09:55,735
our outcome. I'm not going to go into it in depth here because this is covered later in the class in the session on

112
00:09:55,735 --> 00:10:00,735
survival analysis. And that's it for Part Two. Please join us for Part Three, advanced

113
00:10:00,735 --> 00:10:06,735
and applied topics in Cohort Studies in the Life Zoom session on Thursday, September 17th, beginning

114
