1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,710
Items. The first thing I want to mention was regarding Cruise.

2
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:15,460
So you've all been getting amazing comments, really interesting comments on perusal.

3
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:19,960
But do be sure that you're commenting on both readings for the week.

4
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:26,140
So say you do six comments on the on the Tuesday reading.

5
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:33,400
That's still doesn't exempt you from the show's debut. And you have to comment on on on both sets of readings.

6
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:43,030
And like we said at the beginning of the semester, generally, that's something like two comments you make and one reply.

7
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:52,570
But we are far more interested in seeing high quality comments and replies than just commenting, you know, to fulfill the quota.

8
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:59,080
So even if that's one comment and one reply, as long as they're high meaningful quality, that's fine.

9
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:13,270
But do be sure that is on both readings for the week and then we'll just chat briefly about your next assignment as well as the paper,

10
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:26,080
which should be due at the end of October. If it would work.

11
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:50,530
So this is your next assignment, which I believe is due next week sometime.

12
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:56,040
And as always, with the assignments, you can request an extension for any reason.

13
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,180
You just have to do it before it's due.

14
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:06,400
This assignment is to familiarize you with the burden of disease, the overall burden of disease in the context you're working on.

15
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:14,889
When you're working, even if you're working on a specific disease, it's important to consider other diseases which are which are prevalent because you

16
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:19,510
can have cross-cutting intervention interventions or complementary interventions.

17
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:24,310
One example is if you're doing an intervention on HIV,

18
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,479
you still want to consider malnutrition because HIV can cause malnutrition all you

19
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,400
still want to consider other studies because there are complementary interventions,

20
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:40,630
you can have that. So in this assignment, you'll be looking at the other diseases that are prevalent in your and your context.

21
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,930
So you're going to have a look. You're just going to say what the W.H.O. region your context is in.

22
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:55,690
The W.H.O. has something called mortality strata, which is where stratify countries based on the mortality rate.

23
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:01,929
So you'll say what that is the countries less context you discuss the life expectancy,

24
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:08,260
the top causes of mortality and the factors that relate to those.

25
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,980
How those compare regionally and globally.

26
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:22,480
And also the top causes automobile mobility of disease in your context and again, how they compare regionally and globally.

27
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:27,370
And finally, talk about what what risk factors exist in your context.

28
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:31,270
So hopefully this should be a pretty straightforward and quick assignment.

29
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:37,180
But as always, Jonathan will post an example sometime this week.

30
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,950
And also, if you have any questions, feel free to chat to us.

31
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:52,540
Yeah. I should have that out by Thursday for you all. And if anyone needs to connect with me for assistance on that, please let me know.

32
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:56,410
I'd be happy to set up a time or a sim with you. Okay.

33
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:02,049
Thanks, John. And then your first paper will be due on October 21st.

34
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:07,600
And again as the assignments. Let us know if you need an extension in terms of length,

35
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:14,530
I'm not going to say it as a minimum length because gravity is actually something that's very good and should be celebrated.

36
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:21,670
So you have a maximum length of 2500 words, but no longer see if you can get a shot on that, even if it's quite short.

37
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,929
If you're including everything you need to include. That's that's fantastic.

38
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:30,610
That's a really good skill to have a maximum of four figures and tables.

39
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:34,990
So like a standard paper and in epidemiology and public health.

40
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,920
But you are allowed to have unlimited appendices.

41
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:43,809
And the appendices you can put additional figures, additional tables and additional text,

42
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:48,010
which doesn't count towards your maximum figure count or world count.

43
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:58,719
You should also have 25 sizable references, and that can be from academic journals, NGOs, great literature,

44
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:09,730
policy, literature, anything which you think is a good source and fusion that can help at finding the literature.

45
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:13,710
Really, all you're doing in this assignment is tied together.

46
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:18,340
What you've done in those in this paper staying together, what you've done in those first few assignments.

47
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:24,010
So in your selected health condition, in your chosen context, you're going to discuss the situation,

48
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:30,360
the demographic situation, the politics, the culture, all those things that we talked about, the economics.

49
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:33,610
You're going to justify why your health issue is important.

50
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:42,520
You're going to talk about the epidemiology and burden of the issue, and you're going to finish off by discussing what data gaps they currently are.

51
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,560
Why does, exists and what biases those may present.

52
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:54,669
You didn't talk about what data needs to be collected to better understand the epidemiology of the issue,

53
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:58,750
to better design interventions and ways to address the health issue.

54
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:07,360
You are allowed to work with each other if you have similar topics,

55
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,579
but obviously you need to turn in your own work and you are allowed, like I mentioned,

56
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:19,510
to to pull from past work you've done in this class as long as you take into account our feedback,

57
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:27,219
but because of, you know, academic regulations, you can't use work from a different class even.

58
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:38,050
You know, if I was doing undergrad and we will put this through a plagiarism checker, but hopefully that shouldn't be a problem for anybody.

59
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:45,000
Any questions on these assignments? Okay.

60
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:52,429
So moving into the lecture, we're going to talk about travelers health today.

61
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:55,370
Like I mentioned, the health of people traveling around the world.

62
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:04,250
When discussing travelers health, it's important to understand the international health regulations and what the IHG is,

63
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:08,480
is it's a legally binding agreement of almost every country in the world.

64
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:16,340
So every W.H.O., member state, all 194 plus two more, but they all agree to, to do,

65
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:21,290
to work together, to detect, assess, report and respond to public health events.

66
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:29,090
And generally these events of new and emerging and outbreaks of communicable diseases like COVID,

67
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:32,750
like monkeypox, like sores, like Ebola, that kind of thing.

68
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:42,259
The first iteration came out in 1969, but it's gone through quite a few iterations since then, the most recent one coming out in 2005.

69
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:47,989
So it is aging quite a bit and there's a whole list of diseases which need to be notified,

70
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:52,820
such as smallpox or polio, new flu, new strains of influenza and sores.

71
00:07:53,180 --> 00:08:01,490
But when there's a new disease all by W.H.O. declaration, they can be added to that list of notifiable diseases.

72
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:14,000
But the IHS isn't exactly fit for purpose, especially when it comes to travelers health and preventing the spread of infectious diseases globally.

73
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:21,110
Article two of the IATA essentially states that the regulations should prevent,

74
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,660
protect against control and provide public health response to the international spread of disease.

75
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:31,310
But it shouldn't interfere with international traffic and trade.

76
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:33,890
Article 43 adds on to that,

77
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:43,790
saying that health measures for pandemic control should be based on scientific principles and evidence and guidance and advice to the W.H.O.

78
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:50,510
The issues here are these are all very, very vague things, and we saw that with the COVID response.

79
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:56,360
The first thing that happened, as soon as, you know, COVID, you know,

80
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:03,770
became properly acknowledged as a public health threat, was there was the stopping of international travel.

81
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:13,100
You can see on the on the map, on the right, the countries in red stopped all travel across their borders in non-citizens and nonresidents.

82
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:19,310
And the countries in all rooms had a partial closure, which LA Times was pretty close to a full closure.

83
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:30,800
Pretty much every mathematical model and every paper you read looking at this says Closing of borders does not work at all.

84
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:37,760
All it does is delays, you know, eventual peak of disease by maybe a week or two,

85
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:43,430
because by the time a disease is spread, it's a disease is found, it's already spread internationally.

86
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:49,129
And this also has major implications for trade and economic stimulus costs.

87
00:09:49,130 --> 00:10:00,830
The second. But because these ambiguities in the which really allows a lot of countries to do to do you know what has driven mostly by

88
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:10,400
politics and you know populist politics not so much science epidemiology that there's there's a lot of need for change over that.

89
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:22,560
And also beyond that, only one third of countries in the world are properly able to do the things that the HL sets out.

90
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:29,840
Only 1 to 2 countries have the ability to properly assess and detect epidemics and those respond to them.

91
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:35,550
You can see that as well with COVID response, where in a lot of countries, especially low income countries,

92
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:43,620
surveillance systems can be locking down systems to provide vaccinations on the screen travelers properly.

93
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,790
So there needs to be big change in the future with the IHF.

94
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:56,450
There's lots of discussion over this and it's something which we've actually been working on a book to,

95
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:02,340
to discuss what changes are needed, which I'll share with the class release in a few months.

96
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:06,750
But it's something that W.H.O. also is actively working on.

97
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:17,990
So now that we've touched on the picture very briefly, we will talk about what different measures that are to protect the health of travelers.

98
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:21,650
These fall into three broad categories.

99
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,010
The first is public health measures.

100
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:39,020
So preventing human to human transmission on a wild traveling that's having contactless technology, having interventions on planes and vessels,

101
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:49,130
commuting a staggering commutes to find travel using PPE, hygiene measures on board, and having good information and communication.

102
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:59,399
They're also border measures. So screening on entry and exit off the country, lockdowns, which aren't exactly border measures.

103
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:04,140
But we'll talk in a few minutes about how it might be considered a border measure.

104
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:12,240
Quarantine of people, quarantine being isolation of people who are possibly exposed.

105
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,410
Disease. Repatriation of people when lockdowns happen.

106
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,550
And having travel advisories, restrictions and bans.

107
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:24,630
And in this, you also have to consider trade related measures.

108
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:33,420
So restrictions and bans on trade regulations of trade, surveillance, hygiene and trade and global supply chain management,

109
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:39,270
which is highly impacted during COVID 19 and other international public health events.

110
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:49,339
Going deep into public health measures. Anybody who's traveled in the last year, you would have seen the rise of contactless measures,

111
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:54,919
whether it's having mobile boarding passes on a plane quite often.

112
00:12:54,920 --> 00:13:01,100
Now, you can use your phone to control the TV as opposed to touching it or having contactless payment.

113
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:08,510
But one really interesting one which the UAE adopted quite well, is having fully contactless border entry procedures.

114
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:14,900
And this isn't contactless in that, you know, when you come to us, you have global entry or when you go to UK,

115
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:19,710
you have those e-gates where you put your passport into an opens a door. This is fully contactless.

116
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:24,290
So this is a picture of it on the right. And it's it's really weird.

117
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:28,520
You walk through this tunnel and there are cameras everywhere and they scan your face.

118
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:37,310
And by that, it matches your face to the records in the UAE and it tells you you're good to go or you have to come for additional screening.

119
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:43,880
And most of those measures have been really important in protecting the health of people traveling internationally.

120
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:49,970
They also on board measures both on planes and and ships.

121
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:58,310
But we'll just focus on planes over here. The first, which we've talked about quite often, is, oh, which you would have heard quite often,

122
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:07,550
is air filtration using HEPA filters and making sure planes have enough of those and that the ad is cycled as much as possible,

123
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:10,730
but also disinfecting planes and vessels.

124
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:19,219
An example, being on the right, having electrostatic spraying which can really sanitize every surface in a vessel, a plane.

125
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:27,950
And that's also been associated with pretty substantial decreases in COVID related and COVID infections on both planes.

126
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:39,110
Define travel is also something which has been which is promoted in the first year of the COVID pandemic, saying if there is any travel,

127
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:48,230
put it off until it's safer both to decrease the amount of people getting COVID on the plane from the density,

128
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:50,510
but also just decrease the amount of travel.

129
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:59,290
Similarly staggering, trying to offset the number of people on a plane by saying X amount of people can go on this flight.

130
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,110
Then the next slide.

131
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:13,040
The next slide, an example which which was pretty apparent as well in the first six months, a year of COVID was blocking seats in planes, PPE as well.

132
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:16,729
A very contentious topic at this point.

133
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:27,290
Most places, most countries have, in my opinion, unfortunately removed the need for PPE and planes and also communication and information exchange,

134
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:38,540
something which is being pushed at pretty high levels right now, is having almost like a, you know, a better support system for for pandemics.

135
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:44,989
So being able to easily go some and say, oh, there's a lot of COVID in Singapore right now,

136
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:50,210
so I'm not going to travel to Singapore, but in Dubai it's a bit better. So maybe it's a bit safer over there.

137
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:58,910
But that really as well comes down to, like we talked about before, having good surveillance and detection capability in countries.

138
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:12,850
Border measures are where it gets a lot more political and a lot more difficult to to to enforce it from a scientific perspective.

139
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:18,580
And there's a few different border measures. The first is entry and exit screening.

140
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:22,540
And a lot of countries did adopt both entry and exit screening.

141
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:31,900
The gold standard, of course, is testing, testing using either a PCR or a rapid test.

142
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:42,790
There are obviously pros and cons of both of them, the pros of the PCR being at sensitivity and specificity, the cons being the time and the cost.

143
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:48,669
And that's something which which has to be weighed in the screening.

144
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:54,040
Screening being. When you're when you think you can find the case, we're not entirely sure.

145
00:16:54,670 --> 00:17:00,639
The most popular example for Coburn being syndromic screening, either taking temperatures,

146
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:07,480
asking travelers, do you have a fever or cough or one of those things, you have to do the same thing.

147
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,620
Even when you go to campus, you're supposed to have Responsive Blue App.

148
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:15,040
That's a screening, in my opinion, especially for COVID.

149
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,760
It's it's not the best it's not the best tool.

150
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:28,330
And there are quite a few reasons for that. You can lie, you can have asymptomatic infections or you can have a fever and cough without having COVID.

151
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:33,540
And the academic literature agrees that this really, you know,

152
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:43,030
syndromic screening isn't that useful for border measures, for COVID vaccination antibody policies.

153
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:51,220
They aren't fully effective, but they can help. You know, obviously, people who are vaccinated can have COVID and can transmit COVID.

154
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:57,040
But the the likelihood is far, far less than somebody who is unvaccinated.

155
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:05,020
Antibody passes are interesting and something which was discussed for travelers at the beginning of the COVID pandemic.

156
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:12,260
And, you know, they kind of serve the same purpose as the vaccination passes.

157
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:16,399
But the concern that was had was, well,

158
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:22,520
people might just go out and deliberately get COVID because they want to have the antibodies and this is what will allow them to travel.

159
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:31,880
So these are really scrapped. And you know that pretty much as soon as they were discussed though back home in the UK we have

160
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:39,380
still go back them but we still have a horrible Prime Minister to come back then was worse as bad.

161
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:47,680
He was really big. He really built these antibody positive neighbors like absolutely not this is ridiculous and

162
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:53,389
travel advisory this is just discovering discouraging travelers who are traveling saying,

163
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:57,080
hey, it's not a good idea right now. But, you know, there's no legal basis.

164
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:02,480
If you do show up at the port of entry, we will admit you.

165
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:11,240
So now here's a video actually on border measures in Uganda right now.

166
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:16,190
As you discussed briefly in class a few weeks ago, there's an Ebola outbreak in Uganda.

167
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,660
And here are some of the measures they have at the border of that.

168
00:19:33,360 --> 00:20:50,590
What kind of. So we can still be here.

169
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:56,590
It's mostly syndromic screening, mostly on temperature.

170
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:04,320
And, you know, it's it's it's not ideal, to say the least.

171
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:16,590
Ebola is difficult because the amount time you need to do to go positive on a PCR is quite long and as long as symptomatic period.

172
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:27,630
But isn't this certainly is not ideal and it's something which needs to be addressed, as, you know, as they as the outbreak progresses.

173
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,380
Other measures are restrictions and bans on travel.

174
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:49,009
They are the most sickening policy by far. And like you mentioned earlier, they really ignored the international health regulations,

175
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:56,180
saying that travel restrictions should be as relaxed as possible and should be backed up by science.

176
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:03,260
Travel restrictions and bans, like I said, almost never, never work and just put unnecessary pressures on economies.

177
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:13,490
Quarantine is when possibly exposed. Passengers are placed into isolation and the way they do this varies quite a bit.

178
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:17,750
It can be 14 days in a facility, 14 days at home.

179
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:30,080
You can in the UK they had this system called test release where you would spend five days, you know, in a in an isolation, in isolation somewhere.

180
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:35,480
And the fifth day you would, you would take COBR tests and if it was positive, you would be released.

181
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:39,560
But this was it was a really bad system over there.

182
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:45,600
I remember in the UK, for example, it was actually ridiculous.

183
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:51,410
What happened was my my wife came to visit me and she could stay in the apartment with me.

184
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:56,149
I was free to go out and do things and go to grocery store and get food.

185
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,200
Even though I was staying with her,

186
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:04,339
she had to stay at home and but she could leave and go on the subway and go on the tube to go get her tests and stuff.

187
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:08,930
But other than that, she couldn't it was just one of those things where you're thinking, who came up with this idea?

188
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:12,499
The person who came up. This wasn't epidemiologist. It wasn't a doctor or nurse.

189
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,500
It was some politician sitting behind a desk.

190
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:28,969
But over here, we'll watch a video. On the first few days of COVID in the UK when they introduced the very strict hotel quarantine policy and the

191
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:36,430
kind of problems that were found with that almost eight years since the pandemic was officially declared,

192
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:42,830
these are the first passengers to land in hotel quarantine and it's all about stuff.

193
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:48,709
They were not aware exactly what they should be doing, you know, social distancing.

194
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:53,700
Everybody was at work together from different countries.

195
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,530
It's a system. It's similar to Australia's with key differences.

196
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:04,970
In England, only travelers arriving from 33 red list countries must stay at the hotels.

197
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:12,830
Others isolate at home. Instead of 14 days, ten people can leave their rooms to smoke and exercise,

198
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:19,729
with government concerned about ventilation and must have fresh air going into specific

199
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:23,840
groups circulated around document but not going back into the general system,

200
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:33,410
it's aimed at stopping COVID variants. The nine threat to persons vaccine rollout declared an unprecedented national achievement so far.

201
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:39,200
Next week, Boris Johnson will release a roadmap for lifting lockdown restrictions across England,

202
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,920
saying he wants any progress to be cautious but irreversible.

203
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:52,990
Schools will be the first thing to reopen, possibly from early March because we want this lockdown to be the last.

204
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,320
And this was fraught with issues all along the way.

205
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:06,679
Quite often what happened is the bus driver driving the patients from the apple to hotel will get COVID and get it back to their

206
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:13,040
family or in the hotel there was improper ventilation there to mention that it would spread between rooms or to security guards.

207
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:21,139
And it was really badly mismanaged. And, you know, you see examples of this, you know, in every country, Australia, Singapore, South Africa,

208
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:28,130
like almost everywhere that had a hotel quarantine program was fraught with these issues where it was almost pointless.

209
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:34,310
Not so much border issues, but still things to mention.

210
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:40,790
One is a Patriot mission, which is sending people home, which was done at the beginning of the pandemic,

211
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:46,340
famously, those that fly from Wuhan back to the U.S. and to L.A. somewhere.

212
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:54,380
And countries had this all across the world. But the issue was when countries shut down borders, the high,

213
00:25:54,500 --> 00:26:00,140
higher income countries were able to supply flights and transport their citizens to get home.

214
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:07,760
But lower citizens of lower income countries are often left stranded without any means of returning home.

215
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:16,670
Here's a video of some migrant workers in the UAE who were unable to return home to Pakistan.

216
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:20,639
Salama shares a moment with his family,

217
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:27,030
but not with some of his relatives stuck in the United Arab Emirates desperately want to come back to Pakistan.

218
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:29,160
He can only speak to them from afar.

219
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:38,280
I recently came back to Pakistan after spending 20 years in the UAE, but now my nephew and other family members are stuck there.

220
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:44,670
They are desperate to come back. But unfortunately, due to the incompetency of the government, there isn't any plan for the repatriation.

221
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:49,020
They are least bothered about the plight of Pakistanis stuck in the UAE or elsewhere.

222
00:26:53,160 --> 00:27:00,720
Some 35,000 people have registered with the Pakistani embassy to the UAE will allow them to return home.

223
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,540
But Pakistan must provide repatriation flights, something it hasn't done so far.

224
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:11,340
Many Pakistanis are angry at the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic.

225
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:18,330
They accuse Prime Minister Imran Khan of not doing enough to tackle the crisis and for not taking decisive action.

226
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:24,390
The Foreign Ministry says plans are underway to bring back Pakistanis or stranded abroad.

227
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:31,320
The Government of Pakistan is for the same situation being approved by our compatriots and

228
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:36,900
Pakistani nationals in different markets of work in the UAE and other parts of the Gulf region.

229
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:46,620
This is uppermost in the mind. To come to Pakistan and a comprehensive plan for repatriation of all our nationals is being made.

230
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:55,500
The Pakistani government has set up a quarantine facility on its border with Afghanistan to house the 1500 people who were repatriated recently.

231
00:27:55,950 --> 00:28:00,570
It wants to show this is a successful aspect of its response to the pandemic.

232
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:05,280
But Pakistan, like many countries, is struggling to cope with a global health emergency,

233
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:11,700
and things are moving slower, which is frustrating many who are worried about family and friends stuck abroad.

234
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:21,580
Imran Khan and Sara. And this was a story which is repeated globally with many other low income countries.

235
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:29,169
And another not so much a broader measure, but has broader implications as lockdown when there were lockdowns.

236
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:33,760
What would happen quite often is even if there weren't border restrictions,

237
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:38,730
border agents would still say would still enforce lockdown measures on people coming into the country.

238
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:49,000
So if you were trying to enter a country but wouldn't be allowed to move in that country, they would say, well, under our lockdown, you cannot enter.

239
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:54,940
An example in the EU, in the UK for being a people when we had lockdown.

240
00:28:54,950 --> 00:29:03,069
So you can only go out to get medical care or to buy food if you want and from the UK to buy food or medical or get medical care, which you wouldn't.

241
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:06,850
Regardless, they would say you can't enter the UK, same to exit.

242
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:13,030
And this also happens around the world with quite a few different countries.

243
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:22,000
So if my thoughts on border measures and this is also what's supported by quite a few papers, travel bans don't really work.

244
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:31,840
You know, one figure does say, which you mentioned earlier, a new infectious disease in the smallest village,

245
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:37,360
the smallest, most remote village can spread to any big city in the world within 36 hours.

246
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:42,760
You probably aren't even detecting that disease in that small village in the first 36 hours.

247
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:47,860
It might even take up to a week. So by the time it's detected, it's already everywhere.

248
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:58,000
So travel bans aren't going to work. Similarly, I have similar thoughts on quarantine when it comes to pre-departure testing and vaccination mandates.

249
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:03,250
That's really good because it limits transmission on board the vessel or the plane,

250
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:11,950
but the same the same reason it's not going to do much to to stop the disease from entering a country.

251
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:15,040
The best methods, like everything in public health,

252
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:24,040
include a lot of different layers social distancing, masking vaccinations, our lockdown when warranted.

253
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:30,720
And just quickly now to talk about considerations that need to be made for trade.

254
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:38,820
A majority of the world's trade travels on passenger planes and when anymore passenger planes flying.

255
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:46,770
That means that there isn't much trade happening and there's not much cargos and good goods being transported.

256
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:59,760
Again, in the COVID 19 pandemic, we saw this quite evidently, exports of PPE from China to the U.S. fell by about 19%.

257
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,530
Along with this,

258
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:09,770
there was increased spending on PPE because of the suffering supply chains where high income countries output in low income countries,

259
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:13,230
everything and export ban were put into place.

260
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,379
And as calls and as such,

261
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:24,480
this calls for the next iteration of the IHF to include regulations to firstly make sure that the supply chain is in impacted,

262
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:33,880
but also to ensure that high income countries aren't outfitting low income countries to supply and that export bans are being put into place.

263
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:43,140
And of course, depending on the nature of an outbreak, if it's epizootics or not, that could be considerations for the trade of animals and food.

264
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:47,760
For example, during the foot and mouth pandemic in thousand one, the UK side of this,

265
00:31:47,790 --> 00:32:02,070
the export of British beef was banned and during the swine flu pandemic, the trade off of pork products was also impacted quite heavily.

266
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:11,400
So what we going to now is going to have a fairly extended discussion using jam board again.

267
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:22,650
So Jonathan is just going to send the jam board link to the chat and we're going to split everybody up into four groups.

268
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:32,370
Each group is going to be assigned a a different disease.

269
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:42,360
And you will discuss how the disease emerged, how it merged, how it's spread,

270
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:51,540
especially with regards to international travel and how it happened and what response was like with regards to international travel.

271
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:56,160
So we will just get those going.

272
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:16,090
You have any troubles, access to it. Just make sure you're using your new mesh email.

273
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:23,079
And gentlemen, for the breakout groups, can you make sure Jacob and Rachel in the same group?

274
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:28,690
Because I think they're sitting next to each other somewhere. Yes.

275
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,990
What are we doing for groups? Okay. Yeah.

276
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:56,000
And we will spend maybe about 20 minutes in your groups, and then we'll come back at 355 and have about 20 minutes to report out.

277
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:26,910
And Jonathan, if you need to head out, this might be a good time for that. Oak Park doesn't say if everyone started, then I might jump off.

278
00:34:28,620 --> 00:41:07,800
Okay. Sounds good. See if there's stuff. I guess it has. What?

279
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:59,840
When were you ever in a room? Yeah, I got disconnected and then I've been trying to get back in.

280
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:05,290
That's fine. Before I let you in. Before you go on. I was good for.

281
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:10,250
Okay. I'll just tell you about that. Thank you so much.

282
00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:47,960
No problem. For the hospital.

283
00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:55,690
Original patient entered the hospital and was not put into a negative pressure

284
00:44:55,750 --> 00:45:01,590
room which caused a mass spread because no one realized someone was infected.

285
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:08,920
So a lot of health care workers were like dying and so on.

286
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:21,190
And an interesting note originated in China, as was previously, previously stated, and China alone had 5300 cases.

287
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:26,379
So they accounted for almost like two thirds of the total cases.

288
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:32,950
And a lot of this had to do with China was kind of like trying to keep it low key,

289
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:40,150
quiet, because they didn't want to deal with their economy potentially collapsing.

290
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:42,670
And there was a lot of politics involved.

291
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:55,240
So that kind of hindered and stopped the response or them preventing mass spread until like eventually the WHO reported it.

292
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:05,230
And as mentioned before, SaaS is like spread through like close contact, you know, kind of like COVID.

293
00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:13,070
All right. And I can talk about the response.

294
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:24,080
So on March 12, 2003, the W.H.O. announced a global alert about a form of pneumonia, of unknown origin that was infecting individuals.

295
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:30,590
And then two days later, on March 14th, the CDC activated its emergency operations center.

296
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:39,890
And throughout the course of the outbreak, they initiated travel bans to China, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Toronto.

297
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:49,520
Toronto had to have one activated twice. And throughout this response, a big part of it was the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network,

298
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:56,990
which was working with the W.H.O. and enlisted help from multiple countries, including the U.S., UK, Germany, France.

299
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:59,930
And they also were able to get China on board,

300
00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:09,770
which helped with the process and then established virtual networks with 11 infectious disease laboratories

301
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:16,759
from nine countries that worked together to figure out the virus and the genetic sequence causing stars.

302
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:20,839
And that was found by April 14th, 2003.

303
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:28,400
And that was 12 days after, I believe they had established the network of all the different countries and laboratories working on it.

304
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:33,710
And then on July 23, the W.H.O. had announced SA's outbreak was contained.

305
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:41,810
And then just moving on because of time. The last foot amount in 2001.

306
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:47,860
Yeah. I can quickly cover emergency equipment.

307
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:52,100
This is a little bit different than all the ones covered before.

308
00:47:52,130 --> 00:48:02,600
This is strictly a disease of livestock, primarily, but I guess as we'll be covered later, humans can help facilitate that spread.

309
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:11,839
So the first case was actually discovered in Essex, but the second case was eventually discovered in Northumberland,

310
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:22,190
and that was identified as the source of the spread was a farm in North Cumberland that was feeding its pigs untreated waste.

311
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:25,579
And I find that I just found out that it's called swill feeding,

312
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:36,200
where you're feeding animals untreated animal byproducts like scraps, scraps of other animals through your livestock.

313
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:41,569
And that's facilitating the spread of foot and mouth disease to those pigs.

314
00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:44,060
And from that farm started to spread throughout the UK.

315
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:50,990
The first case was found in February of 2001, but they were able to relatively quickly control the outbreak.

316
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:54,020
The last case was identified the end of September,

317
00:48:54,020 --> 00:49:03,200
so it was declared controlled in October and then the UK was officially declared like disease free in January of next year.

318
00:49:06,590 --> 00:49:10,610
So as I said, it was a quick outbreak, about 221 days.

319
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:17,690
And over that time, as you'll hear in the response, about 6.4 or 5 million animals were called or killed since it did.

320
00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:26,080
You want to add anything else to that? Well, nowadays it's just it's INS and Zyrtec.

321
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:35,780
So I guess, like it's prevalent and like many different regions around the world where there's livestock and.

322
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:40,660
No that's about it for the emergence portion of it.

323
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:44,700
Mhm. All right. And then I'll talk about the spread.

324
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:48,340
And so, as previously mentioned, this is spread between animals.

325
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:59,879
But the interesting thing is that if a human, for example, during the slaughtering process is like this, if during this process, the farmer,

326
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:09,610
for example, is slaughtering the animal, the human can act as a carrier so the human can and can then spread the disease between the animals.

327
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:11,310
So that's what we were interested in,

328
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:19,740
like for the looking into farmers proper preventative measures to make sure that they weren't increasing the spread within their own farms.

329
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:28,200
And so then the spread is also the discharge from the blister and saliva of the infected infected animals.

330
00:50:28,710 --> 00:50:32,820
Depending on certain weather conditions, the virus can stay in the water.

331
00:50:32,970 --> 00:50:38,010
So that's another thing that needs to be looked into as well as it can spread.

332
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:43,200
It could it can spread through the wind, which I'm assuming is like through like a droplet contact.

333
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:53,670
And I would say I guess another thing to mention is that it can also spread through contaminated farm equipment.

334
00:50:54,570 --> 00:51:01,740
And I'm assuming that within farms, things aren't necessarily extremely sanitized or like hygienic.

335
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:10,040
So the spread. And I'll finish this off with the response.

336
00:51:10,050 --> 00:51:16,680
So essentially what the government did was call pretty much most of the livestock that either was infected or had a chance

337
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:23,530
of being susceptible to an infection which was measured with animals being within three kilometers to any reported cases.

338
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:28,290
So this total to the calling of about 6.5 to 10 million livestock.

339
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:35,660
Additionally, there was some articles that discussed some of the issues the government had.

340
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:41,059
One of them was they could have vaccinated, but pretty much every group involved opposed vaccinations,

341
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:48,500
including the farming community, veterinarians, the food industry, etc. They also had to outsource some of their support.

342
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:54,920
So for example, they had to employ more than 1200 veterinarians, but many of those individuals came from overseas.

343
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:59,090
So there were some capacity issues the government was facing in handling this.

344
00:52:00,110 --> 00:52:07,700
And then they also ended up having to compensate farmers for the killing of the livestock and that compensation totaled to over £1.1 billion.

345
00:52:11,810 --> 00:52:16,070
And just quickly, few things on the response to things they did as well.

346
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:22,100
For people, traveling is back. Then when you enter the plane leaving the UK, you would have to sanitize your shoes.

347
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:30,710
It was really weird, but they were like, you'd have to step in like a chlorine soaked carpet or or wipe down issues with some kind of antibiotic clot.

348
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:38,660
And the second, which actually still goes on today, is when you enter the US from the UK, they ask you have you been to a farm in the past week?

349
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:42,230
And if you have, which happens to be quite often because I love farms,

350
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:50,810
they lead you to the back room and you get like a million more questions and then they make sure they're being introduced or that kind of thing.

351
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:53,760
So fantastic. Thanks so much.

352
00:52:53,780 --> 00:53:01,790
Joining on Zoom today and again, apologies for the change in topic and the somewhat improvised improvizational nature of the talk.

353
00:53:02,030 --> 00:53:06,410
I only found out the speaker couldn't make it this morning, so we had to change gears quite quickly.

354
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:13,370
But I will see you all on Thursday in class, in the classroom, in person,

355
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:21,590
where Abram Wagner will talk on childhood vaccination and let us know if you have any questions on the assignments going forward.

356
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:25,580
And that's all. Take care. Thank you.

357
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:26,780
Thank you.
