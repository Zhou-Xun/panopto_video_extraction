1
00:00:01,245 --> 00:00:05,359
In this session, I'll give an introduction to linkage disequilibrium.

2
00:00:07,542 --> 00:00:12,242
Learning objectives are to define the difference between linkage at two loci and

3
00:00:12,242 --> 00:00:14,463
the allelic association at two loci.

4
00:00:14,463 --> 00:00:19,818
Describe the difference between linkage studies and association studies.

5
00:00:19,818 --> 00:00:24,899
Articulate the concept of linkage disequilibrium or LD, and

6
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:28,924
describe how LD can be utilized in genetic association studies.

7
00:00:30,283 --> 00:00:34,343
When we're talking about linkage, we're really thinking

8
00:00:34,343 --> 00:00:39,206
about the relationship between loci that is examined within families.

9
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:45,172
And this really refers to the observation that those two loci are inherited

10
00:00:45,172 --> 00:00:51,338
together rather than be separated by recombination in a single generation.

11
00:00:51,338 --> 00:00:56,231
With genetic association, we're really talking about the relationship

12
00:00:56,231 --> 00:00:58,800
between specific alleles at two loci.

13
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,656
So for example, the C allele at SNP1 and the T allele at SNP2.

14
00:01:04,656 --> 00:01:09,699
It's examined within populations instead of within families.

15
00:01:09,699 --> 00:01:13,707
And it refers to the overall pattern of allelic

16
00:01:13,707 --> 00:01:17,537
correlation between those loci at the population level.

17
00:01:18,751 --> 00:01:22,077
There are two historical approaches for

18
00:01:22,077 --> 00:01:26,391
identifying the loci that cause genetic diseases.

19
00:01:26,391 --> 00:01:30,329
Linkage studies which we've talked about already are shown here.

20
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:34,363
They're excellent at detecting rare alleles, so

21
00:01:34,363 --> 00:01:40,376
those with a very low minor allele frequency that cause large effect sizes.

22
00:01:40,376 --> 00:01:44,938
So they have a really strong effect on the disease phenotype.

23
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:49,566
These are the kind of diseases that typically follow Mendelian

24
00:01:49,566 --> 00:01:51,407
inheritance patterns.

25
00:01:51,407 --> 00:01:56,685
So for example, an autism or dominant allele that's really low prevalence

26
00:01:56,685 --> 00:02:01,479
in the population, but when you have it, it always causes disease.

27
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:06,031
Linkage is really good at finding those kind of genetic associations.

28
00:02:06,372 --> 00:02:11,003
But the thing is, we actually have a lot of genetic

29
00:02:11,003 --> 00:02:11,821
associations that influence the disease in more subtle ways.

30
00:02:16,861 --> 00:02:21,723
And so the effect sizes of those individual alleles might be a little bit

31
00:02:21,723 --> 00:02:22,298
lower.

32
00:02:22,298 --> 00:02:26,148
And so genetic association studies are actually better for

33
00:02:26,148 --> 00:02:31,384
identifying alleles that have a little bit higher frequency in the population,

34
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:34,772
but that have a little bit less strong effect sizes.

35
00:02:34,772 --> 00:02:39,474
So these are variants that usually predispose people to things that are more

36
00:02:39,474 --> 00:02:41,685
common and calm complex diseases.

37
00:02:41,685 --> 00:02:45,793
So things like heart disease, or hypertension, or kidney disease,

38
00:02:45,793 --> 00:02:50,877
there's actually several different genetic loci that are probably contributing and

39
00:02:50,877 --> 00:02:53,259
maybe some environmental factors too.

40
00:02:53,259 --> 00:02:59,004
And when you have that situation, linkage studies really can't find those easily,

41
00:02:59,004 --> 00:03:02,027
but genetic association studies do a better job.

42
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:07,546
And as we talked about before, linkage studies are usually done in families and

43
00:03:07,546 --> 00:03:11,636
genetic association studies can be done with unrelated individuals.

44
00:03:12,195 --> 00:03:16,281
So when we're talking about allelic association with disease, and

45
00:03:16,281 --> 00:03:20,165
this is what we're looking for in genetic association studies.

46
00:03:20,165 --> 00:03:24,531
What we're going to be looking at is across the entire population,

47
00:03:24,531 --> 00:03:29,586
people with a certain allele at one locus, for example, the allele at SNP1,

48
00:03:29,586 --> 00:03:35,043
one have a statistically more than random chance of having the disease of interest.

49
00:03:35,043 --> 00:03:40,386
So you really see an association between some specific allele and a disease.

50
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:46,443
And so the genetic association studies are really just looking for that association.

51
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:52,305
Genetic association studies can take a direct approach or an indirect approach.

52
00:03:52,305 --> 00:03:57,336
So with the direct approach, what we're gonna do is we're gonna

53
00:03:57,336 --> 00:04:02,647
measure the genotype that you have at a certain set of polymorphism.

54
00:04:02,647 --> 00:04:08,222
So SNPs or VNTRs, whatever we think might be actually causing the disease.

55
00:04:08,222 --> 00:04:11,919
And then we look at the association between those SNPs and

56
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,010
the disease to see if there's a relationship.

57
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:19,656
So for example, you might have a hypothesis that there's a particular SNP

58
00:04:19,656 --> 00:04:22,385
that leads to an amino acid substitution and

59
00:04:22,385 --> 00:04:25,577
a protein that you think is important for disease.

60
00:04:25,577 --> 00:04:28,907
And you could directly genotype that SNP and you could look for

61
00:04:28,907 --> 00:04:31,049
an association between the SNP and the disease.

62
00:04:31,543 --> 00:04:35,149
The indirect approach is gonna be kind of similar in the way

63
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:37,658
that we thought about linkage studies.

64
00:04:37,658 --> 00:04:43,594
So what that's gonna do, is it's gonna test marker loci all along the chromosome.

65
00:04:43,594 --> 00:04:45,889
And it's going to look for

66
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:51,429
marker loci that are associated with the disease of interest.

67
00:04:51,429 --> 00:04:55,643
And it doesn't mean that those loci are actually causal,

68
00:04:55,643 --> 00:04:58,348
they might just be correlated with the causal SNP for example.

69
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:05,444
This is what we call the indirect approach where we just test a bunch of markers but

70
00:05:05,444 --> 00:05:09,535
not necessarily any variants that are causal for the disease.

71
00:05:09,535 --> 00:05:15,329
And because of the linkage disequilibrium or the correlation across the markers

72
00:05:15,329 --> 00:05:20,439
in a genomic region, we might see an association between the marker and

73
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:24,294
the disease, even though the marker isn't causal.

74
00:05:24,294 --> 00:05:28,725
So let's just reiterate and be very clear.

75
00:05:28,725 --> 00:05:30,804
What is linkage disequilibrium?

76
00:05:30,804 --> 00:05:34,648
It's just the allelic correlation between two loci.

77
00:05:34,648 --> 00:05:39,546
So across the whole population, people with allele at one locus,

78
00:05:39,546 --> 00:05:44,270
so like a SNP1, have a statistically more than random chance of

79
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:47,869
having a particularly allele at a second locus.

80
00:05:47,869 --> 00:05:50,696
So the C at SNP2 for example.

81
00:05:50,696 --> 00:05:54,361
So really what linkage disequilibrium is doing,

82
00:05:54,361 --> 00:05:59,334
is it's describing the tendency of certain alleles to be inherited

83
00:05:59,334 --> 00:06:04,044
together more often than would be expected under chance alone or

84
00:06:04,044 --> 00:06:07,733
random segregation over time in the population.

85
00:06:07,733 --> 00:06:12,066
And the extent of that correlation or the LD is really a reflection of

86
00:06:12,066 --> 00:06:15,875
population history and the distance between the markers.

87
00:06:18,646 --> 00:06:24,339
So if you have two markers that are in linkage to disequilibrium with each other

88
00:06:24,339 --> 00:06:30,478
or are highly correlated with each other, what are the forces that can affect that?

89
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:34,811
So the biggest force is recombination, right?

90
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,051
We saw how it works in a family.

91
00:06:37,051 --> 00:06:40,261
If you think about recombination over time,

92
00:06:40,261 --> 00:06:44,231
eventually if two things in the genome are correlated,

93
00:06:44,231 --> 00:06:47,875
that recombination is gonna break them up, okay?

94
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:51,778
So if two SNPs, if the allele start out correlated,

95
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:55,250
over time that correlation is going to decay.

96
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:59,521
Because of recombination over generation, over generation,

97
00:06:59,521 --> 00:07:03,405
over generation, even if they're very close together.

98
00:07:03,405 --> 00:07:06,256
There are also other things that can affect it, for

99
00:07:06,256 --> 00:07:08,651
example if you have a recurrent mutation.

100
00:07:08,651 --> 00:07:12,843
So the same exact mutation arising on different haplotype backgrounds.

101
00:07:12,843 --> 00:07:15,768
If you have things like natural selection or

102
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:20,599
demographic history, those can also affect linkage disequilibrium.

103
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:27,250
And in especially important thing again that's coming back, is non-random mating.

104
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:31,350
So just like non-random mating can affect Hardy-Weinberg,

105
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,985
non-random mating can also cause us to see patterns and

106
00:07:34,985 --> 00:07:39,781
linkage to disequilibrium that aren't really at the population level,

107
00:07:39,781 --> 00:07:42,901
it's just because there's non-random mating.

108
00:07:43,131 --> 00:07:47,138
So what is the importance of linkage disequilibrium?

109
00:07:47,138 --> 00:07:52,058
We can use markers that are correlated with each other or

110
00:07:52,058 --> 00:07:54,893
in LD with the causal mutation.

111
00:07:54,893 --> 00:07:59,469
The mutation that's causing the disease to pinpoint the chromosomal

112
00:07:59,469 --> 00:08:01,338
location of that mutation.

113
00:08:01,338 --> 00:08:05,908
So for example, if you have some kind of functional mutation.

114
00:08:05,908 --> 00:08:12,073
So there's an amino acid change in a protein that actually causes disease.

115
00:08:12,073 --> 00:08:17,862
But you actually didn't measure every mutation in the entire genome.

116
00:08:17,862 --> 00:08:20,865
You couldn't measure every SNP in the genome,

117
00:08:20,865 --> 00:08:24,328
you could only measure some markers along the genome.

118
00:08:24,328 --> 00:08:28,649
If you've got this causal mutation and you don't measure it, but

119
00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:33,823
you measure a marker that's correlated with it or in linkage disequilibrium,

120
00:08:33,823 --> 00:08:38,765
then you could also observe an association between that measured marker and

121
00:08:38,765 --> 00:08:40,490
the disease of interest.

122
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:40,616
We can capitalize on this correlation of the genome.

123
00:08:44,026 --> 00:08:50,117
This can really help us identify where in the genome these disease loci are,

124
00:08:50,117 --> 00:08:52,796
and people call that LD mapping.

125
00:08:52,796 --> 00:08:55,828
So what it's doing is it's looking at,

126
00:08:55,828 --> 00:09:00,467
we're gonna use linkage disequilibrium, what we know about

127
00:09:00,467 --> 00:09:05,659
the correlation structure of different alleles across the genome.

128
00:09:05,659 --> 00:09:10,531
We're gonna use that to select some SNPs that actually do a pretty good job

129
00:09:10,531 --> 00:09:13,611
of capturing variability in the population.

130
00:09:13,611 --> 00:09:17,998
So we're gonna select genetic markers that actually are pretty strongly

131
00:09:17,998 --> 00:09:21,324
correlated with everything around them on the genome,

132
00:09:21,324 --> 00:09:24,806
including any functional mutations that might be there.

133
00:09:24,806 --> 00:09:28,706
And then instead of testing every SNP in the entire genome,

134
00:09:28,706 --> 00:09:33,401
we'll just test that set of markers for its association with disease.

135
00:09:33,401 --> 00:09:37,775
And this will allow us to sort of refine the location of a disease locus.

136
00:09:37,775 --> 00:09:43,131
So if for example we found a disease locus using linkage analysis,

137
00:09:43,131 --> 00:09:49,061
linkage gives us a really broad region in the genome to look underneath and

138
00:09:49,061 --> 00:09:54,923
sort of see, okay, it's somewhere on the short arm of chromosome two.

139
00:09:54,923 --> 00:09:59,986
But if we can actually use association studies, it can help us hone in and

140
00:09:59,986 --> 00:10:05,060
get a more fine grained picture of where that disease locus actually is.

141
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:10,696
And the more dense array of SNPs we can use in a region, the more we'll be able

142
00:10:10,696 --> 00:10:17,233
to actually pinpoint the exact location of a disease locus using association studies.
