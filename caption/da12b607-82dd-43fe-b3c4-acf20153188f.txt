00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:09,070
Hi, everyone, my name is Madiha Tariq. I'm the deputy director for the Access Community Health and Resource Center.

2
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:15,130
I am so excited to be here today. I'm also a little sad that we can't be together.

3
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,040
But being in public health,

4
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:28,420
we all know the importance of staying home and trying to do as much as we can and make the best of the situation and be a role model for others.

5
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:37,810
So I want to thank you for being a leader  a FPHLP leader in this year as opposed to any other,

6
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:46,020
because we understand the challenges that you may have had through this year and trying to gain the experience that you want.

7
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,080
So thank you. Thank you for being out there. Today

8
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:59,290
I'm going to talk to you about my organization, Access, which is the Arab Community Center for Economic and Social Services.

9
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:04,920
And I want to kind of share a little bit about the community that we serve,

10
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:11,710
which is the Arab and Chaldean community, as well as underserved communities in southeast Michigan.

11
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:19,420
And let me give you a little bit of an overview here. We'll do a snapshot of the Arab-American community and the demographics.

12
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:23,500
We would talk about health disparities in this community.

13
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:32,320
I would talk to you about our model and how we work in helping address some of the health disparities that exist in our community.

14
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:38,830
And it is impossible to have any presentations in this day and age without talking about the pandemic.

15
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:49,540
So I will end this series of presentations by talking about what access has done in the context of this pandemic.

16
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:57,040
So before we start, I think it's really, really important to talk about who Arab Americans are.

17
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:06,520
And the one thing that I will say is that this specific part of my presentation is extremely important

18
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:15,690
because Arab Americans are a community that is not recognized as a minority by federal agencies.

19
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:26,340
So they are even though a lot of the health issues that impact Arab Americans and the health outcomes are similar to minority communities.

20
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,990
They are not recognized as a minority and not being recognized

21
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:38,730
has a lot of implicit implications when it comes to health and human service provision for these communities.

22
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:48,990
Arab Americans are communities that come from 22 different countries in the Middle East and North Africa region.

23
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:54,900
And they this community has been around the United States since the eighteen hundreds.

24
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:03,240
And I wanted to share this picture right in the center of my presentation of the Elias Zainea family that left Damascus, Syria

25
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:13,720
for the United States in 1897 and the community that has come to the United States since the eighteen hundreds has changed dramatically.

26
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:21,990
So the first wave of immigrants to the United States was primarily Christian men from Greater Syria region

27
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:26,130
they came here to work. The second wave,

28
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:36,540
So that was up until the 1920s. The second wave was in the 50s and 60s, which was people who came here as part of the brain drain.

29
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:43,920
So a lot of people that were coming here that were skilled, that had high level of education in their countries back home.

30
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:52,740
But they came here for a higher education, as well as building careers in higher skilled jobs.

31
00:03:52,740 --> 00:04:04,260
And then the third wave of immigrants, which is about 1970s to now, is immigrants that and refugees that have been impacted by war.

32
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:10,290
So I'm not sure if you are all familiar, but there have been several wars in the Middle East,

33
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:22,290
North Africa region since the 70s, including the civil war in Lebanon, Palestine, Israel conflicts, the Iraq war.

34
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:32,730
And Iraq had a whole slew of force. There was with Iran, Gulf War, as well as the most recent war that happened in Iraq.

35
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:40,680
And then most recently, it has been the conflict that has that has occurred in Syria starting in 2011.

36
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:48,510
So the the nature of the populations that have come to the United States that belong to the Middle East,

37
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:51,180
North Africa region have changed dramatically.

38
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:59,670
But it also has implications for populations that are here, because when you think about Arab-American communities,

39
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:04,010
these are communities that have existed in the U.S. for many, many generations.

40
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:12,870
There is a strong cultural infrastructure specifically in certain states in the United States, New York, California,

41
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:17,970
Michigan are states that have a dense populations and very large cultural

42
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:24,870
infrastructures where Arab Americans also over 90 percent of the Middle East,

43
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:33,840
not African populations, live in higher density urban regions and not so much in rural areas.

44
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:40,830
And all of that impacts the way services are provided, what health outcomes in these communities look like.

45
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:45,890
So I'm going to take a second here and try to share this link.

46
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:52,010
This is a report that ACCESS does. And as I mentioned the beginning of my presentation

47
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:58,010
Arab Americans are not a minority. By the and they are not considered a minority by the U.S. Census.

48
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:07,400
So it was really important for our organization to put together a report that really kind of desegregates the data that does exist.

49
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:18,650
So desegregation means looking at existing data collections and kind of extracting the numbers where some somebody in the survey,

50
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:25,790
the person indicated that they were from Lebanon or they spoke Arabic or they that ethnicity was Arab.

51
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:34,010
So we take those out and we created reports to really get a true narrative of what the Arab and Chaldean community looks like.

52
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:38,060
So I will make sure that this is shared in the resources.

53
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:44,090
But as you'll see, according to the U.S. Census, there are two million Arab Americans in the U.S.,

54
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:53,540
but there really are three point six million Arab Americans, according to other agencies that have done data desegregation.

55
00:06:53,540 --> 00:07:04,400
And this report is really cool because you can actually look at different populations of Arab Americans compared to other racial categories,

56
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:10,070
as well as looking at some of the basic demographics of Arab Americans.

57
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:14,180
So this data actually was extracted from the American Community Survey,

58
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:19,850
and it shows you that a large number of Arab Americans live in multigenerational households.

59
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:26,900
Seventy eight percent of Arab Americans live in the United States as the whole are U.S. citizens.

60
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:33,290
And I think oftentimes this is there's a misperception about Arab American communities.

61
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:41,540
And it also presents this opportunity to engage Arab Americans and involve them and get out toward activities.

62
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:49,430
You will see that overall in the United States. Only 32 percent off populations live in poverty.

63
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:55,670
And they are, you know, fairly well educated. However, when you go into the state level,

64
00:07:55,670 --> 00:08:07,100
which I'll show you in a minute. So down here in metropolitan areas in the Detroit region, we note that this data is different.

65
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,390
So in the Detroit region,

66
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:20,090
there are in the Michigan there are a lot of people who Arab Americans who live in poverty compared to the white population, more unemployed.

67
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:29,650
And this kind of shows you that it's really, really important to look at granular data and regional data for communities,

68
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:39,200
for essentially for communities of color in general. So I will definitely share this report and I'll go back to my presentation now.

69
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:49,520
So I talked about the three, you know, that the three waves of immigration to the US in total.

70
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:56,690
There's about three 3.6 million Arab Americans in the United States.

71
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:02,930
In Michigan specifically, we have between four to five hundred thousand Arab Americans.

72
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:10,800
It's always a range when there's no nationally recognized database collection mechanism for population.

73
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:19,820
So it's somewhere between three to four hundred thousand and about over 40% of them are born outside of the U.S.

74
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:26,000
So we have a large number of what we call new Americans, immigrants and refugees.

75
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:33,920
They are generally younger population and they live in multigenerational households, which is something that is consistent with national data.

76
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:40,470
And they usually have tend to have large families. So working with a lot of refugee families,

77
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:51,380
we actually had one specific case where we had to send two different vans to pick up a family because they were a family of 10 people.

78
00:09:51,380 --> 00:10:00,680
So, you know, thinking about that is extremely important when, you know, when providing service to the community.

79
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:06,560
And I also gonna threw in a map of this local metro Detroit area that shows you

80
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:14,360
a breakdown of the Arab and Chaldean populations by specific countries as well.

81
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:26,010
So we got a lot of Lebanese, Iraqi and Syrian populations and a decent amount Palestinian in this region.

82
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:36,660
I want to also take a second to talk about refugees, and I'm going to move my face from here because I want you to be able to see this picture.

83
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:50,200
But. Look at these two pictures. So there's a woman on the left who is in a refugee camp, you know, probably doesn't have a very comfortable living space.

84
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:55,270
And then there's a woman on the right who is a comfortable living space.

85
00:10:55,270 --> 00:11:00,880
But it is possible and it is the story of a lot of refugees that they may have had,

86
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:06,640
even if they are in comfortable surroundings now and physically they look OK,

87
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:13,300
they have had a history. They carry this history of having the same life as the woman on the left.

88
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:22,720
And they may have lost loved ones as they were leaving their homes or as they were in the refugee camps where they might be away from their families.

89
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:29,210
There's a lot of families, especially during the last four years, that were unable to unite with their family members.

90
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:36,070
We've had clients that have had families overseas that they were not able to bring here.

91
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:40,780
And they're in some refugee camp or living in strife overseas.

92
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,790
So it's really important to think about this,

93
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:52,570
because these are specific things that impact refugee and immigrant communities and it's even more important in the context of a pandemic.

94
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:56,320
So when everything started shutting down in Michigan,

95
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:05,230
our number one concern was to make sure that we can find ways that the populations, especially refugees and asylee populations,

96
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:07,930
are not re traumatized by the shutdown.

97
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:16,360
Because the last time these populations saw everything shut down in their countries was when they never went back home again.

98
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:22,720
So this is the kind of context upon which we built our programing.

99
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:31,210
So I'm going to give you I'm going to give you a little bit of a snapshot of what health challenges look like in this community.

100
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:39,040
So Michigan is the only state that does a Arab and Chaldean specific Behavioral Risk Factor survey,

101
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:46,180
which is a statewide survey that collects a whole bunch of health outcome and other social determinants of health data.

102
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:50,290
And it's done only about only four to five years.

103
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:57,460
So I apologize that this is kind of dated, but this is from the 2013 BRFS survey.

104
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:08,500
And I mean the one thing I would see here is that so the gray bar is Michigan average and the red bar is Arab Americans only.

105
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:17,050
And the one thing that I will see here is that, you know, there's definitely a lot of chronic disease of risk factors,

106
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:26,570
but then they also are low rates of health coverage as well as low rates of health preventative screening in the community.

107
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:30,910
A lot of low physical activity and then definitely mental health issues.

108
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:42,010
Some of them are defined by, you know, the experience of coming here as a refugee or even as an immigrant in certain cases.

109
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:50,670
I thought this was important to look at, too. This compares to 2013 and 2016

110
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,990
BRFS Urban Chaldean Survey.

111
00:13:52,990 --> 00:14:02,710
One thing that I thought was really interesting here is to look at how, you know, so the purple bar is 2013 and grey Buyers' 2016.

112
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:11,170
More people are thinking about race and discrimination. You know, more people think that they are treated inequitably.

113
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:20,620
You know, there's a lot of, again, mental health issues and screening issues in general, just generally poor health.

114
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:25,990
And there's been some improvements you'll see in specific health outcomes.

115
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:32,260
And that is attributed to the fact that the Affordable Care Act went into effect in 2013.

116
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:37,090
And a lot of people and in 2014 in Michigan we opened up Medicaid.

117
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:42,010
So a lot of poor people in the community were able to get health coverage and be

118
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:48,020
able to have a doctor and address the existing health issues that they have.

119
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:55,010
So this is just basically a snapshot trying to set the stage so that we can talk about ACCESS,

120
00:14:55,010 --> 00:15:02,760
which I will cover in my next section of this presentation. But I wanted to start by talking about this.

121
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,640
Thank you.
