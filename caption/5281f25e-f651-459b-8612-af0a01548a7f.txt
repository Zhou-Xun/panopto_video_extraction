1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:17,170
Oh, and let me help you with your dress, Harry.

2
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:26,580
Are you feeling better? You say that you will be better by Friday.

3
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:49,200
Yeah, I'm probably going to be fine.

4
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:57,930
Okay. Could you tell me why you think it was that you did it?

5
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:10,830
I don't. Because I was eliminated. Because they said that you're just psychologically thinkable.

6
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,130
No, I mean, I think about how much I was out of it.

7
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:30,200
How would you change? You know what I mean? Did I hear you say I can't even keep an eye on date night, is what I'm saying for you?

8
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:45,150
So I just I'm just very impressed. So I had to give you a tough choice, but they're building out your resume.

9
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:51,220
I'm doing this right now. I would just.

10
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:54,750
And I wrote I Can't Find My Future Wedding, you guys. December.

11
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:04,020
Yeah. Yeah. So hopefully they think when they get over, I will start to this lecture.

12
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:08,790
If you haven't seen the notification from Carrie. She is not here today.

13
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,740
And I'll be help her. I'll help her teach to this class.

14
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:22,860
And I'm a second year Ph.D. in my name is City. What I've been working with how to use loans after I took this class, basically.

15
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:29,910
So I remember I remember after the first semester I email her and said, Oh, I think you're always pretty interesting.

16
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:38,580
Is it possible to work with you on some of the research projects? And she said, Yes, we have like money to support you the same time.

17
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:42,510
So I have been working with her ever since.

18
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,980
But even though I've taken this course. But it's been two years.

19
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:52,090
So I didn't remember clearly what was covered in the class.

20
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:56,870
So over the weekend I was like trying to review of what's in today's lecture.

21
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:05,459
So today this is also my first time teaching, so I'll try to do as good a job as I can,

22
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:09,900
but if you have any questions you can ask me during the class or afterwards.

23
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:14,130
It's no problem. Okay, we can all get started.

24
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:23,110
So today is about the objectives. This slide is about objectives of like following sample size.

25
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:29,730
So there are a lot of factors to the sample size population.

26
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:35,660
And then we want to identify all of these factors and try to see if the factors changes.

27
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:40,800
For example, if deliverability of my data increases, how many?

28
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:45,030
Like what? What the sample size population will change.

29
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:52,260
And we of course, we need to understand that all sample size calculations are assumptions.

30
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:57,720
They are like based on assumptions and they're all approximations.

31
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:03,300
So there are, of course, limitations to the number we obtained in the end.

32
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:13,490
As a sample size cause we also need to know how to calculate the sample size based on different scenarios, different control designs.

33
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,930
And we'll start from the very basic case.

34
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:22,219
So we will start from one arm, which is which is not usually seen in the first trial.

35
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,340
But we want to start from the simple, simplest cases.

36
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,490
So definition of how to do the calculation.

37
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:39,960
And we will start with from continuous data to our well normally this distributed data, I believe we are all pretty familiar with normal distribution.

38
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:43,040
So is a good place to get started.

39
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:53,960
But later on in future lectures we will also cover what if we have battery outcomes and what if my outcome is like the survivor survival type of data?

40
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:59,240
For example, I have censoring, I have time to death or time to relapse.

41
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:08,990
And under that scenario, how we do the calculations that this lecture will mainly focus on the superiority hypothesis,

42
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:15,980
but we will also briefly push on the non-inferiority later in the lecture.

43
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:20,570
So why do we do sample size calculation?

44
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:29,010
I think knowing how many people you want to have control can help you prepare,

45
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:35,000
like the number of staff or the amount of money you want to allocate to this trial.

46
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:45,860
And basically, we want to find the least number of patients we need on and treatment arm to be able to see the treatment effect we want to see.

47
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:49,640
So if we have to fewer subjects,

48
00:05:51,110 --> 00:06:01,730
we may not be able to reject a null hypothesis if the null hypothesis is wrong and also if we have too many subjects, the problem is.

49
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:06,290
Subjects. Having more subjects in your study means you need to.

50
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:11,300
The cost is higher than when you want to write a grant.

51
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:17,990
The cost will be too high to be funded. And also there is an ethical issue because if you recruit too many patients,

52
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:23,210
those patients, maybe they could receive other, more effective trial treatments.

53
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,390
That's all possible.

54
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:35,090
So we try to like just find the least number of people we need on each treatment arm so that we can successfully conduct this trial.

55
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:38,300
Also not waste resources with resources we have.

56
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,980
We will briefly talk about this one for you, too.

57
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:50,120
So in your face, one, we already know that phase one trials are usually very small.

58
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:59,690
We have a few individuals and it's usually a defendant determined by the level of doses you want to test.

59
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,090
Yeah, I was like, is how far your initial initial dose is from the.

60
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:14,870
Usually in phase one trial we don't have very formal statistical sample size calculation is

61
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:22,070
often decided by your ability to accrue accrual patients within the reasonable time limits.

62
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:27,980
I mean, we want to have a good operating characteristics of your phase one design.

63
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:35,180
Phase two is kind of similar, but there are more statistical component to it.

64
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:44,389
The goal of the phase two trial is often to estimate the endpoints relate to efficacy with some degree

65
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:51,080
of precision so that we can determine whether the treatment we are looking at can move into phase three.

66
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,950
So one example is like a common scenario would be at the end of a trial,

67
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:04,010
we look at the outcomes we gathered from all the participants in the study and we will

68
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:10,700
calculate an estimate of the treatment effect based on all the outcome we obtained.

69
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:16,309
Along with the estimate are we usually provide a confidence interval and the

70
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:20,900
upper bound and lower bound of the interval is the confidence interval with.

71
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:32,870
So the goal is to find the sample size that's big enough to give to us the confidence interval with that small that's below a certain threshold.

72
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:39,169
That's usually what happens. And we talk about Simon's two stage design before and in this design,

73
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:44,930
if you read their paper in the introduction, they said in this study, they they will achieve this.

74
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,440
They will show you the probability of recommending a.

75
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:55,259
I hear it means not so good treatment because it's below a threshold.

76
00:08:55,260 --> 00:09:02,639
So the probability of recommending relatively bad treatment on the probability being smaller than type one

77
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:09,900
IRA and they want the probability of rejecting a relatively good treatment being smaller than type two error.

78
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:17,790
Another example is the thought on standard design is a Bayesian method is like what I do everyday,

79
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:26,460
but not this particular design, but somewhat a basic design. So usually what we do is to find a credible interval from the posterior distribution.

80
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:39,000
So to sum it up for first to trial is about find a sample size that is big enough to give enough precision for the treatment that we want to estimate.

81
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,760
So it's more like I said,

82
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:52,140
there are more statistical components to that compared to the Phase one trial but is like less skilled compared to the Phase three trial.

83
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:57,620
So this is what we will mainly focus on.

84
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:07,260
So in this lecture we will look at the simplest cases, will say we have two treatments for treatment A, treatment B,

85
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:17,350
we will look at only one type of primary outcome and we will assume the outcome to be continuous first so we can use normal distribution to model it.

86
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:21,360
But later, we will also see what if the outcome is binary,

87
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:29,580
and what if the outcome is like the similar type of data that Michael will use is the hypothesis testing.

88
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:37,110
We use hypo testing. Again, we use a very simple hypothesis.

89
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:41,879
Now it's usually say my treatment and treatment.

90
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,180
B they have the same treatment effect.

91
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:51,030
And my alternative is usually, oh, we see the treatment effect of A and B are different.

92
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:55,800
But here we will give it is a difference which we will call it talk.

93
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:59,430
So we will say the difference is Delta. We want to do it.

94
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:03,000
How possible this testing based on this tool statement.

95
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:10,890
So here are the factors that influence the size and power of our trial.

96
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,680
First is the size of treatment difference that I just mentioned.

97
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:18,870
We call it Delta and it has another name.

98
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,090
We also have effective size.

99
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:31,290
So this treatment difference is how different your treatment arm is from the placebo or the standard of care you are comparing to.

100
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:41,040
So you should be fairly easy to understand because you want to prove, you want to show that there is a difference as why you are doing this trial.

101
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:48,900
And the second is to detect this difference, Delta, how much power we want to have in this trial.

102
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:59,040
And the third one is the type one error, which is the level of statistical significance accepted as showing evidence of difference.

103
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:05,250
And the fourth one is variability in the outcome between subjects.

104
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:11,670
You may be thinking, how can we know the variability before we conduct a trial?

105
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:22,710
So usually what we do is we have some preliminary data and we try to ask the data based on operability, based on the pretty preliminary data.

106
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:27,540
And then we use that as as a assumption or a simple size calculation.

107
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:36,540
So the sample size calculation is not there's never a loss of calculation.

108
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:42,630
You sometimes need to go back and force tries to confirm what the appropriate numbers should be.

109
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:52,950
So usually what happens is, let's say a physician comes to you and say, oh, I found this treatment and I have this as my primary outcome.

110
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:57,180
The variability of our data is is assumed to be this.

111
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:02,490
This is the effect size I want to test. So you have all this data, you'll go back and do the calculation.

112
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:10,890
Let's say you found out the sample you need is 500. You come back and talk to the physician and say, Oh, I think we need 500 people for this trial.

113
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:19,500
And they may say, Oh, I don't have that much money or I don't have that many people to support 500 participants for trial.

114
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:25,980
Or they could say, Actually, I found out my variability is more likely to be ten instead of eight.

115
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:32,160
So that happens all the time, and so is more likely to be a iterative process.

116
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:38,910
And in the end, we want to find the balance between being able to still conduct the trial and finding

117
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:45,030
the treatment effect size that we want to see and all the logistical constraints.

118
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:53,479
So let's see. And also in the end,

119
00:13:53,480 --> 00:14:05,299
the sample size we chose like should be able to allow us to use the resources we have wisely and and also be feasible within logistical constraints.

120
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:11,810
And we also should have enough time to finish the trial within the time we want it to be.

121
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:18,200
Okay, so the limitations of sample size, like I just said,

122
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:28,040
it doesn't matter how complicated your method is, how your methods are, and how how robust your model is.

123
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:32,090
All sample size calculation are ultimately approximations.

124
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:37,339
There are never for sure in stone numbers and I say I only need 100 at best.

125
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:46,800
The correct number is very rarely to be the case and we wouldn't be able to know before the trial started get started.

126
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:53,810
So like, there could be many things that don't go as we planned.

127
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:57,110
So for example, we could have incorrect assumptions from the start.

128
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:02,240
A good example, we thought like the variability is best,

129
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:10,700
but in fact it's smaller and we could have other logistical constraints that can come up only during the trial.

130
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:22,350
That's possible. And also there could be change of designs during the trial and also subjects may withdraw like that's us expected.

131
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:30,830
So like if you see the COVID protocol, usually they will say, oh, we assume 5% dropout rate, but what if something happens?

132
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:38,209
Or What if there is a natural disaster, something that we can't control and end up so that we end up with less participants?

133
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:46,430
We want this all possible. So just want to make sure that we understand, even though we have this small size calculated,

134
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:53,420
but it is only a approximation and we try to do as good a job as we can,

135
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:59,600
but it's kind of impossible to foresee all the possible issues that might happen in the trial.

136
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:04,670
So. So yeah. It's never a useful number.

137
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:12,880
Although it's also good practice to provide a range of calculations instead of just one number.

138
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:17,790
Under one scenario, what was narrow means under this particular group of assumptions.

139
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:27,050
So it is important to be aware of how the required sample size varies according to variations in input.

140
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:31,290
Parametres for example, like I mentioned many times already, what is my variability?

141
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:37,710
What's wrong? What if the effect size was slightly different, slightly bigger or slightly smaller?

142
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:49,510
The sample size could change. And also also what if there are all fuzzy things that happen that make me not be able to have enough people in my trial?

143
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:56,370
So we want to do a range of calculations with the sample size under different scenario,

144
00:16:56,370 --> 00:17:04,169
and we provide a power of according to light corresponding to the different sample sizes because we want to see if something happened,

145
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:12,360
if this thing happened or if that thing happened, how or what is the power that I can achieve in the end by the end of the study.

146
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:23,780
So. And also if you were like clinical biostatistician is pretty common to include at table of the outcome of this range of calculations in the grant.

147
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:36,040
So for approval. Here is a summary of the things, the procedures we need to take.

148
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:42,760
If you want to calculate the sample size first is since we are using the hypothesis testing method,

149
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:48,880
we will just say the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis is pretty simple.

150
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:57,010
Like I just said, the null hypothesis is usually if women are at a treatment, r b, they have the same treatment effect.

151
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:01,540
And the tube is usually like the effect are different.

152
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:07,810
And this is the difference. The difference is Delta and this is the difference I want to be able to test.

153
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:18,880
The second is determined the primary outcome to measure in each subject that will distinguish between the null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis.

154
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:23,400
Primary outcome could really be anything that's reasonable.

155
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:30,130
That's like based on your particular test, it could be like BMI, it could be blood sugar level.

156
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:34,120
It could be the amount of antibodies. It could be anything.

157
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:43,780
Here we will mainly focus on continuous and assume normally assumed that the outcomes are normally distributed.

158
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:48,280
The first step is we have hypotheses that we have primary outcome.

159
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:54,130
So we want to calculate the test statistic and find the distribution of the test

160
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:59,170
statistic so we can find a rejection region and then we can do the hypothesis testing.

161
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:08,080
And in the next few slides we will show you like how to like derive the formula and how

162
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:14,090
to solve for and when we have the formula like all the components ready in the format.

163
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:23,800
So here this slides came up before in the course and then this is just to show how we define error, how we define type two error.

164
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:32,229
And then here in this lecture, we mainly focus on one error, which is the probability of rejecting all is done,

165
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:40,480
always true, and then also the power, which is like the probability of reject the null.

166
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,410
If no, it's not true. Just remember the power is one minus beta.

167
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:52,690
So a good question to ask is how to choose the alpha and beta.

168
00:19:53,500 --> 00:20:00,400
You may see like alpha is almost always 0.05 and beta is almost always 0.0, 0.2.

169
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:10,090
But that doesn't have to be the case. You see them all the time is just because they're at a convention, especially from the regulatory perspective.

170
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:17,590
If you want to get your drive registered with the FDA, this is like the most commonly seen settings for alpha and beta,

171
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,280
but really it should be depend on your particular test,

172
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:24,100
like how different your experiment,

173
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:34,810
your experimental treatments is from your control treatment and whether there are very effective treatments already in the treatment environment.

174
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:43,239
All this will affect how you choose alpha and beta, for example, if there are already very effective treatment.

175
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:51,430
But they could be toxic. So the goal of your clinical trial could be maybe I want to find a treatment.

176
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,410
Is that effective but less toxic?

177
00:20:53,410 --> 00:21:02,230
So my like so it's more helpful for my patients if you do that and that's not in the alpha and beta will change accordingly.

178
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:10,450
There is also the third perspective, which is a statistical perspective, but it's just for you to understand what is alpha, what is beta?

179
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:18,520
But it doesn't really answer the question of how we choose to level out alpha and beta in our design.

180
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:26,630
Like I mentioned before, there are other ingredients in the sample size calculation.

181
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,420
Of course we will have sample size.

182
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:36,820
Usually if we think about it intuitively, the larger the sample we have, we'll have more information on the patients.

183
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:42,560
So it will be easier for us to distinguish the null and alternative hypothesis.

184
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:50,710
So this is pretty straightforward. The second one is a delta, the distance and also the effect size I just mentioned.

185
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:54,310
So the larger the delta, the smaller sample size.

186
00:21:54,430 --> 00:22:00,330
This is also pretty straightforward. The delta means how different the treatment arm is from the placebo.

187
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:06,550
If the delta is big, that means the difference between your treatment arm is big.

188
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,200
The difference between your treatment arm and placebo arm is big.

189
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:14,560
To see a big effect, we don't need that many patients.

190
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:23,380
But on the other hand, if there's a if the difference is small, were maybe more patients to be able to tell the difference.

191
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:30,640
The third is sigma squared is the variance of the outcome you collected.

192
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:36,160
The entire group is usually the amount of noise in the data.

193
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:42,000
So the bigger the variability, the larger the angry need.

194
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:50,350
Because if we have noise, it's kind of hard to tell where the edge is, like how how good we can estimate this treatment effect.

195
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:55,120
So this is also pretty intuitive if we have smaller.

196
00:22:57,170 --> 00:23:01,370
Very good of you. Let's think about an extreme case. Everybody have the same measurement.

197
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,050
So you don't have there is no doubt you will know that this is the achievement effect of looking for.

198
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:16,790
What we'll do is we'll derive equation that contains all of five components that we both one and type to error the sample size,

199
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:20,120
the effect size and also the variability.

200
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:27,800
So once we have this equation, we can fix any for components and so we should be able to solve 2/5.

201
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:43,200
One thing to note is the effect size and variability are usually not to any parametres they're usually decided already by the design,

202
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:47,699
by the treatment, or like or by your assumptions.

203
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:57,060
For example, I see this case is like saying a mortality rate of disease under standard of care is 50%.

204
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:03,600
I now we're looking at a new therapy that may reduce the mortality by 10%.

205
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:07,230
This 10% is kind of decided by the treatment already.

206
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:15,650
And so because we hope that it reduces mortality rate by 10%, so this effect size will be 10%.

207
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:20,640
In this case, the variability is determined.

208
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:27,750
If we assume a binary outcome, the variability is determined by binomial distribution,

209
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:33,270
which means like if you remember the formula is and multiply by p multiplied by one minus p,

210
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:38,610
so you come out right, you can't really be changed, right? And then we have the alpha.

211
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:43,890
If we assume alpha is 0.05, we say beta is 5.2.

212
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:52,260
If we do a calculation, the couple of which I'm going to introduce later, but if we do a calculation will find that we need 194 patients.

213
00:24:52,740 --> 00:25:02,350
And this is the scenario I just described. The prosecutor may just say, oh, we don't have enough resources to support this 194 people trial.

214
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:12,780
The most I can do is 100 people. So with 100 patients, maybe you will go back and do a confirmation again and you'll find out the most power,

215
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:19,080
the the highest level up already could achieve with 100 patients is 50% power.

216
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:22,590
If we don't make any changes to the parameters here.

217
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:27,959
But you can also say like based on my methods,

218
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:38,490
I know if instead we want to test a 0.14 difference instead of just 0.1, I just do achieve that 80% power.

219
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,650
But when you are making suggestions like this, is it really realistic?

220
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:53,040
Is it really feasible? Because like the trip, the mortality rate of 0.14 may be too big of a difference there that you would never be able to test.

221
00:25:53,610 --> 00:26:00,480
And also, if you can't recruit 194, if you are if you can't have more than 100 people,

222
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:07,590
maybe you just shouldn't do this clinical trial at all, because if you do it, you won't be able to see the effect anyway.

223
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,300
So often when we make suggestions, we want to be realistic.

224
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:18,230
And just to remember, the delta and variability are not tuning parameters.

225
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:28,070
There are kind of determine already. So here are the five types of sample size formula we learned in this lecture.

226
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:34,730
The first is white and two arms for normal outcome, but constant variance.

227
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:40,250
This means even if I have two arms, I will assume the same variance for each arm.

228
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:46,100
Of course, like I said, while arm is very rarely seen in phase three,

229
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:54,980
we just want to demonstrate how we calculate the sample size based on one arm, and that can be easily extends to two arms.

230
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:59,750
And so we will also see what if my variance is different?

231
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:05,510
What if, like my arm, it has its own variance and arm two has its own variance?

232
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:11,870
The formula would change accordingly. And we will also see what if we have paired outcomes.

233
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:17,569
Ferguson usually means equipment like very commonly means in the same study.

234
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:25,610
It has the same individual twice. For example, at start of the trial and maybe after six months I test her or is him again.

235
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:34,880
And I have two observations from this one individual and this like this, two data points are paired.

236
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:38,510
So I would do that to all of my participants in the trial.

237
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:42,110
In the end, this this is what we mean by paired outcome.

238
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:51,169
And also we will do we will mainly focus on superiority, but we will also look at morality and Indiana.

239
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:54,290
We will check the scenario for survival type of data.

240
00:27:55,870 --> 00:28:02,380
So here are the assumptions of all the tests we will introduce in the rest of the class.

241
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:07,480
So the first is, we assume a very simple hypothesis test.

242
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:13,120
It could be like a T test or a T test. These are like the basic statistics.

243
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:17,050
So it should be ready. This should be easy to understand.

244
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:19,990
And the second one is one sided testing.

245
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:29,050
But once I do, testing is not a common is not the norm in this trial, but is a simple extension to the two sided.

246
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:33,520
Again, we use one sided testing just to make the formula look less complex.

247
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:39,010
So easy for us to understand when the first time we're learning it again.

248
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:45,190
Once again, testing is not usually acceptable in phase three unless it's non-inferiority hypothesis.

249
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:53,560
And in all the examples we will give in this in this lecture, the larger outcomes means better.

250
00:28:53,710 --> 00:29:02,070
So if I have one individual with all competition and one individual with all six, the ten means that ten is better than a six.

251
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,770
There is a better treatment effect for the individual with ten.

252
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:14,410
So because of this, my effect size will always be positive because I want to see a better treatment outcome.

253
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:21,139
Okay. Now we're talking about we're going to talk about the first scenario,

254
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:27,650
which is one arm or its normally distributed outcome and also a constant variance.

255
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:33,440
So let's say if we collect data, why one, why two or two, why end?

256
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:43,790
And they are ideal subjects. They all follow this one normal distribution with name you and and variance equals four sigma squared.

257
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:48,430
Excuse me. So, like I said, a null hypothesis.

258
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:54,220
It's pretty straightforward. We say the mean. The mean of this distribution is zero.

259
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:58,100
And we say the alternative hypothesis is even better.

260
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:07,150
It's better than this total value. And here to estimate the meal, we will use the median of all the subjects we collected.

261
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,240
And this is this is how we calculate a mean.

262
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:19,210
This is a distribution for the mean in 601 or a central limit at serial, which would be like this is the facts we learned there.

263
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:29,910
So it's like the mean. The mean will follow normal distribution with mean mule as standard deviation equals two sigma squared divided by zero.

264
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,490
Or just this website I want to show.

265
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:38,170
We can see the distribution of y and how it changes us and changes.

266
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,420
Okay. So this is the rule. The number may be small.

267
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:56,800
I'm not sure whether you can see it, but on the top here and is equal to five.

268
00:30:57,070 --> 00:31:00,520
This is just some random number and this website decided to use.

269
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:08,110
And also here is like square root of five is corresponding to the number of sample size we have.

270
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:19,060
So the rate curve is the distribution under the null hypothesis and the green curve is the distribution under the alternative hypothesis.

271
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:22,720
This just shows how big the variation is.

272
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:31,959
If I increase the number of participants in that, while we can see that the two curves are more separated from each other,

273
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:38,800
as I add more people and also they are more concentrated around their issue than their own meaning.

274
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:50,770
Right is becomes gradually becomes more L-shaped and our living area is taking less of a proportion as we add more people.

275
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:58,590
So this is just a show with more people. We have more information. It's easier for us to tell them as to how this is a part.

276
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:08,070
And also based on what we already know, we can calculate the test statistics.

277
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:16,140
This is pretty easy. It's also like y bar minus the mean and divided by a standard deviation.

278
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:20,730
This is going to use statistics plus the year we are about to do so.

279
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:27,280
We can also find the distribution for the test statistics under the null hypothesis.

280
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:32,610
We have the standard normal distribution mean zero variance one,

281
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:39,390
and under the alternative hypothesis we have this and normally distributed with mean

282
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:45,960
equals to delta divided by the standard of the standard deviation of the mean.

283
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:51,330
We also have a name for this, as we sometimes call is the standardized effect size.

284
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:56,550
So what you'll see if people say standard effect size, they're talking about this and this one right here.

285
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:06,930
And notice that our notice that this distribution has the same shape as the normal distribution is just the mean is shifted slightly.

286
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:12,750
So if we do the testing, we will reject the null hypothesis.

287
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:20,430
If our test statistics is bigger than the critical value, especially like the 92.

288
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:26,070
I want to show like the distribution of statistics as a changes.

289
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:33,720
So here is a very similar plot, but you already look value because according to what I just showed, there are like a center.

290
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:42,360
They have the shape of standard normal. So the orange colored curve is the is under the normal distribution.

291
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:46,260
What the what the distribution of the test statistic is.

292
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:51,060
And then the green one is under the alternative hypothesis.

293
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:56,010
Here are the shaded area in green color is showing the beta.

294
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:02,760
And like on the opposite, this this part will be the power is the one minus beta, right?

295
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:06,420
And here the orange shaded area is the rejection region.

296
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:13,410
If my test statistics locate any anywhere beyond this point, I'm going to reject right now.

297
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:20,280
So if I have more people by green curve is shifting to the right.

298
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:28,540
That's because my center around this mean this standard effect size I was talking about as you have more people.

299
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:32,640
This component becomes smaller and then the mean will become bigger.

300
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:40,979
And this is just another way of showing. If I have more people, it's easier to tell to tell this to a distribution.

301
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:48,800
So part I have more information. It's easier for me to make the decision and.

302
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:55,809
Okay. Here on this page are your slides.

303
00:34:55,810 --> 00:35:01,840
Quote, looks slightly different from mine because I rearrange a little bit to make it easier for me to demonstrate this through revision.

304
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:06,730
But you slice also have all the components to it. So don't worry.

305
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:15,220
Here is the plot that we just saw and I just posted here, because I want to use this plot to derive the formula.

306
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:20,920
A very good starting point would be to find a relationship that includes both curves,

307
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:27,640
because we said we want to include all this Delta Sigma in the calculations, too.

308
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:35,950
So a good starting point is the power, because the power because of the definition the power rejects is the probability

309
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:40,980
of reject the null hypothesis conditional on the alternative hypothesis.

310
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:47,290
So we have we see both curves are involved in this in this formula.

311
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:57,760
And what we can do next is to replace the reject null hypothesis with the mathematical symbols that makes it make it easier to see.

312
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:09,970
So reject and all just means the test statistics is bigger than the critical value which is we are talking about this region is orange colored region.

313
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:16,540
And in the previous slide we also calculated exactly what the test statistic is.

314
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:20,080
So now we just plug it in. There's nothing complicated about this.

315
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:24,340
So we just plug in the cascading test statistics here.

316
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:36,520
And but notice that this probability is conditional on the alternative hypothesis, alternative hypothesis distribution.

317
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:46,120
So we want to find a way to see where this inequality is located relative to the screen curve.

318
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:53,530
But this is also easy because we know the green curve is just a mean shifted from the standard normal.

319
00:36:53,920 --> 00:37:02,740
So all we need to do is just to subtract this is mean, which is the standardized effect size from this value.

320
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:06,759
So this is what we obtained to keep the equality.

321
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,670
So we also do a subtraction here.

322
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:20,540
After this transformation we realized this point is just some points understand there standard normal curve because we did the

323
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:29,900
transformation so we could just simply replace it by Z like that because standard normal distribution also called the Z distribution.

324
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:34,610
So what do you see here and here? We're really close to what we want to get.

325
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:39,410
So all we want to do now is to get rid of this probability sign.

326
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:46,790
This is also easy because we know we learned the normal distribution very well after some.

327
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:51,080
Like if we draw the plot, use the symmetric probability of normal distribution.

328
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:58,130
This is this will be what we obtain in the end. Basically, you just get rid of this probability sign at a Z here.

329
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:05,330
Also on that is time because of the symmetric thing. You can check this after the class, but it should be fairly straightforward.

330
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:10,550
But we want to end right now. We have the relationship among all of this.

331
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:17,600
All of this elements we want to solve for. And so this is the formula we want.

332
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:25,850
If you look at this. This just includes all the components we can verify of intuition.

333
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:31,640
We mentioned a few slides ago. We said If we want more power, we want we want to have more people.

334
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:36,260
So that would mean if we want more power, the numerator is becoming bigger.

335
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:43,940
So that means I will have I need to have a bigger sample size and also we can verify the effect size.

336
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:49,400
What if I have a bigger effect size? But then we said if 35 size is bigger, we need less people.

337
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:55,880
We can verify it here. The effect size is bigger, my denominator will be bigger and the overall value will be smaller.

338
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:59,390
So that's why I use less people in my trial.

339
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:03,950
So. Okay.

340
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:11,150
So this is like the thing we want to see.

341
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:16,080
This is how we calculate the sample size for one arm test.

342
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:22,750
Here is just a power curve. What I want to say through this plot is pretty simple.

343
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:27,970
If we set the number of patients to five is fixed at five.

344
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:37,230
And here we see. So that means if my Delta IV becomes bigger, that means if my standardized effect size becomes bigger,

345
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:41,010
I will be able to achieve a higher level of power.

346
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:49,520
It's basically another way of saying, if my effect size is bigger, it's easier for me to test to do the testing.

347
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:57,860
You can also click on this website for a. And then you can see I have more people with the cargo, just three ships up.

348
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:03,290
That means if I have more people given all other states the same, I will.

349
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:07,070
It will be easier to achieve certain power.

350
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:16,790
You might be thinking, oh, is it right to always use to see these statistics the t test?

351
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:20,800
Because in reality our segment will always be estimated.

352
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:27,410
We don't know the truth, so we should use the T test instead of the test.

353
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:34,250
But if you follow the same procedure we did just now, we have a like formula.

354
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:38,450
It looks almost exactly the same. We just need to replace the Z with the T, right?

355
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:48,049
But the problem with T test is I remember when I first started learning the statistics to try the T statistics.

356
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:53,630
I always need to know what my sample size is, so I will be able to know the degrees of freedom.

357
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:57,589
But here we want to know the sample size, right? We want no sample size.

358
00:40:57,590 --> 00:41:04,370
So we're using the T test, but T test saying, oh no, I want to know, I need to know the sample size so I know how, like, how big I have.

359
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,820
But this is like a circular argument. So it's more complicated than Z Pass is less straightforward.

360
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:16,010
The good news is in phase three, we usually have moderate to large stumbles.

361
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:22,820
So if you remember that the T test, if we have more samples, we can approximate by the normal.

362
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:29,030
So this is so that's fine. It's fine that we're using normal when we have a large sample size.

363
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:33,620
But like what Kenny is working on, what I'm working on is usually the rare disease.

364
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:41,660
We may only have 30 individuals or like very few individuals, and we have no choice but to do to that,

365
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:45,500
to do the clinical trial on this small group, if that happens.

366
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:51,840
The best option is to use tea distribution, but we don't need to calculate it by hand.

367
00:41:52,290 --> 00:42:00,470
I will just introduce a R function that we can use, but just to remember, the process is interactive.

368
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:07,560
It's not that straightforward. And then the T distribute the T statistics is related to the sample size.

369
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:19,500
Here is an example. Let's say we want to have 80% power and the distance, which is of Delta, we want to test is three point.

370
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:29,170
We have a standard deviation of ten. So this is this was the three hour function I was talking about is called

371
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:32,980
power that t that test if you wanted to get your house or verify on a laptop.

372
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:38,460
So this formula is really straightforward.

373
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:42,040
We just need to plug in the values we have for Delta.

374
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:47,770
Here, delta equals two three standard deviation equals 210. Our alpha will be 0.05.

375
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:52,000
Like the convention. The power we stated here is 80%.

376
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:57,819
And make sure to apply the models like function now are doing a wonderful test or two.

377
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:05,110
Several times here we're doing the one single test and also tell the function whether we were doing two sided or was not discussed.

378
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:15,850
If we put in this line of code, this is all good. We obtain here the first lines and equals to 89.14958.

379
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:20,860
But in the grand we're in, like we never reported a number like this.

380
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:24,819
Right? We always need to run up. We said we'll report 98.

381
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:29,350
Is that because we don't want to give it 89 and India, we don't have enough power.

382
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:34,899
So it doesn't matter. Is 89.001 or 89.998.

383
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:38,410
We're always wrong up to 90 here.

384
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:42,700
The other lines are just an information. You you gave the function.

385
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:51,130
They're just restated here. So this is how we do it in our when you need to do what our ti statistic t test.

386
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:57,680
So here's is two scenario. This is the second scenario. Just now we did it one arm.

387
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:05,630
Here we're doing them two arms. But we still assume a continuous sorry outcome.

388
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:10,370
They're normally distributed and they have constant variance,

389
00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:18,710
which means my treatment and treatment be the outcome obtained from both trials, have the same standard deviation.

390
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:25,460
So like what I said, we collect y one, y, two, two, y and eight.

391
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:30,020
There are the subjects again and they're all they all follow.

392
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:35,680
This normal distribution was mean a a standard deviation course two sigma squared I'm here

393
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:44,510
the same thing for axis and notice that here I'm using the same variance the null hypothesis.

394
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:51,440
Now we have two arms we want to compare between the storms. So is we say this two arms have the same treatment effect.

395
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:56,090
So this is for A, this is for B, there's no difference.

396
00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:02,240
And the null alternative hypothesis is we say that there is a difference on the different sides is delta.

397
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:14,300
The similar to before to ask me this mean this meu a newbie, we use the means of all the ways on the means of all of axis.

398
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:18,590
And similarly again the test statistics. Look at this.

399
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:22,900
The numerator is the difference between the mean and denominator.

400
00:45:22,910 --> 00:45:28,130
If you do the calculations really simple. This is just a standard deviation of the difference of the mean.

401
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:39,080
Again, we're doing the T test. So before deriving it, we first look at a power curve which should look really similar to the one I showed just now.

402
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:45,770
Again, we see that the total number of participants in our trial is 80.

403
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:53,540
Like you could be or we could, you could. This are A and B, you have the same number of participants.

404
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:56,870
Or it could be different here.

405
00:45:56,870 --> 00:46:03,980
Like we see a like if you draw a vertical line anywhere on this graph,

406
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:11,390
you see that the one or the 12 that distribute the patients equally, you almost always has the highest power.

407
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:23,240
I think this was mentioned earlier in the course too. So but if you look at other if say I say the our best 20 RB 60 or our mayor has ten, RB has 70.

408
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:32,329
There are all they all have like lower power compared to if I evenly distributed this 80 people here is also

409
00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:39,530
says if we look at the like trend of the curve it also says if I have a bigger standardized effect size,

410
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:43,160
it's more helpful for me to reach a higher power.

411
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:54,360
I hear the distribution. Oh, no, the derivation looks scary, but it really is exactly the same thing we did when we did just now.

412
00:46:54,370 --> 00:46:57,520
The only part that's changed is the standard deviation part.

413
00:46:58,030 --> 00:47:02,470
If you go back and see the revisions, the only thing that's different should be here.

414
00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:10,660
So I will just skip this here is just continue from previous page.

415
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:19,960
But here I do want to say we replace and be the number of people arbitrary treatment r b with R multiplied by an eight.

416
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:24,610
The number of people enrolled in treatment arm, arm, treatment arm.

417
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:31,750
This R we call this R allocation ratio because we just don't want to see two s in the formula.

418
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:38,050
And we think if we derive it for an eight, we could use this R to calculate the number of people we need.

419
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:48,550
So if you look at this formula, even though we didn't do it step by step, but it looks just really similar to the one we did for one arm.

420
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:59,160
And the difference is here is the one plus one over R was the allocation ratio because now we have two arms instead of one arm, we need more people.

421
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:11,020
And then let's say if my R is one, my if our is one, we have equal number of people on A and B, I hear this inside this parenthesis, we will have two.

422
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:22,540
That means that means we need just twice as many individuals in this one arm than we would need for one arm while.

423
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:29,010
Yeah. But this component look, this part is exactly the same.

424
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:39,420
It is the most responsible for the. What are. Oh yea I want to mention and I forgot to mention earlier we said we're doing a one sided trial.

425
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:44,060
That's why we're using Alpha. If we want to do a two sided trial, we'll use Alpha over two.

426
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:48,410
So it's very easily extendable. It's not complicated at all.

427
00:48:49,830 --> 00:48:52,950
Here. We will see an example of the two hour scenario.

428
00:48:53,550 --> 00:48:59,340
So what we're doing here is the control group level is 80%.

429
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:10,740
The variability is 10% of the effect size we want to see, which is a delta we want to see is we want to see the treatment increase to 90%.

430
00:49:11,010 --> 00:49:22,600
That means the delta is 10%. It didn't write on the slides here, but we use alpha equals with 0.05 and we want to calculate what gave us 80% of power.

431
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:26,830
That's fairly easy because we already have our formula.

432
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:34,310
We just need to plug in the numbers. It's easy to do it by hand, but of course I have this line of code here you can always use to r,

433
00:49:34,450 --> 00:49:39,130
I just use R to calculate the sample size, but usually do it by hand.

434
00:49:39,970 --> 00:49:46,450
Where where is this 70% point nine from? So I have a little shade here on the right hand side.

435
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:53,890
So if you remember this part of this thing, this guy is the is the numerator of the formula we derived.

436
00:49:54,190 --> 00:50:03,130
So I just want to have a little shade so we know if I have a beta equals to a 0.2 alpha equals to 0.05 what the numerator is.

437
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:07,270
So this is where the 7.9 is from is just easy for you to check.

438
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:17,709
And also now the second is the second one is what if I want to test my neighbors in power and then all all else stays the same?

439
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:22,840
We just need to return to power. So previously we were looking at this point, which is Saudi.

440
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:29,440
If we want 90% power, our beta is 0.10, alpha is still 0.05.

441
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:33,849
And we have this number 10.5, which is this amount.

442
00:50:33,850 --> 00:50:37,720
Right. This is the again, the numerator of the formula we derived.

443
00:50:37,990 --> 00:50:40,630
So we just need to plug it in. And now we have 21.

444
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:49,180
So this is also saying if we have higher power, if we want to test a higher power, we need more individuals in our clinical trials.

445
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:59,410
The third one is what if we still want 90% power? But now I realize my availability increased from 10% to 15 to 15%.

446
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:04,510
This is also easing. There is a typo here. It should be 10.5.

447
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:10,390
This is also easy. We just need to replace the standard deviation by 15.

448
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:17,319
And now we have 47.25. Just notice how much difference it can be.

449
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:27,460
Like we have the the standard deviation, all the increase from 10 to 15, but we have more than like double amount of people.

450
00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:30,310
Yeah, we need more than double of the 12 now.

451
00:51:33,050 --> 00:51:37,960
So this is also to say it is very important to give a range of calculations instead of just one calculation,

452
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:41,810
because what if you are wrong in your variability calculation?

453
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:48,469
Here is just a power curve that like.

454
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:57,540
Made in our. Work is generated by all this code on the left.

455
00:51:57,930 --> 00:52:02,180
And the the graph is pretty straightforward.

456
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:07,380
We want to just want to say that with all other factors being fixed,

457
00:52:08,010 --> 00:52:14,610
if we have bigger sample size, we will be able to achieve more power in our clinical trial.

458
00:52:14,970 --> 00:52:23,490
I think the reason that I think this why I was taking this course, I was also thinking, why do we need to stress so many times?

459
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:28,290
Of course, if we have a bigger sample size is we can achieve higher power.

460
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:35,999
But I think really, which is just like keep your body, you know how like different elements work together,

461
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:41,670
like so that it becomes instinct so that when you see it, you know what will happen.

462
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:49,020
So even though I'm repeating many times, I apologize, but it is pretty important here.

463
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:54,960
The power curve again is just we generated this curve using all the code here you can verify on your laptop.

464
00:52:55,350 --> 00:53:04,380
And then this is just to say, if I my standard, my sample size stays the same, if I have a bigger effect size,

465
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:08,520
again, the effect size, the difference between treatment arm and the placebo arm.

466
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:13,620
I should be able to have more more power in my, you know, trial.

467
00:53:16,070 --> 00:53:23,060
Here is another example on the two hour cost constant variance scenario.

468
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:31,440
So if we have a randomized trial to weight loss programs, program A and program B, so our primary outcome is change.

469
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:41,690
You wait six months. So the effect size is five lbs, which means the delta is five, standard deviation is 11 for both arms,

470
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:47,990
and we want to have 80% power and we're going to do a two sided test.

471
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:59,690
Well, with Alpha being 0.05 here, if we're plug on numbers just like what we did before, where we have some number of people on each arm.

472
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:04,910
This is a table that I talk about, like a range of calculations.

473
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:08,270
What if my standard deviation is smaller than your level?

474
00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:12,530
Right? What if it's eight? Where is that? What if it's bigger?

475
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:21,500
This is just a sample size we calculated. And also, what if my effect size is not the same as I assumed?

476
00:54:22,070 --> 00:54:27,860
So we thought is five. But what if it's seven? And what if it's 2.5, even though it's less likely to be the case?

477
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:33,500
But still, if you do the analysis, you will have a better idea of how different the sample size could be.

478
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:37,880
Right. And then in here, in this example, we set £5.

479
00:54:38,450 --> 00:54:41,510
11, £11 is a variability.

480
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:46,160
So if they variability in is eight, we'll only need 41 people.

481
00:54:46,610 --> 00:54:52,730
If it's 14, we need 124. So but you are you never know about this.

482
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:58,460
You never know the true variability before the trials start. So it's super helpful,

483
00:54:58,730 --> 00:55:06,080
like to provide a table like this just to show our like or in the grants you will be pretty common that you provide a

484
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:15,770
table like this to show this are two different scenarios and like we need to be like careful when you are estimations,

485
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:25,400
etc. And the third scenario is if we have two arms where again assume normal but is a non constant variance,

486
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:34,680
that means I give a variance to my treatment arm and another variance to my treatment or B here looks almost exactly the same.

487
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:41,510
But just notice here my standard deviation is sigma as you cannot be there no longer the same.

488
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:50,870
But I still collect all this data, all otherwise and all the axis of my hypothesis look exactly the same.

489
00:55:51,350 --> 00:55:57,079
So I defer the null. I say they're equal. The alternative, I say they're not equal.

490
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:59,720
And this is the gap. This is the delta I want to test.

491
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:09,170
So again, a viewing on a movie are estimated by taking an average of all the wise and all access.

492
00:56:09,690 --> 00:56:16,589
This test statistics just look exactly the same. The only part that's different is here because all variance is different.

493
00:56:16,590 --> 00:56:24,420
You structure slightly differently but is still saying this are still what you close to the standard deviation of the difference between mean.

494
00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:28,350
So this is so the.

495
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:36,180
Yeah, it's not too big of a change. It should be easy to understand and just ignore all of the revisions.

496
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:43,650
We know what we need to do with your entity revisions. So here is the end product is how many people we need.

497
00:56:44,010 --> 00:56:48,419
I'm Truman. Are you define Truman. All right. It doesn't matter which one it is.

498
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:56,640
Just remember too is that Truman be as the allocation ratio multiplied but a number of people you need treatment array.

499
00:56:57,330 --> 00:57:01,100
So here again no is the numerators always stay the same.

500
00:57:01,110 --> 00:57:06,630
You never change throughout all the scenarios and the here is the only thing that's changed

501
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:14,130
is I have this other ratio allocation ratio here and also I have the two standard deviations,

502
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:21,420
but he follows the same structure. If you derive it, you can follow exactly the same derivation we did for the one arm.

503
00:57:24,370 --> 00:57:28,960
Here is just a very quick example, is the same setting is still the weight loss programs.

504
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:39,850
But now instead of having standard deviation you close to 11 for both arms using only 5 seconds second treatment arm.

505
00:57:40,270 --> 00:57:45,340
The variability is 25, which means the standard deviation is five.

506
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:51,090
I'm still using the same power and the same alpha is here just now.

507
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:55,360
If you remember, we had that in the result with 77 individual time charm.

508
00:57:55,810 --> 00:58:07,230
Now we only need 46. And that's because while my arm is not doesn't have that big of variability anymore, it's the variability the smaller.

509
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:10,600
So it's easier for me to see the difference. So I don't need that many people.

510
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:21,780
Again. This is just the same table. The lesson area is paired with data.

511
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:27,669
So again, like I explained impaired data, well, there could be many ways of doing it.

512
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:36,149
But one common way is I take the I take the observations from the same individual twice, the first time,

513
00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:41,280
maybe at the start of the trial, the second time, maybe after six months anyway, after a certain amount of time.

514
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:47,850
I have two observations from of from each individual and I pair this two observations together.

515
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:57,360
I take them, I take I step track them. Right. So if I look at the scenario is we have 10.1 time going to they're denoted by j.

516
00:58:57,990 --> 00:59:08,670
So I have y1y1j12j and then and then they all follow this normal distribution.

517
00:59:09,090 --> 00:59:16,070
They have the same variance. The constant is where under the custom variance scenario, so they have the same variance.

518
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:25,620
The only thing that's changed is their mean. So because we're taking the observation from the same individual there, there is this correlation.

519
00:59:26,430 --> 00:59:36,140
So my body weight in ten days, well would just slightly vary from my body weight or like my dad, it's pretty he's a lot heavier than me.

520
00:59:36,390 --> 00:59:40,500
I couldn't be able to wear like wear to his, like his weight.

521
00:59:40,890 --> 00:59:44,280
So if I compare it to my own weight, there is always a correlation.

522
00:59:44,730 --> 00:59:48,799
And again, we use the same hypothesis. The first one is the same.

523
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:54,180
The second line is we want to see a difference. The difference is Delta and the exact same thing here.

524
00:59:54,180 --> 01:00:03,000
If we estimate me one on mutual using y one hat on yy2 has we're just taking the average of all the y's.

525
01:00:04,210 --> 01:00:06,490
Here. We want to see the difference.

526
01:00:07,090 --> 01:00:18,309
The difference between this, why I won and why I too is a normal distribution with the and you one minus mutual and this is the standard deviation.

527
01:00:18,310 --> 01:00:21,510
No, I have the correlation component there.

528
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:30,580
So if we do a follow the same procedure, this is the formula we're going to get in the end.

529
01:00:31,150 --> 01:00:36,670
And notice that if I paired individuals this part is smaller than one,

530
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:44,710
so is making so compared to the unpaired scenario, our various parties are getting smaller.

531
01:00:45,430 --> 01:00:52,600
So overall we have a we have a we have smaller we only need a smaller number of individuals in our trial.

532
01:00:54,320 --> 01:01:01,570
This means this is because when we compare only compared all of the ratio within one individual,

533
01:01:02,230 --> 01:01:08,080
we're like eliminating the variance across individuals, right?

534
01:01:10,390 --> 01:01:16,180
So paired compared to all paired almost always give us a smaller variance.

535
01:01:16,420 --> 01:01:19,600
We need a small number or a smaller number of individuals.

536
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:34,090
And again, here we know is a one sided task because we're directly using Alpha here instead of alpha over two and y example on the power cases.

537
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:39,010
So this is pretty simple. It's about blood pressure.

538
01:01:39,490 --> 01:01:43,510
We're interested in a change of ten, which means the delta is ten.

539
01:01:43,930 --> 01:01:48,340
Standard deviation of difference within pairs is 20.

540
01:01:48,670 --> 01:01:52,090
So again, we use the formula, we plug in everything.

541
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:58,300
Remember to say paired here very often we are like, I remember I just made the same mistake many times.

542
01:01:59,020 --> 01:02:04,300
Remember to put a pair here. This is what we get and again and is the number of pairs.

543
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:09,060
So the number of observations we got in the end should be two.

544
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:14,770
And then we have the all comments and you close to 33.3672.

545
01:02:14,770 --> 01:02:20,140
Again, we need to report 34 pairs instead of 33 onwards.

546
01:02:21,430 --> 01:02:28,659
Also another thing I want to mention is that it looks like we're always calculating the sample size with this power.

547
01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:36,250
That's the test. But really we can just plug in any four of the elements and calculate the fifth if you're afraid to try it on your laptop.

548
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:39,280
And I think it is pretty easy.

549
01:02:41,110 --> 01:02:45,340
Okay. So this is a summary of all the scenarios we did just now.

550
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:52,930
So we have one arm, constant two arms, constant arms, not constant on parity with constant variance.

551
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:56,950
And the formulas are here again, it's not important like.

552
01:02:58,030 --> 01:03:02,499
Whilst learning this course, Kylie didn't require us to, like, recite, remember all the formulas.

553
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:06,280
So it's just important to know how we reach here, how we direct it.

554
01:03:06,490 --> 01:03:11,830
Not exactly all the details, but you need to know, like where the formula came from.

555
01:03:11,860 --> 01:03:21,870
So we figure out the distribution of the all comes under the null scenario and also the alternative scenario and we solving for power,

556
01:03:22,330 --> 01:03:31,590
given that given that all the information we had at that point and once we sample power and you stop worrying the formula, we need to start full.

557
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:38,350
And so also if you look at this, we didn't get a chance to compare them vertically, but right now we can do it.

558
01:03:38,350 --> 01:03:42,810
So this part of the numerator is always the same, right?

559
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:51,190
So the only thing that's changed is if my virus change, my structure, my very structure could change a little bit.

560
01:03:51,610 --> 01:03:55,149
There's nothing major is still follows the same logic here.

561
01:03:55,150 --> 01:03:59,470
If I to have if I have two halves, I may need a allocation ratio.

562
01:03:59,890 --> 01:04:13,270
Again, it's just to take into the fact that like now I have two arm instead of one curly only need me to cover or this page.

563
01:04:13,510 --> 01:04:18,040
So I think we finish like I let's finish what I prepared.

564
01:04:18,430 --> 01:04:22,280
So if you guys have any questions, I will stick here for slightly longer.

565
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:31,960
You can come up and ask me if. No, I think that's the end of this course and the the of of day.

566
01:04:45,170 --> 01:05:08,230
So, yes, I did church with my high school and I like my behind might be out there.

567
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:20,430
I like I want to tell you, you know,

568
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:50,110
I was born years ago but I that I did it because I play that I like novices this is not ready to get it wrong all the time you know,

569
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:54,790
because I have seen his or I go every time.

570
01:05:54,850 --> 01:05:58,890
You curious whether you're thinking about it? I thought, oh, really?

571
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:02,390
You just want to really try to find people who are already there.

572
01:06:02,740 --> 01:06:10,870
It's always been. And it's going to have a dial up.

573
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:14,440
How many shots you take, you just don't quite get something. You have to.

574
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:25,910
But you know, it was the first birthday. Sometimes I took shots you have if I took a shot going to.

575
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:31,510
Oh that he added the person. Yes.

576
01:06:31,870 --> 01:06:39,260
Thank you for your people to see.

577
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:43,210
I mean. Yeah, I mean I don't know. What are you guys going up or down?

578
01:06:44,350 --> 01:06:51,790
And I just, you know, want to see how they're going about this in favor of rain.

579
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:56,350
But I think. Yeah, mostly outside.

580
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:59,620
Can we get coffee? Awesome. Out here.

581
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:05,290
Are you okay? I'm a little sore, but it's okay.

582
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:13,220
What happened? She worked out for the first time in, like, three weeks to be more than.

583
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:30,550
Okay. What are you doing?

584
01:07:31,730 --> 01:07:37,420
You're. You should be more involved with people who are in the military.

585
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:41,300
I don't want to go to jail. So your comment on Shorten.

586
01:07:42,470 --> 01:07:45,860
Walk me to shore. What do you mean? There's a physician.

587
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:52,730
What do you mean? Come on. I want you to send me the material, so that will be very helpful.

588
01:07:54,270 --> 01:08:01,819
Don't you go see a woman? A young woman's empowered to look what you want to achieve.

589
01:08:01,820 --> 01:08:19,160
Granddaughter has a young gigolo. If you. How would you say, you know, how she would have come home for you, which I can't imagine.

590
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:23,690
Optician Impossible for treatment.

591
01:08:24,090 --> 01:08:34,110
I told her she can't do it.

592
01:08:35,070 --> 01:08:38,170
Sometimes she told me to tell you something.

593
01:08:38,190 --> 01:08:42,470
To try to do it.

594
01:08:42,990 --> 01:08:50,790
What? How would you will need your permission to shoot it.

595
01:08:54,930 --> 01:08:59,010
It's important to me and.

596
01:09:03,050 --> 01:09:07,580
Jim. So if you're blowing onshore at all, right,

597
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:17,010
let's compare what you do with really an issue helping you to assure you should test some type of high sentimental value.

598
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:30,500
Oh, oh, oh. Tissue damage on a farm and you don't have emotion in our industry.

599
01:09:31,730 --> 01:09:42,230
Passion emails from this one stood out to me.

600
01:09:44,870 --> 01:09:56,450
Portugal should have. You know, when you're watching this, I'm not sure you should have seen how Lincolnshire should do it.

601
01:09:56,950 --> 01:10:01,280
I'm not going to do it.

602
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:06,950
So should you. What has your country got? Original. Do you got your shrimp farm?

603
01:10:06,950 --> 01:10:10,819
You just had surgery. Now you've got paper wishing you could come.

604
01:10:10,820 --> 01:10:15,170
You know, definitely welcome me or want you to try your choice on it.

605
01:10:15,170 --> 01:10:19,249
What adaptive design can and I don't want the these are always we are entering

606
01:10:19,250 --> 01:10:24,899
the analysis on your you come away with double our usual oil placebo having a

607
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:29,840
low low dose arm having a high dose are going into and when you can we can have

608
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:36,020
the response you come onto Hollywood you are going to re redistribute to zero.

609
01:10:36,340 --> 01:10:46,010
Yes you do well response to how you find all response to go welcome to fungal audience from the arm that was written to go to do so.

610
01:10:46,010 --> 01:10:52,690
I mean there's a huge I you don't fit home with attention when you know how to fool the neck

611
01:10:53,450 --> 01:10:59,120
paper what kind of concerns you how can you see their job you what you are showing them.

612
01:10:59,930 --> 01:11:11,540
Do you know when people that doing something in your country you don't have you sure thing sigma how you would

613
01:11:11,540 --> 01:11:21,859
you should you should do I sent to my baby from the time usual how you want to indulge your your what we're

614
01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:27,560
doing those with Hoboken which I'm looking forward to for you as you want to jump your actual new consumption

615
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:36,830
these coming you dropping water that you can take a pill don't do what you see on your diet or should I do?

616
01:11:36,860 --> 01:11:42,290
The result would be the placebo test, which are less the new craze we can't handle deliberately, you know,

617
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:50,060
to wash up zebrahead pusher woman to sell trailer for women because of our physician maybe having that demure but I

618
01:11:50,060 --> 01:11:56,170
sure what if you have a beautiful woman just young on complementary the variability you guys were crazier than shoot

619
01:11:56,180 --> 01:12:04,010
on truth and that was it was an ideological monologue told an untenable intelligent when about all of these you should

620
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:12,380
do your own UK you don't handle so much marketing of our pop like you take off and should do to with albuterol.

621
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:17,830
So much water. Well. To carry it with a hammer.

622
01:12:17,870 --> 01:12:21,830
Well, it was always emphasized the research. She was always outside of research.

623
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:23,250
Research having to sure.

624
01:12:23,570 --> 01:12:34,700
Whether she was in the clinical variability though I do a quasi empirical but you you want to fit on a single picture so you feel that it was,

625
01:12:34,700 --> 01:12:35,900
you know, cutting a new drug,

626
01:12:35,930 --> 01:12:49,970
I'm sure was very telling you go with them you go to jail or is yeah you talk to a gigolo where you what a job and they say it can come to you at all.

627
01:12:50,210 --> 01:12:53,270
Cindy, you're sure? I told you. How do you guys want me?

628
01:12:54,290 --> 01:12:57,739
So I go yourself. You wrote Julie, your name goes in monster.

629
01:12:57,740 --> 01:13:09,490
And how come you need use it to tell me how your power vision.

630
01:19:58,920 --> 01:19:59,080
We?
