00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,360
Welcome to Public Health 508,
Social Determinants of Health.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,770
This course is designed to
introduce you to, or reinforce,

3
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:13,880
your knowledge of issues related to health
that considered behavioral, psychological.

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,670
And structural factors in population
health beyond the healthcare system.

5
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:22,440
By the end of this course, you'll be able
to discuss factors that contribute to

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:27,090
health inequities in the society,
and suggest innovative ways to

7
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:33,330
reduce disparities in health with
a focus on achieving equity.

8
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,030
By the end of this session,

9
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:38,170
you will be able to distinguish
definitions of health disparities and

10
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:43,070
health equity, determine factors that
contribute to health inequalities.

11
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:47,190
Discuss the historical context for
understanding health inequities.

12
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:52,420
And recognize levels of influence
that can affect health.

13
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:57,050
To begin, let's consider
current definitions of health.

14
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:01,200
When we think about health, we must
consider definitions that include not only

15
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,420
physical health but the role of
psychological and social factors, as well.

16
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:12,640
And how we function and
our overall well-being.

17
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,970
This approach addresses
the evolving definition of health

18
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:20,040
from the World Health Organization
that allows us to expand our thinking

19
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,260
to include not just the absence
of illness in physical health but

20
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:30,670
also good nutrition,
muscular strength, and adequate sleep.

21
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:36,790
Mental health issues such as coping with
stress, being flexible, finding balance,

22
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:44,370
and the ability to enjoy life are also
included in a definition of good health.

23
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:49,280
The idea of finding meaning and purpose
in life and the integration of mind,

24
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,205
body and
soul consistently contribute to health and

25
00:01:52,205 --> 00:01:55,780
well-being in ways we can
effectively document.

26
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:59,890
However, there are a number of factors
we must understand to determine

27
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:03,090
who will be healthy and who will not.

28
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:08,830
Based on influences beyond individual
behavior and the healthcare system.

29
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:13,680
If we consider the top 10 leading causes
of death in the United States listed in

30
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,680
figure 1, we see that heart disease and
cancer account for the majority of deaths.

31
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,170
Subgroup analysis by race and
gender show similar findings.

32
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:27,820
I'm sure there are no surprises for
you here.

33
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:32,510
However, if we consider factors that
determine health outcomes in figure two,

34
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:36,590
we see that lifestyle is
the greatest explanatory category.

35
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:42,730
That is, what we do accounts for
50% of our health status.

36
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:47,640
Where we live from an environmental
perspective matters as well as biology

37
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,862
to account for an additional 40%.

38
00:02:49,862 --> 00:02:55,140
That leaves only 10% for healthcare.

39
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:59,760
So why do we focus so much attention on
the healthcare system to explain health

40
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,980
when so many other factors are important?

41
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:06,320
In this course, we're going to
examine alternative explanations for

42
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,350
disparities observed in health outcomes
across different populations based

43
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:13,210
on structural and other factors.

44
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:17,520
It will be our job to interrogate
explanations offered in readings,

45
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,640
reflecting behavioral, psychological, and

46
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,970
structural factors that contribute
to inequalities in health.

47
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:31,110
Over the next few weeks, you will view
course videos, read assigned articles,

48
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:36,080
take weekly assessments, and engage in
class exercises designed to further your

49
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,530
understanding of inequalities and
health in today's society.

50
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,589
So, let's get started.
