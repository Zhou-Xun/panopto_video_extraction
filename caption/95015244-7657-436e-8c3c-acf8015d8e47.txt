00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:05,470
Hello, my name is Alecia James, and our presentation today is titled Quantitative Research Basics. I am a DRPH student,

2
00:00:09,337 --> 00:00:13,027
And in terms of data sources, where do we get our data from

3
00:00:13,027 --> 00:00:18,797
to analyze? We can use surveys such as the Youth Risk Behavioral Survey.

4
00:00:18,797 --> 00:00:25,637
We can also get data from clinical trials or other epidemiological studies.

5
00:00:25,637 --> 00:00:32,267
Now, a key concepts in quantitative research is that is a population, right?

6
00:00:32,267 --> 00:00:39,227
What does this mean? So the population is essentially the entire group from which a sample is drawn.

7
00:00:39,227 --> 00:00:43,337
And it could be all the seniors in New York City, for example.

8
00:00:43,337 --> 00:00:50,987
It could be the entire population of the United States or it could be all the students at the University of Michigan.

9
00:00:50,987 --> 00:00:55,097
Now, from an population, usually we would take a sample.

10
00:00:55,097 --> 00:01:06,277
So a sample is a representative subset of the population because usually we don't always get a chance to get data from everyone in the population.

11
00:01:06,277 --> 00:01:13,187
Unless we we're doing a census, but most times we just have access to data from a subset of the population.

12
00:01:13,187 --> 00:01:16,997
And that's what a sample is called. I mean, that's called a sample.

13
00:01:16,997 --> 00:01:25,817
And an example could be a group of 500 students at the University of Michigan instead of all of the students at the University of Michigan.

14
00:01:25,817 --> 00:01:31,277
Now, a parameter is a number used as a summary measure for a population.

15
00:01:31,277 --> 00:01:41,087
So using this in a sentence in context it could be we could say, the mean height of all the graduate students at the University of Michigan.

16
00:01:41,087 --> 00:01:47,567
And then a statistic is a number used as a summary measure for a sample.

17
00:01:47,567 --> 00:01:55,997
And an example could be the mean or median heights of fifty graduate students from the University of Michigan.

18
00:01:55,997 --> 00:02:05,567
And statistic for this kind of, you know, segway into the whole concept of statistics as a branch in itself.

19
00:02:05,567 --> 00:02:15,377
With statistics we're basically studying samples and then we're making inferences about the larger population from which the sample is drawn.

20
00:02:15,377 --> 00:02:23,437
Now other key concepts we need to know what a variable is and a variable is a characteristic that is being measured.

21
00:02:23,437 --> 00:02:28,657
And examples include height, weight, age or income.

22
00:02:28,657 --> 00:02:37,687
Now, variables are categorized into two main categories. You have what's known as a categorical variable and a numeric variable.

23
00:02:37,687 --> 00:02:42,637
A categorical variable can be further divided into two categories.

24
00:02:42,637 --> 00:02:48,697
So one is a nominal verbal, such as if we wanted to do the final verbal for sex,

25
00:02:48,697 --> 00:02:53,977
sex would be the variable and then the categories would be male or female.

26
00:02:53,977 --> 00:03:00,367
And an ordinal variable is use in ranking. So we have low, medium or high.

27
00:03:00,367 --> 00:03:05,827
And in terms of a numeric variable, we have discrete variables such as the number of children.

28
00:03:05,827 --> 00:03:13,717
Right. And then we have continuous variable. An example of a continuous variable could be someone's age.

29
00:03:13,717 --> 00:03:18,307
Right. Because you could be technically fifteen years and six months,

30
00:03:18,307 --> 00:03:28,697
so that's continuous. Now, other classes of variables, we have what's known as an independent variable and a dependent variable.

31
00:03:28,697 --> 00:03:36,797
Now an independent verb was also your predictor variable and your independent variable influences the dependent variable.

32
00:03:36,797 --> 00:03:44,477
So an example here is smoking as your independent variable and your outcome variable would be lung cancer.

33
00:03:44,477 --> 00:03:50,007
So in this case, we would be studying how smoking affects lung cancer.

34
00:03:50,007 --> 00:03:57,687
Now, in statistics we have what's known as the normal distribution, and it's a type of continuous probability of distribution.

35
00:03:57,687 --> 00:04:07,257
It's a symmetric on either side of the mean. So in this diagram right here in this graph, you can see the mean is actually at zero.

36
00:04:07,257 --> 00:04:12,777
And then within one standard deviation of the mean, you have six to eight percent of the data.

37
00:04:12,777 --> 00:04:21,447
Now measurements in real life, such as height, blood pressure, and IQ scores, tend to follow a normal distribution.

38
00:04:21,447 --> 00:04:31,857
And why is a normal distribution important? So usually there are certain statistical procedures that require this condition,

39
00:04:31,857 --> 00:04:36,057
so normality must be met for us to use certain statistical tests.

40
00:04:36,057 --> 00:04:42,957
And if it's not meant, we would be violating those procedures. So you'll see later on when I actually analyze some data.

41
00:04:42,957 --> 00:04:48,527
But the key thing is that your data is this usually symmetrical, as you can see.

42
00:04:48,527 --> 00:04:55,187
Now we also have what's known as univariate statistics, and this is statistics that describe a single variable.

43
00:04:55,187 --> 00:05:02,147
For example, we could look at the median income of participants in a particular survey. With bivariate statistics

44
00:05:02,147 --> 00:05:11,597
we're looking at two variables to see if there is an association, so we can look at the time spent studying and the test scores in college students.

45
00:05:11,597 --> 00:05:17,267
We could investigate if students get higher test scores if they spend more time studying.

46
00:05:17,267 --> 00:05:22,047
Right? That's an example of an analysis we could do. In multivariate statistics

47
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:30,997
we're usually analyzing more than two variables, and this can be done to determine the impacts of additional factors.

48
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:35,917
Now a major branch of statistics is descriptive statistics,

49
00:05:35,917 --> 00:05:42,307
this is used to summarize or describe the data collected in a study. Within descriptive statistics

50
00:05:42,307 --> 00:05:47,197
we have what's known as the measure of central tendency

51
00:05:47,197 --> 00:05:50,827
and this involves the median, the mean and the mode.

52
00:05:50,827 --> 00:05:56,947
We also have measures of spread, such as the range the interquartile range,

53
00:05:56,947 --> 00:06:02,527
the variance and the standard deviation. And we also use data display tools

54
00:06:02,527 --> 00:06:06,847
so we can visualize our data. What does the distribution look like?

55
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:12,037
So we use tools like a histogram, a density plot or a bar chart.

56
00:06:12,037 --> 00:06:20,707
What I have here is a box plot and on it you can see I have the minimum value, the maximum value,

57
00:06:20,707 --> 00:06:26,077
the median, the Q one means the first quartile, Q three means the third quartile,

58
00:06:26,077 --> 00:06:32,047
and this distance right here represents the interquartile range.

59
00:06:32,047 --> 00:06:42,367
Now, we also have inferential statistics. This is used to make inferences or to draw conclusions about a population from which a sample is drawn.

60
00:06:42,367 --> 00:06:49,477
So like I said, we in real life, we don't get to collect data from everyone in the population.

61
00:06:49,477 --> 00:06:58,477
So if we want to say, OK, look at the rates of obesity in a particular state, we would collect data from a representative sample.

62
00:06:58,477 --> 00:07:06,547
So this is our sample here and based on our findings in the sample we can make an inference about the population in general.

63
00:07:06,547 --> 00:07:11,137
Some of the statistical tests that are used in inferential statistics.

64
00:07:11,137 --> 00:07:16,687
We have a T-test and ANOVA, which is known as analysis of variance.

65
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:24,707
We can do a correlation or a regression, and I'll be doing a regression later on so you'll see how that works.

66
00:07:24,707 --> 00:07:29,437
Now, other things you need to know about quantitative research.

67
00:07:29,437 --> 00:07:35,167
One, various estimation and hypothesis testing involves.

68
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:38,777
So the confidence interval, that's an interesting concept,

69
00:07:38,777 --> 00:07:46,957
so it's a range of values for which we are fairly certain that the true population parameter falls in.

70
00:07:46,957 --> 00:07:50,887
The null hypothesis is really a statement of no difference.

71
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,987
So he's really saying, for example,

72
00:07:52,987 --> 00:08:01,867
there is no difference in the test scores of the students who studied for two weeks versus the students who did not study.

73
00:08:01,867 --> 00:08:13,117
There's no difference. Right? And the p value is the probability of obtaining results, at least as extreme as the observed.

74
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:21,107
Given that the null hypothesis is true. So later on, you will see how these concepts come into play.

75
00:08:21,107 --> 00:08:27,397
It will make more sense to you, and you'll see how we test our hypotheses

76
00:08:27,397 --> 00:08:32,787
for example. And finally we will look at,

77
00:08:32,787 --> 00:08:39,237
actually I'm going to talk briefly about some of the tools that we use in quantitative research.

78
00:08:39,237 --> 00:08:48,517
So we have statistical software such as R, R is open source it can be obtained from this site right here

79
00:08:48,517 --> 00:08:54,147
R-project.org that will give you the instructions.

80
00:08:54,147 --> 00:09:01,827
Usually with SPSS or SAS, your school would have a license for those so you can get access to those from your schools.

81
00:09:01,827 --> 00:09:12,567
But if you go to SAS.com, they do have SAS University as well as SAS for academics On-Demand, which is free, and STATA

82
00:09:12,567 --> 00:09:17,127
you may be able to update obtained via your school but I know that this one is paid.

83
00:09:17,127 --> 00:09:27,327
R is free and open source. You can get SAS for free. So I encourage you to take advantage of these tools to analyze your data. In the next segment

84
00:09:27,327 --> 00:09:34,827
we will be using R software to do descriptive statistics as well as inferential statistics,

85
00:09:34,827 --> 00:09:39,087
and we will operationalize some of the concepts that we looked at earlier

86
00:09:39,087 --> 00:09:45,277
so they will make a lot more sense to you.
