1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,100
Okay. Oh, I should think for this semester.

2
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:16,160
Office hours. I'll be available after class here.

3
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:26,219
But I think there's a classroom in right after us so we can find a place if you want to meet after class.

4
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,299
And I'm thinking Tuesdays 12 to 1, I'll be on campus.

5
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:37,200
All you can either meet me. I have an office space over in the nutritional sciences department or it could be via Zoom.

6
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,390
But I'll finalize that time. Okay, let me.

7
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,910
Family and spiritual settings.

8
00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:01,370
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,809
Okay. So. So I'm really a pretest,

10
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:16,150
but I think every year I don't want to make too many assumptions about like our baseline knowledge of enteral and parental nutrition.

11
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:21,820
So this is where I just want to see kind of where we're at. So for this first one,

12
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:29,740
this type of nutrition therapy enters the bloodstream directly and bypasses normal absorption so that the enteral or parenteral nutrition,

13
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:38,800
parenteral nutrition, right? So this is delivered right into the bloodstream and there's no absorption happening.

14
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:44,410
The nutrients are delivered right. Right into. Systemic circulation.

15
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:49,460
So this type of artificial nutrition therapies are both considered artificial nutrition therapies

16
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:55,910
delivered into the gastrointestinal tract where it is digested and absorbed through enteral nutrition.

17
00:01:55,930 --> 00:02:02,350
Great. This type of nutrition therapy is used for people who cannot eat or obtain adequate nutrition on their own.

18
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:13,870
Enteral nutrition will talk about indications for both, but if it's simply that a patient can't eat for whatever reason,

19
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:17,170
we're always going to use enteral nutrition whenever possible.

20
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:24,100
So this type of nutrition therapy is used for general use for people that do not have a functioning GI tract.

21
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:31,090
Parental rights. So if there's reasons that we cannot feed directly into the GI tract,

22
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:38,080
whether through oral nutrition or entering nutrition, that's when we reserve and use the parental nutrition.

23
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,990
Okay. There are different types of tubes that can be used for this type of nutrition therapy.

24
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:49,740
And true. But the tip of the tube will always do.

25
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:57,590
Will always terminate in either. The stomach or small intestine?

26
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:07,710
Yes. And I think today we'll get to a discussion is how we determine when we maybe don't want to feed into the stomach.

27
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:12,260
But usually our first priority would be to feed into the stomach whenever possible.

28
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,080
So we'd want the feeding tube tip to terminate into the stomach.

29
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:22,670
The nutrients delivered in this type of nutrition therapy are already broken down and ready for the body to use.

30
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:29,690
Parenteral nutrition and the nutrients are delivered to the body via once.

31
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:35,240
Yes. Like an I.V. So they're going to have intravenous access.

32
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:41,560
And in a couple of weeks, we'll talk about that. Okay, great.

33
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:46,850
So we have a pretty good understanding just of how these are different, it sounds like.

34
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:56,360
Okay. All right. So we are going to start by talking about intro nutrition today, just introducing it,

35
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:02,930
getting into feeding tube placement indications, things like that.

36
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:12,170
And we'll see if we can get through how it's delivered in terms of whether we do it around the clock or do it intermittently.

37
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:20,089
If we don't get to that section, we'll pick up on that next week. But the learning objectives for today, which may also go into next week,

38
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:24,830
I want to be able to describe the clinical indications for the initiation of mental nutrition,

39
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:30,980
describe the various routes of administration, and apply to a specific patient case.

40
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:36,980
Describe the advantages and disadvantages of gastric gastric versus small bowel feedings.

41
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:43,830
Apply a knowledge of the physiology of the GI tract and GI motility to planning

42
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:47,760
enteral nutrition regimens with patients that have altered GI motility.

43
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:53,790
And then we'll identify three different formula delivery methods. So this one we may not get to today.

44
00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:00,880
All right. So what is central nutrition? You'll see this referred to as N very often.

45
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:08,080
So how do we define it? This is nutrition provided through the gastrointestinal tract via a tube, catheter or stoma.

46
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:14,170
Most often it's going to be tube feeding tube that delivers nutrients distal to the oral cavity.

47
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:20,290
So we're our feeding tube is usually going to terminate into the stomach.

48
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:26,020
Sometimes we will progress it further into the small bowel and we'll talk about why we might want to do that.

49
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:30,570
And there's different types of tubes.

50
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:35,130
Lots of different types of tubes that can be placed. And we'll we'll get into that a little bit.

51
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:44,450
What I will say is if during your if you do do an internship, you have a chance to watch a feeding tube placement, do it or seek that out either.

52
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:50,790
Some sometimes are placed at the bedside. Sometimes a patient goes to interventional radiology and has a place.

53
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:54,900
So if you can watch that, that would be a good experience.

54
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,560
All right. Let's talk about indications for nutrition. So when.

55
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:07,950
At what point are we saying, okay, we need a feeding tube to be placed because we need to start until nutrition?

56
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:11,430
This patient cannot meet their nutritional needs through oral nutrition alone.

57
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:17,800
So until nutrition support should be considered, when findings from your nutrition assessment, of course,

58
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:24,710
demonstrate the inability to meet nutrient requirements via voluntary oral intake of food and beverages.

59
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:29,760
Now there are certain situations where a patient involuntary just will not eat.

60
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:36,040
We have we have protocols in the eating disorder population when they just will not eat.

61
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:41,199
And it depends on who has medical decision making.

62
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:48,069
When we place we go forward with nutrition therapy, but that's a little bit of a special circumstance.

63
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:51,550
But most often it's our patients that, for whatever reason, cannot.

64
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:58,020
Obtain adequate nutrition orally. So that could be our patients with really significant dysplasia.

65
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:06,870
We talked about last semester, maybe a lot of our elderly patients, maybe post-stroke that have significant dysphagia or swallowing difficulty,

66
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:14,579
maybe on a really restrictive diet, maybe they're a peri diet or they're on no liquid consistency that can be really hard to meet.

67
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:20,700
Nutritional needs so malnourished patients unable to consume adequate oral intake.

68
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,169
So we do have some guidelines.

69
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:31,410
So if we have a patient who we diagnosed with malnutrition and they're unexpected to, they're expected to be unable to eat for greater than five days.

70
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,380
That would be indication to place the feeding tube.

71
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:40,440
Sometimes we don't know if they're how can we predict if they're going to not be able to eat for five days,

72
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:44,070
depending on what's going on with their clinical picture and their hospitalization?

73
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,420
We might have some idea.

74
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:54,540
So we can be a little bit proactive, but you'll see this timeframe changes depending if they're well-nourished or malnourished.

75
00:07:54,540 --> 00:08:02,120
So our threshold to wait is is shorter for those that are malnourished and definitely shorter for for kids and babies.

76
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:06,750
We'll touch on that briefly. Mechanical ventilation.

77
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:12,180
Why would that be? You're on a ventilator, right?

78
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:18,090
They cannot eat. So these patients will almost always be on natural nutrition.

79
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:26,969
They'll have a feeding tube placed. And almost always, unless you're expecting them only to be on the vent maybe 24 hours,

80
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:31,200
they might they might hold off, but they're not going to be able to take anything orally.

81
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:35,250
So chronic history of poor oral intake.

82
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:42,690
This is these are like the toughest cases when usually the dietitian is the one advocating for an enteral feeding tube,

83
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:49,920
just maybe a patient that just is frequently in and out of the hospital, consistently not eating well.

84
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:55,890
That can be a hard sell for a medical team sometimes when they just simply are not eating well.

85
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:05,490
But if we have the if they are malnourished, that provides a little bit more more strength for us to push our point to get a feeding tube in place.

86
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:11,700
But this is probably, in my experience, the toughest battle when it's just someone that just cannot eat enough.

87
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:17,730
And you're pushing for a feeding tube some. Think of it as more of like a.

88
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:25,840
Extreme circumstance, a place of being, too, but it's really relatively it's a safe procedure,

89
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:30,010
but we take it very seriously whether we're going to go that route and actually do that.

90
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:36,549
So critically ill patients, we're not going to get into a lot of our ICU or critically ill patients,

91
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:45,190
but those that are critically ill or had major trauma in birds early until nutrition is actually recommended.

92
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:54,040
So in the first 24 to 48 hours of admission, if they are critically ill, they have a major trauma or burns if it is safe to start early.

93
00:09:54,340 --> 00:10:00,490
Enteral nutrition is recommended even if let's say they come off of it in two days.

94
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,040
That's still this is really encouraged.

95
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:11,470
And if you recall way back last semester with Anna's talk, the second day of class about these critically ill patients with major trauma burns,

96
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:17,260
their utilization of energy is really high at a certain point.

97
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:23,350
So that's why preventing excessive protein breakdown is really important.

98
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:30,430
So a lot of guidelines will will encourage implementation of nutrition within the first two days.

99
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:37,180
So what about a well-nourished patient who's under little or no metabolic stress,

100
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:40,930
but they're expected to be unable to eat for greater than 7 to 10 days.

101
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:43,540
So this is like a patient coming in. They're otherwise healthy,

102
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:49,930
but maybe they have a planned surgery and it's going to be at least over a week that we don't think they're going to be able to eat.

103
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:56,530
And that would be an indication for until nutrition does seven days so long to

104
00:10:56,530 --> 00:11:00,730
you guys like we're going to let them go a week before we place a feeding tube.

105
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,510
Able to expect to be able to eat.

106
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:11,630
Expect those were actually started on the first day of the 73.

107
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:17,270
Yeah. Let's see. You're going to have surgery on the head neck area there, well-nourished.

108
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:22,910
But it's going to be at least a week before we think they're going to be able to eat something.

109
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:27,680
Then we're going to wait the 7 to 10 days. Right. Which is.

110
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,840
Yeah, you wouldn't wait.

111
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:36,080
You would do this if you're expecting that, like we're anticipating it to be at least that long, then we would place a feeding tube.

112
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,270
But if it's less than that, like if it's going to be five days of MPO,

113
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:48,709
technically we would hold off because the the benefit at that point is not really shown

114
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:53,780
to be to be there to go see the trouble placing the tube getting once we get it started.

115
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:58,320
It's not like once we place a feeding tube, we immediately are delivering all the nutrition.

116
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:06,260
It does take some time. So this is kind of that threshold for a well-nourished patient would be if it's going to be over a week,

117
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:11,690
then yeah, but under a week we're going to hold off and that can be really tough to predict.

118
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:15,180
Yeah. And so it's not a well versed patients,

119
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:24,800
but five days with the threshold be different if it's a malnourished patient and we're thinking it's going to be over five days.

120
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:31,569
I mean, I would probably. I think we would be having that conversation to push that.

121
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:38,049
But we our threshold is is shorter. And these are these are in guidelines.

122
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:42,890
So there has been research done to see where where that benefit really happens.

123
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:49,120
It'll be even more interesting when we talk about how we decide when to start parenteral nutrition.

124
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,830
But there there is a lot of consideration is for if we are really going to go forward and place a eating to.

125
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:01,680
Okay. If we need to feed the GI tract, desultory obstruction or high output fistula.

126
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:08,640
So this would be another indication. So let's say somebody has a an obstruction somewhere in their GI tract.

127
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,840
Maybe they can chew and swallow and eat, but they have a bowel obstruction.

128
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:20,139
So if it is possible that we can have a tube place distal to that obstruction,

129
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:26,440
so below the side of the obstruction, that would be an indication parental nutrition because they can't eat.

130
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:31,750
So it two feet below that that obstruction.

131
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:44,930
Okay. So other indications for transitioning from parenteral nutrition or transitioning to nutrition via oral intake.

132
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:55,999
So if somebody was on on parenteral nutrition and we're going to now let them eat, we might also feed them.

133
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,069
And truly, while they're doing that transition so that we can get them off parenteral nutrition.

134
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:05,030
We'll talk about why it's so important that to avoid parental nutrition if possible.

135
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:11,840
So it also may be a bridge to to when they can have adequate oral intake from parental nutrition.

136
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:20,390
Professor, can you just talk about this application in terms of the gastric surgery, those people for weight loss?

137
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:25,670
So yes, if we will talk about that, like where we would feed.

138
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:29,329
So hold on to that thought. We'll have that discussion. Yes.

139
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:37,850
Did you say that we want to keep patients proper, terrible nutrition, parenteral nutrition, if possible?

140
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:46,940
Okay. So in summary, it's the inability to consume adequate oral intake, but the patient has a functioning GI tract.

141
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:52,340
So you'll hear this often. If the gut works, we use it.

142
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:58,520
Even if the gut works a little bit so or partially we're going to use it a little bit,

143
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:03,890
meaning we're going to try and feed even a small amount of nutrition to maintain the integrity of the gut.

144
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:10,670
And so you'll. You'll. You'll hear this during if you do the internship.

145
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:15,230
When you do some clinical class weeks off, remember this.

146
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,470
If the gut uses or if the gut works, we use it.

147
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:25,430
We want to maintain the integrity of the GI tract. When we try not to do it at all.

148
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:37,250
We'll talk about that because there are some contraindications to feeding somebody directly into a main artery.

149
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:45,900
Because a lot of infection risk with that. So we want to avoid it and we want to keep the integrity of the gut.

150
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,960
If we're not stimulating the gut, it loses function.

151
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:56,410
It can. So if even if it has if it's working a little, we want to feed it a little bit.

152
00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:03,070
You'll you'll we'll talk about situations where we might just kind of trickle in some enteral nutrition, nothing.

153
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:05,000
That's not providing them there.

154
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:13,640
A lot of nutrition, but it's just working to stimulate the gall gallbladder, to just keep peristalsis going, things like that.

155
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,680
All right. So we say if the gut works, use it. Well, how do we know if the gut works?

156
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:28,690
So in general, nutrition is going to be preferred to parenteral nutrition because of its relative simplicity safety.

157
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:34,339
It's also lower cost and as well as its ability to maintain mucosal barrier function.

158
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,810
So that's really important here.

159
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:43,909
So for enteral nutrition, the patient should be unwilling or unable to maintain adequate nutrition with oral feeds alone.

160
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:48,229
And in most cases, nutritional support should be considered if recommended.

161
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:57,490
Daily requirements will not be met for more than seven days in adults or 3 to 5 days in children, 1 to 3 days in infants.

162
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,860
You can see how our threshold to wait is.

163
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:08,100
It gets much shorter as the younger the patient gets. And then earlier intervention, of course, for those who are already malnourished, they.

164
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:19,470
So a functional GI tract with sufficient length and absorptive capacity is necessary for effective nutrient delivery using enteral nutrition.

165
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:26,970
I think we'll have time at the end of the semester to talk or I want to at least do a small

166
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:32,670
discussion on like more extensive GI surgery where a patient might have like an ostomy.

167
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:41,380
And what we talk about in terms of adequate absorptive capacity and what do we do there?

168
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:48,059
So what does a functioning GI tract look like? There's no obstruction or illness.

169
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:53,460
Does anybody remember or do we know what an illness is or.

170
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:08,910
I don't think we talked much about this last semester. Is there at the end of this meeting and it was it can be anywhere in the small intestine.

171
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:15,000
It's essentially the larger point with that towards the end.

172
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:27,450
That's the alien. Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah. Q An alias is essentially concerned, like a paralyze part about like it's not it's not dead.

173
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:33,120
So it sounds chemical, but it's a temporary and often painful lack of movement in the bowel.

174
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:44,720
So for feeding into an illness where there's not a lot of Paracelsus, that can be problematic, we learn in this class, I think word.

175
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:52,049
Okay so no obstruction or alias these both potentially can be visualized on an x ray.

176
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:59,520
So they might take an abdominal X-ray to rule this out. Now, often, if there is an obstruction or maybe an alias,

177
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:04,680
more proximal meaning higher up in the GI tract that we can speed safely below it will do that.

178
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:09,960
That's still going to be preferred. We can bypass that and still still feed the GI tract.

179
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:18,389
If I hear the question that people have that relief to write isn't that they have a lot of these things, not parts of it.

180
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:22,470
Not working? No. Well, in the large intestine. Diverticulitis.

181
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:31,500
Most of it, yes. Affects the colon. But that wouldn't necessarily be a contraindication.

182
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,790
That doesn't lead to an illness unless there's like an infection.

183
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:47,040
Potentially diverticulitis can maybe lead to a fistula, which we'll talk about, which we also might not want to feed that area in the civil.

184
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:51,359
Isn't that interesting? So I'll thousand.

185
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,010
You know, a lot of issues. Oh short short syndrome.

186
00:19:55,020 --> 00:20:02,880
Yeah. That's one. Yeah. That's significant. That would affect the absorptive capacity if they've had too much small bowel removed.

187
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:07,080
Well, we will talk about short palate syndrome because those patients often.

188
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:16,720
Sometimes we let them eat. But they'll be on parental nutrition because they don't have enough smell to investigate when and where.

189
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:20,230
I mean, where do we send a camera in or something?

190
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:31,210
You will have you will have an understanding, like the medical team will be ordering abdominal X-rays if they've had GI surgery.

191
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:35,080
Usually they have an estimation of how much bowel has been removed.

192
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:38,530
So we're not doing that, but it should be available.

193
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:48,150
Yeah. The view is that if we have or if the patient has an illness earlier in the digestive tract, that we would feed them below that.

194
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,880
But what happens if they have been replaced with the surgery?

195
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:56,260
Then that could potentially be a contraindication so we wouldn't be able to feed actually.

196
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:01,770
So even though I'm saying the functional GI tract is one where there's no obstruction or alias,

197
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:08,950
there are situations where it's proximal enough that we have functioning GI tract below that and we can see that.

198
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:17,010
So a lot of times we'll see our chart notes when we're wanting to start a diet or nutrition,

199
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:23,739
say somebody just had surgery, they'll assess if they're passing gas as a sign that the bowel is waking up.

200
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:28,420
That's a good sign. And they're having bowel movements that's telling us that things are functioning.

201
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:35,110
So that is a sign of a functioning GI tract, not just on its own, but that's always good.

202
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:40,870
You'll see. Like they're waiting to start a diet until a patient is passing flatus.

203
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,190
They'll say it in the note.

204
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:51,430
So once that things are waking up in the movie, the absence of vomiting or uncontrolled diarrhea, this is not an absolute contraindication.

205
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:58,480
But ideally the patient would not be having excessive vomiting and uncontrolled diarrhea,

206
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:03,010
because if we're going to feed that patient, there's lots of considerations we may have to take.

207
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:08,830
So it's not an absolute contraindication. If they do have vomiting and diarrhea, we can still feed internally.

208
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,840
But there's some some circumstances that we might want to consider there.

209
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:19,239
Because you're saying that if there is vomiting, then absolutely.

210
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:28,720
No, no. I'm saying if they if there's no vomiting, if the absence of vomiting or uncontrolled diarrhea is a sign of a functioning GI tract,

211
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:35,299
but if they do have vomiting and diarrhea, that's not an absolute contraindication to feeding internally.

212
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:40,190
And we'll get into to that. Okay.

213
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:47,629
So we're talking about there must be a functional but the only absolute contraindication to enteral nutrition is a mechanical obstruction.

214
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:53,870
So the there there is a bowel obstruction that we cannot feed distally to.

215
00:22:54,020 --> 00:23:04,459
So we're not going to feed somebody that has an eyeball obstruction, whether it's a tumor, whether it's let's say sometimes there's lysis of adhesion.

216
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:09,140
So maybe they've had previous bowel surgeries and there's a lot of scar tissue that now the bowel is obstructed.

217
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:17,540
So that would be like the only absolute contraindication is if there is something obstructing the GI tract that we cannot feed past.

218
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,610
So we're going to have to do parental nutrition.

219
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:30,560
Okay, so the following disease states all require careful management but are not absolutely contraindications for nutrition.

220
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:35,030
So the patient has had multiple traumas or third and post-operative state.

221
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:44,780
If there's congenital gastrointestinal anomalies to consider malabsorption or short palate syndrome,

222
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:47,899
this is really dependent on the length of the bowel that's been removed.

223
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:54,260
Sometimes we do feed these patients and truly to maintain the integrity of the bowel they do have left,

224
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:59,870
but maybe they're also on supplemental parental nutrition. So it's short bowel syndrome.

225
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:06,830
Yes, often requires parental nutrition, but it's not an absolute contraindication to enteral nutrition.

226
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:15,420
Okay. Something else to consider is that a route to eventual access must be safely obtainable.

227
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:19,120
So we have to be able to obtain Antrel access.

228
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:25,540
That's why with mechanical obstruction, if we cannot safely get enteral access, we cannot feed that mentally.

229
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:35,270
Yeah. Just clarify. So it's like for the obstruction, is that just an obstruction that's just too far down to it?

230
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:41,340
Can be. So if it's high enough up in the GI tract, we would still be.

231
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:46,639
Still possibly like and it depends on the type of ventral axis which we'll discuss.

232
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,950
Like if they can guide a feeding to pass the side of instruct of the obstruction,

233
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:57,890
see it's in the proximal blood and they can get a tube safely past that to feed.

234
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:05,210
Great. If it fits down lower in the GI tract, we might not be able to do that.

235
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:13,610
And it depends. Like if they want to go in and surgically place a feeding tube, they might not want to do that for several reasons.

236
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:20,630
So the it really depends on where the obstruction is and if we can safely obtain enteral access.

237
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:29,910
All right. Contraindications. We talked about some indications that are can also be contraindications,

238
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:35,940
but contraindications would be a nonfunctional or inaccessible gastrointestinal tract.

239
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:43,830
So if we can't safely feed into the track that the GI tract because we can't get a feeding tube safely, that would be a contraindication.

240
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:48,899
Or if the GI tract is just nonfunctional, we'll talk about why that might happen.

241
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,430
So severe short bowel syndrome.

242
00:25:50,430 --> 00:26:00,150
So less than 100 centimeters of remaining small bowel is usually kind of the threshold where there's there is no longer enough absorptive capacity.

243
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:07,260
Regardless on what type of formula we use. They cannot get adequate nutrition with that amount of small bowel left.

244
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:14,489
So these patients will be on parental nutrition and if they have intractable vomiting and diarrhea.

245
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:22,710
So maybe despite our best efforts on selecting maybe a certain type of formula,

246
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:28,799
doing a slow rate, maybe it's just that there are certain patients that are just really sick.

247
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:33,540
Maybe they have really damaged G.I track for whatever reason.

248
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:41,669
There's been radiation enteritis where there have just been kind of really inflamed and they just cannot tolerate that.

249
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:45,780
So there's constant vomiting and diarrhea. We're not going to feed those patients.

250
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:49,379
It can be it can just make matters more difficult.

251
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:55,110
So that might be a patient where. For a period of time there in parenteral nutrition until this can get under control.

252
00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:00,650
So gastrointestinal or bowel ischemia, does anybody know what that is?

253
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:09,840
If you think of ischemia, ischemic skin infection, it's like a lack of blood flow.

254
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:16,050
Yeah. So it's like potentially dead bowel or there's not enough blood flowing to the gut.

255
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:19,770
We don't want to feed patients that have got thalassemia.

256
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:29,430
So that would be a contraindication talked about an intestinal obstruction that we can't safely feed past peritonitis.

257
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:35,880
So inflammation of the peritoneum. So this is just a we'll talk about this when we talk about.

258
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:46,600
Different dialysis methods. But the peritoneum is is like a membrane that lines the inner abdominal wall covers the organs within the abdomen.

259
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:52,960
It can be prone to an infection if there's tubes or catheters through that area.

260
00:27:53,380 --> 00:28:00,250
And peritonitis is pretty significant and associated with a high morbidity and mortality.

261
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:03,610
So we don't see if there's presence of peritonitis.

262
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:12,170
A paralytic alias. So that alias is again, kind of like where the bowels just kind of frozen.

263
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:17,690
It's not moving in a paralytic. Elias would be like a more significant version of that,

264
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:25,819
where it's just kind of like a portion of paralyzed bowel and those can be caused by bacteria or viruses that cause intestinal infection.

265
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:30,110
So a really bad case of gastroenteritis can lead to like a paralytic illness.

266
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:39,080
Often the illness will happen after abdominal surgery, or if there's poor blood supply to the intestines, we might see something like that.

267
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:45,260
A high output fistula exhibit. Remember, a fistula is.

268
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:57,690
If we talk just briefly about this, we'll look at a picture on the next slide, but that is it's like an abnormal opening in the digestive tract.

269
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:02,580
So this causes gastric fluids to see through the lining of the stomach or intestines.

270
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:09,320
And so there could be a lot of output like GI output of gastric acid or or different secretion.

271
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:18,479
So we'll look at a picture as to why we wouldn't want to feed that until it's surgically corrected or healed because feeding into that,

272
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,510
it's just going to kind of exacerbate the situation. And then somebody.

273
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:29,389
These are just considerations. This would be more like our ICU patients that are on cancer support.

274
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:35,150
So this just means that they're hemo dynamically unstable if they're on pressers.

275
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:39,320
So medications trying to bring up their blood pressure, this is like they're unstable.

276
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:45,450
So we're not going to be feeding them enteral nutrition at this time. Okay.

277
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:49,500
So this is like a depiction of that chai fistula.

278
00:29:49,560 --> 00:30:00,490
Do you see how it's like. These abnormal connections where maybe there's a vulnerable spot in the bowel that then goes into another part of the bowel.

279
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:03,760
So it's like this. It's this connection that's not normally happening.

280
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:10,630
So about 85 to 90% of all GI fistula occurs a complication of surgical procedures.

281
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,310
So other possible causes could include a history of radiation to the abdomen.

282
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:23,629
Or maybe there's a lot of cell death causes some some damage to the intestinal wall.

283
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:30,740
And then we see this this kind of abnormal connection. I've always had a hard time visualizing and understanding what a fistula is.

284
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:37,670
But this is this is one of the better pictures I've seen, an infection, so such as diverticulitis,

285
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:45,319
if they get really inflamed in infected, we can see fistula development, inflammatory bowel disease, including Crohn's disease.

286
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:53,180
Some patients are more prone to GI fistulas with Crohn's disease, sometimes even an ulcer in the gut.

287
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:58,190
That doesn't heal can make that the lining again, really vulnerable.

288
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:04,120
And this kind of phenomenon can happen. So we don't want to feed into this.

289
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:14,489
Because it's not going to be able to heal if we're having constant, you know, nutrition kind of going through their flood of times,

290
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:21,809
we will feed potentially while the fistula is healed, or it might have to be surgically repaired as they can heal.

291
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:27,810
Naturally, they can. So. Or they'll go in and surgically repair.

292
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:33,430
Yeah. What was it? I want to be healing naturally.

293
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:38,950
That's a good question. And. I don't know.

294
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:44,960
In my experience, like, let's say there's presence of fistula, we're going to start parenteral nutrition.

295
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:51,980
And then the discussion is, are they going to be on parenteral nutrition long enough that the benefit outweighs the risk,

296
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:54,020
which we'll talk about, like parenteral nutrition.

297
00:31:54,020 --> 00:32:00,649
We really say like we want to see the patient on it for at least a week or else there's really no benefit of putting them through that.

298
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:07,770
So. I'd say probably a couple of weeks in my experience.

299
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:15,090
But if it's if it's really not something that they're going to think will spontaneously heal on its own, usually they'll go plan for surgical repair.

300
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:19,260
Just. All right.

301
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:28,380
Let's take a just a classroom poll. What scenario best represents a situation when nutrition may be recommended?

302
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:37,380
Okay. So the one the first one, when a person has an inadequate oral nutrient intake for 2 to 4 days, when a person has severe diarrhea.

303
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:44,370
When the GI tract works but the patient cannot meet their nutrient needs orally or when a person has severe dysphagia.

304
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:54,110
There can be more than one answer to this softball question.

305
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:57,920
What do you guys think of this one? Are we going to start entering nutrition?

306
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:05,570
No. Nobody eats well in the hospital. So if you go see your patient, they've been there two days and they're like, I've had two bites of whatever.

307
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:09,590
Okay. Kind of radar. But that's that can be typical.

308
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:15,230
Even 2 to 4 days of severe diarrhea that we are going to start.

309
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:20,330
No, the GI tract works if the patient cannot meet their needs orally.

310
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:26,930
Yes, right. That's like the simplest kind of indication when a person has severe dysphagia.

311
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:33,650
Probably just face severe dysphagia is going to be really hard to get adequate oral nutrition.

312
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:37,490
So that would be a a scenario where we might push frontal nutrition.

313
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:40,940
Yeah. And was really for an adult. Right. Yeah.

314
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:46,490
Okay. Yeah. Babies like our little neonates were quick like this.

315
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:50,930
We'll start. We'll place a feeding tube very quick. Even kids are.

316
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:54,169
Threshold is much lower. Yeah. Is severe.

317
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:58,040
Dysphagia. Is there like a certain level that's considered severe?

318
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:11,330
I would say, you know, in terms of the diet that they're on or just proceeding with in terms of nutrition.

319
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:19,520
Well, obviously, if it's severe enough that their MPO is they're not safe to take oral nutrition because

320
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:24,590
it's a very like they're at risk for any cancer that would be severe dysphagia.

321
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:33,520
But I pray, even if they're like kind of really like sometimes they'll even be on just like a level two diet, but they just they can't do it.

322
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:37,480
So that would probably be diagnosed.

323
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:40,040
Hopefully it would be diagnosed in terms of the severity.

324
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:46,850
But you could look at the level of diet they're on and then talk to the patient and family about what they've been experiencing.

325
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:57,610
But but if there's dysphagia so bad that they're MPO for all textures and liquid consistencies, that they have to be on actual nutrition.

326
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,930
So not safe to consume anything, really. Okay.

327
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:06,950
Well, we'll take a break in 10 minutes. So we'll take a break at 10:00.

328
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:13,010
All right. Let's talk about roots. Eventually, nutrition will start on this.

329
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:23,290
There's different reasons why we might place her name so in terror, too, meaning it goes through the nose into the GI tract somewhere,

330
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:28,450
so it might terminate in the stomach or we can have it progressed further into the small bowel.

331
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:34,630
I've seen this like couple of times of this, if maybe somebody has.

332
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:43,410
Oh, gosh, they might have it through, like an open stoma in their in their throat.

333
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:52,260
They might have a tube placed through that as well. They had like a thoracotomy or some type of esophageal.

334
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:58,810
Or if this if this area has been really surgically manipulated a lot of times and had neck cancer.

335
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:04,060
They might have access through through the throat, essentially.

336
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:12,750
I don't see that often. Yeah. If that's the case, if they have had a lot of work in their head and neck, why would they put the tube there?

337
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:16,220
Why wouldn't they do the other ones? That's a good question.

338
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:19,590
It depends on how long they think the patient's going to need a tube.

339
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:23,190
And a lot of this is dictated by insurance, which is going to be really frustrating,

340
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:31,140
frustrating for all of us clinicians when we think this makes the most sense is what we call more permanent feeding tubes.

341
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:37,020
Sometimes we'll be covered by insurance. We have to place what we call a temporary feeding tube.

342
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:42,000
And, yeah, it's it's not great.

343
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:50,160
Okay. So to determine the type of enteral access devices best for the patients, so many factors must be evaluated,

344
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:56,670
including the underlying disease, gastric and small bowel function, short and long term goals.

345
00:36:56,670 --> 00:37:00,840
We'll talk a lot about like timing, how long we think they're going to need enteral nutrition.

346
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:07,230
So anticipated length of therapy, risk factors related to the method of the tube placement.

347
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:13,490
And ethical considerations are all considered when determining the type of enteral access device.

348
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:20,550
So Mazo and Tarik, too. So these are ones that go through the nose, down the esophagus,

349
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:26,220
and then they either stop when the tip is in the stomach or maybe we go even further into the small bowel.

350
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,650
These are going to be the first means of gaining enteral access in the vast majority of our patients.

351
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:40,410
Okay, so keep that in mind. Most often, if they're patients hospitalized, maybe it's an acute issue that we need to feed them mentally.

352
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:44,790
Often they'll just drop a needle in two.

353
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:51,090
It's pretty, pretty quick, pretty safe to do. And it's it's more temporary.

354
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:57,430
Oral. Gastric feed. So this is where they go through the oral cavity, through the esophagus.

355
00:37:57,450 --> 00:38:07,169
This is that I have not seen in adults that we usually use that for infants since they're predominantly nasal breathers.

356
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:11,309
Sometimes we can better access the GI tract through the mouth.

357
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:14,550
So we're not this is not a pediatric course. You don't have to worry about that.

358
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,970
There are some situations where we might place a tube through the mouth.

359
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:25,240
So a more permanent feeding tube and we'll go through this. This would be these tubes down here.

360
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:30,340
There's going to be lots of different names for them. A more permanent feeding tube.

361
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:37,640
Should be considered essential. Nutrition support will be needed for more than 4 to 6 weeks.

362
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,580
There's like there are some timeframes there.

363
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:47,180
Often six weeks is a time frame used to decide between a temporary versus a feeding permanent feeding tube.

364
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:51,080
And sometimes that's where the insurance kind of issue kicks in.

365
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:56,510
If they don't anticipate the patient's going to need enteral nutrition longer than six weeks,

366
00:38:56,570 --> 00:39:00,469
a lot of times they won't cover placement of these more permanent feeding tubes.

367
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:04,580
And then the patient is is stuck with in his own chair, too, which is okay.

368
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:10,040
But it's it's not great. Sometimes the patients have to go home with that and it can get kind of fussy.

369
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:19,250
All right. Enteral access device selection. So we first need a clear rationale, parental feedings, which we kind of talked about.

370
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:24,360
An understanding of the potential links of central feeding.

371
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:32,249
So how long do we anticipate this patient will be on? Until nutrition and then a plan for enteral access placement must be determined.

372
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:35,500
Like how? What type of tube and how is it going to be placed?

373
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:42,780
You will not be making that decision. You may be part of that like, hey, this this patient is going to need a permanent feeding tube.

374
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:48,880
Like, I've had those conversations, like with the patients, like. There's no point in placing what we call a dab.

375
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:55,750
Sometimes that's a language you'll hear a DAB hop to, but that's really just an esoteric tune.

376
00:39:56,260 --> 00:40:00,340
They need a permanent feeding tube. They're going to need this for a prolonged amount of time.

377
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:10,599
So the estimated duration of ventral therapy or the desire for an enteral feeding trial to assess for feeding tube tolerance before an a more

378
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:18,460
invasive procedure might be the main factors in determining enable to placement versus a a percutaneous interest me which we'll talk about.

379
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,660
Sometimes if we think the patient's going to need a long term feeding tube,

380
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:32,899
they'll start replacing a nasal enteric tube just to make sure that they tolerate enteral nutrition, that we can get them on a regimen.

381
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:40,110
Then we'll place the permanent feeding tube. Okay.

382
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:46,139
So let's do just a quick, quick overview of enteral access, short term enteral access.

383
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:55,140
So what do we mean by short term? This is when Antrel Nutrition is estimated to be needed for 4 to 6 weeks or less, so essentially under six weeks.

384
00:40:55,140 --> 00:41:00,320
And some times the institution might use four weeks as kind of that threshold.

385
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:04,530
So this is where we would use those, what we call temporary feeding tubes.

386
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:09,269
And these are in Keenan, too. So that could be a nasogastric feeding tube.

387
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:16,590
So that terminates in the stomach or a nasal intestinal feeding tube, so it might terminate on the duodenum or the germ.

388
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:25,080
I guess it could go into the alien, but usually we don't we don't go quite that far unless absolutely necessary.

389
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:32,880
And again, there are some situations where we might feed our thread a tube through the oral cavity, but that's going to be an infant.

390
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:39,720
So how are these plays?

391
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:50,320
I haven't worked in the inpatient setting a long time, but when I worked most often even just a a nasal in therapy to was placed.

392
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:55,170
In I.R. or interventional radiology or with an endoscopy.

393
00:41:55,180 --> 00:42:00,750
So they have to thread the tube through the endoscopy and they know where they're going.

394
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:05,020
They kind of follow the camera to know if they're terminating in the stomach or into the small bowel.

395
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:07,720
And then they pull the scope out and the tube is in place.

396
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:16,420
They secured in place threads most often in my in my history of working clinically, it was done by like an endoscopy placement.

397
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:21,490
They can do them at the bedside so a nurse can place it at the bedside.

398
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:27,940
And there are certain devices like they can use some imaging to know where the tube is and where it's terminating.

399
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:36,850
I think I mentioned last semester some patients place their own feeding tubes on, but they don't want that permanent spot on their stomach.

400
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:40,360
A lot of these young kids, they'll place their own feeding tubes.

401
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:45,610
So take some practice. We have to make sure they're not going into the lung.

402
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:49,269
For instance, you want to make sure you're going through the esophagus.

403
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:54,020
That has happen. We've had patients on this.

404
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:59,890
It doesn't really happen anymore because we usually have X-ray confirmation where the feeding tube tip is.

405
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:03,280
But it has happened where this place is.

406
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:08,109
You're feeding central nutrition to the lung and you wonder why the patient has it is having aspiration pneumonia.

407
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:16,050
And then you confirm an X rated into the lung. Feeding tubes can migrate, so they can they can move.

408
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:23,050
Usually they don't. They try and secure them in. But it's always good to have confirmation of where that feeding tube is.

409
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:30,879
Yes, they have. How do they make sure they don't? So for a nasal and tear tube, you guys will see this.

410
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,650
You'll see patients on natural nutrition.

411
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:43,540
Often they'll have it kind of there's like a little it looks like a little string that helps keep it in place in their nose.

412
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:47,470
I'm not sure exactly how they do it. Oral B taped to their face.

413
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:54,759
Patients that are really agitated sometimes can pull at things and at times tubes come out that we replace.

414
00:43:54,760 --> 00:44:02,710
So they might have more extensive tape, but there's a term called like a bridal tube where they kind of secure it in with some some thread.

415
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:11,520
Yeah. Okay. Well, I think we can we'll stop after the the next slide.

416
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:16,230
So short term is usually a nasal tube and it's going to be needed.

417
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:21,450
The idea is it's going to be needed for, you know, less than a month or less than six weeks.

418
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:28,680
So there were and that does have indications for insurance if a patient is not expected to need until nutrition more than six weeks.

419
00:44:29,010 --> 00:44:34,080
So they're going to have any is on track to because their insurance will not cover permanent feeding too often.

420
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:42,770
But long term enteral access. So this is for our patients that we think are going to need dental nutrition greater than 4 to 6 weeks.

421
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:48,290
And this is these are lots of different names for tubes.

422
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:52,730
So we'll we'll talk about these briefly, but I want to get too caught up in the different needs.

423
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:56,780
But there is a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.

424
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:02,609
You'll hear the term peg tube. It's just. A tube that's into the stomach.

425
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:09,089
So a gastrostomy tube, meaning it's going into the gastric body and this is just how it means, how it's placed.

426
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:12,660
And so percutaneous endoscopies.

427
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:20,550
So they use an endoscope to kind of light up the spots that they want to insert the tube and then it's done percutaneous.

428
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:26,219
We'll look at examples of this. They can have a a peg tube.

429
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:31,860
So the the same idea. But it's going into the doona often.

430
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:35,310
If that's the case, they'll have what we call a peg tube.

431
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:38,820
So they have gastric acid access as well as digital access.

432
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:44,630
We'll look at an example why we might have that. And then they're surgically placed, trust me tube.

433
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,950
So these are not done and desktop actually,

434
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:53,220
but they're more of like a surgical procedure and that will be referred to as a g tube if it's in the stomach.

435
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:57,000
If it's surgically placed into the jejune m, that'll be a j tube.

436
00:45:57,450 --> 00:46:00,930
I will be honest. These will be used interchangeably.

437
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:06,899
Like the doctor will say, patient is a g tube. Well, technically, maybe it was like a peg too, but it's.

438
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:12,200
It's the same idea. It's a permanent feeding tube into the stomach. So don't get too caught up in that.

439
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:19,580
But if you read the patient's note, they might just say they have a peg to maybe it was really a G tube in terms of how it was placed.

440
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:27,240
All you need to know is where it terminates in this person, this class.

441
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:31,880
Is it in the stomach or is it in the small bowel? We won't get into this too much.

442
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:41,549
Okay. So this is like an example. Of a pay tube placement.

443
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:46,860
So they're going to put an endoscopy probably through the nose down into the stomach,

444
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:54,450
and then they'll have percutaneous early access to the stomach through like a needle with the tube they threaded in.

445
00:46:54,780 --> 00:47:00,750
They secure it on the inside of the stomach, and then they'll be an access point on the outside of the abdominal wall.

446
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:05,880
So you can kind of see that here. So here's the the end of scope.

447
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:11,459
They light up the area that they're going to then puncture. There's like a small balloon in here.

448
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:15,930
It's like a sailing balloon usually that keeps the tube in place.

449
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:19,680
And then this is like the the port on the outside.

450
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:23,550
And this is kind of how we deliver meds, fluids, formula.

451
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:32,050
Okay. I'll do one more and then will step back. Okay.

452
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:41,500
So it's a little bit hard to see, but to use this is like the example of a a DJ to whether it was placed in this graphically or surgically.

453
00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:47,410
But you'll hear the term DJ too, meaning they have gastric access and digital access.

454
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:51,520
So they have two different termination points of the tube.

455
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:59,020
So one that terminates in the stomach. Maybe we use that to deliver medications and then maybe we need to feed into the

456
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:03,520
jejune and for some reason that we don't want to feed into the gastric pouch.

457
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:06,520
So. This is this is common.

458
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:10,050
If they're going to have a G tube, usually they place a GJ tube.

459
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:13,600
So we have both gastric and digital access.

460
00:48:15,570 --> 00:48:20,730
Usually there's going to be a port that we put the enteral nutrition into.

461
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:28,140
So formula goes through one. We usually have one for medications and then there is usually.

462
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:35,780
A port here. It might look like this that will keep that sailing balloon inflated.

463
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:38,900
So they can they can control that, too, that way.

464
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:43,930
I mean, these are like I. I don't know a ton about these permanent feeding tubes, but.

465
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:52,280
I always like to look at what the patient has like let me see what it's like, especially if they're on home.

466
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:57,330
Enteral nutrition. Tell me what you're putting where and they can, you know, tell you.

467
00:48:57,390 --> 00:49:01,610
I put my formula through this one. Usually they'll have it labeled. But if there's, like, issues.

468
00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:06,559
It's always good to have that discussion. Like, how are you infusing your child nutrition?

469
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:11,220
Where are you giving your meds? Where are you doing your fluid flushes? Okay.

470
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:17,420
So that's just like a brief rundown. So let's take let's take a ten minute break and come back around 1013.

471
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:22,040
And we'll do like an exercise together. Any questions?

472
00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:34,870
Okay. With this in 1994.

473
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:44,310
This is true of three and a half.

474
00:49:44,410 --> 00:49:44,680
Three.
