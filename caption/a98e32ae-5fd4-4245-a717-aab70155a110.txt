00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:12,240
Hello, welcome to this
lecture covering inference,

2
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,655
for binary and
categorical outcomes.

3
00:00:14,655 --> 00:00:17,760
In this lecture, we'll focus
on what binary data are,

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,280
and how we compute
proportions from these data.

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,750
Now investigating
health outcomes,

6
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,470
in communities and populations,

7
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,290
it's certainly one of
the most common forms of

8
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:29,495
analysis we use in public health.

9
00:00:29,495 --> 00:00:31,140
We're often interested in seeing

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,570
whether the proportion of people

11
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,765
with a disease is greater in
one group versus another,

12
00:00:35,765 --> 00:00:37,160
and therefore we
know where to put

13
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,084
valuable resources toward
addressing health disparities,

14
00:00:40,084 --> 00:00:41,780
and hopefully reduce
the burden of

15
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,775
disease in our communities.

16
00:00:43,775 --> 00:00:46,610
Now there are many ways to
categories health outcomes.

17
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:48,860
For example, the
ultimate outcome in

18
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,815
life is that someone is
either dead or alive.

19
00:00:51,815 --> 00:00:53,840
We could also consider
a study in which

20
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,835
we categorize people
as having a stroke,

21
00:00:55,835 --> 00:00:58,850
a heart attack, some other
cardiovascular event

22
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,605
or perhaps, no
cardiovascular event.

23
00:01:01,605 --> 00:01:03,140
In a study of a disease,

24
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,240
we might categorize each
person's outcome as either

25
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:08,195
being mild or moderate or severe.

26
00:01:08,195 --> 00:01:10,330
So in this module,
we'll work through

27
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:12,130
how we estimate a probability or

28
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:14,200
a proportion of the population

29
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,880
that exists in each category,

30
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,890
and this will prepare
us next to test,

31
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:22,010
whether those proportions
are different across groups.

32
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:24,120
Our learning objectives are;

33
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,445
first to understand what

34
00:01:25,445 --> 00:01:28,090
a population probability
or proportion is,

35
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:29,860
then to understand how we compute

36
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,080
a sample probability
or proportion,

37
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,690
to then use a contingency
table to summarize

38
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:37,720
binary outcomes that we collect
on two groups of people,

39
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,870
at last to understand how
we use the data to compute

40
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,909
a 95 percent confidence interval

41
00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:46,160
for a single
population proportion.

42
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:50,320
As an example, imagine we
have two groups of infants.

43
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,060
We have a group of infants who

44
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,085
have a control given to them,

45
00:01:54,085 --> 00:01:55,910
and we have a population of

46
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:58,099
infants who are given
an intervention,

47
00:01:58,099 --> 00:01:59,915
and after two years,

48
00:01:59,915 --> 00:02:03,365
we wonder if the probability
of caries or cavities,

49
00:02:03,365 --> 00:02:06,290
differs between the population
of infants who were given

50
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:08,720
the intervention versus
the population of

51
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,830
infants who were not given

52
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,260
the intervention and
received the control.

53
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:15,565
Set another way, we
ask after two years,

54
00:02:15,565 --> 00:02:18,635
does the proportion of
infants with caries differ

55
00:02:18,635 --> 00:02:23,100
between the intervention and
the control populations?

56
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,725
Now in the control population,

57
00:02:25,725 --> 00:02:28,565
we have a single
population parameter P_1.

58
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:31,200
If you recall, with
continuous outcomes,

59
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,760
every population had

60
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,455
a population parameter
for the mean mu.

61
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:37,070
We have binary outcomes,

62
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,710
we do not focus on
a population mean,

63
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:42,200
but instead a
population proportion.

64
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,410
So P_1, indicates
the probability of

65
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:48,815
caries in the control
population of infants.

66
00:02:48,815 --> 00:02:51,230
Correspondingly, it
is the proportion of

67
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:54,460
control population
infants who have caries.

68
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,685
For the intervention population,

69
00:02:56,685 --> 00:03:00,070
we have a corresponding
population parameter P_2,

70
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,330
which represents
the probability of

71
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,505
caries in this population,

72
00:03:04,505 --> 00:03:07,010
which is equivalent to the
proportion of infants in

73
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:10,670
the intervention population
who have caries.

74
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:13,319
For each of these infants,

75
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:16,295
we have an outcome which
is carries, yes or no.

76
00:03:16,295 --> 00:03:18,320
We will represent
this through a zero,

77
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,180
representing no carries, and

78
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:23,930
a one for every infant
who has caries.

79
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:28,190
So therefore, P_1 is the
proportion of all of

80
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,780
the infants in the
control population

81
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,330
who have a one for their outcome,

82
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:36,020
and P_2 thereby represents
the proportion of all infants

83
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,615
in the intervention population

84
00:03:37,615 --> 00:03:39,880
who have a one for their outcome.

85
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,800
Now we do not know the
values of P_1 and P_2,

86
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:47,020
so we will draw a sample of
infants from each population,

87
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,040
and we have a control
sample of infants and

88
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,835
an intervention sample of
infants who then give us data.

89
00:03:52,835 --> 00:03:57,200
The data in the control
sample is summarized by n_1 ,

90
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,170
which is the number of
infants in the sample.

91
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:02,130
We then count up the
number of infants

92
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:03,885
in the sample who have caries,

93
00:04:03,885 --> 00:04:05,805
that number is m_1,

94
00:04:05,805 --> 00:04:07,370
and therefore an estimate of

95
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,394
the population parameter P_1,

96
00:04:09,394 --> 00:04:11,600
is the value P_1 hat,

97
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,240
and this is the proportion
of infants in the sample

98
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,735
of data who develop
carries within two years,

99
00:04:16,735 --> 00:04:20,630
and that is simply the
ratio of m_1 to n_1.

100
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:23,680
Likewise the data in the
intervention sample,

101
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,040
are summarized first by

102
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,565
the number of infants
in this sample n-2.

103
00:04:27,565 --> 00:04:29,960
M_2 is the total
number of infants

104
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,225
in the sample who
developed carries,

105
00:04:32,225 --> 00:04:33,800
and therefore an estimate for

106
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,765
the population parameter P_2,

107
00:04:35,765 --> 00:04:37,790
is the value P_2 hat,

108
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,500
which is the proportion
of infants in

109
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,635
the sample who developed caries,

110
00:04:41,635 --> 00:04:46,250
and that is m_2 divided by n_2.

111
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,040
Now imagine I had a
study in which I had

112
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,545
36 infants in the control sample,

113
00:04:51,545 --> 00:04:53,180
and I found that 10 of them

114
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,340
developed carries
within two years.

115
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,525
I therefore have an
estimate P_1 hat,

116
00:04:57,525 --> 00:05:02,010
which is equal to 10
divided by 36 or 0.28.

117
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,710
Now notice that the value 10,

118
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:07,070
is the sum of all
of the zeros and

119
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:10,895
ones in the total 36
infants in my sample,

120
00:05:10,895 --> 00:05:14,825
and that sum is then
divided by n_1, 36.

121
00:05:14,825 --> 00:05:16,760
So therefore, we have a sum of

122
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,130
outcomes divided by
the sample size.

123
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:21,230
This is exactly what
a sample mean is,

124
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,640
this is the formula we saw when

125
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,085
we had continuous outcomes.

126
00:05:25,085 --> 00:05:27,080
Likewise, suppose I had

127
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,510
68 infants in the
intervention sample,

128
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:32,320
six of whom developed
carries within two years,

129
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:37,875
giving me an estimator
proportion of 6 over 68 or 0.09.

130
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:39,950
Again, the value six is

131
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,840
the sum of all the
zeros, and ones,

132
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,160
in the 68 infants in

133
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,875
the sample divided
by the sample size.

134
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:49,235
So again, this number
looks like a sample mean.

135
00:05:49,235 --> 00:05:50,990
I emphasize this last fact,

136
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,190
that both of these numbers are

137
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:55,400
sample means because the
central limit theorem,

138
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,070
is a theorem we apply
to sample means,

139
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,990
and we'll prove very
valuable when we

140
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:03,230
analyze binary outcomes
in future lectures.

141
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,690
Now the data, from the study,

142
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,190
can also be summarized in what

143
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,740
we call a contingency table,

144
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:12,160
and I show you the contingency
table here on this slide,

145
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,900
is comprised of two
rows and two columns.

146
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,200
The rows indicate who belongs
to the intervention sample,

147
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,210
and who belongs to
the control sample,

148
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:22,340
and the columns
indicate which babies

149
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,405
developed carries
and which did not.

150
00:06:25,405 --> 00:06:28,370
So therefore, the first
row of this table there's

151
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:31,130
a total of 68 infants in
the intervention sample,

152
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:33,245
six of them developed carries,

153
00:06:33,245 --> 00:06:35,270
and 62 did not.

154
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,175
Likewise the second row,

155
00:06:37,175 --> 00:06:39,490
we have 36 total
infants in the sample,

156
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,145
10 of whom have caries,

157
00:06:41,145 --> 00:06:43,350
and 26 who did not,

158
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:46,560
and then we can add up the
column totals and we see

159
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,610
that in all 104
infants in my sample,

160
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:54,650
16 had carries, and 88 did not.

161
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:58,700
We therefore can compute
sample proportions from

162
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,220
a contingency table
by simply taking

163
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,860
the first value in
the first column,

164
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,895
and dividing by the corresponding
total for that row,

165
00:07:06,895 --> 00:07:09,150
so that end of the
control sample, again,

166
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,665
we have 36 infants,

167
00:07:10,665 --> 00:07:12,335
10 of whom had carries,

168
00:07:12,335 --> 00:07:15,350
the ratio of those
two numbers is 0.28.

169
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,660
In the first row
we had a total of

170
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,110
68 infants in the
intervention sample,

171
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,935
six of them developed carries.

172
00:07:21,935 --> 00:07:28,570
So we have a proportion
of 6 over 68 or 0.09.

173
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:32,240
Now that we have estimates for
the population parameters,

174
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,140
we also need standard
errors for those estimates.

175
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,915
For binary outcomes,

176
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:39,050
the formula needed for
the standard error of

177
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,760
the estimate is different than

178
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,070
the formula that I showed
you in previous lectures,

179
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:46,070
for the sample mean of
continuous outcomes x-bar.

180
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48,855
I show you the formula
here on this slide,

181
00:07:48,855 --> 00:07:51,220
and from this standard error,

182
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,330
I can then compute
standard errors

183
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:56,735
corresponding to the data I
collected in each sample.

184
00:07:56,735 --> 00:07:59,449
So in the control sample,

185
00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:01,180
I have 36 infants.

186
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,055
The estimator proportion
was 10 over 36,

187
00:08:04,055 --> 00:08:07,640
and therefore I have 10
over 36 divided by 36,

188
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,220
times 1 minus 10
over 36, and again,

189
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,640
I take the square root
of this and get 0.07.

190
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,640
The corresponding computation
for the intervention sample

191
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:20,335
leads to a standard
error of 0.03.

192
00:08:20,335 --> 00:08:23,390
We use these standard
errors to compute

193
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:26,030
confidence intervals for
the population parameters,

194
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:29,030
like we did when we had
continuous outcomes.

195
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:31,820
The concept for a 95 percent
confidence interval,

196
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,160
for a population parameter P,

197
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,740
is the same as the
formula we used when we

198
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,265
wanted a 95 percent confidence
interval for the mean mu.

199
00:08:40,265 --> 00:08:42,215
It is simply the estimate,

200
00:08:42,215 --> 00:08:44,975
plus or minus two
standard errors.

201
00:08:44,975 --> 00:08:46,375
So in this case,

202
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:48,080
a 95 percent confidence interval

203
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,715
for the population proportion,

204
00:08:49,715 --> 00:08:52,145
is the estimator
proportion P-hat,

205
00:08:52,145 --> 00:08:56,390
plus or minus two times its
corresponding standard error.

206
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:59,270
Applying this to the
control population,

207
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,890
you can see that a 95 percent

208
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:03,230
confidence interval for P_1,

209
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:05,300
is the estimator proportion

210
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,195
0.28 plus or minus
2 standard errors,

211
00:09:08,195 --> 00:09:12,395
giving me an interval
of 0.14 to 0.42.

212
00:09:12,395 --> 00:09:15,180
Therefore, in the
population of control

213
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,850
infants my data suggests that,

214
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,280
the probability of developing

215
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:23,800
caries ranges from 0.14 to 0.42.

216
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,075
Likewise, a 95 percent
confidence interval

217
00:09:27,075 --> 00:09:29,775
for P_2 in the
intervention population,

218
00:09:29,775 --> 00:09:32,590
is the estimated proportion 0.09,

219
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:34,750
plus or minus 2 corresponding
standard errors,

220
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:40,390
which was 0.03, giving me
an interval of 0.3 to 0.15.

221
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:42,960
Again, this means
that my data suggests

222
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,260
that in the intervention
population of babies,

223
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:48,020
the probability of developing
carries could be as low as

224
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:52,220
0.03 or as high as 0.15.

225
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,750
So at this point for
any binary outcome,

226
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,810
we're now able to first estimate

227
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:59,200
the population proportion
from our sample,

228
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,750
and then to provide a 95
percent confidence interval

229
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,225
for that population proportion.

230
00:10:04,225 --> 00:10:06,245
Now, of greater interest,

231
00:10:06,245 --> 00:10:08,490
is to assess whether
two populations

232
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:10,770
have different proportions.

233
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:12,840
In other words, we
wonder if there is

234
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,440
an association between

235
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,730
a person's probability
of the outcome,

236
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:19,115
and which population
they belong to.

237
00:10:19,115 --> 00:10:20,770
To answer this question,

238
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,580
we'll use a new hypothesis test

239
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,900
known as a chi-squared test

240
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:27,560
of association that will be
covered in a future lecture.
