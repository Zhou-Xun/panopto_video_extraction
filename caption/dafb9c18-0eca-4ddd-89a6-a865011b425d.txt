1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:05,880
in the both for research and her teaching and just

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:15,380
this week she became an associate editor of the journal as Medical fire.

3
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:20,400
and then you can read her talked title here. but as I

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,400
understand that the better title would be. she's in wall closing.

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:41,420
that sounds like there maybe some Weston falls. so please join me in about something.

6
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:46,600
you. I haven't given a seminar for the department. as

7
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,680
part of the department of Macy's since my job interview so I have like a residual job interview

8
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,275
there. today is Wednesday the go I guess I don't know. I wanna talk

9
00:00:57,275 --> 00:01:02,475
today. rather focus topic. cover some work. very recent

10
00:01:02,475 --> 00:01:07,655
work that my lab has been doing a route Rhino virus and respiratory and enter viruses and also in

11
00:01:07,655 --> 00:01:12,675
the second why does go together. in the first half of the presentation is something

12
00:01:12,675 --> 00:01:17,855
that we've just finished with the many schedule just got submitted on Monday. and

13
00:01:17,855 --> 00:01:23,115
then the second have something working on right now is all very new stuff I won't be entirely polished but

14
00:01:23,115 --> 00:01:28,135
it's pretty exciting. so Mister with a brief introduction to Rhino virus. and

15
00:01:28,135 --> 00:01:33,275
why I think we should care about Rhino virus and going to bed.

16
00:01:33,275 --> 00:01:38,575
use two different scenarios one looking at that pattern to write a virus transmission in childcare

17
00:01:38,575 --> 00:01:43,875
and then one looking at the two thousand fourteen DVD sixty break

18
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:49,235
and how that integrates with us. two fourteen was a very

19
00:01:49,235 --> 00:01:54,535
interesting year for us to try versus any other and worldwide in general. and

20
00:01:54,535 --> 00:01:59,601
one was because of the flu vaccine with match very well. there was a_lot_of respiratory

21
00:01:59,601 --> 00:02:04,801
message. like to listen the country anyways. but before that happens.

22
00:02:04,801 --> 00:02:09,901
there was this large outbreak. that's right a virus

23
00:02:09,901 --> 00:02:15,041
or DVD sixty enter virus D sixty eight or restoration or viruses representative in

24
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:20,061
Ann_Arbor area by the words here. I'm gonna talk more about it and

25
00:02:20,061 --> 00:02:25,061
why it was so unusual and with this kinda implications of that

26
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:30,301
outbreak are going forward. so to serve with an introduction

27
00:02:30,301 --> 00:02:35,421
right over as of viruses from Corner Verde Family.

28
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:40,481
this is me. bye. I'll be in a buyers. if you go. are nice

29
00:02:40,481 --> 00:02:46,441
tiny and a virus. it's very small. it's a captain's virus.

30
00:02:46,441 --> 00:02:52,361
it has a very high level of diversity. with over a hundred noon. heights is over

31
00:02:52,361 --> 00:02:57,461
and because of this diversity. there's a_lot_of challenges in accurately testing

32
00:02:57,461 --> 00:03:02,587
for an understanding we have a genealogy virus. they're still so many types

33
00:03:02,587 --> 00:03:08,087
of it. it is very very frequent virus. it is the predominant

34
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:13,267
because of the common calls. so you can do about that. and second and this is

35
00:03:13,267 --> 00:03:18,727
more data you know it's been often over last or sort of just credit it is being important virus.

36
00:03:18,727 --> 00:03:24,027
even though it's so common. hi this is so freaking that people will have a just a short

37
00:03:24,027 --> 00:03:29,327
self Limited inspection with Rhino virus with there. there's a date that suggesting

38
00:03:29,327 --> 00:03:35,367
the Rhino virus is linked to Princeton. as a doctor patient or maybe the future development of asthma.

39
00:03:35,367 --> 00:03:40,567
and we do see hospitalization some severe infections that are caused by run a virus.

40
00:03:40,567 --> 00:03:46,567
so we need to think carefully before totally setting.

41
00:03:46,567 --> 00:03:51,767
there's a few things that happened in recent years it is made to study a friend of ours more complex. one

42
00:03:51,767 --> 00:03:56,867
is back in two thousand and eight. it is important with advance

43
00:03:56,867 --> 00:04:02,445
use the use of molecular message for buyers characterization and discovery. independent

44
00:04:02,445 --> 00:04:08,045
of culture growth message using Jott. the sequence of virus site. I discover and identified.

45
00:04:08,045 --> 00:04:13,465
there was a new species of Rhino virus that was discovered called Rhino virus. we

46
00:04:13,465 --> 00:04:18,605
know we previously knew about viruses. alright bye. hey Indian Bright of Mercy has

47
00:04:18,605 --> 00:04:23,865
previously been totally I detected in human and it's because the growth parameters

48
00:04:23,865 --> 00:04:28,865
and run a very serious so different than the other place. so the message that we were using up until two

49
00:04:28,865 --> 00:04:34,425
thousand and eight. we're completely unable to detect a friend of Marcy had existed

50
00:04:34,425 --> 00:04:39,425
for as long as all right of viruses had if it was in an emergent virus we just didn't know about

51
00:04:39,425 --> 00:04:47,465
it. it was running around and causing the common hold of people being on detectable.

52
00:04:47,465 --> 00:04:52,485
there was a discussion about how do we understand right versus how do we classify them and

53
00:04:52,485 --> 00:04:58,973
how do we need that because it's such a diverse set of for allergy

54
00:04:58,973 --> 00:05:04,133
message. why this is Mimi. classify Rhino virus is based on the solstice

55
00:05:04,133 --> 00:05:10,053
in Joe Mickey Association. the weather may cause a classic upper respiratory virus. as demonstrated

56
00:05:10,053 --> 00:05:15,353
by my friend. very sick son right here. I'm kinda. it was also determined by

57
00:05:15,353 --> 00:05:20,573
reference panels is gonna Stacy Sarah to use to Raleigh to see and

58
00:05:20,573 --> 00:05:25,693
you. whether the virus to grow under certain zero logic conditions to be able

59
00:05:25,693 --> 00:05:30,793
to name a virus and number that in sequence. you have Rhino virus type

60
00:05:30,793 --> 00:05:35,993
one three five nine oh. to determine if did reference to another series in here the doctor

61
00:05:35,993 --> 00:05:41,553
and a valid picture from that you come see study that shows what what the classical

62
00:05:41,553 --> 00:05:46,893
run of our study sounds really serious. I was running to verify slips are all classified

63
00:05:46,893 --> 00:05:51,933
by number by the basis of this are due testing starting in two thousand

64
00:05:51,933 --> 00:05:57,365
and nine. so I'm gonna make it happen I'll make you virus pass on it needs probably

65
00:05:57,365 --> 00:06:02,505
picked up at the drive topic I come up. bye. in two thousand and nine. there was a total

66
00:06:02,505 --> 00:06:07,905
tax and I re shuffling all of the Rhino virus and the decision was made

67
00:06:07,905 --> 00:06:12,945
to do it totally on the space to speak with match. totally no longer

68
00:06:12,945 --> 00:06:18,465
looking at some drama presentation we're only looking at genetic and matches to reference range.

69
00:06:18,465 --> 00:06:23,545
in order to now Main run versus going forward into re classify the right of versus that we

70
00:06:23,545 --> 00:06:29,245
know about. so what this resulted is.

71
00:06:29,245 --> 00:06:34,945
now we have this is sort of over working group. I don't buyers Gina

72
00:06:34,945 --> 00:06:40,003
Indiana Wright Gina we see an oral virus. we already know it

73
00:06:40,003 --> 00:06:45,223
was like our second virus polio virus. and then we've got Ryan

74
00:06:45,223 --> 00:06:50,503
a birthday. see and see this or the three buckets that we're gonna put this address is

75
00:06:50,503 --> 00:06:55,823
rejection right about. during this free classification which will become much more important later in

76
00:06:55,823 --> 00:07:01,043
the presentation. this federal virus here and raise D sixty

77
00:07:01,043 --> 00:07:07,123
eight used to be a Rhino virus. there were there were Bruce Albright versus I got reassigned

78
00:07:07,123 --> 00:07:12,243
and now called general viruses and should be done with that road

79
00:07:12,243 --> 00:07:17,543
that you need to kinda felt like new viruses because I got new name new identity. they received Brenda

80
00:07:17,543 --> 00:07:22,583
versus we had known for years. but they were actually genetically to diversion from other right of versus

81
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:27,783
to stay in that category. so by two thousand and ten.

82
00:07:27,783 --> 00:07:33,183
services. total shake up and sort of how we looked at right versus the message

83
00:07:33,183 --> 00:07:39,004
that we're we were using is the gold standard to be able to classified and

84
00:07:39,004 --> 00:07:45,524
what our understanding of the different categories of ours. so I miss you guys a quick

85
00:07:45,524 --> 00:07:50,664
tour and explain why at this point. I

86
00:07:50,664 --> 00:07:55,824
decided to look at what these what this Jacob had to do with Child Care. so

87
00:07:55,824 --> 00:08:01,464
Childcare was the first place today would you try to understand what the right of RC

88
00:08:01,464 --> 00:08:06,904
the new questions and run over for me all day.

89
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:12,024
so why study why City child Care. so we can get

90
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:17,284
this question in two ways. one has everything you know just in what you said people who no children

91
00:08:17,284 --> 00:08:22,284
who are in child care may have a children or child care. if you have children or child care. your

92
00:08:22,284 --> 00:08:27,464
question is often why is my kid always sick studied and tells the

93
00:08:27,464 --> 00:08:32,584
response and his kids has been ten twenty percent of the time we have you references

94
00:08:32,584 --> 00:08:37,592
is water out_of every five days. your child care child is sick and if you look in

95
00:08:37,592 --> 00:08:42,752
that. if you're free could you of the mommy blog. you can look at parenting

96
00:08:42,752 --> 00:08:48,092
websites as lives and have them all your freaking poles in daycare and preschool. here's the list

97
00:08:48,092 --> 00:08:53,292
of recommendation that the Berkeley parents network has in the station

98
00:08:53,292 --> 00:08:58,952
at home on some stage or talking to your child's teacher about fighting daycare germ.

99
00:08:58,952 --> 00:09:03,992
well there was a the Twitter Hash tag called the daycare flag. so it's it's it's

100
00:09:03,992 --> 00:09:10,812
just sort of rope in our society the kids are in daycare I just always

101
00:09:10,812 --> 00:09:15,832
busy please tell me do that as well. so we look at any of allergy or

102
00:09:15,832 --> 00:09:21,412
various in child care because Childcare is where the viruses are mean that's really where the

103
00:09:21,412 --> 00:09:26,412
children shelter program are three times as likely to require emergency department

104
00:09:26,412 --> 00:09:31,432
Care Urgent Care Pharmacy Services. I received a very pediatric office on

105
00:09:31,432 --> 00:09:36,512
that average Health Care Centers. fifty three percent higher. for children who attend center

106
00:09:36,512 --> 00:09:41,574
base take care. alright. over. if this is not just a small

107
00:09:41,574 --> 00:09:46,734
side side of the population. over sixty percent of US children. attendance Center

108
00:09:46,734 --> 00:09:51,854
based child care programs that are associated with this high level of

109
00:09:51,854 --> 00:09:57,534
sickness expenditure and it's not in you see more data. in a moment about this one. when you have

110
00:09:57,534 --> 00:10:03,114
on this outbreak in the Child Care Center. you got impact on Health Care expenditures you have_to

111
00:10:03,114 --> 00:10:08,634
to take the kids to the doctor or doctor soon as you can about it. over use happening. this also impacts

112
00:10:08,634 --> 00:10:14,594
the home impact businesses. it impacts the other parts of our community as his lost productivity.

113
00:10:14,594 --> 00:10:19,854
as parents stay home to take care of his or his parents

114
00:10:19,854 --> 00:10:25,234
house is also sort of itinerary and the call mind we found in terms

115
00:10:25,234 --> 00:10:30,294
of local community academics. so I've been working with. as

116
00:10:30,294 --> 00:10:35,520
part of the Chris Network. which is a Health Care after surveillance base after

117
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:40,940
surveillance program to look at infectious diseases. in child care to use it as a mechanism

118
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:45,940
for bio surveillance in the community. and since first publication that we

119
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:51,400
had this network. looking only in for Child Health Care Center. this is for Geo illness.

120
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:56,860
we found that UCS. I can tell us is appearing in the child care.

121
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:02,160
I went to two weeks before you start to see don't miss is show up on a regular

122
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:07,560
state or county based everyone. and this is very recent data that

123
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:13,180
he's Doctor Austin Peter work done that. you will get used ones

124
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:19,100
like illness and this is. I'm looking at four recent years. the blue

125
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:24,420
Bar here is the other child care surveillance and the black line is the county

126
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:29,500
surveillance. I heard pay the state based surveillance and you can see that in some

127
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:36,284
years he had this really strong signal that either coincides or precede

128
00:11:36,284 --> 00:11:42,424
bill this is that we are able to see from the standard and the CB surveillance system for Child Care.

129
00:11:42,424 --> 00:11:47,684
there's an argument to be made for child care. this is to be heading kinda

130
00:11:47,684 --> 00:11:52,984
first and very obviously in the community.

131
00:11:52,984 --> 00:11:58,604
so I have access to specimens and data from

132
00:11:58,604 --> 00:12:03,664
Madigan Army Medical_Center Day daycare study I was involved in the study back when I was in Seattle. and

133
00:12:03,664 --> 00:12:08,704
I just thought that this would be a good framework to try to look at Rhino virus.

134
00:12:08,704 --> 00:12:14,184
given what we now know about the diversity the virus and sequence space and outside.

135
00:12:14,184 --> 00:12:19,284
this is a study where was a perspective lunch and of course any of everybody to daycare

136
00:12:19,284 --> 00:12:25,104
care centers. and it follows them from February two thousand six April two thousand and eight.

137
00:12:25,104 --> 00:12:30,244
all children under three years of age we had two hundred twenty five children the cohort.

138
00:12:30,244 --> 00:12:35,768
and this is the related activities on this follow up. we're studying doors ways to communicate

139
00:12:35,768 --> 00:12:41,268
with the daycare providers and the children and found out every time the children had symptoms for an acute respiratory

140
00:12:41,268 --> 00:12:47,488
virus. whether or not they saw Doctor Sue this is way more sensitive than the

141
00:12:47,488 --> 00:12:52,908
study that you have some TSM or studies that use medical visits to look at

142
00:12:52,908 --> 00:12:58,268
that at the genealogy the virus and then real-time first transcription

143
00:12:58,268 --> 00:13:03,608
with you. you detect fifteen respiratory bars

144
00:13:03,608 --> 00:13:09,468
and these kids. the ceiling scheme is what really enabled us to

145
00:13:09,468 --> 00:13:14,548
dig into this more deeply. once once we identified an LS which is sort of represented by these

146
00:13:14,548 --> 00:13:20,072
blue boxes we swap the children when we identified that the list. also slides

147
00:13:20,072 --> 00:13:25,152
weekly until the PCR was negative. no when we designed the study we thought that this meant we were

148
00:13:25,152 --> 00:13:30,512
gonna add one maybe two other slots under our budget. and somebody's

149
00:13:30,512 --> 00:13:35,852
kids are spotlight steady and fifteen guys because the kids never became

150
00:13:35,852 --> 00:13:40,912
negative the kids. always had a virus. the other thing we did for through the study we added

151
00:13:40,912 --> 00:13:45,932
me to protocol modification. just love the kids enrollment. whether or not they were sick

152
00:13:45,932 --> 00:13:51,112
and I can tell you how the kids were sick when he enrolled in the study because the kids are really sick and is that

153
00:13:51,112 --> 00:13:56,252
he's ER was positive. we found a virus and like said even if they do nothing since we continued

154
00:13:56,252 --> 00:14:01,392
to swap. so we'll have data from some Ethan somatic kids as well to be able to Missus Iris

155
00:14:01,392 --> 00:14:06,552
is the easiest another buyer. we tested these viruses

156
00:14:06,552 --> 00:14:11,652
for for what ways are tested the sample for what was causing the Ellis

157
00:14:11,652 --> 00:14:17,793
you can see right a virus what size in large the most common

158
00:14:17,793 --> 00:14:22,953
virus detected and respiratory illness. about fifty eight percent. I was

159
00:14:22,953 --> 00:14:28,933
the respiratory illnesses. had a rhino virus. I just walk during the fires. we have a lot

160
00:14:28,933 --> 00:14:33,953
lot of positive hours to work with here. there were a_lot_of not gonna get into it

161
00:14:33,953 --> 00:14:41,893
today to the rest a_lot_of power infections and a_lot_of overlap between easy for viruses as well.

162
00:14:41,893 --> 00:14:46,953
what the focus and both we've got that initial set set of Rhino virus infections

163
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:53,153
that we found we found them in children with acute respiratory illness. we also found

164
00:14:53,153 --> 00:14:58,473
forty one percent of kids with with Alison James had a rhino virus detected.

165
00:14:58,473 --> 00:15:03,813
we often have been rolled during the following rental versus very common so you can expect it circulating

166
00:15:03,813 --> 00:15:09,133
in the community that greater time. but I'm gonna focus more heavily on the success

167
00:15:09,133 --> 00:15:16,545
that we were able to get good signal seated to be able to do a big Geno type announces these different strain

168
00:15:16,545 --> 00:15:21,665
and this is Lou. looks like when we actually said this is the Gina Rent a verse right here. we

169
00:15:21,665 --> 00:15:26,705
seen point five time non- coding region which because it's not coding you

170
00:15:26,705 --> 00:15:31,885
expected. if you very have a_lot_of variation have a_lot_of evolution happening. we with

171
00:15:31,885 --> 00:15:37,005
that that area of the Gina to try to differentiate between these

172
00:15:37,005 --> 00:15:42,965
different writer buyers Street. and this is sort of our arch free that we get from that.

173
00:15:42,965 --> 00:15:48,065
and as you can see here the red the red

174
00:15:48,065 --> 00:15:53,225
prong that we have our Gina hi it's Jeanette. Jeanette if we correlate to run of our

175
00:15:53,225 --> 00:15:58,325
species today which we've known about for a long time. the green is friend of ours. he could be. which

176
00:15:58,325 --> 00:16:04,945
was known about for a long time. and then the blue is running of a receipt. so these are

177
00:16:04,945 --> 00:16:09,985
samples that before two thousand and eight and. we just to study in two thousand

178
00:16:09,985 --> 00:16:15,145
and two thousand sixty two thousand eight. when you study started. never it hadn't even been known

179
00:16:15,145 --> 00:16:20,149
about having been discovered so these would have been classified as negative for

180
00:16:20,149 --> 00:16:25,909
Rhino virus. so

181
00:16:25,909 --> 00:16:31,209
I was interested also in this idea at Ace and somatic specimens whether. if it possible

182
00:16:31,209 --> 00:16:36,389
that certain Gina Tice maybe more less likely to be a symptomatic person versus

183
00:16:36,389 --> 00:16:41,649
others and Mark here with these dot. the distribution of the AC bad

184
00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:47,269
patterns throughout this another tree and we're pretty well

185
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:52,309
distributed throughout. there's a_lot_of these that are a systematic. you proportionately.

186
00:16:52,309 --> 00:16:59,989
but in general we see a systematic infections at all.

187
00:16:59,989 --> 00:17:05,029
so in meetings a_lot_of children like I mentioned forty one percent

188
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:11,889
of the systematic enrollment. how to write a virus.

189
00:17:11,889 --> 00:17:18,565
overall it was pretty evenly distributed between the different species

190
00:17:18,565 --> 00:17:23,725
we look ever hae mentioned if the PCR was positive we continue to test the child from

191
00:17:23,725 --> 00:17:28,785
year to year. if you look to see look at

192
00:17:28,785 --> 00:17:34,125
those the results of those logs as we test the a Cincinnati child from week to week. the child continues

193
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:39,425
on with no symptoms. but. sixty four percent of them are bad out_of working with an a few sample

194
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:44,425
size. hi Brian ever again. a week later so the continue to be positive for that

195
00:17:44,425 --> 00:17:49,445
same virus. even though we continue to it noxious and then and then they had run over. again it's

196
00:17:49,445 --> 00:17:55,165
day eighteen and nineteen three of them did. and so

197
00:17:55,165 --> 00:18:00,205
we just saw these patterns that were screwed up. you saw him initially about a case and I'll show you

198
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:05,405
that data from the of the kids with active illness. hi this is Byron

199
00:18:05,405 --> 00:18:10,665
Castillo. often referred to as a mild. very shortly. cell with the virus.

200
00:18:10,665 --> 00:18:17,857
it's not something you would expect to see have this kind of persistent

201
00:18:17,857 --> 00:18:22,997
when you just break downs that I precursor the viruses by the different unit types

202
00:18:22,997 --> 00:18:28,237
throughout the throughout the daycare Center. you can see this is actually

203
00:18:28,237 --> 00:18:33,437
this is very what we call kind of had her tropic or header genius

204
00:18:33,437 --> 00:18:39,137
distribution of viruses throughout the picture. so we have all

205
00:18:39,137 --> 00:18:44,517
the different strains and somebody asked races kind of one strain.

206
00:18:44,517 --> 00:18:49,617
they don't really have a matching French and a group together. if you see overtime. you

207
00:18:49,617 --> 00:18:54,757
have this is why diverse mix of viruses that every curve that we that I kind of showed you

208
00:18:54,757 --> 00:19:00,137
in that very first picture is actually made up. many many many many smaller

209
00:19:00,137 --> 00:19:05,497
unit. this is Mark. not one since this is James or something circulating around for the most part.

210
00:19:05,497 --> 00:19:10,597
listen into this entire thing inside that service engine a constant

211
00:19:10,597 --> 00:19:16,395
circulation pattern. we had an epidemic strain here that I'm calling you six

212
00:19:16,395 --> 00:19:21,395
rest throughout the day care so this is this is your Bob Harvey this is a's this is Vision

213
00:19:21,395 --> 00:19:26,775
Medical the identical strain. identified in multiple children throughout the day. so slightly

214
00:19:26,775 --> 00:19:32,315
high. many of the damage in that inside of this is really very little mix

215
00:19:32,315 --> 00:19:37,655
of infection. so we this is being mapped that

216
00:19:37,655 --> 00:19:43,155
strain that they use extremely mapped it by classroom so these are maps of the you

217
00:19:43,155 --> 00:19:48,415
take care this is Keith Sanders. this is a graph of a beverage form.

218
00:19:48,415 --> 00:19:53,533
if you hey so black line connected to space color. those

219
00:19:53,533 --> 00:19:58,807
are all one hundred percent it's Lisa Miller. I need you follow this is the right time

220
00:19:58,807 --> 00:20:04,407
this is from January twelfth to February twenty fourth over this one period of time. you can see

221
00:20:04,407 --> 00:20:09,827
infections get entered used in the classroom. kinda spread out these individual

222
00:20:09,827 --> 00:20:14,907
classrooms in over time. more and more classrooms are infected.

223
00:20:14,907 --> 00:20:20,167
as you go through and so he would expect that because this is shoes Child Care Center is located

224
00:20:20,167 --> 00:20:25,807
at one community if you have siblings in different classrooms. you're gonna happen or making your people from just different classroom.

225
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:31,007
you can sort of see this fire spread throughout. but temporarily

226
00:20:31,007 --> 00:20:36,187
that's kinda of Minneapolis make is happening in the context of all of this other run of

227
00:20:36,187 --> 00:20:41,467
circulation. please pray line. point two viruses that are related

228
00:20:41,467 --> 00:20:46,847
to their still right a virus. related to the academic strain. you got all the circulation.

229
00:20:46,847 --> 00:20:53,138
also unrelated prior virus entire

230
00:20:53,138 --> 00:20:58,378
this is big. anything that happens whenever you have a new clear new series

231
00:20:58,378 --> 00:21:03,378
of virus discovered one of the big question is it. now established establish the law to write a

232
00:21:03,378 --> 00:21:08,738
very see the child care. what. but this is Rent a Mercy

233
00:21:08,738 --> 00:21:14,038
clinically any different from these other viruses. so we know that genetically form to Sunset Group

234
00:21:14,038 --> 00:21:19,178
but this is me. matter at all. for the patients and stuff. we

235
00:21:19,178 --> 00:21:24,338
found no difference between the right virus. when you compare and advise Andy

236
00:21:24,338 --> 00:21:29,518
to run it by receipt. the only the only significant as fast. I think that

237
00:21:29,518 --> 00:21:34,758
is that children is running a very see had decreased activity compared in BBC

238
00:21:34,758 --> 00:21:40,098
CHS in an awful lot of questions here and so I think you said

239
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:45,198
in terms of these instructions don't process it. really pop

240
00:21:45,198 --> 00:21:50,658
somebody to seek medical care and the mild community based infection that I never received

241
00:21:50,658 --> 00:21:56,224
very similar to the other types of runners. when you before but something I wanted to point out

242
00:21:56,224 --> 00:22:01,404
is always is argument the right of virus. is not a big deal it doesn't have an impact.

243
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:06,824
you know why should we look anti- Burrows or vaccines around us but I wanted to know

244
00:22:06,824 --> 00:22:11,964
that across all the types that were average one day of Ms. Child Care and one day

245
00:22:11,964 --> 00:22:17,064
of missed work for each bridal buyers inspection for all of the day for day

246
00:22:17,064 --> 00:22:22,104
run of birthday with the and. regardless is strange. on average is the run

247
00:22:22,104 --> 00:22:27,504
over some section kids gonna miss Wendy daycare which means that Karen is gonna have one unexpected

248
00:22:27,504 --> 00:22:33,184
on it now. in and out today home from work and so there is

249
00:22:33,184 --> 00:22:38,204
despite his reputation is being a mild virus. the other is pretty financial

250
00:22:38,204 --> 00:22:43,384
productivity loss especially if you consider somebody's children had three four five

251
00:22:43,384 --> 00:22:48,544
or in a virus infections in a single year. so much have a little bit more

252
00:22:48,544 --> 00:22:53,824
about this idea of generation what you have a renters inspection. how long

253
00:22:53,824 --> 00:22:59,176
you have how long does that continue for. so if you just

254
00:22:59,176 --> 00:23:05,576
you a text yes or no to somebody has run a virus without looking at the specific Regina for their virus.

255
00:23:05,576 --> 00:23:10,616
we found in median days of infection was ranging from about eight days to

256
00:23:10,616 --> 00:23:15,756
eleven days and these are separated by whether other viruses were detected during that illness.

257
00:23:15,756 --> 00:23:20,836
so we can kinda brief you that for Missus Segal Marcella's and most buyers on

258
00:23:20,836 --> 00:23:25,896
it. but the thing to note that the that the meeting was about eight to eleven

259
00:23:25,896 --> 00:23:31,056
days. somebody was having Rhino virus infections detected over a period of time. which

260
00:23:31,056 --> 00:23:38,696
said yes that once you get infected perhaps a virus can hang around for a little while.

261
00:23:38,696 --> 00:23:44,016
multiple sequence of rejections of the right of ours was. we're founded in about twenty eight percent

262
00:23:44,016 --> 00:23:49,456
of the run of virus. so message. the two hundred twenty three. about a third

263
00:23:49,456 --> 00:23:54,916
of people had run a virus detected continuously over time for for multiple

264
00:23:54,916 --> 00:24:00,280
slots and there are two ways to think of it. one. one is is is it possible

265
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:05,740
to run a very. in fact people for much longer than we originally buy.

266
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:10,800
the second computing series is. is it possible that these kids are getting

267
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:16,340
infected with right of ours to testing them at day zero of their study visit.

268
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:21,480
you could have him run a virus he test him again in a day seven there part of the for run a virus. but

269
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:26,480
it's a different rhino virus. they have cleared the first infection and become infected with a second

270
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,700
infection before you got to them with the second slot. and this is spirit. I like to call the I love

271
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:36,860
Lucy. period right over where you just pass this person's been in wrap

272
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:42,140
with the exception of such type. constantly coming down the part and the kid is getting

273
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:47,620
infected and clearing the individual viruses as fast as they can.

274
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:52,780
so what I'm gonna tell you is if the answer is both

275
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:58,060
of us is really a good enough genetic dated actually I asked that question they were evenly split

276
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:03,448
between case you had some persistent kids that had transient and sequential

277
00:25:03,448 --> 00:25:08,448
infection. and when kids a heads up. each of these little

278
00:25:08,448 --> 00:25:13,648
mini plots here are four different kids. follow over time. January

279
00:25:13,648 --> 00:25:18,708
first two thousand nine. and as you can see we have some some places kids here

280
00:25:18,708 --> 00:25:25,508
before three. I suspect that was a home break type of there

281
00:25:25,508 --> 00:25:30,668
and we have this kid that had two weeks apart had a twelve to head to twice. two five two twenty

282
00:25:30,668 --> 00:25:35,848
thirty one at eight. I'll talk to you twice. two twenty ninety at eight seventy eight. take

283
00:25:35,848 --> 00:25:40,868
multiple times and then head in a sixty five detected. so they had one

284
00:25:40,868 --> 00:25:46,028
hundred percent identical virus detected throughout three weeks of their illness and the nine week for

285
00:25:46,028 --> 00:25:51,068
a little less stable genetically different rhino virus detected

286
00:25:51,068 --> 00:25:57,060
and then some kids had more of this. hopefully bye. so

287
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:02,180
this is fifteen right me back. I just pointed out before

288
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:07,520
this green boxes are are on site or we're sending a new system.

289
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:12,700
they become symptomatic at this point. and as you can see this two fifteen has

290
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:17,800
got one list this is one oh five they have a second illness with the old rhino

291
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:22,800
virus showing up and then they have a new rhino virus before the surgery so better. and if you sixty

292
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:27,900
five has two different run of our species. I'm with season.

293
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:36,636
we seven children that had these patterns of these kinda plans you. once again is eight seven

294
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:41,656
so it's not a huge step of children but what we were able to

295
00:26:41,656 --> 00:26:46,856
see by looking at the genetic the genetics of the different of our stable. using

296
00:26:46,856 --> 00:26:52,216
fairly straight forward sequencing technology. we're able to see that that

297
00:26:52,216 --> 00:26:57,336
Brian over at the genealogy in the child care consisted of a header to fix Coles circulation

298
00:26:57,336 --> 00:27:03,176
and many many Gina today and he but there was also a message with a Missus periodic spread

299
00:27:03,176 --> 00:27:08,576
of these occasional academic year. then we also found

300
00:27:08,576 --> 00:27:13,576
that multiple run overseas has in the course

301
00:27:13,576 --> 00:27:18,616
of a single respiratory illness. this is your doing a rest reverse if you give me a allergy study and you're not

302
00:27:18,616 --> 00:27:23,676
just finding to Jean a text of your writer buyers record here that somebody was consistently

303
00:27:23,676 --> 00:27:28,696
positive and persistent from week to week. when in actuality those of you infections that

304
00:27:28,696 --> 00:27:34,117
are happening over and over. so something to be mindful of bye

305
00:27:34,117 --> 00:27:39,177
alright. I'm gonna switch tracks a little bit. okay. about

306
00:27:39,177 --> 00:27:44,217
what happened in two thousand fourteen. how we can use the same idea of looking at

307
00:27:44,217 --> 00:27:49,477
the news on sequence creation you take specific information to add more clarity

308
00:27:49,477 --> 00:27:56,197
to what we know about the two thousand fourteen upgrade. so by way of introduction.

309
00:27:56,197 --> 00:28:01,517
I'm gonna be focusing on. I have a virus D sixty eight and are very used to be right

310
00:28:01,517 --> 00:28:06,657
over eighty seven. before the re classification happened. my my

311
00:28:06,657 --> 00:28:11,677
previous manager from Seattle will say the only time right over that ever did anything interesting with

312
00:28:11,677 --> 00:28:16,757
after that we need to do that. and enter of viruses. so you can actually

313
00:28:16,757 --> 00:28:21,817
severe if you know you have_to be careful with all the literature about an urgent virus. and

314
00:28:21,817 --> 00:28:26,937
I'm running an. eighty seven has been known for a_while to report to the outbreak to

315
00:28:26,937 --> 00:28:32,577
bring a virus he said. but if you don't know the history of the tax you would miss that.

316
00:28:32,577 --> 00:28:37,895
so this is the in in the late summer and fall

317
00:28:37,895 --> 00:28:43,695
of two thousand and fourteen. I don't know if you to see was identified first again.

318
00:28:43,695 --> 00:28:49,155
I was also when you touching clusters. will people were calling. Rino enter a virus.

319
00:28:49,155 --> 00:28:54,735
just kind of up before it was kind of determined by sequence what it was.

320
00:28:54,735 --> 00:28:59,735
said they were the rhino enter of virus and clusters of the outbreak. it appeared to be linked with your

321
00:28:59,735 --> 00:29:05,135
current paralysis zero two five to my later. there were also

322
00:29:05,135 --> 00:29:10,595
in sections that were linked with as make the activation of your weaving hospitalization.

323
00:29:10,595 --> 00:29:15,775
children but I'll add more clarity to that in a moment. I'm here in the corner

324
00:29:15,775 --> 00:29:21,055
I've got the CDC is on most of today report on what ASM

325
00:29:21,055 --> 00:29:26,175
surveillance looks like in the United_States. and if you see from August to February right

326
00:29:26,175 --> 00:29:31,441
here. there's this big peak. as a and that

327
00:29:31,441 --> 00:29:36,561
marking out with that kind of behind status and he's control studies. it does appear

328
00:29:36,561 --> 00:29:41,881
that this is linked to infection with DVD sixty eight. this is James Wise

329
00:29:41,881 --> 00:29:46,981
is Susie with the development of family. but as you can

330
00:29:46,981 --> 00:29:52,061
see there's a second grade here. June October two thousand and sixteen.

331
00:29:52,061 --> 00:29:57,601
there is no DVD sixty eight detector during that time. so there is it's likely

332
00:29:57,601 --> 00:30:02,761
that part of that is Lynch DVD sixty eight.

333
00:30:02,761 --> 00:30:07,841
also in sensible is a mild infection. this is very widespread infection

334
00:30:07,841 --> 00:30:12,921
in the country. it's really hard to distinguish how much

335
00:30:12,921 --> 00:30:18,781
was really treatable. to repeat eight sixty eight. so if this is something that we were interested

336
00:30:18,781 --> 00:30:24,181
in both. not so much that because it's a rare event it's hard to study

337
00:30:24,181 --> 00:30:29,403
in the local area. because we did see the same rise

338
00:30:29,403 --> 00:30:34,543
I'm in Rino and her virus case is in the local area that same time is what we wanted

339
00:30:34,543 --> 00:30:39,843
to see what the relationship was with that. so something I wanna notice it because

340
00:30:39,843 --> 00:30:44,923
and you can kind of understand now if interested in the history of our clinical diagnostic test

341
00:30:44,923 --> 00:30:50,443
have the one that you use that you've done them and a_lot_of other places have a pass.

342
00:30:50,443 --> 00:30:55,523
I tested for Rhino Rhino slash Centro and it basically covers the whole

343
00:30:55,523 --> 00:31:00,543
bucket. so pick the brain of ours. also take the DVD sixty eight and it doesn't tell you

344
00:31:00,543 --> 00:31:05,543
which one it is. super brown July August. I

345
00:31:05,543 --> 00:31:10,863
was calling this is we're getting reports from the colleagues in other parts of the country saying we had to send her a virus

346
00:31:10,863 --> 00:31:15,903
D sixty eight outbreak. it's causing a_lot_of hospitalization. if your problems in

347
00:31:15,903 --> 00:31:21,003
our region. people are looking at this rhino enter results and things let's probably enter of Iris

348
00:31:21,003 --> 00:31:27,073
because everyone else is having an outbreak. looks like here in Ann_Arbor we are also having an outbreak

349
00:31:27,073 --> 00:31:32,093
this is an investigation I've been collaborating with the people at the Medical School.

350
00:31:32,093 --> 00:31:37,093
I'm a smart person sent here still use genetic message to piece together what actually

351
00:31:37,093 --> 00:31:44,013
happening in our area. so we do see a thanks. bye. I was writing a letter of instructions clinically.

352
00:31:44,013 --> 00:31:49,473
this Charter said you minute I just want to mention this is clinical lab data from you in the hospital.

353
00:31:49,473 --> 00:31:54,853
this includes the clinics and hospitalization.

354
00:31:54,853 --> 00:31:59,853
in the local area there was also a_lot_of just sort of press and hold other about there being

355
00:31:59,853 --> 00:32:05,073
an EDD sixty eight. alright this is a picture for my daughter school. the CDC is five

356
00:32:05,073 --> 00:32:10,113
three about how to avoid the spread of enter virus D sixty eight in your home. there

357
00:32:10,113 --> 00:32:15,333
were article that I'm live my favorite new sort about DVD sixty eight

358
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:20,993
spreading to the community. not as good as with the allergist. you can reach us and if you really find this out.

359
00:32:20,993 --> 00:32:26,413
most of michigan's confirmed DVD sixty eight cases has lead the hospitalization. according

360
00:32:26,413 --> 00:32:31,619
to the NBC H hi this is CDC was expecting five to ten.

361
00:32:31,619 --> 00:32:36,639
test for confirming to re testing the baby CCH. part one month period. so

362
00:32:36,639 --> 00:32:43,899
I can tell you this is surveillance probably focused on people that were being. bye.

363
00:32:43,899 --> 00:32:49,359
what happened when we actually use those like a Conservatory message. all of the assessments.

364
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:54,479
not just those that are highlighted for being sent to the CDC. so we had access to two

365
00:32:54,479 --> 00:32:59,619
hundred fourteen right now and enter a clinical questions from you is hospital and these are all people

366
00:32:59,619 --> 00:33:04,639
that were hospitalized. this includes a hundred and one children. and then we also got

367
00:33:04,639 --> 00:33:09,897
access to a hundred and eighteen children fourteen forty two adults from the highest cohort.

368
00:33:09,897 --> 00:33:15,777
this is the perspective household covert study run out. you will then

369
00:33:15,777 --> 00:33:20,857
have surveillance going throughout the same time here is doing after surveillance of respiratory

370
00:33:20,857 --> 00:33:26,157
illness. and this is testing people don't necessarily seek medical care. testing people who

371
00:33:26,157 --> 00:33:31,217
need a case definition for two restroom. the sort of two different populations to come have

372
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:36,217
a question the topic people who had done the severe enough to go see medical care. ultimately be

373
00:33:36,217 --> 00:33:41,277
hospitalized. this is the second group as people who are

374
00:33:41,277 --> 00:33:46,617
actively finding out when they happen to going out and testing them and with this

375
00:33:46,617 --> 00:33:51,617
these samples. we did sequencing. I repeat two four which is now kind of the gold

376
00:33:51,617 --> 00:33:56,777
standard region for genetically typing the viruses. this is Sydney who's I love you a_lot_of

377
00:33:56,777 --> 00:34:02,097
the sequencing data that I wanna show you the results. including during the power outage is due like

378
00:34:02,097 --> 00:34:08,150
physically hold all those machine together to be connected to all of the generator plug

379
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:13,250
it was very I rode her. so

380
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:18,530
if we looked at the hospital I specimen. what we would expect to see from this graphics

381
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:23,570
we truly had a DVD sixty eight. bring happening in Ann_Arbor that corresponded with the rest of the country

382
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:28,630
we would expect to see a_lot_of DVD sixty eight during the at the at. hey this

383
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:33,710
is. the role that write a note in

384
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:38,830
a row. kinda basic result. we did have an epidemic or something happening.

385
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:43,990
it was run out and around. I don't know the virus only accounted for twelve

386
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:49,430
percent of the infections in the Children's Health Center the infections in the dark green barges

387
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:55,190
the EDD sixty eight results. everything else is confirmed is being. just

388
00:34:55,190 --> 00:35:00,270
just run a virus and so we had and this is sort of where I came up with his idea

389
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:05,270
of the sheep in the walls clothing because of this. this is basic test

390
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:10,720
that covers both renters and enter of virus. that you know in the Ann_Arbor area.

391
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:16,060
this job has been that we had an EDD sixty eight outbreak. here

392
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:21,080
is well and that was responsible for all of that the hospitalization that we saw around that

393
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:26,100
time. but as you can see. we had actually very little DVD sixty eight. quite a

394
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:31,140
bit of run over maybe and see. this is what I thought seem to find really remarkable

395
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:36,280
is that the yellow barbecue this Hobart. that's right of my receipt. so that's a virus

396
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:42,340
I had to study been done ten years ago. we would not have known that it exist.

397
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:47,480
what I think this also. so demonstrate the fact that Brian Harris can't

398
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:52,620
put somebody in the hospital. I can't High Community level of

399
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:57,640
disease into. they called people to be of concern he put flyers up

400
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:02,720
in schools and do all that because there were there was this is Cecil Manis of your disease going on at

401
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:07,800
that time. just wasn't hard by this rain. I can't think kind of noted by

402
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:13,158
the public so we will get the samples

403
00:36:13,158 --> 00:36:18,378
from hi this is literally off the process. I was working on this last night.

404
00:36:18,378 --> 00:36:23,678
I was working on the stuff in the next day and. Doctors

405
00:36:23,678 --> 00:36:29,238
Data. just with this together and I just need to get a chance. thanks. see

406
00:36:29,238 --> 00:36:35,318
you sixty eight results. if you look at the community study.

407
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:40,578
this is his two black boxes one. each one is in sort of. so I

408
00:36:40,578 --> 00:36:45,878
talked to number these weeks. bye. and this week of respiratory season in the fall and

409
00:36:45,878 --> 00:36:50,878
in season week sizes in week six. we have one each of the rest of the enter of

410
00:36:50,878 --> 00:36:55,998
virus. old the rest of it with Rhino virus. different run of our

411
00:36:55,998 --> 00:37:01,718
species that we're not the enter virus three sixty eight and you can see there's also a pretty substantial

412
00:37:01,718 --> 00:37:07,198
amount of rent of our seat in the gray bars here. when you go when you actually

413
00:37:07,198 --> 00:37:12,212
do the Geno type thing. to speak with that region and find out what's in there you

414
00:37:12,212 --> 00:37:17,412
see Blake. just this whole free. you know the time. so each

415
00:37:17,412 --> 00:37:23,612
color represents a different GHI. I was running about

416
00:37:23,612 --> 00:37:28,892
way to get finally to get to the visit. the typical

417
00:37:28,892 --> 00:37:34,172
way to do this type of to be able to match the genetic using results

418
00:37:34,172 --> 00:37:39,372
that we get our two groups that were originally defined by the Raleigh G. if you speak

419
00:37:39,372 --> 00:37:44,392
with this region and you going to a big national data base like an CVR Eastern Chesapeake

420
00:37:44,392 --> 00:37:49,672
with you see what comes up as the top. the height

421
00:37:49,672 --> 00:37:54,672
match sequence. what we found is that this is happening now that we use the genetics

422
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:59,772
to the fine right virus is happening and changing so quickly around

423
00:37:59,772 --> 00:38:04,952
the world. offers are really tight. I have results that are popping up in stream.

424
00:38:04,952 --> 00:38:10,814
things don't make a whole lot of sense. so in order to get this like we actually ended up doing this

425
00:38:10,814 --> 00:38:16,374
we found sources that has a link to Sarah love you Regional. Sarah tight.

426
00:38:16,374 --> 00:38:22,114
base on the anti-. there a reference viruses to genetic.

427
00:38:22,114 --> 00:38:27,234
kind of examples of each of those types. and then we meet ourselves a new reference data base. just try

428
00:38:27,234 --> 00:38:32,414
to make that linkage is pure as possible. that's with these numbers come from. so what we've done is been able to kind

429
00:38:32,414 --> 00:38:37,594
of genetically re create what we expect we would've seen from the original zero

430
00:38:37,594 --> 00:38:42,694
logic. and if you look to see all of these

431
00:38:42,694 --> 00:38:47,714
different factors throughout. there are some common Alley if you get take

432
00:38:47,714 --> 00:38:52,834
colors the third show up more often than others. we have more work to do on this.

433
00:38:52,834 --> 00:38:58,714
two zero. our kind. there will be some extremes that are more common than others. but

434
00:38:58,714 --> 00:39:03,934
as a whole. during this one week period. there's an incredible amount of

435
00:39:03,934 --> 00:39:08,974
genetic diversity and renovation just circulating right in the Ann_Arbor area.

436
00:39:08,974 --> 00:39:14,266
I think it's pretty did in never

437
00:39:14,266 --> 00:39:19,386
have a DVD sixty eight. well we had Sam. I still

438
00:39:19,386 --> 00:39:24,406
called in saying that we did not have the type that you needed to see a break that was in another

439
00:39:24,406 --> 00:39:29,466
area in the country and in widely reported there. I don't think and I don't think it was to

440
00:39:29,466 --> 00:39:34,686
the degree where it parallels kind of other

441
00:39:34,686 --> 00:39:41,946
out breaks of Real Public Health. kind of concerned and in response

442
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:47,306
overall conclusion what I hope that I had communicated today that you can have a_lot_of

443
00:39:47,306 --> 00:39:52,466
running of errors closer to leaving in a single season. even with in a single classroom even a single

444
00:39:52,466 --> 00:39:57,546
community. you can even have money type of writing a very close or delay to

445
00:39:57,546 --> 00:40:02,726
get a single person. you have any if you had time to write a single missing a single

446
00:40:02,726 --> 00:40:08,326
child. individual would you text a friend of ours for rest to try

447
00:40:08,326 --> 00:40:13,526
and reverse care and the cost of your house breaks and so you got this. so I added

448
00:40:13,526 --> 00:40:18,926
having this very first frequency of the different

449
00:40:18,926 --> 00:40:26,166
types with the possibility of academics pride of an individual message inside of that

450
00:40:26,166 --> 00:40:31,666
and I still don't want people to forget that. just annual run of our situation.

451
00:40:31,666 --> 00:40:37,806
in the absence of the major outbreak of the single type for a single service of your presentation.

452
00:40:37,806 --> 00:40:42,806
you can still leave a significant illness lost productivity. Hospitalization lost word

453
00:40:42,806 --> 00:40:48,046
from parents miss child care from children so this is not a virus to be completely

454
00:40:48,046 --> 00:40:53,826
ignored it still has significant

455
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:58,886
and. just wanted to thank you for this Friday. I

456
00:40:58,886 --> 00:41:04,646
work with the numbers in here at Seattle Children's_Hospital. I'm Christine

457
00:41:04,646 --> 00:41:10,166
in that community with the Community Child Care DVD sixty eight.

458
00:41:10,166 --> 00:41:15,246
thank you. bye. team at University of Michigan has the lot of

459
00:41:15,246 --> 00:41:35,426
different collaboration. thank you to everybody who was involved.

460
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:58,525
thank you

461
00:41:58,525 --> 00:42:03,565
Tiffany how you had this is already. I

462
00:42:03,565 --> 00:42:08,685
can't figure anything out_of my head is been a_lot_of like animal models. to look at

463
00:42:08,685 --> 00:42:13,685
differences and different type of delivery. I don't know about

464
00:42:13,685 --> 00:42:18,945
civility but I know like clinically we can see your finances in an animal model

465
00:42:18,945 --> 00:42:24,285
between different types but it doesn't seem to like translate

466
00:42:24,285 --> 00:42:44,165
very cleanly in a population level human

467
00:42:44,165 --> 00:42:54,885
yeah this is Beth and interesting point.

468
00:42:54,885 --> 00:43:00,445
so when you can. when you look at coding resources. you holding Regency.

469
00:43:00,445 --> 00:43:06,905
I repeat two four. third of the newer sequencing message. does the Cody Regency. thanks.

470
00:43:06,905 --> 00:43:11,985
had cleaner Revolutionary messages. thank you. if you

471
00:43:11,985 --> 00:43:16,985
look at that and even if you look at Princeton. even if you look at cities. the two times he said he's the

472
00:43:16,985 --> 00:43:23,105
right versus their evening and take care of panels with Mister Aji message. you'll

473
00:43:23,105 --> 00:43:28,245
see this one strain like pops up inside. kinda because of that. but

474
00:43:28,245 --> 00:43:33,445
it's a different strain from Community Community or your dear. you have that pattern that happens

475
00:43:33,445 --> 00:43:38,625
but it's nobody's ever been able to identify that it's one specific Gina tight. it is

476
00:43:38,625 --> 00:43:43,685
consistently that one. you will also see that particular unit. also have kind

477
00:43:43,685 --> 00:43:48,893
of a sporadic in fact press. so what I would like to do it in that high because we got

478
00:43:48,893 --> 00:43:54,073
families that are in front of to be able to see and very kind with really

479
00:43:54,073 --> 00:43:59,113
great surveillance and really kinda fine skill whether that's you know because it could be

480
00:43:59,113 --> 00:44:04,793
just an next my problem. but nobody's ever identified specific unit.

481
00:44:04,793 --> 00:44:14,513
we did that we get back.

482
00:44:14,513 --> 00:44:19,633
so that you didn't hate to spread in the Child Care House history

483
00:44:19,633 --> 00:44:26,493
with Francis. I had about ninety three percent of all of the eight seventy.

484
00:44:26,493 --> 00:44:34,253
this is the title of every building in that region. we don't call anything. thanks. bye.

485
00:44:34,253 --> 00:44:53,449
I'm talk to you tomorrow. bye

486
00:44:53,449 --> 00:44:58,549
well I seen that. I just left it on my number in my class a couple weeks

487
00:44:58,549 --> 00:45:03,689
ago and I very much available to the full studies. menu which Charles. we need me to that

488
00:45:03,689 --> 00:45:08,809
that has shown very clearly that Rhino virus

489
00:45:08,809 --> 00:45:14,049
is transmitted by respiratory. if this is. it is just aerosol

490
00:45:14,049 --> 00:45:19,329
restoration information it's not Services or contact or anything that could be causing

491
00:45:19,329 --> 00:45:25,009
it to live longer in service. so if there was anything else that was sort of causing rest

492
00:45:25,009 --> 00:45:30,589
or run a very epidemic to kind of start and then and you would have_to do contact patterns.

493
00:45:30,589 --> 00:45:35,669
so I mean why does it always like this to me leave at the beginning of school and everybody

494
00:45:35,669 --> 00:45:40,909
comes back forever they were and brings her viruses into the siding and

495
00:45:40,909 --> 00:45:46,155
you know they've been allotted. I'm not sure why the curve that you can the birds are sold

496
00:45:46,155 --> 00:45:58,135
out but in the header to line which is strange.

497
00:45:58,135 --> 00:46:06,975
yeah.

498
00:46:06,975 --> 00:46:16,795
yeah.

499
00:46:16,795 --> 00:46:25,411
anyway right

500
00:46:25,411 --> 00:46:31,791
yeah hey Nathan this is Ben series about other what else is circulating whether competitive

501
00:46:31,791 --> 00:46:36,851
in unity. just checking on Brian number. that's looking. nobody's really been

502
00:46:36,851 --> 00:46:41,911
able to come up with the smoking time. in terms of that. but they said some of that idea too. maybe another

503
00:46:41,911 --> 00:46:48,891
buyer. a_lot_of.

504
00:46:48,891 --> 00:47:00,651
so

505
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:10,751
hope all is well.

506
00:47:10,751 --> 00:47:16,111
miss you. bye. bye. bye.

507
00:47:16,111 --> 00:47:24,330
yeah. yes

508
00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:34,630
Theresa it's about

509
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:47,570
three

510
00:47:47,570 --> 00:47:53,230
and we're

511
00:47:53,230 --> 00:48:02,590
leaving

512
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:09,070
right. [INAUDIBLE]

513
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:17,750
right now.

514
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:25,284
bye yeah. bye

515
00:48:25,284 --> 00:48:36,264
this is

516
00:48:36,264 --> 00:48:41,464
Susan. I feel like it. yeah. it's too far in the other direction

517
00:48:41,464 --> 00:48:47,464
because even working with this date I mean I very frequently come across type that I can't type.

518
00:48:47,464 --> 00:48:52,964
because again. so I'm over here ready to do a reference data base

519
00:48:52,964 --> 00:48:58,084
because we were finding some really funky results the maybe I can you just submit without and

520
00:48:58,084 --> 00:49:03,304
seven. so we need to overhear in a data base. but even when I find stuff I can't type

521
00:49:03,304 --> 00:49:08,504
in there like that. that's Trina calling you back which is just a this is the sixth and the file

522
00:49:08,504 --> 00:49:13,924
type that I found. we take that back to an CBI and we can't find

523
00:49:13,924 --> 00:49:19,404
a type of a close tomorrow. so it's more than the more you look the more you find we're gonna keep finding me sometime

524
00:49:19,404 --> 00:49:24,486
and like I would never think to take those like twenty samples.

525
00:49:24,486 --> 00:49:29,526
I have a new type of Rhino virus but it is genetically diversion from the other type that are

526
00:49:29,526 --> 00:49:34,526
at the reference site. so like we're gonna keep putting up with Force National like high

527
00:49:34,526 --> 00:49:39,646
winds like this it really makes sense to be for the tax and a group to be actually cure rating

528
00:49:39,646 --> 00:49:44,746
and numbering needs for much longer because it's gonna keep getting bigger. yes it

529
00:49:44,746 --> 00:49:49,766
kinda has_to come to the happy medium for the have_to make some larger class

530
00:49:49,766 --> 00:49:54,866
or they just people just to be happy with AB and C and saying is a really diverse

531
00:49:54,866 --> 00:50:02,946
buyer. you know

532
00:50:02,946 --> 00:50:20,206
I don't know the.

533
00:50:20,206 --> 00:50:25,424
yeah I think the this is different now though it's like

534
00:50:25,424 --> 00:50:30,464
we had to grow it in in looking. now we can you check if you can grow and we can

535
00:50:30,464 --> 00:50:35,644
to things that you can try to keep more so than we ever had before into the group today that. if you can even some job

536
00:50:35,644 --> 00:50:41,944
definition of where to go go because.

537
00:50:41,944 --> 00:50:47,024
yeah. bye. hey Kenny Corley this is Jonathan

538
00:50:47,024 --> 00:50:56,324
and if you don't have this is Joe Megan Myers. this is

539
00:50:56,324 --> 00:51:06,270
Leonard. yeah okay
