1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:24,780
Otherwise it I said I just felt like it was better to it's so gross.

2
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:38,570
And so it's like it's not like I don't know if it's 2 hours a week, you know,

3
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:52,090
it is a bit different because it it's you know it's not actually gonna work but you there and.

4
00:00:53,790 --> 00:01:01,660
You know, it's a good experience to having the spotlight come down to the people who have relatives.

5
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:34,940
You know, we. I was just wondering about some of the other people who don't see much of a future but are really parts are still matters here.

6
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,070
And I think that is is it worth it?

7
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:54,630
You know, I think that, you know.

8
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,830
So how does this I presume you have let them have more time to?

9
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:11,880
I guess I don't really think about it or want to try to get some help.

10
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,850
I think we're going to take some time.

11
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:42,840
So I just ask you, you have it laid out like a bit of an easier manner to use your imagination for this.

12
00:02:43,320 --> 00:03:06,880
So it looks like this will never be I don't care if you like, you know, I mean, I guess it was like I was like, yeah, I left out of the picture.

13
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:15,270
And if nobody else looks like, you know, everybody is here.

14
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:20,340
Yeah. Awesome. Thank you so much for coming in today in person.

15
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,950
There will be a lecture on childhood immunization. A guest lecture will be approved.

16
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:30,030
Wagner. Dr. Wagner is a research assistant professor in the School of Public Health.

17
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,290
Also the track leader for global epidemiology. Yeah.

18
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:42,600
Yep. So most of you, a lot of you would have interacted with Dr. Wagner and Dr. Watkins a lot of work on immunizations,

19
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,880
childhood immunization and HPV vaccination.

20
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:54,959
Yeah, well, thanks for reminding me. Happy to give you a bit of an overview of vaccine and hopefully tell you something that you have learned before.

21
00:03:54,960 --> 00:04:00,150
And then towards the end of class we will do I'll break up into small groups to kind of

22
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:06,330
go in-depth into some of the vaccine issues which are specific to different countries.

23
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,990
Okay. So we're going to be talking about immunizations today.

24
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:16,030
The other kind of acronym that I'll be throwing out a lot and you may or may not have heard about it in this class or other things,

25
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,420
is the expanded program on immunization or IV.

26
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,970
And this basically refers to the routine doses which are recommended in a specific country.

27
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,209
And so there will be different examples that I'll give later on.

28
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:37,510
But I'm here in the U.S. just because we have such a different system of financing for for public health and for vaccines and health care in general.

29
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:45,100
We don't really have we don't really talk about FPI here in the U.S. so much as just like routine immunizations.

30
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:50,670
But when you talk about vaccination programs in any other country, you hear the surgeon general or.

31
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:57,069
Okay. So I want to start at the beginning of vaccines.

32
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:03,570
And what I like about thinking about the history of vaccines is that this really is a global issue.

33
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:09,070
So vaccines is all about dissemination of knowledge and practices across different regions of the world.

34
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:17,230
So how this started is that people, I'm sure throughout history and location,

35
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:28,300
had realized that if you got one disease, you were less likely to get a similar disease in the future.

36
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:31,720
And, you know, this was millennia prior to germ theory.

37
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,100
So I don't think, you know, this articulated well what viruses or bacteria or whatever works.

38
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:45,700
But I think overall the concept is that, you know, if you got something which now we might recognize as influenza,

39
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:53,140
that means if an outbreak happened a few months later, you were less likely to get that yourself.

40
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:58,900
So, you know, they wouldn't have called it immunity, but this idea of immunity was understandable.

41
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:04,989
And around this time, maybe you're thinking about like a thousand or 1500 years ago,

42
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:09,760
one of the biggest scourges that people were dealing with was smallpox.

43
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:19,899
And again, it was recognized that if you did survive from smallpox, which was not a given, it was probably over 30% mortality after smallpox.

44
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:26,770
But if you did survive, you were less likely to come down with smallpox in the future if there was an outbreak.

45
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:39,339
So it's unsure where this started, but at least some place in South Asia or East Asia had this idea that if you took pus

46
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:45,760
from somebody who was recovering from smallpox and if you inoculated somebody else,

47
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,950
then that sort of counted as giving them immunity and they were less likely to get smallpox in the future.

48
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:57,999
So it could be that this person would revert to getting a full blown case of smallpox.

49
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:05,200
But more often than not, they would have just like a very mild or very vocal infection, and then they themselves would be protected.

50
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:14,140
So they literally would have to get somebody who is recently recovering, I guess, recognized by this indicator, by this person.

51
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:27,490
And they would take like. A sample of their tissue, which was around smallpox, was all about like rashes and pustules and pox.

52
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:35,080
So take a scraping of that and then you could like dry it even or there's different ways of administering it.

53
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:43,100
You could try to like put it in a cut on somebody's arm or you could drive and have them slip or insulate it.

54
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,250
So there are different ways of doing this.

55
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:53,110
But anyway, this is spread through Asia, it's spread through the Middle East, and then we end up in the 1700s.

56
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:59,600
Um, where there was this remarkable woman, Lady Mary Montagu.

57
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:02,760
She was a well-known debutante in her day.

58
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:08,770
The was widely known for being this world traveler.

59
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:14,390
She would travel around the Middle East and write letters back home, which were widely shared and publicized.

60
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:21,570
She was a well-known figure, and she ended up marrying the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire.

61
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:34,230
And so she was very well known at the court of the Ottoman Empire, and she saw that other women in that area,

62
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:40,740
they would be inoculating their kids against smallpox using the methods that I was talking about.

63
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,770
So she herself had a brother who died of smallpox, which again was not unusual in this age, probably.

64
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:58,590
You know, most families had a child who had died of smallpox, and she herself was known for being a beauty,

65
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:03,600
not to be like super sexist and misogynistic and just thinking of her her looks.

66
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:11,969
But again, she looks very beautiful. And she herself came down with smallpox and later on was like very scarred.

67
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:20,250
And that was something that she really noticed about herself, is that she just wasn't looking the same as is prior to having smallpox.

68
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:28,559
So she was very interested in a way to protect her child against smallpox.

69
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,120
So she she did get her child inoculated against smallpox.

70
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:42,780
And then when she returned to the United Kingdom later on, she popularized this method of inoculation in the United.

71
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:49,050
And that also quickly spread into the colonies as well.

72
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:59,550
But the thing is, like from the get go, there was this reaction against this, that this early vaccination is an occupation.

73
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,139
There is a religious objection that, you know, the will of God.

74
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:09,720
There were these concerns that, you know, it wasn't safe like you could you know,

75
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:16,650
there were chances of actually giving your child like a full blown case of disease, which obviously would be really harmful for them.

76
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:23,420
But one person who was on the pro smallpox inoculation side was Scott Mather.

77
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:27,469
He was sort of a polymath of the day. He was a judge.

78
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:31,010
He was a clergyman.

79
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:41,210
He was an intellectual. So he wrote all these pamphlets, basically promoting the use of smallpox inoculation through the American colonies.

80
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:47,450
And if you remember anything from your high school English literature class,

81
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:53,299
I think he shows up in The Crucible because he is one of the main judges of the Salem Witch Trials.

82
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:57,830
So, you know, not exactly like a pure hearted, amazing person in all facets of his life.

83
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:02,910
But you popularize vaccination. Oh.

84
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:08,900
So the switch in our mind that we get is, is, is like the first vaccine,

85
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:15,800
because before this we were taking like an inoculated inoculum of smallpox and transferring that to another person.

86
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:22,100
So around this time, people also are realizing that if you were a milkmaid, you were less likely to get smallpox.

87
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:26,000
And again, this is before germ theory, before people in her viruses or immunity was.

88
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:31,700
But I think people got this idea that like cowpox protected you against smallpox.

89
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:39,440
So, you know, there's lots of pox. You know, there's monkey pox, as we've seen this past year.

90
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:46,310
But there's all sorts of expenses which sort of are limited to a certain species range.

91
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:56,299
And one of these is cowpox, which would not kill cows, but was was certainly a disease that could get it was not a series smallpox.

92
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:04,700
And sometimes it would transfer over into humans. But again, for the humans who got it mostly milkmaids, it was not a serious disease.

93
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:09,989
And so that's also one thing where you hear a lot of literature about milkmaids being really beautiful,

94
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:13,430
and that's just because they were much less likely to be scarred from smallpox.

95
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,269
So what Edward Jenner did is he was this real position.

96
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:29,180
He was kind of making these connections. And he thought, what if we could take a scraping of cowpox and then inject that into a human being?

97
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,650
Because in this way, maybe we could protect them in the future against smallpox.

98
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:37,610
But there wouldn't be any of the downsides of the smallpox. Not people like having a full blown case of.

99
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:45,360
So you see, this is this is just a picture of him performing the first vaccination.

100
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,030
And that was his main son, James Phipps.

101
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:55,170
And I'll let you know from the get go, there's this misinformation campaign as people like, why didn't he vaccinate his own kids?

102
00:12:56,310 --> 00:13:00,090
And the reason was that they had already gotten the smallpox inoculation.

103
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:08,040
So there's really no reason to trial this new method on him. And, you know, whether there was full employment, I'm not really sure.

104
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,920
But apparently Edward Jenner and James Phipps remained in correspondence throughout their life.

105
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,340
I don't think this boy was scarred from this experience.

106
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:22,440
But, you know, not necessarily the most are thing because he did first give him this this inoculation of cowpox.

107
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:30,030
And then a few years, a few months later, he challenged him against like actual smallpox and he survived at up with any disease.

108
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:38,670
So that's that's how we ended up with this idea that this was a protective vaccination.

109
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:41,720
And, of course, now we have better methods of testing safety, effectiveness.

110
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:52,290
But, you know, our reason why we call vaccines vaccines actually comes from this event because vaccines comes from the Latin word for health.

111
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:58,860
So we don't use a lot of things based on cows now.

112
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:05,500
But since the first vaccine was from cowpox, we now just have to realize that to.

113
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:11,420
So terminology. So an inoculation is just a bit more general.

114
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:17,380
That's and then I referred to taking like a document of some infectious material.

115
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:21,200
Bring that to somebody else. Specifically, you could think of Variolation.

116
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,100
So smallpox is very well a major that's like a scientific name.

117
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:30,950
So Variolation just refers to that early process that people in Asia and Ottoman Empire were doing.

118
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:40,339
Vaccination. Immunization, pretty much, I think, are synonymous, but vaccination is more so referring to the event of like using a vaccine vial and

119
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:45,290
administering that immunization is sort of your body's response of having an immune response.

120
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:48,200
And ideally, if you are administered the vaccine, you do have an immune response.

121
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:54,229
And we might think of like injections or shots as synonymous with vaccination and immunization.

122
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:59,510
But of course there are benefits out there nowadays which are not requiring a shot.

123
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:07,100
So there are like oral polio vaccines, there are lists for influenza and there, you know, for rotavirus.

124
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:11,540
There are also some oral doses which you can get. And, you know, in the future there could be development.

125
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,750
There's these like microneedle patches which look like Band-Aids.

126
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:18,620
That also might be something which could be developed in the future to administer a vaccine.

127
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:24,720
We could think of like how we classify different vaccines.

128
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:34,170
So and this is where we've had so much movement in the past decade or two because predominantly in the past we were thinking of

129
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:41,160
this dichotomy between whether this was a live attenuated vaccine or whether it was inactivated or we sometimes call it kill it.

130
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:45,780
And so a live attenuated vaccine would be something kind of similar to that for smallpox or cowpox,

131
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:55,920
where the vaccine strain has been attenuated through repeated maybe thousands of generations of replication within a certain tissue.

132
00:15:56,340 --> 00:16:01,590
And ideally, over that period of time, it's lost its ability to cause severe disease, but it still can replicate.

133
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:06,420
So it's going to replicate in the host, but it's not going to cause any severe disease.

134
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:12,090
And inactivated killed the vaccine as a way for us to actually make it so there's no

135
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:17,549
replication like the bacteria is going to die before we put it in the vaccine strain.

136
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:21,780
I know we don't really talk about viruses as being alive, but we still say we be kill them through.

137
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:27,360
You know, it could be like through heat or through chemical inactivation or something like that.

138
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:35,310
And then we could either administer like the whole the whole virion or the whole bacteria, or we could kind of separate out some protein component.

139
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:49,040
And then more recently we've been thinking of vector vaccines where we might have like a plasmid from maybe like a cold virus or a yeast or something,

140
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,050
and then we'll put on,

141
00:16:52,040 --> 00:17:01,790
we'll recombine it so that there is going to be like part of a viral or bacterial genome product in it that can if that replicates in the host,

142
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:13,550
it might. It might displace some of the target bacteria or viral protein, which then your body can respond to.

143
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:19,870
Okay. So I think this is similar to a lot of what I was just saying.

144
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:25,750
But for one thing, that will save her life vaccine. We think that generally it's somewhat similar to a natural infection,

145
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:31,570
so it's probably more effective with fewer doses compared to other types of vaccines.

146
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:36,060
And we generally think it's like more long lasting immunity. And again, these are generalizations.

147
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:44,530
There could be vaccine specific differences, but in general, we think over time we've actually produced a pretty good immune response.

148
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,890
But there are some drawbacks. You know, potentially there is going to be more adverse events.

149
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,720
So it could be more reactogenicity reactogenicity just per person, like having these adverse events.

150
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:05,370
Another synonym of that would be tolerability, like how how well the human tolerates it in terms of how many adverse events that are,

151
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:12,929
there are cases where this could reverse disease. We see that maybe with something like an oral polio vaccine,

152
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:21,090
where there are some cases where somebody would be administered an oral polio vaccine and then an oral polio vaccine is a vaccine.

153
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:32,130
And instead of just causing a brief infection with no disease, it could revert to a full blown case of polio where somebody just become paralyzed.

154
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:39,300
So here in the United States, we don't use the oral polio vaccine for that reason, just out of concern that it could do that.

155
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:44,950
Another concern about liberty vaccines is there could be interference from circulating antibodies.

156
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:53,230
This could be due to like alerted so during the third trimester of pregnancy.

157
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:59,200
There is a transfer from the mother to the fetus.

158
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:10,169
Of course, there's all sorts of. Exchanges of like blood and nutrition and stuff.

159
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:16,980
And was one of those things in the third trimester is that the mother will pump a lot of antibodies into the Virgin.

160
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:28,080
So when the infant is born, it is protected against a wide range of infections based on what the mother's immune system has immunity to.

161
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:35,230
But that does mean that if you give somebody alive, if you give a kid a lot of attitude vaccine,

162
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:41,920
then what could happen is those maternal antibodies could kind of neutralize that vaccine strain and not allow it to.

163
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:47,729
Not allow it to replicate within the host. So that's great for it.

164
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:53,610
That's like a natural infection. But if it's a vaccine or we're trying to counter any response, it's not great.

165
00:19:54,420 --> 00:20:01,380
The other thing about live attenuated vaccines is you do need a lot of times you need a cold chain, so you need to keep it at a certain temperature.

166
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:06,540
That's cool. You need to be really protective and have like these refrigerators and stuff.

167
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:17,420
It can be kind of complicated. Don't. Of course, we've been hearing a lot about DNA and RNA vaccines because of the COVID 19 vaccine.

168
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:24,649
And again, this is just one of those recombinant vaccines or so there's a couple of different things we could think of.

169
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:26,540
So we could think of recombinant vector vaccines.

170
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:35,180
That's what I was talking about earlier, where we have like a vector like that that is pregnant and, you know, virus like a cold virus.

171
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:44,389
And then we could just click part of a genome or something else into it, and then we can disable it from really causing any sort of disease.

172
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:52,100
So it's going to cause a cold in you, but it'll still replicate a bit and it'll have that one gene that we want your body expansion to in response to.

173
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,590
But I want to interject. Okay.

174
00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:01,270
So inactivated vaccines are different from live vaccines because they cannot replicate.

175
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:07,600
So we don't get that interference from antibodies. We don't rely on immunity to replicate, to develop immune response.

176
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:17,890
But what we do bring activated vaccines is we'll often have to give multiple boosters over time, but we give an injection in your body.

177
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:20,620
Looks like a bit of a response. It's kind of like deal with that.

178
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:25,600
But you need to kind of have repeated doses given over time just so that your body has this

179
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:32,170
repeated exposure to the antigens because it won't replicate as much as a live vaccine.

180
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:36,460
And then often you might need to.

181
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:45,049
Like puts like an adjuvants in the vaccine strain as well that could be like aluminum or something like that.

182
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:51,640
Basically to cause more of a flare up, get more of your body immune response wants to respond to this one better.

183
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:58,030
But trade vaccines are kind of a type of inactivated vaccine.

184
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:04,830
So there's some that there's some bacteria out there which the way that they cause disease is they release these toxins.

185
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:08,979
So we could think of botulism, we could think of tetanus or even pertussis.

186
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:14,950
This is a bit. So they release these toxins and then that's what causes disease in your body.

187
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:21,489
So a toxoid is a type of vaccine where we actually aren't developing a vaccine against the bacteria.

188
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:25,479
So we're developing a vaccine against the toxin so that in the future,

189
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:30,940
if you get like a tetanus infection, like your body can deal with the tetanus bacteria.

190
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:38,320
It's just like the vaccine will deal with all the harmful effects of like the tetanus spitting out this toxin into.

191
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:45,560
So this DNA subunit or this could also be similar to an EV or any vaccine.

192
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:51,110
This is just where we take genetic material from the vaccine to target strain.

193
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:59,510
And then, you know, so for a COVID vaccine, we might be really interested in the gene coding for spike protein and then we

194
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:03,290
make that into a plasmid and then we inject that directly into an individual.

195
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:08,330
So then the idea is that some of the genetic material, the.

196
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:19,550
Will be uptake will be uptake by some of the host body cells and then it will be expressed on some of the host cell surfaces.

197
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:24,290
And then your immune response will be against the cancer.

198
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:31,250
So it was really interesting looking at the pace of COVID vaccine development because again,

199
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:36,290
20, 30 years ago there was a live vaccine or inactivated vaccine.

200
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:40,190
But with COVID vaccines, there's just like so much more.

201
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:45,080
There are so many more so much more diversity in terms of what vaccines are out there.

202
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:54,950
So this is just like early and I think the middle of 2020 when there were a lot of vaccines being developed and Krammer,

203
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:58,159
who's an immunologist out of Mount Sinai in New York City,

204
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:07,550
he was just telling up how many different types of vaccines that were listed in clinical clinicaltrials.gov.

205
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:11,900
So, you know, certainly there are some inactivated and some live vaccines,

206
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:17,750
but these are just like a minority of the vaccine candidates which were being tested.

207
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:22,520
So again, like 20 years ago, this is like what we would have had as vaccine technology.

208
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:29,810
But all of a sudden there's all these other different types of vaccines. You know, there's like the mini vaccines which come up with.

209
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:35,040
Come to licensure with like Pfizer and Moderna.

210
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,020
There are different types of recombinant vaccines.

211
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,519
So all sorts of different technologies which are based. Okay.

212
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,540
And this is just another way of looking at all of that.

213
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:55,550
So let's talk about the different vaccine development stages. We could think of preclinical studies, phase one, face to face three in phase four.

214
00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:05,620
And. Yeah. So phase one is a smaller amounts of individuals were just looking at healthy volunteers.

215
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:12,850
What is the safety of this? And we might like assess the immune response as sort of a surrogate endpoint.

216
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:15,190
We're not looking at whether somebody gets disease or not.

217
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:20,530
We're just looking at do they have what are their antibody titers like after giving them the vaccine?

218
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:26,090
And that's something like a couple of dozen people we could then think of studying.

219
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:33,980
If that passes, then we go to a phase two clinical trial where we would start randomizing people into getting a placebo or not,

220
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:39,780
or like the actual vaccine. And then we could look at measures of vaccine efficacy.

221
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:46,040
We're also looking at like immune response. And again, we're still very interested in the safety and the amount of side effects.

222
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:52,189
For Phase three. This is like the big studies where we're evaluating efficacy and safety.

223
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:57,950
And here we're probably having tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of people in our clinical trials.

224
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,680
And as epidemiology students,

225
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:09,469
I think you can kind of think about it logically because vaccine phase three clinical trials are some of the largest studies we have.

226
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:16,580
And the Salk trial, which was run out of here at the University of Michigan in the 1950s,

227
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:21,500
there were over a million children who were enrolled in that trial. So that was like a huge number of people.

228
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:28,850
And the reason why vaccine trials had to have so many people is because our endpoint is whether they get disease or not,

229
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,199
and we're trying to prevent that.

230
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:37,220
So we take a population, general population, people who are healthy and their risk of getting disease might be really low.

231
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:43,140
So we need to have enough statistical power to test, you know,

232
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:49,730
a small number of people getting disease in the placebo versus the actual vaccine group.

233
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:54,920
That's very different than, for instance, if you're testing a drug to.

234
00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:03,360
Three people who had a heart attack and maybe or maybe even looking at will this prevent a second heart attack?

235
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:11,400
Will this prevent death? There's going to be a high rate of people dying or people having a second heart attack after having a heart attack.

236
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:16,260
So in that kind of clinical trial, you probably don't need as many people as in a vaccine trial.

237
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:21,450
But it's almost like vaccine trials that are really expensive compared to a trial.

238
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:26,460
And what treatment for heart disease or something like that?

239
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:35,009
So, you know, these numbers a thousand plus is like really minimal, I think, for a clinical trial, for vaccines, for COVID.

240
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:38,820
We were thinking like 30, 40, 50,000 people enrolled in these trials.

241
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:44,140
Facebook just refers to you, like after there's been authorization of the vaccine,

242
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:48,010
let's continue to do surveillance of safety and long term infections.

243
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:57,460
So we have a number of different words that we can use. Efficacy refers to the output from an experimental study.

244
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:05,800
So like a phase three clinical trial and our endpoint will be it could be a lot of different things, but probably reduction of clinical disease.

245
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:11,710
Effectiveness is from an observational study. And again, our end point is like a clinical disease.

246
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:18,130
So this would be like a studies which take place after phase three clinical trial.

247
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:27,130
Immunogenicity is what we call like a clinical surrogate or it's a correlate of protection.

248
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:30,249
So we're not looking at whether somebody gets disease.

249
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:34,750
We're looking at what their antibody responses or their immunological responses.

250
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:38,440
And you could do an experimental study. Could it's an observational study.

251
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:44,800
The whole idea behind these words be different is efficacy means that ideally we've broken

252
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:49,670
any of the issues surrounding confounding through our randomized controlled trial.

253
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:55,360
So efficacy kind of has this higher word of. We have like what is our.

254
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:05,180
What is the strength of evidence given that we can remove this idea of confounding or is effectiveness is more real world information?

255
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:10,850
And I will say that like a practice generally will give us a larger result than efficacy.

256
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:16,430
And that's just because one of the downsides of efficacy is there could be people who.

257
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:23,420
We randomized to do something, but then they had to do something else. And I don't know if you talked about that.

258
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:26,750
We talked about like attempt to treat versus per protocol. Okay.

259
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:37,620
Well, that might be coming up. So but in a randomized controlled trial, there are some people who, you know, we we randomized them to get the vaccine.

260
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:44,930
But then they they come to their apartment to give me advice, but for whatever reason, they actually don't get vaccinated.

261
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:52,670
Like, maybe they have like the 5 minutes between you randomize them and they get the dose they like, ran off and like, never came back.

262
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:58,640
Um, it could be that, like, if they're multiple doses, maybe they got one dose, but they didn't get the second or third dose.

263
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:05,000
Similarly, for people who gave the placebo, they might have ended up getting the vaccine and who knows how.

264
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:10,970
Like maybe they enrolled in another clinical trial or maybe like they were able to through some other source, get that and get the vaccine.

265
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:17,660
So that's hard to say that like we could think of the randomized controlled trials as really gold standard,

266
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:23,000
but oftentimes the data is actually really messy in terms of what people actually did.

267
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:27,770
So I don't want you to think that efficacy is like the be all, end all. There are some downsides to it.

268
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:33,830
Ideally, you can kind of look at multiple sources of evidence. Okay.

269
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:38,320
So, um, have you learned about actuarial projections in a female?

270
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:46,780
Okay. So an attributable fraction is one minus the risk ratio of one minus an odds ratio.

271
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:55,209
And I think at least when I was learning about it for real fractions back in the day, I wasn't thinking about the practical implications of it.

272
00:30:55,210 --> 00:31:01,000
But vaccine effectiveness for vaccine efficacy is probably the most widely used application of a trivial fraction.

273
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:06,760
So we hear about it all the time. So this is just like the formula for it.

274
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:11,380
And, you know, this just simplifies out to one minus the risk ratio.

275
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:17,290
Okay. So maybe pull out your calculators and figure this out.

276
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:23,640
So suppose in a study of COVID 19, the risk of hospitalization.

277
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:27,829
And that's our endpoint, let's say, for the studies. So our endpoint is hospitalization.

278
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:33,900
The risk of hospitalization was 11% in the unvaccinated and 4% in the vaccine group.

279
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:42,330
What the vaccine effectiveness? I have a severe.

280
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:08,180
Like 64%. Yes. So that's what you.

281
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:15,760
So if you're ever wondering how does this vaccine affects the vaccine efficacy again, statistically, those are computed the same way.

282
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,730
It's just one of them. An observational study. One is from sovereign risk.

283
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:28,030
If you're wondering where those numbers come from, that's what it comes from. So like a vaccine effectiveness, does it mean like for the 63%?

284
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:31,510
It doesn't mean that like 63% of people who are vaccinated are protected.

285
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:36,910
That's not what it just means. Like the reduction of risk is 30 to 63%.

286
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:45,220
There's 63% lower risk of COVID 19 hospitalization of those vaccinated compared to those not vaccinated.

287
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:56,360
Okay. So one concern that people have been having is that the immunization schedule is becoming more diverse.

288
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:02,570
So what do we mean by that? Like in recent years, we've added in like an HPV vaccine.

289
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:08,779
There are like Tdap boosters. There's like pneumococcal conjugate and polysaccharide vaccines.

290
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,730
There's a shingles vaccine for older adults.

291
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:17,570
One thing to keep in mind is that the vaccines which are used in country are based on the local epidemiology of disease.

292
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:21,680
So here in the U.S., we did not use BCG, which is a tuberculosis vaccine.

293
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:28,040
And that is because, you know, we do have to produce as cases 10,000 or so each year in the US.

294
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:32,080
But it. Those cases usually are imported from other countries.

295
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:41,950
So a BCG vaccination of universal vaccination for kids isn't going to prevent the disease from spreading when it's coming in from outside the country.

296
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:46,720
Whereas in other countries, if TB is endemic, that the BCG vaccine makes sense.

297
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:55,700
And in some countries, there's less use of subtext in sentences. Like kid pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.

298
00:33:55,700 --> 00:34:08,010
Hepatitis B rotavirus. And one thing that people wonder about is that the vaccination schedule.

299
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:12,700
Here in the US, this appears to be exploded.

300
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:16,090
Like if you look at, you know, what did my grandma get as a vaccine?

301
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:21,340
Maybe she only got two vaccines and then my parents, maybe they only got like three vaccines.

302
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:24,940
And then I have to get my child vaccines.

303
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:31,360
And I think this is scary for a lot of parents. Just kind of look at this and hear about their own experiences and parts of their parents.

304
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:38,990
You know, it's it's a different thing. I want to introduce this idea of.

305
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:42,310
So antigens is like what your body specifically responds to.

306
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:48,420
So what is it in the vaccine strain that your body thinks is not part of your own part of your body?

307
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:52,790
So an antigen is like, you know, could be a protein.

308
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,430
It could be like a polysaccharide, the surface of a bacteria.

309
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:00,180
But it's something that your body recognizes as not being part of itself.

310
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:05,480
And so it wants to attack it at home with it. So the thing things keep.

311
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:10,480
So this is how our body responds to things. So if we're thinking of like what is our immune response like?

312
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:16,540
If there are more antigens, there's going to be more of an immune response because we need more things to deal with all the antigens.

313
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:22,060
So the thing to keep in mind is smallpox. Again, it's like one of the first vaccines out there.

314
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:27,760
So it is what we'd call like a bit more of a dirty vaccine in the sense that it's not very purified.

315
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:34,810
But I mean, there are a lot of instance, smallpox is also one of the largest viruses out there.

316
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:39,910
So for your body to kind of clear and mount the immune response to the smallpox vaccine,

317
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:47,529
it needs to basically deal with two or three different elements. Um, the vaccines that we use nowadays are much more purified.

318
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:53,049
So instead of we kind of got away from using wholesale vaccines and instead we purify, like,

319
00:35:53,050 --> 00:36:02,440
what is the like one or two proteins on certain virus or bacteria that we really need to develop an immunity to, to clear it in the future.

320
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:07,540
So we don't like that there's that trend over time to simplify and purifier vaccines.

321
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:08,950
And so actually,

322
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:17,110
if you somebody counted up all the ingredients that somebody would have to respond to across all the vaccines used in the current schedules,

323
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:24,640
and it's less than 200, which is all to say, you know, there's these concerns that we're overloading a kid's kid's immune system.

324
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:34,050
But actually, when we consider like smallpox being such like an old vaccine, which, you know, you have to deal with some antigens for it.

325
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:41,290
Like actually with all of our doses now, there are fewer antigens than ever, first of all.

326
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:48,040
And then, of course, like, you know, if responding to a natural infection, we of course, have to deal with abstinence.

327
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:55,210
And so like a strep throat, that's like the bacteria for that staphylococcus, that's probably around 50 antigens.

328
00:36:55,690 --> 00:37:02,470
And just like in your day to day life as this human being is just like walking around or if you're thinking of a kid specifically,

329
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,820
like crawling around,

330
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:12,940
licking everything and putting their fingers on everything, like there's so many such bacteria and viruses that they're responding to already.

331
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:18,680
So it doesn't really make sense to think about like the immunization schedule is

332
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:23,900
overloading the kid more than what the kid has to do with a typical day anyway.

333
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:31,980
So there's a number of different ways of conceiving of how we measure the schedule.

334
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:40,050
So here in the U.S., we have this schedule which is often abbreviated as support 3133142 schedule.

335
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:47,820
I mean, that just refers to how many doses there are. And it's kind of in this order based on when the vaccine was introduced.

336
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,180
So we've had the DTP vaccine and opposed vaccines for a while.

337
00:37:51,180 --> 00:38:01,890
And then measles was introduced in the sixties, in the eighties and happy in the nineties and then varicella and PCV and have a have since 2000.

338
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:10,330
First of all, it's also the case. But this is all to say that these are like doses you need for these different vaccines.

339
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:15,720
I like to also just take a moment to think about like, what is this disease causing?

340
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:22,830
Because we will often think very fabulously about like, oh, diphtheria, we don't want it, period.

341
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:26,320
But like, who knows what the theory is? That's it's kind of like a vague thing.

342
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:34,050
And so is the necessity of getting a DTP vaccine might be less for us who just like,

343
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:37,390
don't know what the theory is, don't know what Texans, don't know what pertussis is.

344
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:47,830
So I just have these disease descriptions in mind just to remind you and remind me that these really were severe things.

345
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:53,860
And through our vaccines, we can prevent or prevent this.

346
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:02,930
Okay. So I'm thinking of a global perspective.

347
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:09,040
Each country can kind of come up with their own list of vaccines that they want to include or not.

348
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:13,200
And again, this should be based on the local epidemiology of disease.

349
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:23,309
There is also the W.H.O. puts together position papers where they evaluate the best set of evidence and think about whether the country should expect,

350
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:31,350
seen or not. Of course, the DeLay show doesn't have any regulatory power in any country, but its position papers might carry some carry some weight.

351
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:38,510
So what the W.H.O. does is for vaccines, they sort of have a universal recommendation that they give.

352
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:43,650
So, for instance, they're saying every country should include a hepatitis B vaccine.

353
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:50,020
And by recommended means like this should be publicly provide or people should not have to pay for it.

354
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:56,860
And generally the government needs to provide something to make sure that every every kid gets hepatitis B vaccine.

355
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:02,240
Then they have like certain vaccines, which I call them high performing.

356
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:06,200
They don't say that, but they're like, these are sort of second tier vaccines.

357
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:11,210
Like, if you already have these vaccines under your belt, then why don't you try to protect against these?

358
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:20,209
So you know the citizens to say that the researchers would like people to cover a month's vaccine, which,

359
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:23,930
you know, here in the US is generally administered with measles and rubella and a combination vaccine.

360
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:32,150
But you know, if measles vaccination coverage is really low, then maybe not at and maybe focus on getting measles up and then later on at.

361
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:37,960
Then there are these other I call them high risk. And it's kind of based on immunology.

362
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:44,780
So, you know, tuberculosis is usually endemic in your country that you have that vaccine if Japanese encephalitis is great.

363
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:50,239
So out there is a usually there's a Japanese encephalitis vaccine which is given to every kid.

364
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,420
But here in the US that's not so much an issue. So we don't have.

365
00:40:56,540 --> 00:41:06,680
We can also look at Gabby. So Gabby is a public private partnership, funded a lot through the Gates Foundation, but also through other.

366
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:17,600
Other public funds as well from various countries. And what they try to do is they try to accelerate the introduction of new vaccines into countries.

367
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:23,540
And their model is to kind of have a stepwise fashion where early on they will provide most of the funding.

368
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:33,020
But then over a few years, they provide continuously less money and then, like the host country is supposed to provide more funding.

369
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:41,540
So the idea is that this is a way to for a country to introduce a new vaccine into their country without having to pay up front for a lot of costs.

370
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:44,300
Like GAVI will cover some of the funds, but then after a few years,

371
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:53,030
that supposedly will be the sustainable plan for the country to actually focus themselves.

372
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:56,300
So these are these are different projects which they fund.

373
00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:02,509
And then, you know, I am just looking at a smattering of different countries China, India, Ethiopia.

374
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:13,670
And what about vaccines that the fund and again, China has this expanded program on immunization where these are vaccines provided by the government.

375
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:22,540
They are not EPR vaccines. These are vaccines which are you can pay for out of pocket, but the government doesn't have.

376
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:33,740
In India, they just call things the universal immunization program, but it's the same thing and they are just in the middle of rolling.

377
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:40,620
So like Hib, pneumococcal and rotavirus vaccines, these are kind of like the newer ones, which China still hasn't introduced.

378
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:47,130
India is like planning on doing it, but places like Ethiopia in much of Africa have already introduced infections.

379
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:55,670
But again, this is this is all to say that generally countries should be looking at kind of look like criminology of disease.

380
00:42:55,670 --> 00:43:02,340
But I would say for a lot of these ones where there's just so much evidence that kids everywhere should be getting it within.

381
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:17,070
Presumably that that should be a goal of these places. So a number of different organizations are involved with vaccines on a number of fronts.

382
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:21,969
I give you an example, GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance. So keep this in mind.

383
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:28,860
If you're thinking about what are jobs they can have after graduating that are related to vaccines that are related to global health care,

384
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:32,650
you get this, a lot of funding for vaccine introductions.

385
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:39,000
How they think is very similar to their CPI is the.

386
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:50,379
So like the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations that I see, I don't see a big thing at the Academy background doesn't really make sense,

387
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:57,160
but CPI is a way of thinking about, you know, and this is before the COVID 19 pandemic.

388
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:01,360
But there is this realization that it's so expensive to develop vaccines.

389
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:08,919
So CPI is all about like let's develop vaccines which maybe can be used in low and middle income countries.

390
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:14,710
Like maybe there's not a market for like the pharmaceutical company to get billions of dollars from African countries.

391
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:23,530
But if you develop a vaccine which can be used in a lower middle income country, if it really responds to the local epidemiology of disease,

392
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:31,500
then we'll just provide some market funding and make sure that, like the pharmaceutical companies will be rewarded for developing metrics.

393
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:44,350
Okay. So, you know, throughout this year, I think not only of this class, but next semester you'll talk a bit more about this, too.

394
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:50,270
But there are a number of surveys which are out there on how that have been conducted to measure vaccination status.

395
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:56,660
I'll mention two except DHS. Mean they're very similar.

396
00:44:56,660 --> 00:45:03,730
It's just slightly different funding patterns. So. Makes sense for a multiple indicator cluster survey.

397
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:06,220
And DHS is the demographic and health survey.

398
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:20,470
And these rose out of a need among a lot of funding agencies at the US, in the US but also at the UN for understanding like who is dying,

399
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:25,900
like what are vital statistics like and vital statistics like who's being born, who's dying in a certain country.

400
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:32,170
And so here in the US we have like this vital record system where we have that information, but in a lot of countries they do not.

401
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:38,469
So at the very basis these surveys are like they try to get not everybody in the population,

402
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:48,280
but a random sample of the population want to see who's dying and who is still alive for kids, but they also added for vaccination.

403
00:45:48,290 --> 00:45:51,550
So for those kids who are alive, there's pretty comprehensive information about vaccination.

404
00:45:54,030 --> 00:46:00,540
Okay. So I'm switching to vaccine hesitancy for a bit. I'll talk for a couple of moments and then I'll switch you into small groups.

405
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:09,720
So vaccine misconceptions are nothing new. Like from the first vaccination, there were like this products, like, are we turning everybody to cows?

406
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:14,610
I feel like analogs of this message have been.

407
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:20,800
I hear about all the time with like COVID vaccine. So against the methods we're talking about this hour.

408
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:25,740
Derived from early in the days of the 17th century developing these vaccines.

409
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:32,040
The other thing to keep in mind is that it's really hard to change people's minds who are vaccine hesitant.

410
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:38,910
So this is a study which looked at how there's a control arm and then a number of

411
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:42,510
different ways where they're trying to present like new information about vaccines.

412
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:48,660
And the idea is that they were trying to reduce the number of people who are vaccine hesitant.

413
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:55,590
So I'm just giving you two outcomes that they looked at, like vaccines cause autism, where there's lots of side effects from this one MMR vaccine.

414
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:01,620
And in the control group for each one, maybe like 7% of people were kind of vaccine hesitant on that dimension.

415
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:05,460
But like, you know, they had a number of ways where they're trying to correct these errors,

416
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:09,510
where they're trying to describe, like, the risks of not getting vaccinated.

417
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:12,899
They're providing a story of somebody getting vaccinated.

418
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:16,500
They were providing images of kids who were not vaccinated,

419
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:22,680
who came out of disease like it really wasn't affecting like people's like this outcome measure.

420
00:47:23,730 --> 00:47:31,890
So this is sort of a failed clinical trial where people were trying to or poor people randomized it to receive different information sets.

421
00:47:32,070 --> 00:47:36,600
And that just didn't affect what they thought about vaccines. Okay.

422
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:41,660
So what I would like to do is to split you actually into.

423
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:50,180
Or so. All right. Okay. But it's only for these four.

424
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:54,380
So I will. I will find a way to explain you two things.

425
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:58,820
And what I have is. Do you have the gym boards ready or.

426
00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:03,660
I do. Maybe you can actually do that.

427
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:08,930
All right. So I put together a really quick jam board for these four groups.

428
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:13,640
The links are in there. I can't hyperlink them in the gym word though unfortunately.

429
00:48:13,650 --> 00:48:19,820
So either copy paste them or you can pull them from the wrong ten words or you

430
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:24,350
can copy paste them from the Google doc that is also in the class schedule.

431
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:37,230
So yeah, the links are on the front page. And then there are four groups here.

432
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:43,930
Sure. Yes. Are. Okay. So again, in a moment, I'll speak to four groups of.

433
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:50,549
And you might be able to receive some information from the article for today.

434
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:53,850
But I think there's like three sets of three sets of.

435
00:48:55,330 --> 00:49:05,950
Data or URLs. So one is information from the show, the amount of kids who received the vaccine and who have a vaccine preventable disease.

436
00:49:05,950 --> 00:49:09,250
And that's for each country. And again, focus on your country.

437
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,249
There's you can you can just like Google around for news.

438
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:18,400
But vaccine confidence is an NGO which looks at which kind of collects information from different sources.

439
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,620
And they have information on.

440
00:49:22,350 --> 00:49:30,060
So if you just there's a search engine in there, search for your country, and then there's information about COVID vaccinations.

441
00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:34,890
So in your groups, I think there will be like 3 to 5 people per per group.

442
00:49:35,130 --> 00:49:38,250
I think you can kind of like divvy up how you want to look at this.

443
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:41,910
So for each one, you will.

444
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:49,290
Yep. So just like provide some information about like trends in vaccine coverage,

445
00:49:49,290 --> 00:49:55,400
trends in like the epidemiology of vaccine preventable diseases, what news, their vaccine hesitancy and stuff.

446
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:58,860
And then we'll come back in 15, 20 minutes and talk through these.

447
00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:03,330
Does this idea extends to you? Okay.

448
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:06,690
So I think.

449
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:14,240
For Japan. Why don't we do these for people here?

450
00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:24,100
Maybe I'll have you in the back as well. Yeah. Okay for Indonesia.

451
00:50:24,970 --> 00:50:30,670
Could it be like your to here you three there and then for.

452
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:37,010
Philippines. Maybe you four and then.

453
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:43,290
Nigeria. The three of you in the back as ever.

454
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:51,830
Okay. So we will maybe reconvene at like a bit after 4:00, but I would love to.

455
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:54,200
You know, you don't need to like go into the nitty gritty,

456
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:58,670
but we'll have maybe once each group to say like a bit of things that they think about each country.

457
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:14,630
But I really do want to think that that's true.

458
00:51:14,630 --> 00:51:19,430
It's a business matter. And this is.

459
00:51:28,290 --> 00:51:33,210
So that's what they're doing right now.

460
00:51:36,210 --> 00:51:45,360
So it's more trouble than it was last year and we won't let it go.

461
00:51:48,660 --> 00:52:12,880
Sarah She works on the map and the was not included in the coverage and they wanted

462
00:52:12,990 --> 00:52:23,100
their own vaccine preventable diseases such as kind of the Moderna vaccine.

463
00:52:23,150 --> 00:52:30,640
And they're going to send them to Bangladesh over four years.

464
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:38,540
She says, Oh, God, I don't think we need that.

465
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:57,549
And so that just says all that great monkey business.

466
00:52:57,550 --> 00:53:10,680
Thank goodness we want to have that for our I live in Brownsville, Texas, thinking about it.

467
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:33,260
So it was apparently the one where they wanted something interesting to see.

468
00:53:33,890 --> 00:53:43,650
It really hasn't been exposed.

469
00:53:44,490 --> 00:53:58,360
It's not that simple, really.

470
00:54:01,590 --> 00:54:32,610
But I think we would have never seen anything like it if they haven't found it was failing with no illnesses, worked really well.

471
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:56,140
And then the only thing I can say is that our restaurant isn't.

472
00:54:56,580 --> 00:55:04,050
Which means you are not there yet, but you found out about that.

473
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:39,780
But the thing is that it's not that I know a little bit of the things that I think it's not going to make stuff up in the hands of Google.

474
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:59,280
But I guess maybe I don't know if there's anything that tells me.

475
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:13,870
Okay. Well, that's quite surprising because they're going to have a lot of.

476
00:56:21,990 --> 00:56:27,330
Everybody is country.

477
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:46,570
One of the reasons why we think that we are blessed with all the countries in the world because it is typically with animals they save.

478
00:56:46,760 --> 00:57:06,560
The importance of other animals is when you feel that way.

479
00:57:07,610 --> 00:57:41,710
Even with all the things that we are doing, because everybody out there, not only the environment, yeah, these are great.

480
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:45,710
The stuff about vaccines at some point and Indonesia.

481
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:52,340
Have you heard about that? I hadn't heard about it like in different places.

482
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:59,120
This has always been like the biggest. It was actually my wife is on the phone.

483
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:05,210
Do you know what I mean?

484
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:18,910
Yeah, it was great. Did you finally reveal that to the happy couple?

485
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:35,560
I guess what I'm suggesting is, you know, now.

486
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:43,830
The other stories, I mean, I guess like our point,

487
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:54,890
this is like our hubris or whatnot was like if people have a concern about health care with those around you.

488
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:59,510
But I don't think like I think that's natural. It's not like that.

489
00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:10,580
I don't know if people are probably yourself, like if people are concerned about that or whatnot, like the last thing they want to think of.

490
00:59:12,830 --> 00:59:16,520
So I guess, I guess, but.

491
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:26,210
Be But yeah, because like if you're years that eventually you'll have to be very concerned that

492
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:32,490
maybe let's do this thing for like the ten people who like to leave the house.

493
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:39,610
Yeah, but are you finding that, you know, to talk about doing that?

494
00:59:41,150 --> 00:59:52,200
That was really so. So the one thing is, is just thinking about like the rates, because I think when we think of grocery stores and I mean,

495
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:56,269
this is like here in America, like there is this kind of like side of the road.

496
00:59:56,270 --> 01:00:08,839
Like, so there's this place like I think for us, we're trying to think like, oh, it was so easy for people.

497
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:16,250
They were like, oh, you know, like it was really find. So I think for all her ideas that there would be like a large enough space if I could read,

498
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:25,190
maybe we'll have to like look for it or something to study. The results are quite different, like for both.

499
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:33,580
So we, we have things like we have to is like maybe give me more of like a little business in clinic,

500
01:00:34,010 --> 01:00:40,910
although I don't know now it's like, oh, how, how much does it cost to get one of these both?

501
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:45,680
And finally it's like, it's like a relatively simple set up of a bit, but like.

502
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:54,230
I don't know exactly how it is, how it has to be set up to go back to that, because actually that's what we did in London.

503
01:00:54,250 --> 01:01:01,190
And all you needed to do was the and of the vaccinations and the vaccine roll back.

504
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:11,059
It needs to be accurate and that's about it. So I was just trying to let them know exactly.

505
01:01:11,060 --> 01:01:17,030
That's like we're thinking about it because I think for people they might have a cognitive episode.

506
01:01:17,030 --> 01:01:24,499
They're like, Oh, it's like a story, but it'd be like the back of the truth style or like like where would it be?

507
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:28,240
But if it's like, if it's in place, like the next person over.

508
01:01:29,090 --> 01:01:37,790
I think, I think that what you're doing quite well was this was a big government hospital

509
01:01:37,790 --> 01:01:42,170
proposal to come and give you a vaccine and they will show you every stadium.

510
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:47,400
Yeah, I know. That's right. Yeah.

511
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:52,330
Oh, yeah.

512
01:01:53,000 --> 01:02:05,420
So even like we did in Westminster Abbey, a clinical competition, which is going to be interesting results kind of thing.

513
01:02:05,570 --> 01:02:09,110
They were well, they were they were like messy.

514
01:02:09,110 --> 01:02:13,370
And it wasn't exactly was thinking, what is the point of doing this to figure out?

515
01:02:13,370 --> 01:02:24,240
But it's also like now somebody would bring up this proposal and it's like, how is the team still the same one?

516
01:02:24,250 --> 01:02:30,620
That's a lot of people have the last which is like sick or something.

517
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:39,430
Yeah. And then we found one person and went with we've actually had done some work before.

518
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:44,839
It was like a bit of a reconstitution.

519
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:57,150
But I think people are very yeah, that would be well, maybe so we'll be in touch basically because like that's great.

520
01:02:57,170 --> 01:03:00,110
Think yeah, there's a lot of different ways that we can see that.

521
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:07,670
But yeah, that's where I go back in Kenya kind country chat and I mean, that's awesome.

522
01:03:09,020 --> 01:03:19,389
How long has. So the question, therefore, I suppose in the second to be noted, Erin, what I know,

523
01:03:19,390 --> 01:03:26,590
I'm sure some of you have that still looking at stuff and you can kind of go down a rabbit hole where you would do this forever.

524
01:03:27,790 --> 01:03:36,549
But maybe it's just like a three minute spiel of like what they found is that would be one person or multiple people.

525
01:03:36,550 --> 01:03:42,910
But kind of unusual is I want to talk as a group so you don't do too much time, but, um.

526
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:48,639
Yeah. Like what? Why did you panic groups?

527
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:52,450
Like, maybe we know each of these things. What were you looking at and what did you find?

528
01:03:56,650 --> 01:04:05,170
We have found that the trends in vaccine coverage and in vaccine hesitancy,

529
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:13,490
the coverage went down on hesitancy increase with the HPV vaccination drama

530
01:04:13,510 --> 01:04:18,960
where the government recommended it and then withdrew their recommendation,

531
01:04:18,970 --> 01:04:23,080
which really. Everyone with their children.

532
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:27,990
And then Vertex the overall winner in funds.

533
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:45,430
Both instances we saw just like just on the run after the Japanese flight as measles, mumps, rubella overall and those typical vaccines.

534
01:04:47,140 --> 01:04:52,240
The number of cases that were reported in relation to that have been going down in the last 20 years,

535
01:04:52,240 --> 01:05:05,440
according to the World Health Organization and coverage in Japan for polio and measles, rubella, all are pretty, pretty high rates of coverage.

536
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:11,730
Of course, we have very much in the case of HPV in the misinformation regards,

537
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:20,300
but COVID as well in Japan has seen a lot of higher vaccination rates that yeah,

538
01:05:20,930 --> 01:05:30,579
was covered 72.6% of the population vaccinated, which is really high compared to the rest of the world.

539
01:05:30,580 --> 01:05:37,090
It's pretty high as well. And currently the Japanese government covers the cost of the COVID vaccine,

540
01:05:37,570 --> 01:05:45,460
so there's pretty easy access to it and pretty low hesitancy with that much of the population being vaccinated for.

541
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:52,940
Oh, and just like just received little vaccine hesitancy.

542
01:05:52,950 --> 01:06:00,450
So the government is trying to reintroduce the HPV vaccine, but they're having a lot of difficulty because of the misinformation.

543
01:06:00,690 --> 01:06:09,330
And then there was like a video that like circus. Like circus where like there was girl like motor function problems or a lot of friction.

544
01:06:09,630 --> 01:06:16,140
So like the HPV vaccine also found something about the MMR vaccine.

545
01:06:16,470 --> 01:06:27,600
Vaccine was recently banned because there was 1.8 million children had experienced non viral gingivitis and there were other adverse health outcomes.

546
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:33,370
So in Japan they vaccinate for new specimens separately instead of using their.

547
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:44,000
Yeah. So Japan, I thought, was an interesting country because they it seems like every decade they pull a recommendation for a certain vaccine.

548
01:06:44,010 --> 01:06:50,639
So early in the 1980s, there was some like health scare around pertussis vaccine.

549
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:51,390
So they pulled that.

550
01:06:51,390 --> 01:06:58,410
And then you can see like the number of pertussis or the smoking tops, the number of those cases just skyrocketed in the 1980s as a result.

551
01:06:58,410 --> 01:06:59,880
And then they like reintroduced the vaccine.

552
01:07:00,570 --> 01:07:07,170
And yet like over the years they've kind of stopped using the MMR vaccine to kind of like reintroduce that.

553
01:07:07,170 --> 01:07:12,120
And then for the HPV, again, there is these concerns about safety. So they stopped it and they reintroduced it.

554
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:17,579
So I think they're very like trigger happy in stopping a vaccination program even without there

555
01:07:17,580 --> 01:07:23,100
being like huge a lot of causal inference evidence for like the vaccine causing something because,

556
01:07:23,310 --> 01:07:25,680
you know, with any like with with the vaccine.

557
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:33,930
The problem is if you're vaccinating millions of people, there's just by chance going to be somebody that's like some thing that happens to them.

558
01:07:34,290 --> 01:07:36,870
And that's why, you know, having a randomized controlled trial is so important.

559
01:07:37,140 --> 01:07:43,800
But when we get to things like Facebook clinical trials, which is basically like post-marketing surveillance, it's just, you know,

560
01:07:44,850 --> 01:07:54,749
it's the Wild West where if anybody comes down with some severe thing which happens slightly after them getting a vaccine,

561
01:07:54,750 --> 01:08:00,660
then for many people that would just be attributable to the vaccine, even on a more comprehensive level, that's not gonna be the case of it.

562
01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:07,090
Okay. Moving to Indonesia was your.

563
01:08:11,740 --> 01:08:17,950
I can set aside still in 2019, but they had a pretty high rate of complete vaccination coverage.

564
01:08:18,490 --> 01:08:28,210
But with 2020, with the COVID pandemic, and because of issues like supply chain and just restrictions and people just afraid to go out and stuff.

565
01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:33,250
That rate decreased to about 84%.

566
01:08:34,330 --> 01:08:40,270
And but recently there's been this trend of the National Child Immunization Month,

567
01:08:41,290 --> 01:08:47,199
which is an initiative by the government to get that childhood immunization rate up for

568
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:52,780
vaccine preventable diseases like diphtheria and pertussis and all the other ones.

569
01:08:54,760 --> 01:09:01,340
Anyone else want to? Yeah. So I was looking at the vaccine confidence project and I found a couple of articles about it.

570
01:09:02,140 --> 01:09:07,840
So it was just around 2016 where they found that a lot of fake vaccines had been distributed.

571
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:16,800
And they said that that might have been going back to 2003. And so they had to vaccinate a lot of children and it broke confidence in vaccines.

572
01:09:16,810 --> 01:09:23,810
So we did see it over the next year or two in 22 area outbreaks and Wisconsin measles and all those things.

573
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:28,810
I think that that really changed the confidence in vaccines.

574
01:09:32,550 --> 01:09:40,230
Yeah. So, I mean, I had not heard about that fake vaccine scandal, but certainly if that happens, one, it could break confidence.

575
01:09:40,230 --> 01:09:43,680
But then also it just means that there's been a accumulation of people who are

576
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:47,450
susceptible to both diseases who you think they've developed immunity towards.

577
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:55,170
So it doesn't surprise me then that there's that big outbreak if there's been years of people not actually getting vaccinated against it.

578
01:09:56,220 --> 01:10:05,129
One of the reasons why I like to bring up Indonesia is right now I have a project and one thing that has been an issue there is measles vaccination.

579
01:10:05,130 --> 01:10:08,100
And there's concern that like for some of the measles vaccine,

580
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:15,660
if a pork product is used during the production of it, then maybe the vaccine is not considered halal anymore.

581
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:22,360
And there's like different, you know, religious. Reasonings behind whether it not be or not.

582
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:25,050
And there are religious councils who in general,

583
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:33,010
I think the idea is that they're supportive of vaccines in principle and just kind of wish that this manufacturing process would change.

584
01:10:33,580 --> 01:10:38,530
But, you know, for for some individuals, that could be like a showstopper for whether they want to get the vaccine.

585
01:10:40,060 --> 01:10:45,910
But I always like doing this because every year people come up with like other reasons that they're seeing in their hands.

586
01:10:45,910 --> 01:10:49,690
And so the snakes scandals is an interesting one.

587
01:10:52,180 --> 01:10:59,079
Okay. Philippines. So what we found is that a lot of the stuff in the Philippines,

588
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:04,750
like the vaccine scandal that happened in 2017, which means that they knew about the vaccine.

589
01:11:05,410 --> 01:11:13,149
And so it came out in 2016 and they had like a national campaign to vaccinate as many children as possible, and they vaccinated over 130,000 kids.

590
01:11:13,150 --> 01:11:17,440
And then the next year, they came out with restrictions to the vaccine,

591
01:11:17,450 --> 01:11:22,329
saying that the vaccine would probably only save some people who had already been exposed to the

592
01:11:22,330 --> 01:11:28,420
dengue virus as people who were being naive might have a more severe reaction or severe infections.

593
01:11:29,530 --> 01:11:33,729
Then, of course, this came after over 8000 people were vaccinated for it.

594
01:11:33,730 --> 01:11:41,799
And a lot of those people who were vaccinated were children. And then in 28, there started to be like that that were linked to the vaccine.

595
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:45,540
And so number of deaths of children were linked to that vaccine.

596
01:11:45,550 --> 01:11:52,270
And that resulted in the license revoked for the next year for that vaccine in the Philippines.

597
01:11:52,270 --> 01:12:02,650
But because of that, there was a steep drop in like all vaccination coverage in the Philippines after 2017, which a lot of images show.

598
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:11,230
And because of that, one of the main things that happened is and this trend in vaccine preventable diseases thing is there are

599
01:12:11,710 --> 01:12:16,690
outbreaks that these vaccine preventable diseases because of this steep drop in total vaccination coverage.

600
01:12:16,690 --> 01:12:24,400
And so in 2018, like right after that whole scandal happened, never saw the massive outbreak of the measles virus.

601
01:12:25,450 --> 01:12:29,559
There was a it was actually a measles outbreak that occurred back in 2018.

602
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:33,550
And one of the the undersecretary of the Diego.

603
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:38,190
I think that Dr. Domingo, actually.

604
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:49,930
Mira a program called a National Book Does the does, which was an outreach program to vaccinate children or the measles or an antiviral program,

605
01:12:50,530 --> 01:12:58,900
and usually reached around 24% of his goal, which is under a quarter of the program that he was reaching for outreach for children.

606
01:13:00,550 --> 01:13:06,820
So it was kind of like a failure and that the working poor so that.

607
01:13:09,470 --> 01:13:15,070
Yeah. Anything else? Yeah. We can mention a little bit about the COVID 19 vaccination.

608
01:13:15,110 --> 01:13:20,209
I mean, the legacy of that vaccine scandals in vaccines.

609
01:13:20,210 --> 01:13:26,030
And that continued sort of slowly rising vaccine uptake ever since.

610
01:13:26,030 --> 01:13:37,220
I think that our days are recovering, but we can obviously see that it's not recovery there prior to the 2017 sort of vaccine uptake rates.

611
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:43,970
So we can see that with COVID 19, and that's only about 66% of the population is fully vaccinated.

612
01:13:46,540 --> 01:13:52,899
And vaccine hesitancy still remains pretty strong in that the far right graph actually

613
01:13:52,900 --> 01:14:00,639
shows that the vaccine uptake has just been slowly declining since December 2021.

614
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:02,740
I'm not sure what that crisis is there.

615
01:14:03,850 --> 01:14:13,480
So we have we do have a legacy of slow growth in terms of vaccine hesitancy is still preventing them from reaching full coverage.

616
01:14:13,870 --> 01:14:19,190
For example, the vaccine. Thanks for that introduction.

617
01:14:19,220 --> 01:14:23,420
So one thing if I could go to the events this,

618
01:14:23,420 --> 01:14:31,430
but I think the Dengvaxia thing is interesting because and I think this was mentioning

619
01:14:31,430 --> 01:14:40,430
about this is like how dengue works is your first infection will probably be pretty mild,

620
01:14:40,970 --> 01:14:49,210
it could be severe. But like and often in most people it's pretty mild. But then your second infection will be relatively severe.

621
01:14:50,110 --> 01:14:53,380
And the reason is because there's sort of like an antibody.

622
01:14:54,220 --> 01:15:00,160
Generally, we think that spreads are great because they're are protecting us from future infections.

623
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:03,280
But in some situations it can just be that way.

624
01:15:04,450 --> 01:15:11,890
For certain viruses like that. Getting as a prime example of that, if you have existing antibodies to something,

625
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:17,860
your body can just go into overdrive and then it's kind of like your immune system started to kill you.

626
01:15:18,130 --> 01:15:24,120
So that's a bad thing. So I think.

627
01:15:24,330 --> 01:15:35,820
What? What's happening is people would get vaccinated and then, you know, that would give them like the antibodies.

628
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:41,810
And then when they got like a natural infection instead of the vaccine protecting them, there was like that antibodies.

629
01:15:41,820 --> 01:15:48,000
And that was like causing such a bad reaction. Like what I think the pharmaceutical companies wanted.

630
01:15:49,700 --> 01:15:53,180
Was that people would like have their initial mild infection.

631
01:15:55,100 --> 01:16:01,670
And for all of these, like, you know, if you survive, there could be, I think like third on would be like relatively mild system.

632
01:16:04,040 --> 01:16:08,819
We're not so. Yeah.

633
01:16:08,820 --> 01:16:16,610
I think what that what the pharmaceutical companies wanted was like this one where it was severe instead of it, you know,

634
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:22,260
having a natural infection have the vaccine so that the vaccine you kind of like missed the one which is really severe.

635
01:16:23,190 --> 01:16:27,659
And it from then on you're like mild again.

636
01:16:27,660 --> 01:16:38,140
There's like more complex ecological exemplars. I don't necessarily understand that there is a sense of, but you know, I,

637
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:44,310
I read through something like the clinical trial data and they don't really talk about it a lot.

638
01:16:44,340 --> 01:16:47,400
So I think what had happened was that, um.

639
01:16:48,690 --> 01:16:56,090
You know, they submitted their clinical trial data after doing this really large scale phase trial for dengue vaccine.

640
01:16:57,500 --> 01:17:09,079
And then the Philippine FDA approved it without having this restriction that you needed to have evidence of infection before this vaccine

641
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:16,790
was actually approved in both the EU and the United States in 2019 with the restriction that you had that had a previous infection.

642
01:17:17,510 --> 01:17:20,900
So I think it works, but only under those restrictions.

643
01:17:21,460 --> 01:17:25,760
No, because I know people are also at this point and you pair it with like an antibody test.

644
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:29,230
So, you know, could there be like a quick like that?

645
01:17:29,390 --> 01:17:31,950
You know, we have a rapid antigen test for COVID 19.

646
01:17:31,950 --> 01:17:37,460
And I mean, you know, somebody comes to the clinic, give them an antibody test and if they're positive and negative.

647
01:17:37,770 --> 01:17:41,419
So either could be, you know, that's logistically complicated.

648
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:47,750
And, you know, I'm sure for the near future or maybe the future, just like I don't want to touch this because it's.

649
01:17:50,810 --> 01:17:58,420
I'm sorry, but I like how you kind of explained there's this bad experience with Jenkins so that I can understand where parents are coming from.

650
01:17:58,420 --> 01:18:01,170
They're like, That is really bad. There's like these kids dying.

651
01:18:01,180 --> 01:18:04,980
And, you know, whether the kids are dying because of the dengue vaccine or whether, you know,

652
01:18:05,050 --> 01:18:08,700
it's just something that happens again, close to a million children to be vaccinated.

653
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:12,580
Unfortunately, some of them will just die for different reasons.

654
01:18:12,850 --> 01:18:20,050
And I would assume a lot of it, though, was related to this antibody, the cancer that influences other things.

655
01:18:20,410 --> 01:18:26,620
And then all of a sudden, you know, children are getting measles and dying from that, which is scary stuff.

656
01:18:27,770 --> 01:18:33,020
Okay. Last group. What did you see from Nigeria?

657
01:18:36,770 --> 01:18:45,920
So I'll sign off on vaccine coverage. So I'll look up and make sure that all.

658
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:55,660
Convergence mean that a position like 7% between four and seven within a population.

659
01:18:56,590 --> 01:19:00,280
So which is when you will have the.

660
01:19:02,940 --> 01:19:10,890
India's army on every other control except for yellow fever and reduces safety as well.

661
01:19:11,270 --> 01:19:14,010
Now, that's kind of interesting to me how they bounce off each other.

662
01:19:15,730 --> 01:19:27,460
So not that we saw that or even coverage for that vaccine decreases by 2028, 2018, 2021, only 54% of people having the vaccination.

663
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:35,400
So although yellow fever is endemic to Nigeria, we see a lot more cases being over there and just going over more details.

664
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:44,710
We saw that there was widespread trust with the government and that was like their main hesitancy on getting vaccinations.

665
01:19:45,220 --> 01:19:47,740
Looking at like colon studies and other studies as well,

666
01:19:47,740 --> 01:19:53,500
they kind of announced that the main reason they got vaccinations is because I don't really trust their government.

667
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:57,580
And when you look at the World Governance Index test for effectiveness,

668
01:19:57,580 --> 01:20:02,290
political stability or corruption, you really will have a super corrupt government.

669
01:20:03,460 --> 01:20:10,030
So one thing we looked at when we had this really big meningitis outbreak and 1996 or something along those lines.

670
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:17,200
And Pfizer took an opportunity to go there and has now a new innovative drug which is been tested on adults

671
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:23,080
and observed pretty serious side effects in terms of like liver abnormalities and cartilage abnormalities.

672
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:29,650
But they tested it on children. And this is like a largely Muslim population and it killed all the children that they tested it on.

673
01:20:30,070 --> 01:20:32,920
So they had such huge distrust in the government from there on.

674
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:37,960
And hence the Muslim population specifically has a huge distrust of vaccines from that point forward.

675
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:49,370
Yeah. I mean, I think Nigeria is an example of a country with like a huge population like Nigeria has.

676
01:20:51,270 --> 01:20:55,050
The third or maybe even the second largest birth cohort might be the third.

677
01:20:56,130 --> 01:20:59,430
So I think there's like maybe even over 10 million children who are.

678
01:21:00,780 --> 01:21:04,920
Born in Nigeria each year. But it's a lot of it's a lot of children.

679
01:21:05,940 --> 01:21:11,640
And so, first off, there's the logistical challenges of just like getting all these children vaccinated.

680
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:15,540
And then you pop out of that look what you're saying about mistrust of government.

681
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:22,680
And oftentimes, vaccines are like a very heightened example of what the government could do because, you know,

682
01:21:22,740 --> 01:21:30,590
when you have a kid or several times in their first life, you are in contact with governmental health services to get your kids the vaccine.

683
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:38,030
So if you have mistrust of the government, that that's going to kind of peer down into this vaccine as well.

684
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:43,739
I had not heard the news story about the testing that you that sporadic drug that doesn't sound great.

685
01:21:43,740 --> 01:21:51,360
So that's like another issue of kind of like epic stuff, like doing these trials or trying to figure out something in another country.

686
01:21:52,830 --> 01:21:58,350
Oh, yeah. So that's all I have for today. Thanks for kind of going in these small groups with me.

687
01:21:58,770 --> 01:22:02,340
And if you have any other questions about vaccines are doing like vaccine related

688
01:22:02,730 --> 01:22:06,570
international internships next summer just let me know and I'm happy to talk to you.

689
01:22:06,570 --> 01:22:13,080
Otherwise I think I'll see most of you next week on the stand up for the lecture session completed.

690
01:22:14,850 --> 01:22:26,190
Yeah. Otherwise you have a great weekend. It's really interesting.
