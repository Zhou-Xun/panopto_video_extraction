1
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:15,520
Okay. Today is week three.

2
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:22,630
What is happening? I think the analysis in genetics.

3
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:36,120
So for that, you should have watched the recordings.

4
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:41,450
I think we would have been hearing probabilities and analysis.

5
00:00:41,650 --> 00:01:00,790
So and then it would be a quiz question that you seem to be able to go over those topics.

6
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:07,060
Interesting questions. I do have a practice problem, said some pedigree analysis which will help us kind of understand.

7
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:15,490
I know the last part can be too much, so go over some examples on that and I will do that practice,

8
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:28,150
practice kind of problem sets and then just other reminders so that the problems that with the homework one is due Thursday.

9
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:36,220
So we will have some time today also to finish for you guys finish working on it improves as well.

10
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:48,629
Okay. So were there any questions on those?

11
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,670
Was how familiar it was?

12
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:58,030
Was it raise your hand?

13
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:02,310
It was familiar or straightforward. Under.

14
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:13,260
No. Let me go quickly over there and we'll go over the list to as well.

15
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:42,970
So it reads in Muslim inheritance.

16
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:52,330
You start by talking about how to segregate, and each research receives one genetic factor from each parent.

17
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:59,500
That's kind of like the basic basics of how from like how we calculate the probabilities or

18
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:07,330
transmission probabilities that you are likely to inherit one copy of your aliens from each parent.

19
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:13,600
So this should be pretty straightforward just how meiosis happens.

20
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:19,420
Symbols for pedigree. Like that's kind of straightforward.

21
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:29,799
This kind of how we label our pedigrees would be important as we solve some of the problems.

22
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:34,720
That's how we call the generations and labeled individuals.

23
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:43,990
And then then the major modes of inheritance will cover in this class, the ozone.

24
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:48,430
Ozone will dominant, recessive and sex recessive.

25
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:52,210
So we want to be more familiar with those.

26
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:03,060
So autism dominant. That's when you have to be that individual that will have an effective parent.

27
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:06,690
And then there's a 50% chance of transmission.

28
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:12,970
It doesn't show differences in expression by males and females.

29
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:22,540
Then two affected individuals may have been unaffected. So they received the recessive value.

30
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:30,560
And then the. Autism and recessive.

31
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:41,730
That's when your. The affected individual will have the two two copies of the recessive Leo.

32
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:54,600
And then whenever if you have two affected parents, then all of the children will be affected because it's all recessive being transmitted.

33
00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:02,100
And then X-linked recessive has a specific pattern of no male transmission.

34
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:08,010
There's mother and son transmission and females can be homozygous in husband James.

35
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,250
Were there any questions on.

36
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:34,890
Then confrontation is when you have kind of two gene locus loci that would result in the same disease or the same phenotype.

37
00:05:42,600 --> 00:06:03,270
So probabilities. So the connotations that we would use as the union or that's when when you're looking at the probability of event A or B happening.

38
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,780
Whenever we say probability of event A and B, that's like an intersection and then a conditional.

39
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:24,270
Or that's when you're looking at the event of a given that has happened, these would be straightforward events are mutually exclusive.

40
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,990
That means that they cannot happen at the same time. So they're like no overlap.

41
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:39,909
So whenever you're looking at the probability of events, A or B, you can just add A and B, and an example of that is due time.

42
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:45,340
So a person cannot have two different genotypes at the same time,

43
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:54,190
even if they are not mutually exclusive, then you have overlap between those two events.

44
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:59,890
They can occur together and whenever we're looking at the probability of A or B we need to account for.

45
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:08,230
So if we're looking at adding probability of A and probability of B, then we're kind of double counting that intersection or that.

46
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:14,019
Like in the in the table here, we've kind of looking at those and looking at those.

47
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:17,050
So we're counting those these overlap twice.

48
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:21,220
So that's why we went to minus our probability of A and B.

49
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:39,360
And then if two events are independent, then the probability of growth of A and B is simply a multiple quantification of A and B, we would use that.

50
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:47,630
So if a person can't hear the D, d or have the d d in 1/1,

51
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:55,350
and then the others will close and like it doesn't matter if you get the d d here, it won't affect what you would get at the second vocal.

52
00:07:55,350 --> 00:08:02,459
So it would just multiply those two probabilities together and we would use that in pedigrees and the

53
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:07,830
pedigree analysis when we are trying to look at the probability of siblings having a certain genotype.

54
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:11,370
So it doesn't matter if a sibling has a certain genotype,

55
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:18,840
the probability of the other sibling has the same genotype or something else is simply a multiplication like their independent events,

56
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:24,540
so they don't know each other. Is that fair questions?

57
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:34,720
And then probability of A conditional on B,

58
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:42,969
you basically use this formula and we would use that whenever we're looking at the probability

59
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:50,290
of an individual inheriting certain values from a mom would be conditional on the mom having.

60
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:55,419
So we open the wheel and then the probability of it transmitting.

61
00:08:55,420 --> 00:09:03,730
So probably of I think that w I feel like this would be clear once we apply it in the actual category analysis of exactly how are things that.

62
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,410
Tricky analysis. The question that.

63
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,910
I feel like this when you go over in the example.

64
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:50,650
So we're we're four for the main goal of this analysis is to estimate the probabilities of an offspring offspring's genotype.

65
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:59,110
Given that we assume a certain mode of inheritance and we assume hardly one word for the genotypes of grandparents.

66
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:07,420
And then we basically kind of put up our assumptions and calculate the probabilities across the whole pedigree.

67
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:15,700
Those are the steps. We'll go over them. Now, in the example, hopefully that would be clear.

68
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:22,860
But were there any questions or. Okay.

69
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:39,550
So we'll go over that in the example. So let's go over to the to.

70
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:50,620
You know, there was a problem with how the quiz was graded, so I'll just put Simpson's.

71
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:10,680
I posted. So question one Which one of inheritance has characteristics in human categories?

72
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:20,130
So every affected individuals individual has an effective parent and then does equal proportions of males and females are affected.

73
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:23,670
So the answer would be autism dominant.

74
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:30,630
So it's not explained because of the equal proportion.

75
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:35,840
And then every effect that you show has an effect that that kind of rules out being.

76
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:49,950
Obsessive. So the probability of a is the quality of a certain person has agents have less

77
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:55,590
than one probability of B is the probability of the same person has the 80.

78
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:02,040
Do you know type one? So what kind of events are those?

79
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:09,600
So why can anyone tell me why they're mutually exclusive?

80
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,560
Because it's a genotype at the same snap. So you can only have one you cannot build.

81
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,400
Yeah, exactly. So they're not overlapping. Yeah, there's the matrix.

82
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:29,460
So A and B are independent events. So probably 8.5.3.

83
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:33,000
What's really A and B occurring together.

84
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:41,280
So. So how do we to the answer is .15 as you can see how how do we get to that?

85
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:51,240
Yeah. Since they're independent events, you just have to multiply multiply the probabilities together.

86
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,050
So five times. .3.1. Yes, that's.

87
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:01,810
Yes. Okay. So A and B are independent events.

88
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:10,810
So meaning the occurrence of A does not affect the occurrence of B, but they are not mutually exclusive so they can happen together.

89
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:19,630
So it's probability of 8.5. Probability of B is point B, what's the probability of A or B occurring so?

90
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:30,480
Answers .65. But how do we get to it? Yeah.

91
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,700
So you add the probabilities of A and B and then you subtract the product.

92
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:42,610
Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

93
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:50,329
So it's so it's a union C and it's then that would be probability of A plus probability of

94
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:58,120
B minus probability of a intersection B which you would calculate by multiplying A and B,

95
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,780
so. So point five plus point three. That's point eight.

96
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Then minus the product. So minus .15, which would be .65.

97
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:20,950
Here is this once straight from the lecture synthetically analysis salary probabilities can be calculated using hardly one word.

98
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:24,700
So for the time or the parents,

99
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:33,340
the first generation would assume how to one word and then calculate probabilities using transmission probabilities for the offsprings.

100
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,750
Any questions? Okay.

101
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:55,760
So maybe you can. One of the problems that's over.

102
00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:00,030
Have some copies for everyone. So take one for each group.

103
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:31,180
What? Yeah, because he was shot.

104
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:54,570
Yeah, I was thinking that.

105
00:15:54,810 --> 00:16:00,060
So it's like, okay, I'll figure something out.

106
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:07,220
So we can go over question three. So what can I do?

107
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,410
You know if you don't have a house.

108
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:29,070
Thank you. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

109
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:35,500
Okay. So then what? So, I mean, it.

110
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:38,870
Probably. Probably. Yeah. So.

111
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:50,700
I guess so.

112
00:16:53,610 --> 00:17:01,980
Yeah. Just because it's just too.

113
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:38,240
Oh. Oh, yes.

114
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:07,490
This is the transmission.

115
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:13,710
That's the first step.

116
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:31,400
Oh, yeah. You. So my turn.

117
00:18:32,770 --> 00:19:22,180
It's. The that that some individuals would be able to continue to sort of look over questions to just look over this.

118
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:27,560
This must be really fun to see you sometimes.

119
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:36,050
Yeah, I was just going to bring it to you. It was like a lecture, a question for me, a lifelong thing.

120
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:57,400
It's not something you have to do.

121
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:06,590
Do you really? I think it's like saying this is my future.

122
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:11,930
So? So this is what going.

123
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:18,970
That's 21st century.

124
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:25,200
Just founder of these. So did everyone get a chance to meet Matthew?

125
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:30,580
Because I knew about this, but I thought, okay,

126
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:38,980
so question three A we're not we're on the cusp of said to calculate the probability of the following pedigree,

127
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:43,120
pedigrees do have to be identical, for example, dominant model,

128
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:52,780
where the deleterious of the big A occurs at a frequency of 0.1 in the population and hides each pedigree under a complete

129
00:20:52,810 --> 00:21:01,270
penetrance model and an incomplete penetrance model where the probability we're giving them the probability of the penetrance.

130
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:09,450
So p probability of being affected, giving you a big a big A is is one and then probability of being effective,

131
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:17,170
giving you heterozygous 6.75 probability of being infected with here small a small A's.

132
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:22,840
Oh, so the question is kind of asking for luck things.

133
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:31,660
Okay, so we will so we have two pedigrees that we would calculate the probabilities of each one separately.

134
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:42,069
So we for start with this one. So scenario one or pedigree one, and we can either do complete penetrance or incomplete penetrance.

135
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:45,730
So maybe let's do the complete penetrance model.

136
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:50,020
So there's like kind of force that of observations that you would like.

137
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:57,580
So systematically using the complete penetrance, this pedigree using the incomplete one, and then this name for this pedigree two.

138
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:03,820
Okay, so we'll do pedigree one. We will do the complete penetrance model together.

139
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:13,780
Okay. So I'm going to follow the slides of all the seven steps that we have outlined so that hopefully easy for you to apply as well.

140
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:21,610
Okay. So step one is to choose a mode of inheritance, and we're given that in the question.

141
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:32,409
So it sets out example dominance and then step to establish the penetrance of each genotype.

142
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:37,870
So we will do the complete penetrance model.

143
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:44,670
And so for that, that means like I want to see how much, like what's the probability of,

144
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:49,720
of being affected or unaffected giving given a certain genotype.

145
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:56,080
Okay. So and it's, I'm assuming a complete penetrance and it's an unresolved dominance.

146
00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:08,380
So, so probability of being affected given that you are big a big A would be 111.

147
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:13,270
So it's an autism dominant disease. This person has two copies.

148
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:21,340
We are assuming complete penetrance. Then then you that penetrance is one.

149
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:30,200
Is that clear? And then I'm going to calculate the complementary probability for the same gene and have those numbers just stand by.

150
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:39,640
Make it easier so the probability of not being affected is unaffected.

151
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:50,020
Given you are a would be interesting would be still one.

152
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:53,680
So it's so these two are complementary.

153
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,049
So if you're if you're double a big A, then you're 100% affected.

154
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:02,170
So what's the probability of not being affected? Zero.

155
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:05,320
Yeah. So those two should always add two and one.

156
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,920
That would mean now here it's all zeros and one.

157
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:13,960
But when you have incomplete penetrance, you can have like point 75 and 3 to 5.

158
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:28,299
So that's never going to be being affected, given you're a big a small a would be one one.

159
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:33,850
Yeah, because it's autosomal dominant and then I'm affected.

160
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:38,800
Using the same genotype would be zero.

161
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:44,200
And we have one set of genotypes.

162
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:51,050
What's the probability here of being affected? Zero zero.

163
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:08,780
And it's funny because it would be just that complimentary and 100% not going to be affected if you have this genotype.

164
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:17,370
Is it clear? Look at yourself for the unaffected, smiling Somali.

165
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:26,250
If there's a reason why, it's an effective probability of being not enough.

166
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:32,660
Yep. These are all effective. That all of.

167
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:42,480
Yep. So we'll use those probabilities because we have looked like people who are not affected.

168
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:45,570
We need to use the entries here. Is that.

169
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:54,420
Is that okay? So we did that penetrance probabilities for all the genotype options.

170
00:25:56,010 --> 00:26:03,270
That is step two on the slides.

171
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:12,450
And then the step three is determine the potential genotypes of each person under that mode of inheritance.

172
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:21,720
And luckily, those are given here in the question. So the genotype is this is given.

173
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:33,090
Okay. Now, step four, determine the standard genotype probabilities.

174
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:49,279
So I'm doing I'm going to call this category one and we want to calculate the genotype probabilities.

175
00:26:49,280 --> 00:27:03,740
So who are the founders? Okay.

176
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:12,760
So who are the founders here? These small, small countries, I guess.

177
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:16,840
Yeah. Yeah. The first generation or the oldest generation here.

178
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:25,800
So I'm having a have to calculate the genotype probabilities for those two people.

179
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:32,670
And for founders. What do how do we calculate those?

180
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:36,680
Artie Lindberg. Yeah. Yeah.

181
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:48,750
And then so we go back to the question and it says that the big HBO series, HBO, where you were affected, has a frequency of point one.

182
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:58,410
So that is kind of huge for you and is for you.

183
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:08,550
Oh, so what is the probability of having the A.

184
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:24,460
I'll start small this morning. So we're doing that the this one.

185
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:42,030
My name is Square. Yes. Yes. So if we say the Q is point one, then necessary P or the probability of small A is point nine,

186
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:47,940
and then the probability of little a little eight would be Q squared.

187
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:55,120
So that would be point where or why eight.

188
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:04,610
And then probability of this one, the heterozygous genotype, what would that be?

189
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:11,890
42 times 29. Yeah.

190
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:21,710
So to pick you so the head is like is under hardly one very easy to pick, you know.

191
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:27,720
Which would be so. Yeah.

192
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:36,400
Question questions like that. Okay.

193
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:43,310
So we are on step four. We did the founder genotype probabilities.

194
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:49,160
Now step five determine the transmission probabilities.

195
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:58,740
That's kind of words. We have to kind of do a setup because each percent of those will have a different transmission.

196
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:08,449
So, okay, so I'm going to set up the table and take the ability to do that.

197
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:15,080
But you can do it maybe. So for each person in the pedigree, I'm going to have the line.

198
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:44,630
Just to. So just filling in from the pedigree here, just putting in everyone's genes.

199
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:53,900
So I'm recalculating the probability of this whole category.

200
00:30:54,230 --> 00:31:00,290
That means we're going to have to have the probability of each of those genotypes and we're going to multiply them all together.

201
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:04,460
Those are independent events, and we're going to calculate one single number.

202
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:10,130
So that's what we're going to have a line for each one corresponding to the probability of the unit type.

203
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:18,570
And in that time, this one is almost like.

204
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:49,500
It's just. This.

205
00:32:32,310 --> 00:33:00,550
It's probably. Okay.

206
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:13,200
Q So it's for the probability of the genotype?

207
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,840
We talked about how if you're sounder than we're using Hardwired.

208
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:30,210
And I showed them the probabilities we calculated here. And then if you're an offspring, then we were we will use transmission probability.

209
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:35,010
So the probability of the alil kind of being inherited.

210
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:40,590
Is this confusing, those two areas? Do you guys know what I mean?

211
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:46,080
So that the probability of the genotype it can be either based on do Weinberg if

212
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:53,330
you were the founders or based on the transmission probability if you are asking.

213
00:33:54,390 --> 00:34:10,490
Yeah. Any questions? Raise your hand if it's clear and then go for the slides.

214
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:33,150
So when we are calculating. So the transmission probability is the multiplication of we have to take into account the penetrance.

215
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:40,320
So that's that's where the penetrance becomes. Okay.

216
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:44,340
Let's go back to solving the. Okay.

217
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:52,530
So let's look at first, then generation to one.

218
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:59,940
Okay. So this person here. So what is the probability of them being big?

219
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:04,580
A small. A you can use like a square if that helps.

220
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:11,190
Or just kind of calculate the probability of inheriting one of those aliens from each parent.

221
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:24,400
Do you think? As to a small square.

222
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:30,620
So if you have a four, the parents and one parent, one or the other.

223
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:38,480
Okay. So we have two options.

224
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:45,950
Let's see. What's the probability of being heterozygous? 15.5.

225
00:35:47,220 --> 00:36:02,130
Yeah, because you have to. Because the square which was set to order for so the probability of being hit is like it is point five.

226
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:11,470
Is that fair? We can actually use the same table for everyone.

227
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:19,629
Or you can say in this locus here, the big A, you can have the there's two options.

228
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:24,120
It's like half from each.

229
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:40,660
So probability of small a small egg like five in here and it's .5.5.

230
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:50,170
So that's the probability of this kid here having this genotype based on his parents and all the assumptions we made in the model.

231
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:57,850
But there's something else that we want to take into account, which is whether which is the penetrance of the genotype.

232
00:36:57,850 --> 00:37:03,430
So how likely it is to show to show like we expressed or nation.

233
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:09,400
And for that, I'm going to fill in the penetrance that we calculated here.

234
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:15,870
I'm going to go and see like this person is unaffected and has this genotype.

235
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,650
So I'm going to look here and look on that for this person.

236
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:24,300
I'm going to need to fill in right now.

237
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:36,170
And then this person is affected and has the heterozygous genome type.

238
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:41,090
So that would be also one.

239
00:37:41,340 --> 00:38:00,590
Yeah. And that for the affected it's again the same one unaffected and small, even one through reflected.

240
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:11,110
Anthony and Henderson.

241
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:16,630
Good morning to uninfected and smiling.

242
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:25,020
They need someone. Key question so far, is that kind of easy to follow?

243
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:44,380
Okay. And then. So the probabilities would be now a multiplication of the gene and type times for each person.

244
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:53,520
When we take into account the penetrance, then the total probability would be a multiplication of those to two columns.

245
00:38:55,020 --> 00:39:22,700
So. But the main one here. And then finally to get that.

246
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:26,850
So this this is the probability of each genotype in this category,

247
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:36,630
given the assumptions that we put and given the frequency that we assumed under this sleep penetrance model.

248
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:41,380
And the final probability of that we would be.

249
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:54,580
Would it be? So these are independent events.

250
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:59,920
Each person having this kind of probability of two type would not affect the other person.

251
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:05,680
And we want to look at the probability of A and B, C and D all those events.

252
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:11,610
So we would. But. Multiply them over.

253
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:15,940
Yes. Yeah. So you're multiplying all of those times together.

254
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:24,880
That would be, you know, 091 st.

255
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:31,750
21. Okay.

256
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:49,690
Yeah. So I know for those probably were given the genotypes and the pedigree,

257
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:54,489
but how would it change if we didn't know the genotypes and we had to especially like for

258
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:59,880
autosomal recessive some of the parents could be homozygous dominant or heterozygous.

259
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:07,870
How would we account for that? And so I feel like you would always be given some form of genotype to calculate that.

260
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:20,739
And in normal scenario, like I know, like so there's a lot of assumptions that would go into this and it's basically you can run the calculation

261
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:25,450
based on one scenario and then based on the other scenario and then calculate the total probability.

262
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:32,050
But you probably won't be asked to do that. And then yeah, no, I was going to ask.

263
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:39,760
So can someone interpret this probability of pedigree for me or like kind of make sense of what this number means?

264
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:51,480
So it really is hard to interpret. There's not doesn't have an interpretation per say.

265
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:57,580
But if we run this analysis under a different scenario, you would get a different probability.

266
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:01,270
So possibly a bigger number or a smaller number.

267
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:12,370
And if we're trying to see how well our assumptions fit the pattern, we want to have the biggest probability possible.

268
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:21,670
So so when we're trying to choose which is the most likely scenario where we would want to choose the one that would have the highest probability.

269
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:28,000
So we assumed that the total probabilities were all independent.

270
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:32,670
But did we account for the dependance of the offspring on the parents?

271
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:36,010
With the transmission probabilities. Is that what we're considering?

272
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:39,430
Correct? Yeah. Yeah. Correct. Yeah.

273
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:50,910
Yeah. That one would be here. And then the offspring themselves are definitely not dependent.

274
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:56,520
And then the transmission that comes for the movement of the entire generation, which.

275
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:07,330
Any more? Yeah. Is there, like, a high probability, like, threshold?

276
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:14,770
I don't believe so. I mean, at least I'm looking at the answer key, and then they're all kind of smallish numbers.

277
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:24,590
And you would just compare them to each other. Yeah. Any more questions?

278
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:33,830
Is that helpful to kind of understand the slides? So you think this one should be captured on campus?

279
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:43,210
Right. If anyone tried, like, up like on the Panopto recording, I think it's okay.

280
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:50,480
It's. So do you want me to?

281
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:55,280
I'll keep it up just to meet you. So if no one has any more questions,

282
00:43:56,870 --> 00:44:06,439
I guess you can either finish working on problems that one if you still have to solve or if you

283
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:13,610
want to go ahead and get started on problem this the practice problems that kind of work on it.

284
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:26,260
Yeah, that's what I'm here for. You name equals three.

285
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:58,560
So we have to continue. So we need to use the last step to say no because that is not very accurate.

286
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:09,070
So this information. Right. But since these are all supposed to go back so far, so it's like, good.

287
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:16,880
They're just. Yeah. So the conditions for an incomplete learning uses these values.

288
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:27,649
Yes, yes. Yes. Know that that's just for the patches, not for the real problem.

289
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:37,160
They have the same thing for. Sorry.

290
00:45:37,490 --> 00:45:41,670
So. Yes. So yes. Yeah. We would do this since 90 years.

291
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:57,880
It's 100% that they wouldn't do just like this is that they have to be able to assess like it's like, okay,

292
00:45:58,010 --> 00:46:14,750
that this for example, when she says which and she says the 117 frequency and she said business name.

293
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:19,550
And so I guess that's why I didn't do that.

294
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:27,840
And we started doing this, but I don't think I would be happy with this.

295
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:34,249
Are you serious? Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

296
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:37,930
One generation of girls. Yeah.

297
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:45,350
Right. So anything like this, that makes sense because.

298
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:57,110
Yeah. So using the previous generation, we go back to 1972.

299
00:46:58,790 --> 00:47:04,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

300
00:47:04,130 --> 00:48:00,620
Thinking about something which is obvious to me that I was like, Yeah, I need to like to know like cute students or just deciding how to get this one.

301
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:12,660
You do not know. You don't know things you can do.

302
00:48:14,510 --> 00:48:18,360
So I haven't.

303
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:29,130
I see. I think it's so. Yeah. I mean it's just like, you know, I guess.

304
00:48:29,150 --> 00:48:33,030
I mean, yeah, yeah.

305
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:37,380
By continuing. Yeah.

306
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:43,800
So it's like I do it just because it's the same kind of.

307
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:54,840
Yeah. I think people should know.

308
00:48:56,610 --> 00:49:12,030
I think people make me go to classical stations, which is something that's.

309
00:49:12,030 --> 00:49:16,350
It's a possibility. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

310
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:20,420
So we just. We just have to get used to it, you know?

311
00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:29,290
I don't think any American. Oh, yes, we used to.

312
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:44,300
Yeah. So it's been a long time.

313
00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:54,280
I think I might. No, thanks.

314
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:04,500
I guess this one we're sure the.

315
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:17,040
But it's so much confusion. So it's like two probabilities nicely increases like our two.

316
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:23,390
Like we're in the three x right at all each.

317
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:34,220
Yeah. So that's, I'm putting them out there, their hands like that for some reasons.

318
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:47,940
It's just that in the beginning, heterozygous appears to.

319
00:50:55,900 --> 00:51:01,300
I think it's just.

320
00:51:04,810 --> 00:51:09,890
It's personal. It's just. Yeah, it's I don't know.

321
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:21,820
It's not actually doesn't in sense that if you look at this that is giving all the

322
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:29,200
statistics that he is giving some of the lines of like it doesn't go with it.

323
00:51:30,190 --> 00:51:59,090
And this has she has said that she she's going to give it to all her son is going to be beginning to see what to do with that.

324
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:06,930
Yeah. Because it was pretty sexually dominant.

325
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:16,990
You have to give it to the daughter and her daughter is giving it to you.

326
00:52:17,290 --> 00:52:17,530
Yeah.

327
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:28,030
Because if there was something that should give her something, that would still have it because it's actually more sensitive and the son gets it.

328
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:33,640
You know, we have the background. It's oh, we have the daughters of the daughters.

329
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:44,550
I can continue to teach him.

330
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:57,670
So wonderful to see happens to.

331
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:04,720
I think it's just about you already have.

332
00:53:06,790 --> 00:53:23,620
There's no way you can spend as much time as possible and stuff without excellence in this sense.

333
00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:46,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

334
00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:57,310
I guess so.

335
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:08,930
Yeah, yeah. Because you used to, you know.

336
00:54:10,850 --> 00:54:21,970
And so she is first and foremost, but also also grandmother, you know.

337
00:54:22,330 --> 00:54:27,290
Yeah, but how would you accept something like.

338
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:39,610
Oh, sorry. I mean, like. But then mom is, is literally okay and then you to have a little.

339
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:53,500
Yeah, you have this. I'm telling you, it's just like I don't think there's any other words.

340
00:54:54,450 --> 00:54:58,870
It's just like, you know.

341
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:36,490
Estimates suggest that she would like to make ends meet with three students say she has since moved forward and she would

342
00:55:36,520 --> 00:56:00,050
like to take that get used to be you know one of the very best daughters if you have like six months or something.

343
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:11,960
So that can be dominated by writing down this kind of water from the rest of the.

344
00:56:14,510 --> 00:56:20,260
I mean, I don't like this one. I agree.

345
00:56:20,430 --> 00:56:31,250
I think there's nothing to see here, but I just think it's great.

346
00:56:31,710 --> 00:57:03,290
So, yeah, it would just be very interesting coincidence that only the voice of Christ, in my view, is something you need to know.

347
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:08,629
Not the second question.

348
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:35,120
It's going to be quite a few, and I think it's happening in the second because it just seems like this is a sister site to me.

349
00:57:35,510 --> 00:57:47,090
I would be her first cousins, so her first cousin once removed Queen of England.

350
00:57:48,210 --> 00:57:53,720
You probably got two, five, six predictions are constructed, of course.

351
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:03,260
So I think one thing is for sure.

352
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:12,740
And yeah. Do you think that she looks so out of his normal recessive if she doesn't use any like she could be?

353
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:27,020
Oh she's big three will also get these processes.

354
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:37,100
She then she could also so because like if he didn't give them as much because of his smile a smile a lot years ago or big a smile.

355
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:44,190
Yeah, there's a customer. But I think the reason that just the kids.

356
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:49,580
So the kids. Yeah. Kids could either be childless so they have to be.

357
00:58:49,730 --> 00:58:55,580
Has their spouses either.

358
00:58:55,580 --> 00:59:00,550
Yeah. Yeah.

359
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:06,200
Same for a from the past years.

360
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:21,540
Well, that's what we're trying to figure out in terms of the positives versus just sort of stuff that, you know, hey, going to get out there.

361
00:59:21,570 --> 00:59:29,840
And it's a function of that next week.

362
00:59:30,270 --> 00:59:34,890
And then you have to.

363
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:42,960
To get to this point. I'm working with teachers.

364
00:59:43,270 --> 01:00:05,490
They work with resources pretty much over the last six years since actually working hard to a lot of things like that,

365
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:23,140
making it like 0% chance or 0%, 100% chance, which it's also okay.

366
01:00:23,310 --> 01:00:35,880
So you know for sure that you have to be serious and they have to inherit knowledge.

367
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:53,190
Again, it has to be smart because that's what we have to happen here.

368
01:00:55,670 --> 01:00:59,830
I probability here that she's a kid. So we take those times each other.

369
01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:08,230
So there's a point. So 20% year, it's false because we have to consider these.

370
01:01:08,230 --> 01:01:11,770
And these are just this one.

371
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:22,590
The daughter. It's the same thing.

372
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:27,650
They can either both be homozygous dominant or heterozygous.

373
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:43,260
So we do this. So we have to take into account the possibilities of disappearance.

374
01:01:44,610 --> 01:01:51,930
It seems like that's what we're doing in this case.

375
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:56,920
That's what I'm great. So.

376
01:02:24,390 --> 01:02:36,670
This has to be seen like the busses to.

377
01:02:52,900 --> 01:03:11,600
Not carrying carried away. I think it was and probably is that it's great to hear your it on a word that people sometimes sometimes.

378
01:03:12,450 --> 01:03:19,590
Okay. Sometimes are not good.

379
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:37,170
Sometimes so be would be .25. It's okay just to know.

380
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:45,440
Yeah. Since then.

381
01:03:50,530 --> 01:03:57,570
These are independent. He's got this.

382
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:04,610
You multiply the. Yeah.

383
01:04:05,690 --> 01:04:08,780
They're they're their career probabilities.

384
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:16,370
And it just means.

385
01:04:17,150 --> 01:04:22,680
Yeah. Yeah. Because they're independent events and it's an opportunity.

386
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:29,910
So they're trying to find.

387
01:04:47,050 --> 01:05:09,870
So this the engineers, you just have to listen to this for this one segment.

388
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:22,610
Yes, we. Which doesn't make sense.

389
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:41,610
Smooth transitions. Oh.

390
01:05:48,330 --> 01:05:55,690
It's female. I mean, like.

391
01:05:56,780 --> 01:06:19,060
If you. It's just small business swapping supply routes.

392
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:23,889
That's why they decided to close. Yes, but, you know.

393
01:06:23,890 --> 01:06:29,670
But you didn't want to do business.

394
01:06:31,670 --> 01:06:44,640
So it's more. So if it's just one or two things.

395
01:06:47,030 --> 01:06:51,410
If that's the case. Millions. Yeah.

396
01:06:51,800 --> 01:07:08,600
This just has to be. Yeah.

397
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:25,230
Yeah. Yeah, it's.

398
01:07:28,290 --> 01:07:33,380
Here. You can see that so many.

399
01:07:40,150 --> 01:07:59,700
Continue to have the opportunity to experience what.

400
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:13,970
Yes. To do, which is to practice, you see.

401
01:08:14,350 --> 01:08:33,020
So. So you just had to take things like using the actual.

402
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:41,900
Coming to terms. So.

403
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:49,180
Speech, please.

404
01:08:57,830 --> 01:09:00,920
Do you still want us to calculate using this frequency?

405
01:09:04,430 --> 01:09:10,080
Yeah. Yeah. We're just looking for resources.

406
01:09:10,910 --> 01:09:15,620
Okay. Thank you for that. Actually, just.

407
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:23,910
I'm just. That's.

408
01:09:30,850 --> 01:09:33,880
I did it that same.

409
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:52,650
In the. In your business.

410
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:57,640
Just want to support. But the point is what happens is.

411
01:10:01,570 --> 01:10:10,510
You can use this one to support the subjects and because you can use it.

412
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:18,310
Since. What do you think?

413
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:32,120
And you may be guessing. So we need you to be my best friend because no one knows.

414
01:10:33,590 --> 01:10:39,650
Just so you know, these two things together.

415
01:10:40,250 --> 01:10:58,810
So this was. So she went, Oh my God, this is just so and.

416
01:11:08,270 --> 01:11:17,840
I'm going to be okay with nothing.

417
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:21,650
This is so.

418
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:58,590
Yeah. Okay. So if she's for beginners section, we make small tables at lunch and you hear this.

419
01:11:58,610 --> 01:12:01,870
So thing, this is your parents.

420
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:16,460
These things you can think about had something to do with this.

421
01:12:19,570 --> 01:12:25,500
Yes. Well, if you don't just say something, just think about it.

422
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:33,470
I'm so happy to see this prince competing this time.

423
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:59,080
This is something that happens in the small days since this is like two terms and there's like two ways that you can get it right.

424
01:13:00,430 --> 01:13:12,720
Like this. So that. For me, it's too many for this.

425
01:13:12,780 --> 01:13:22,860
My main concern is also a sense.

426
01:13:25,700 --> 01:13:34,260
And then this one. It's just something that she's been making since its inception.

427
01:13:34,670 --> 01:13:38,540
I mean, you can make something you expect.

428
01:13:38,780 --> 01:13:46,230
And one thing that I see and this is what you expect and this is what you see is I spider was so,

429
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:58,340
you know, so complete intelligence means that you just simply means that, you know, it's crazy.

430
01:13:59,630 --> 01:14:13,010
But I think just victimology, given that this is something that I did do, especially around this phase, it's only like.

431
01:14:14,510 --> 01:14:22,200
So in the complete tensions with me that have been the picture of the house, that would be all the.

432
01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:39,490
But you should have the feeling that you have this chance to do something like this.

433
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:49,360
So those are the.

434
01:14:56,030 --> 01:15:08,360
Since. So this is actually given to Wall Street.

435
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:16,310

436
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:37,460
Okay. Yeah.

437

442
01:16:43,970 --> 01:16:52,280
That's nice. Okay. So I just wrote that because I have been using.

443
01:16:53,630 --> 01:16:59,450
Oh, okay. I thought I understood that. Yeah. I was like, this is. Yes, I get that.
