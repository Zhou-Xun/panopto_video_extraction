1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,960
We're going to get some more shots.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:25,250
And right now, the breaking news over the last time that we know and it has been the.

3
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:42,520
Yes. She's that kind of good.

4
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:46,460
Yeah. You don't have to ask. That's up to her.

5
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,740
I do. Okay. That's about all. But listen, I'm going to go.

6
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,660
It's almost like I was so angry.

7
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:04,090
Sorry more.

8
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:23,390
Or you might want to think about what it's going to be like.

9
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:44,360
I sense that I'd like to be just like you, but I like to think that you can also be like me.

10
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:49,189
Yeah. So there's also this kind of conceptual signal.

11
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:58,720
But I don't know, I suppose I kind of wish my focus right there.

12
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,150
Yeah, I think that's right.

13
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:17,230
I don't think. Really. Like I said, you know.

14
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:35,270
For 34 years it's been like you have 622 and then other people do.

15
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:43,970
So that's kind of where my head. But I think it's not, you know, having enough time that.

16
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:50,270
Yeah. Have something like that. All right. Good afternoon, fellows.

17
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:55,139
Sorry, I'm running behind. I left my phone in the room, my office.

18
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,350
So you can't do anything about the duo anymore, so.

19
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:05,060
Good thing I had it with me in the office, at least. Okay, well, welcome again.

20
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:13,730
Good to see you all. Today, we're going to talk about proximity analysis, which we kind of knew we didn't start last week.

21
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:17,630
Right. We kind of did work on distance measures and things like that.

22
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:23,659
So today we're going to dig a little deeper into proximity analysis and hopefully we can get started

23
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:30,770
with cluster analysis of hotspots and cold spots and things like that by the end of today's session.

24
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,620
So that's kind of the overall plan for today.

25
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:42,710
I have also on Zoom today because one of the student presenters is at a conference and she was willing to present via Zoom.

26
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:50,300
So we're on Zoom at the moment. Just to let you know, I just made a slide so I can keep the link readily available to me.

27
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:58,490
Today is election day. If you did not know that. So please, if you haven't done so already, vote.

28
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:02,720
Now, the polling places here close at 8 p.m. today, right?

29
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:07,010
I haven't voted, so I've got a rush right after class and vote.

30
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:13,340
So if you haven't done so already, I encourage you to participate in our civil society by voting.

31
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:20,300
All right. So just a little reminder of that for all of you.

32
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:34,160
Okay. Today, we're going to think about proximity analysis by looking at issues of buffers and buffers and joins to measure density.

33
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:43,850
We've talked a bit about this in class to the concept of developing buffer zones around a specific features on a map like schools,

34
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:49,520
banks or grocery stores or hospitals, things like that.

35
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,690
Some of you reviewed papers like that for your first or second assignment,

36
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:04,700
so we're going to get into how to create those buffers and how to use them with this spatial drawing tool to create measures of density,

37
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:08,240
meaning the intensity of something on your map.

38
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:17,810
Okay. And then we're going to talk about distance measures and how distance measures can be used to measure clustering.

39
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:27,770
So we'll talk about the near tool and measures of clustering that use distance as a way to to define clustering as point level data.

40
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:35,719
And then I hope that we can get to the idea of clustering in more broadly and talk

41
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:43,310
about these concepts of global and local clustering of GIS data and spatial data.

42
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:51,350
So global clustering, I'll define what that is and describe a commonly used measure for global clustering.

43
00:05:51,830 --> 00:06:02,209
And then we'll talk about local clustering, which is really the the analysis you do to identify hotspots, cold spots and outliers.

44
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:09,080
And we'll try to get into that today. And if you don't cover all of that today, we'll have some time next week to work on that stuff.

45
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:15,680
And I want you to start thinking about how you may incorporate some of these concepts in your final project if it's relevant to you.

46
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:21,080
Okay. Next week, just looking ahead a little bit.

47
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:26,720
Most of this session will be focused on you guys working on your final project.

48
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:30,680
And we'll wrap up any of the clustering work that we don't finish today.

49
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:39,149
On Tuesday next week, we were supposed to talk about field data collection today, but I just don't think we have time to get into that very much.

50
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:45,260
So we're going to skip that material and then talk about these issues around proximity analysis.

51
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:52,960
Now, if you're interested in learning about collecting your own data, there are a variety of tools out there.

52
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:56,480
And I'll just point you out to a couple of history tools.

53
00:06:56,510 --> 00:07:08,180
One is called our online field maps, and that's a relatively easy to use system to create forms that also collect this information.

54
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:19,280
Okay. The other commonly used tool in this is survey one, two, three, which is also an Israeli product.

55
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,800
And that collects more complicated kind of questionnaire data, which you could.

56
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:34,430
Too often she'll tag the question you do or you collect, but lot of different tools out there that do questionnaire research or survey research.

57
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:42,800
You know, does it have to be household surveys where you can survey locations, businesses, parks, all kinds of things?

58
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:49,790
A lot of those survey tools collect this data on the background so you can get location data pretty readily,

59
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:53,810
like Qualtrics does that as a default Redcap,

60
00:07:53,810 --> 00:08:02,270
which is a commonly used system to collect patient data and and survey data that uses that very, very readily.

61
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:08,870
So those tools also captured the black lung information, which then you can use to display on G.I.s.

62
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:12,980
You guys should all know how to do that by now. Okay. All right.

63
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:16,760
So that's what we're going to cover today and what we're kind of missing today.

64
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:22,700
All right. So let's talk about proximity analysis in these three broad categories.

65
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,470
Right. Basically,

66
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:36,440
the idea we're thinking about here is thinking about of distance between features and how if distances between features is not randomly distributed,

67
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:42,770
then you can measure measure concepts of clustering together or dispersion.

68
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:48,020
Okay. And then this also issue that features have attributes.

69
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:54,679
So our like features surrounding each other and dislike features dispersing away from each other.

70
00:08:54,680 --> 00:09:00,829
Is that happening in the data? There are some things we can understand by doing proximity analysis in.

71
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:07,220
One type of proximity allows us to look at density of things in a specific area.

72
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:19,400
For example, we've talked about the number of tobacco retailers within maybe 500 feet or 1000 feet of schools in parks.

73
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:27,800
Similarly, you can measure the number of homes within one mile radius of grocery stores and vice versa.

74
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:35,900
How many grocery stores are around a neighborhood? So you can create measures of density that way that are relatively simple.

75
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:43,850
You can also measure distance, which we kind of did last time, where we measure the distance between injury and and parks.

76
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:51,200
Right. You can also measure like nearest distance that we saw we did last time.

77
00:09:52,430 --> 00:10:01,010
So we can talk about nearest grocery stores or near parks or nearest service providers for health care services and things like that.

78
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:13,850
And then there's the idea of clustering, which is the clustering of of like attribute features on a map, right?

79
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:22,730
So for example, we can look at the degree of clustering in lung cancer mortality rates, which we've examined through corporate maps.

80
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,940
So we'll do that a little bit, the clustering exercises if we get to them today.

81
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:35,100
All right. So that's just an overview of what kinds of things we're trying to work on as we move forward.

82
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:45,820
Okay. So in terms of the tools we use for clustered for density, we'll use a buffering tool in the spatial joint.

83
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:56,110
For distance, we'll use a linear tool and for clustering, we'll use global and local clustering tools in this probe.

84
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:05,320
So this is just a reminder of one of the studies we read that looks at tobacco retailers and uses buffers, right?

85
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,960
So there were these little buffers that were created.

86
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:16,360
The green ones are around parks and the blue ones are around school parcels and they counted how many dots,

87
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:20,980
meaning the retailers the points are within these buffer zones.

88
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:30,940
So we will be doing a similar exercises to exercise today, to create buffers and then count the number of points within those buffer zones.

89
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:37,479
Okay, so let's do that. Let's get started with life activity activities.

90
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,889
We have a bunch of them to do today, so let's get started with that.

91
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:52,690
So that involves all of us going on to canvas and downloading the zip file for the lab data.

92
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,450
So I'm going to there are more data in there than last time.

93
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:09,610
So you do need to download and use a file for today. So I'm going to delete the old ones and download the new one.

94
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:21,280
And I'm going to put it in the see.

95
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:32,520
Here. Once you get that downloaded, you can open up your ArcGIS pro software.

96
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:40,920
While you're doing that, I just want to remind you all to sign up for meetings with me.

97
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:46,560
I think I have most people signed up, but not all teams have signed up to me.

98
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:55,380
So please do that by the end of this week. And if none of those times work for you, just send me an email and we'll find another time to meet.

99
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:04,800
Okay. And I also mentioned this to folks who are meeting with, which is if you need to meet more than once, I am happy to meet with you again.

100
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:13,710
So you may do a little thinking and working after we meet and then set up another meeting sometime next week for the following and so forth.

101
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:54,540
Okay. But.

102
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:12,750
So I think we we stopped at lap 28 last time because that's we're going to pick up.

103
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:22,990
So go to your lab activities, PowerPoint or you can follow on on today's slides which have all the command activity slides embedded within them.

104
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:29,610
Okay. So we're going to do first is we're going to look at injury data again.

105
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:35,270
So we didn't do this last time, right?

106
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,660
Yeah, I'm pretty sure we did. Okay.

107
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:45,000
So the idea here is, you know, you work for the Pittsburgh Health Department, you're interested in issues around injury prevention.

108
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:52,920
It's part of your work. And there have been a lot of serious pedestrian injuries involving cars in your area.

109
00:14:53,610 --> 00:15:01,709
So you want to examine these injuries and and see has that have occurred around parks and playgrounds?

110
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:07,410
Because those are areas where children tend to hang out the most and see what's

111
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:11,790
going on in terms of these injuries relative to places where kids may hang out.

112
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,250
You have two years of data. All the data are located in two different tables.

113
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:21,540
And in this activity, what you're going to do is just append the tables,

114
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:30,570
meaning that one table of injuries in 2019 and another in 2020, and you want to bring them together in one table,

115
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:39,270
actually talk to a couple of students in their final projects who may need to do that for a number of counties in their in their state.

116
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:46,770
They can do this type of work in Excel, which is easy to do, but you can also do it in Genius Proof.

117
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:53,190
So let's open up. A new map project.

118
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,480
And we'll call it pedestrian injuries.

119
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,880
So go to the middle area here and go to the map, name it,

120
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:16,560
put this tree in injuries and you can add your own name to the end of that if that helps and place that in your

121
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:28,950
guys files project folder so that since the C drive our lab folder in my genius file and project and then push.

122
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:36,750
Okay so the location here should change and point to that specific folder and then push.

123
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:44,930
Okay, so a new. Pedestrian injuries.

124
00:16:46,640 --> 00:17:00,400
Projects should open up. You can turn off the bass players if you like, and usually speed things up.

125
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:11,440
And then what we're gonna do is when you created this new project, right,

126
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:17,610
a new GIO database should have been created into that project folder called Pedestrian Injuries.

127
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:35,470
So what we're going to do is copy the pedestrian injuries data and other data and put it into the the new geo database that has been created.

128
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:44,860
So to do that, we need to get to that data. So you can add a folder by right clicking on the folder button or going up here and clicking that folder.

129
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,600
All right. And let's find that data.

130
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:52,870
It should be it should be in a couple of places, actually.

131
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:57,430
One is the data folder. No, I did not put it there.

132
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:00,460
Okay. So go to the projects folder.

133
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:06,400
And there's a pedestrian injuries project already created in the projects folder.

134
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:15,320
Well, that's right. So you know what?

135
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:22,130
I'm making a folder of connection. I apologize. So just make a folder connection to the map folder here.

136
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:33,480
Okay. And then let's view where the data are to see if it's in it is here in HB G 66 lab data.

137
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:39,160
There should be a pedestrian injuries dataset and there are a bunch of different files here.

138
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:53,580
You want to just copy over. If you pull shift down, you can do more than one selection of injuries 1219, 2020 neighborhoods and parks.

139
00:18:53,900 --> 00:19:02,930
Okay, if you copy them and then you can place them into your due database.

140
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:24,780
You're just doing this so you can get kind of used to moving data around in future classes around for one geo database to the next.

141
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:29,220
Okay. All right. So let's do this.

142
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:41,350
Let's add all of these things that we just copy and paste it into the geo database and add it to our map so you can select all of these features.

143
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:46,340
Right. Click on them and add to Current. Okay.

144
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,920
So you should add those features to the current map.

145
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:06,530
Okay. So you should see a map of Pittsburgh.

146
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:12,530
The green areas are the parks.

147
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:18,500
The blue areas are the different neighborhoods in Pittsburgh where the purple

148
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:27,400
areas and the dots are the two different featured classes of pedestrian injuries.

149
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:34,010
Okay, so this let's look at these feature classes for pedestrian injuries.

150
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:48,950
So if you look at the 2021, we see that there are 46 records in this table for player to look at.

151
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:53,240
They have to be table for the other one you see there, 48 of them.

152
00:20:54,820 --> 00:21:00,470
And so what we're going to do now is just append the two future crosses together.

153
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:04,520
So to do that, you go to the append tool.

154
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:08,510
So go to command, search that append.

155
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:20,910
And there should be an append data management tool. And in the end that opens up in the input data.

156
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:25,590
You could put 2019 and then the.

157
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:36,720
Uh, and I think, uh, the. Target data, you put 2020.

158
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:49,750
Okay, so you can select input fields, must match target fields and you can select enable and do it when you do this type of work.

159
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:58,600
That could be mistakes made. So if you take that as a easy way to undo your work and then you just click Run.

160
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:06,240
Okay. So it's completed as a quick task.

161
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:12,870
So let's now look at the injuries 2020 table.

162
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:19,200
The records should have gone up to 94. So now you'll find that the two tables together.

163
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:36,309
Okay. Now, what we should do is rename injuries 2022 injuries, all where you can do 2019 and 20.

164
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:41,440
If that even works for me, I'm just going to say all okay.

165
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:47,980
And you can remove the other injuries table because that data is replicated if you look.

166
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:57,060
Save this work if you just go back to.

167
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:06,790
Their catalog window. And refresh the database.

168
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,770
How do we not put this in the right spot? Just check it out.

169
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:30,180
It's there. Okay. One thing that we didn't do.

170
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:34,919
I don't know why it's not updating the name. I think you should do that the next time you open it.

171
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:44,940
The Jew database that we didn't do is we didn't project this data to the right area.

172
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:55,589
Right. So that should be something we should do before we go on to any other activities when we use this data.

173
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:58,850
So let's do that. The way to do that is you go to map.

174
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:08,220
You go to properties. You go to coordinate system and.

175
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:25,460
See, these are all kind of in different. So it's projected to stay in Pennsylvania South.

176
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:30,440
So you've got projected systems, state plains.

177
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:42,850
Mid 1983 US feet two thirds of Pennsylvania.

178
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:49,860
So. Right.

179
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:55,650
You push your kid and you could see that the map looks a little better.

180
00:24:56,250 --> 00:25:01,980
And when you project it this way, your distance measures will be a little bit more accurate.

181
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:05,940
All right. And now let's see. Yep.

182
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:11,100
How would we know which one to choose for? Yeah, we should know.

183
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:16,830
You should kind of look that up. So let's say you're working in your particular part of the country or the world.

184
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:22,390
Just look up projection systems for that state. I know that this is in the southern part of Pennsylvania.

185
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:28,620
And then I know that for prior work that there are two different projection systems for the state.

186
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,980
In many states, we have a few of them depending on their size.

187
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:36,870
So you have to kind of look it up and choose the one that's right for your area.

188
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,650
And that type of information is available right away.

189
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:53,130
Okay. They did say in the catalog window, you should rename this.

190
00:25:53,850 --> 00:26:00,569
So let's rename that and you should open that to this lady for.

191
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:11,370
Yeah, I think the naming you did on the map contents page will not be remembered by the catalog data.

192
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:21,730
So let's just rename that and call this all. It didn't that you do it.

193
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,600
It's probably. Ooh. Did it just crash.

194
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:29,770
Yeah. Which it's probably because it's. It's in here. Let's just leave it alone.

195
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:37,540
I think it's a mistake on my part. Okay, so let's do the next thing, which is to create these buffers.

196
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:48,310
Right. So now what we'll do is use buffers to find out how many injuries are within a specific buffer zone around the park's environment.

197
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:52,060
Okay. And I think we did part two already.

198
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:57,849
So I'd forgotten that I had you guys do the correct projection system as a second step here.

199
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:05,680
So we'll go on to number three, uh, which we already have done.

200
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:12,970
And so as to the number four, we will first create a buffer for 250 feet around plaques.

201
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:25,169
Send the command line. Let's type buffer. You can see there's two options you want.

202
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:37,680
The second one, the window analysis tools and in the input feature, you will put the parks, the things you want to create.

203
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:48,510
Buffers around in the output feature will pop up and say Bar parks underscore buffer.

204
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:55,110
Let's put the number to 50 after the word buffer.

205
00:27:56,070 --> 00:28:00,090
I'm just making sure it's in the right location, which it is.

206
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:05,069
It should be in your gas files. Pedestrian injuries.

207
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:11,310
Due database. The next you will put down 250.

208
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:17,970
And in terms of the units, we'll put down fit.

209
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:25,410
Okay. Linear units, ft side type, full.

210
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,280
Meaning that all sides of the park will be. There will be a buffer.

211
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:36,270
Let's say if you're doing streets and you create street buffers, you can pick right side of the street, left side street, that type of thing.

212
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:47,550
Okay. And under method would use a geodesic method, so preserve the shape of the curvature of the planet.

213
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:53,500
It's really important when you have large distances that you might be measuring and no dissolve.

214
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:57,060
Right. And then you press the run button.

215
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:13,080
So once you do that right above the plaques layer, this should be a new layer called plaques buffer to 50.

216
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:21,650
And if you notice, it has created these little buffers around the parks.

217
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:26,000
They extend that to around 50 feet.

218
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:38,070
Okay. Okay.

219
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:45,630
One way we can count the number of injuries within 250 feet is using our selection tool.

220
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:56,400
In the past, go to maps. We've used selection by attribute, but we haven't really used selection by location.

221
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:04,910
And so you can select by location for injuries.

222
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:15,210
Okay. So the input feature and injuries, you want to select the injuries that intersect with the selecting feature, which is the plaque buffers.

223
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:23,650
So this will tell us which buffers are or which injuries are within those buffer zones.

224
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:28,920
And this is a new selection type to just push it so you can't really notice.

225
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:35,880
But some of these that's changed color to the bluish color that's used for selection.

226
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:40,620
I can zoom in to one of them right down here.

227
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:50,730
Okay. Or if you go to the attribute table for injuries all.

228
00:30:55,150 --> 00:31:04,770
It has highlighted. The different injuries that fall within 250 feet.

229
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:14,490
And I have here 15 injuries that fall within that are within two infinity that what most people die.

230
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:20,970
Look, I don't know why you put 16 on the left file, so that must be a couple graphical error.

231
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:30,380
So you have to change that. Okay.

232
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:39,440
So it's one way to kill off. Look at other ways you can clear this so you can clear the selection.

233
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:43,460
Okay, then you can save the work that you do.

234
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:56,210
Now, how about you guys take a few moments? You can work by yourself or work with the partner and create other buffers.

235
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:59,719
500 feet. 1000 feet.

236
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:05,360
And 1500 feet around the parks in this area in Pittsburgh.

237
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:11,540
And then figure out how many injuries are happening within those buffer zones.

238
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:19,790
So first, create the three buffer layers and then you can use selection by location to count.

239
00:32:20,300 --> 00:33:06,890
Right. The nice thing about Chuck just proves once you use a tool, it will remain there for them to close it out.

240
00:33:06,900 --> 00:37:21,620
So you have to really plan it again. Okay.

241
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,790
Maybe anybody need more time. Okay.

242
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,820
So what did you guys get? How many? Within 500 feet.

243
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:41,570
Great. Anybody get something different? Okay, how about five 1000 feet?

244
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:47,960
60 and 1500 feet. Okay.

245
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:59,270
So, given this type of information, what are some general recommendations you could make to address injuries near parks?

246
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:04,140
Vehicular injuries with pedestrians near parks.

247
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:19,990
Yeah. Don't allow vehicles within 200 feet of terms, but although that may not be exactly realistic, he offers.

248
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:25,820
Yeah. One thing that's nice to you get to see is like how much the lander is covered by the buffers.

249
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:30,769
So let's say you did restrict to the heat kills within 5000 feet.

250
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:41,270
That would be most of the city of Pittsburgh, although you would probably remove or reduce most injuries with cars and pedestrians.

251
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:51,260
Right. Um, so maybe there's a middle way somewhere that you find a buffer zone that's a little more, uh,

252
00:38:51,950 --> 00:39:01,640
that allows vehicles or something, but still addresses a lot of the injuries, maybe 500 or 1000 feet.

253
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:10,360
You'd have to remove cars. You could also do like speed bumps that are signage better lighting, right?

254
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:14,060
Like reduce the speed limit. Reducing the speed limit.

255
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:18,649
Great other information you may want to know as well.

256
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:22,040
What's happening is what type of people are getting hurt.

257
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:25,790
Is it kids, young kids, teenagers?

258
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:29,900
Is it what time of day is this happening?

259
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:34,760
Right. So that type of information I this. All right.

260
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:41,300
So let's do the next exercise which is using multiple ring buffers.

261
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:44,990
So we created these buffer zones individually.

262
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,610
There is a way to create all of them at once. Okay.

263
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:54,680
And they use that and for me, that tool to really generate the same kind of information.

264
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:58,280
So is learn about multiple ring buffers.

265
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:06,019
So we're going to continue working with this data set and and map project.

266
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:19,370
So in the command line type mode to pull ring buffer, the first one that pops up analysis tools.

267
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:34,820
Okay. And in the input feature, you want to put buffers around parks right through the parks in the name is multiple ring buffers.

268
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:40,970
You can change it, but I think that's good enough for now and it's being placed in the right spot.

269
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:45,330
So this time we're just going to put multiple values here.

270
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:57,950
We can put 501st in distance and as they add another 1000, add another and then do 1500.

271
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:03,740
Okay. And those are the three buffers will create the same.

272
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:19,050
Units will usually use feets feet. There will be a field that's created in the new data set and distances.

273
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:28,320
I guess you could write for a distance for that because that feel will denote what the buffer length sizes are,

274
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:40,140
will be non overlapping rings and again use geodesic as the method in any push for.

275
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:58,050
Something happened. Did that happened to you guys?

276
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:11,840
Some. Yes, some would have some. The table has been edited field to execute a field.

277
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:28,950
Okay, let's try it again. Something a lot. You may have to change the name of the output feature class to something different.

278
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:35,130
Okay. So I'm just calling it multiple ring buffered two. All of this looks correct.

279
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:47,710
And I'm going to run it again. Maybe the right closed, huh?

280
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:27,870
The table is being edited, filled to execute. Q And I don't understand what's happening.

281
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:32,940
I, I close what I'm doing and I respect my job.

282
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:48,420
So I'm going to do that right now. You see noticeable edits and I'm going to open it up again and start over.

283
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:06,860
Okay. So we're going to work with the same project file.

284
00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:18,410
The software. And I will be.

285
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:30,660
You said your processing. We did the multiple ring buffers.

286
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:37,810
Try it again, Parkes. All right.

287
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:47,060
Okay. One seems to be okay. Distance.

288
00:44:47,210 --> 00:45:02,000
500. And if the government.

289
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:15,130
Do you feel it's the. Just keep this name buffer?

290
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:23,590
No. No rings. And you guys.

291
00:45:54,150 --> 00:46:02,250
Okay. So that did solve the problem. So the folks who are restarting, we can wait a couple of minutes.

292
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:14,140
Okay. Yeah, there must have been some editing table that was not finished from a previous job that I'm good at.

293
00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:24,669
I'm not sure. But while you're waiting for your computer to reload this, I can talk about this new layer.

294
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:31,630
A new layer popped up on top of all the other buffered layers and the contents pane.

295
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:35,320
So let's take a look at that layer of data.

296
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:39,670
Right. Click on it and see the attribute table.

297
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:49,630
And here it's kind of interesting. You only have three features in this table and feature class.

298
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:55,180
So one feature is four 500 feet buffers.

299
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:01,960
The next is for 1000, and the third is for 1500.

300
00:47:02,290 --> 00:47:06,330
Okay. So we can use.

301
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:17,430
This this table to count the number of injuries within each of these buffer zones.

302
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:23,760
So we look to have the attribute table open. Let's go to selection by location again.

303
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:35,220
Selected by location. And again, we want to clear out injuries.

304
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:45,300
Okay. And it's intersecting in the selecting feature should be the ring buffer layer, multiple ring buffer.

305
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:50,310
We're okay. And then push.

306
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:59,250
Okay. Okay. So now if you click on the injuries all table and right click on it.

307
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:09,330
Oh, no, we don't have 46 in here.

308
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:30,620
So I think what I need to do. I need to bring in the other layer or redo the append, depending on where I'm at.

309
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:36,260
So please bear with me. You want to.

310
00:48:48,050 --> 00:49:06,270
Don't look. So I need to agree to the append.

311
00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:22,880
So let me do that really quickly. Okay. She would do the same.

312
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:25,710
All right. So let's do that then with the multiple ring buffers.

313
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,910
Okay. So what we're doing is opened up this multiple ring buffers.

314
00:50:51,320 --> 00:51:00,690
Attribute table. Highlight the first row, which is the 500 feet buffer zones.

315
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:06,330
Okay. So those are all selected in a map here. Okay.

316
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:22,740
Then go to selection by location and we want to kill injuries in yours and make the injuries all intersect with the multiple ring buffers later.

317
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:27,660
And then you push. Okay. All right.

318
00:51:28,650 --> 00:51:36,930
So if you go to the injuries attribute table 29 of the the 94 will be selected

319
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:43,140
just like you got when you did it previously with the different buffer cells.

320
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:51,750
So quickly, do number six and count the number that are within 1000 feet and within 1500 feet.

321
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:58,760
And so what you need to do first is to go to the park, multiple ring buffers,

322
00:51:58,770 --> 00:52:07,380
layer and select the second column a row and then redo the selection by location.

323
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:34,580
Actually, there's a hint. Uh, if you do it this way, it will only kill the ones that are between 501,000 feet.

324
00:52:35,270 --> 00:52:47,840
So if you want everything within 1000 feet, you have to select both of these rules and then do so like by location.

325
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:06,380
And the number should be close to hopefully the same. The man actually aged 66 instead of 68.

326
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:13,540
I think what happened is when I reopened it, the projection may have not stayed the same.

327
00:53:13,870 --> 00:53:17,230
So I think that could cause a problem.

328
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:30,750
Okay. But that's okay. But you get the idea. Okay.

329
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:35,580
So you guys caught up. All right, so let's do the exercise now.

330
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,160
So now you have these different buffers, right?

331
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:42,780
The 500, 1000 5000 and 2050.

332
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:50,370
Let's use something we learned last time or the previous session about spatial joints.

333
00:53:50,990 --> 00:54:03,420
Okay. So you spatial joints to count the number of buffers within the different buffer zones and to identify which parks have the most injuries.

334
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:12,360
Okay. So under number one, it says now you want to know which parts are the most in the least injuries.

335
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:21,000
Recall from previous class that we used a point to polygon spatial joint to count of patients within zip codes.

336
00:54:21,330 --> 00:54:30,090
You can use the same approach and the buffer tool to help identify which parks are the most and least injuries within 500 feet.

337
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:38,580
And then next, you can do the same kind of work with neighborhoods to see which neighborhoods have the most injuries.

338
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:52,140
Using the point two polygon spatial joint. And then there's other data in the data set here for playgrounds and schools,

339
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:57,480
and you can use the buffer tool to map injuries near those features as well.

340
00:54:58,470 --> 00:55:03,420
So this is let's do oh, let's do all three of these, if possible.

341
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:09,660
It may take a little bit time, but I think it brings in different elements of things you've learned over the last couple of weeks.

342
00:55:11,290 --> 00:55:18,610
Okay. Remember to clear your selection before you start the next kind of exercise.

343
00:56:24,090 --> 00:57:36,040
I. I think they need to for folks who have had to restart their computer.

344
00:57:37,790 --> 00:57:43,800
Uh, something happened with my. Buffer zones here.

345
00:57:45,690 --> 00:57:55,740
So in the end. They're not on the map.

346
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:04,420
Hmm. See there? Something wrong?

347
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:13,330
So I need to create my buffers for folks who have had to restart their first year per minute to create your buffers again.

348
00:59:36,360 --> 01:00:04,820
So. I may have these in a different location.

349
01:01:44,550 --> 01:01:58,260
Yeah. It didn't make any.

350
01:01:58,310 --> 01:02:02,280
I think it just clicked. Whatever. Yeah.

351
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:27,080
Is anybody stuck? All right.

352
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:39,680
I had to recreate my buffers. So the first step is, if you don't have your park buffer, 500 feet buffer, recreate it.

353
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:44,870
Because I had when I restarted my actress pro, those were not retained.

354
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:51,710
Okay. The next thing you do, once you have those buffers, the buffer created,

355
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:58,430
you can use spatial drawings to count the number of points within that buffer zone.

356
01:03:59,780 --> 01:04:05,120
So what you do first is you right click on the park buffer layer.

357
01:04:05,630 --> 01:04:12,680
So I have a park buffer, 500 foot layer, and you go to join and relate.

358
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:26,500
And go to spatial job. So the target feature is a part buffer, 500 foot layer,

359
01:04:27,220 --> 01:04:34,630
which you're going to add new variables to depending on the number of injuries or points that fall within that buffer.

360
01:04:35,290 --> 01:04:38,860
Okay. So the joint feature is injuries.

361
01:04:39,190 --> 01:04:43,540
In my case is 20. These are all the injuries on the map.

362
01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:50,890
It'll create a new output feature class. That is the joint information.

363
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:57,130
It creates a name for you. I'm not going to change it. You do a 1 to 1 join.

364
01:04:57,940 --> 01:05:02,120
Match option is intersect and then you push.

365
01:05:02,140 --> 01:05:10,290
Okay. So once it's done, there should be a new layer that pops up.

366
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:15,670
It popped up right on top here. Park buffer, spatial joint one.

367
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:25,299
If you open up that layer, you can go to the attribute table and in the attribute table there will be a field

368
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:32,260
called Join Count that tells you how many points were within that buffer zone.

369
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:45,910
So you can see that the numbers, if you sort this field in go sort descending, you can see which parks have the most injuries.

370
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,980
So if you highlight number one,

371
01:05:48,430 --> 01:05:55,630
because I have a very sorted you could highlight the first row and you can see on the map which park that's referring to.

372
01:05:56,470 --> 01:06:06,550
Okay, if you let's see you do three and all the twos, you can highlight all those that have two or more injuries around.

373
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:14,150
So about you guys practice with the 1000 foot buffer and see what you get.

374
01:06:15,050 --> 01:06:18,320
Yes. Yeah. Let's do it together.

375
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,310
Uh, do you have the buffer zones?

376
01:06:22,670 --> 01:06:31,040
All right, so what you do first is you click on the layer of data that you want to join the points to.

377
01:06:31,940 --> 01:06:38,240
So if you click on the polygon layer here, it's the buffer layer part underscore buffer 500.

378
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:42,620
So right click on that window to join in deletes.

379
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:45,830
And there's an option called spatial joint.

380
01:06:47,150 --> 01:06:57,380
So you click on that and then the target features you'll be populated with the one you right click on, which is Park Underscore Buffer 500.

381
01:06:58,070 --> 01:07:07,910
The join feature are the injuries. Yours probably says injuries all length is 20 and then you will create an output feature named for you,

382
01:07:07,970 --> 01:07:15,830
which is fine for in my opinion, it puts it in the GIO database for your project folder that you're working on.

383
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:22,160
Choose to join 1 to 1. There are multiple options here, but just choose 1 to 1.

384
01:07:22,610 --> 01:07:34,970
Keep all target features. Match Option Intersect meaning when those two features intersect with each other, you know there are multiple options.

385
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:39,020
So we'll just select Intersect and then that's it.

386
01:07:39,850 --> 01:07:52,160
Okay. So another layer popped up at the top here called part underscore buffer 500, underscore spatial, trying to look at that actually table.

387
01:07:53,600 --> 01:08:01,880
And in that attribute table, a new fields were added.

388
01:08:01,940 --> 01:08:07,100
They're not added at the end, for whatever reason. They're near the beginning of the table.

389
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:10,400
And there's a new field called Joint Count.

390
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:18,560
It's not in the park buffer 500 attribute to see there is not there.

391
01:08:18,740 --> 01:08:29,180
It's added to the new layer and this joint count is the number of points within those that buffer area.

392
01:08:30,590 --> 01:08:35,220
Okay. All right.

393
01:08:53,820 --> 01:08:57,330
So you could try number two. Number two is the same concept.

394
01:08:57,350 --> 01:09:05,250
You're counting points within polygons and the polygons for question two, which is neighborhoods which neighborhoods have the most injuries?

395
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:06,660
All right.

396
01:09:07,020 --> 01:09:22,170
So what you would do is you right click on the neighborhoods, polygon layer, go to join and release spatial joint target features and neighborhoods,

397
01:09:23,490 --> 01:09:31,860
and they'll create a new layer called Neighborhoods Underscore Spatial Joint and the feature we want to count or injuries.

398
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:36,930
We will keep the rest the same and push. Okay. Right.

399
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:42,810
And then a new layer will pop up near the top called neighborhoods underscore spatial joint.

400
01:09:43,650 --> 01:09:49,920
You're right. Click on it and look at the attribute table. You'll see a joint count variable there as well.

401
01:09:50,700 --> 01:10:01,440
And you can sort that descending and you'll see that the neighborhood number 17 called Garfield has the most injuries.

402
01:10:01,620 --> 01:10:02,370
It's right up here.

403
01:10:04,410 --> 01:10:15,899
And you can actually do symbology of the neighborhoods now on the count variable to get some kind of a corpus map of the variable later,

404
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:23,850
we're learning about clustering analysis. You can do cluster analysis with the joint count variable to see if there are hotspots in terms of

405
01:10:23,850 --> 01:10:30,770
neighborhoods that have more significantly more injuries than other ones or significantly less injuries.

406
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:42,510
Okay. How about you guys work on number three for a few minutes?

407
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:47,770
Because I kind of walk you through one and two. So number three has to do with playgrounds, right?

408
01:10:48,070 --> 01:10:53,050
And school shapefile they're located in.

409
01:10:59,570 --> 01:11:15,260
Expand this out. Under data, each page is 66 lab data and they are pay schools and then their playgrounds maybe just work with playgrounds actually,

410
01:11:15,260 --> 01:11:23,360
because as schools you have to you have to do an additional step, which is you need to geo content or displayed level on data.

411
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:28,130
So you can just work with playgrounds or you can drag in playgrounds here.

412
01:11:29,810 --> 01:11:38,360
And the playgrounds are going to put them above all the other stuff.

413
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:45,080
And then you can see that the playgrounds in many of them, they're pink on my map.

414
01:11:47,140 --> 01:11:55,630
So these are the playgrounds. So you can do a similar thing, create buffers around playgrounds, maybe create a thousand foot buffer or something,

415
01:11:56,500 --> 01:12:03,399
and then see how many do a spatial joint to count the number of injuries within

416
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:11,950
a thousand feet and then figure out which playground has the most injuries.

417
01:13:43,300 --> 01:16:25,340
Let me know if you need any help and I'll come on back. Okay.

418
01:16:25,850 --> 01:16:35,260
Do people need more time? No.

419
01:16:37,360 --> 01:17:05,450
Yes. Okay. Cool.

420
01:17:06,250 --> 01:17:10,580
All right. You want me to walk you through it? Yes.

421
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:17,570
No. Does it look like you're okay if you need to raise your hand?

422
01:17:18,290 --> 01:17:22,769
Okay, good. Did you find out which park has the most or not?

423
01:17:22,770 --> 01:17:27,950
The park playground has the most injuries.

424
01:17:28,460 --> 01:17:37,690
Kids. I haven't done it, so I don't have the answer.

425
01:17:38,350 --> 01:17:47,280
I do remember nine object 89 and 32 three.

426
01:17:47,590 --> 01:17:51,879
Okay. And I see consistency. So. Excellent. All right. All right.

427
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:58,960
So that's our use of buffer tool and buffer and spatial joints to measure things like issues around density.

428
01:18:00,910 --> 01:18:04,239
So, you know, just to give the summary, right.

429
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:07,300
We basically used how many points are within a buffer area.

430
01:18:07,930 --> 01:18:12,370
So we looked at injuries within 250 feet, etc.

431
01:18:13,150 --> 01:18:23,260
Similarly, you can count other things like alcohol outlets within a buffer zone, grocery stores or health care service points, etc.

432
01:18:23,770 --> 01:18:27,550
And these are the tools you would use to get that type of information.

433
01:18:27,670 --> 01:18:31,960
Buffer, multiple ring buffer and spatial joints.

434
01:18:32,410 --> 01:18:40,180
All right. And how many points are there in a set of polygons?

435
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:47,870
Right. And we did this with the zipcode data.

436
01:18:47,890 --> 01:18:53,230
And you would use a spatial drawing to do that if you had pointed out already.

437
01:18:53,230 --> 01:18:58,480
And polygon data, all you need to do is a spatial join the count, the point to the important points.

438
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:08,320
And there are other measures of density for point data, not just counts, which is the simplest form.

439
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:11,590
There's something called point density and kernel density,

440
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:19,450
which takes into account issues of distance between points in the measurement of density in more nuanced ways.

441
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:26,800
So if you're interested in learning about those measures, there are great examples of them in the RTX profile.

442
01:19:27,370 --> 01:19:32,080
So I encourage you guys to learn about new tools on your own and see if you can apply it to your work.

443
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:40,330
Okay. And now I think we can start a little bit on distance measures.

444
01:19:41,770 --> 01:19:45,819
I think we can pull this off before we do the student presentation.

445
01:19:45,820 --> 01:19:48,940
So let's do that. So we're going to measure distance now.

446
01:19:48,940 --> 01:19:52,420
I thought we did this last time, but I guess I didn't remember correctly.

447
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:59,860
So we're going to measure the nearest distance between points and polygons and necessary lines.

448
01:20:00,310 --> 01:20:07,360
So in this case, we're going to find out which are the parks that are the closest to pedestrians,

449
01:20:07,410 --> 01:20:11,710
which means we figured out how many injuries within a specific zone.

450
01:20:12,220 --> 01:20:24,400
Now we're going to see which parks are within which are the closest parks to the injuries to doing this type of work we can use to do this work,

451
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:31,570
we'll use the near tool. So let's go to a lab activity number 31.

452
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:38,770
I think we can continue to work with the same Pyrex file.

453
01:20:39,860 --> 01:20:46,729
Okay. And we're going to use the injuries all layer in the park slope and all the other layers

454
01:20:46,730 --> 01:20:52,830
you could probably turn off and set maybe neighborhoods so that we can oriented ourselves.

455
01:20:52,850 --> 01:20:56,860
Okay. So parks, neighborhoods and injuries zones, all we need at the moment.

456
01:20:58,750 --> 01:21:06,370
So the near tool will help us figure out which which are the parks nearest to the injuries.

457
01:21:08,140 --> 01:21:27,650
So in the command line, you can type in near. And in the input feature to cope injuries all in the new three near feature is parks.

458
01:21:32,970 --> 01:21:42,840
Okay. And then check the box for location and angle and it tells you which fields will be created.

459
01:21:45,530 --> 01:21:55,700
When you take those marks and we want to use geodesic as the method and then you push round.

460
01:22:00,420 --> 01:22:03,540
So new fields should be added to the injuries all.

461
01:22:06,490 --> 01:22:19,390
Blair. So if you open up that layer, you'll see that more stuff was added near feature, near distance.

462
01:22:19,510 --> 01:22:24,190
I think this is the distance in feet.

463
01:22:26,230 --> 01:22:33,550
These are the coordinates and this is the angle at which that feature is located relative to the parks.

464
01:22:35,570 --> 01:22:41,440
Mm hmm. So let's look at the symbolize this information that we've just generated here.

465
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:45,310
You can right click on the injuries all layer.

466
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:57,550
We've got a symbology and we're going to use single symbology here, single symbol.

467
01:22:58,130 --> 01:23:02,780
Click on this red dot or whatever color it is on your screen.

468
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:13,160
You know, I'll give you some options there. And under Gallery, let's search for Arrow.

469
01:23:13,170 --> 01:23:19,000
So we're going to turn these dots into arrows and then point them towards the nearest talk.

470
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:24,020
Okay. So there are multiple areas of pop up.

471
01:23:24,020 --> 01:23:29,120
The one I'm choosing to work with is arrow marker four right here.

472
01:23:30,090 --> 01:23:36,709
Okay. And let's change the size of that arrow to be appropriate.

473
01:23:36,710 --> 01:23:41,570
It's 14. Now, if you go to properties, you can change the size of it and it's going to make it ten.

474
01:23:42,890 --> 01:23:46,850
Okay. And then the angle of the arrow, let's make it point up.

475
01:23:47,780 --> 01:23:51,020
Okay. So it's right now it's sideways then. Right, horizontal.

476
01:23:51,140 --> 01:23:56,720
We're going to make it 90 degrees and pointed up and then you put apply.

477
01:23:57,440 --> 01:24:10,910
So all the points that turn into these arrows pointing up and click back and there there's option very symbology by attribute.

478
01:24:11,270 --> 01:24:22,520
Okay. And the attribute you want to change it by is the rotation attribute which is located in the field near angle.

479
01:24:23,450 --> 01:24:27,020
Okay. And it tells you there are two options.

480
01:24:27,650 --> 01:24:38,060
We want to choose a geographic area and once you choose geographic in the field, the arrows will be pointing in all different directions.

481
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:43,579
Okay. And if you examine the arrow, let's just pick one randomly.

482
01:24:43,580 --> 01:24:51,770
I'm going to just pick this quadrant up here. And you should see that, you know, this is an injury and it's pointing towards the nearest.

483
01:24:57,020 --> 01:25:04,280
Okay. And this is another entry pointing towards its nearest point, so on and so forth.

484
01:25:06,290 --> 01:25:18,349
Okay. Okay.

485
01:25:18,350 --> 01:25:21,589
So let's let's make another use symbology again.

486
01:25:21,590 --> 01:25:25,490
But this time will symbolize a different variable that was created.

487
01:25:25,790 --> 01:25:34,220
Right, which is the near distance variable. So they'll tell us how far that injury is from a plot.

488
01:25:34,610 --> 01:25:46,190
Okay. So if you right click on injuries all and make a copy of it and then click on map, right click on map and push paste.

489
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:54,350
You should see two instances of injury. Okay, let's pick the top one in the symbolize that one a bit differently.

490
01:25:55,640 --> 01:26:00,020
So go to symbology. And this time you want to do graduated symbols.

491
01:26:01,930 --> 01:26:05,770
So you choose graduated symbols.

492
01:26:07,270 --> 01:26:11,620
The field we will use to do that with is near distance.

493
01:26:13,660 --> 01:26:18,760
There's no normalization because you don't need to divide by anything method.

494
01:26:20,020 --> 01:26:28,240
I prefer quantile. In most cases so many is quantile, especially because this doesn't look well distributed.

495
01:26:29,140 --> 01:26:34,330
And we can say we have five different classes groups,

496
01:26:34,930 --> 01:26:43,870
five different classes and minimum size of make it to the smallest circle and the largest circle will be.

497
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:49,650
Okay. And then you can just push.

498
01:26:49,890 --> 01:27:03,990
I guess you don't really need to push anything. Dockett And then you can see on the map, uh, we turn off the other injuries later.

499
01:27:03,990 --> 01:27:15,420
So each circle is an injury and the size of that circle tells you how far it is from the park.

500
01:27:16,050 --> 01:27:21,480
So the bigger the circle, the further away that injury is from, okay?

501
01:27:21,990 --> 01:27:25,680
The smaller the circle, the closer it is to a park.

502
01:27:27,060 --> 01:27:35,070
So one example would be maybe in this one area here, there is a circle here which is really right next to a park.

503
01:27:36,030 --> 01:27:41,280
There's an injury here, which is a little bit maybe further away from a park.

504
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:46,140
And then you have a larger circle, which is even further than this one from the park.

505
01:27:46,950 --> 01:27:52,590
So in this way, you can identify the injuries that are closest to park.

506
01:27:52,830 --> 01:27:58,200
And with this angle, information identifying which park was the closest yet.

507
01:27:58,590 --> 01:28:02,640
I can't blame my therapist or my circle from my mouth.

508
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:07,980
Hmm. I just had the. The background, like the neighborhoods in the parks.

509
01:28:08,010 --> 01:28:11,370
But my symbols let me come around and take a look.

510
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:19,769
I mean, maybe your layers are not organized. The purple there, like, for example, I want to you an arrow.

511
01:28:19,770 --> 01:28:28,380
They just disappeared off my map. During his.

512
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:46,450
So when something like this happens, obviously this community is pretty good now.

513
01:28:46,780 --> 01:28:53,470
So just so that they can finish it, so that they can stick around otherwise.

514
01:28:54,670 --> 01:28:58,420
But, you know, I think we're. Yeah, maybe you want to do that.

515
01:29:01,590 --> 01:29:05,970
So that we can do the remaining work.

516
01:29:07,740 --> 01:29:12,690
You may be able to do the remaining without starting.

517
01:29:12,690 --> 01:29:15,260
Let's see. Let's let's keep working. Okay.

518
01:29:19,670 --> 01:29:26,700
I think we have a couple of more exercises and they're relatively quick, so let's go through them and then we will do the.

519
01:29:31,460 --> 01:29:39,880
Then we'll do the student presentations. Okay. All right.

520
01:29:40,690 --> 01:29:44,440
All right. So we learned how to use the near tool.

521
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:49,930
Now let's do the same kind of work. But what we can do is generate a near table.

522
01:29:50,530 --> 01:29:54,580
So this time we added data to an existing feature class.

523
01:29:55,000 --> 01:30:03,760
Right. We can do the same kind of exercise, but we can create a table of the data in a tabular format instead of a future class.

524
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:08,170
Okay. So that's exercise number 32. Okay.

525
01:30:08,180 --> 01:30:14,170
So we're going to work with the same data. So this time we're going to use the generate near table tool.

526
01:30:19,210 --> 01:30:27,940
Okay. And once you get that to know that the input feature should be near Paul.

527
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:37,810
I don't think it matters which women choose. I'm just going to use the first one, the same data in the near future as again, clerks.

528
01:30:41,320 --> 01:30:49,600
And the generated table and I creates a name for you and it places into your existing projects to your database.

529
01:30:50,860 --> 01:30:54,730
Right. Yeah.

530
01:30:55,950 --> 01:31:12,180
Okay. And and we want to check, uh, you know, angle, location and only the closest feature and method should be to your desk.

531
01:31:13,110 --> 01:31:23,300
And then you can push, right? So once you do that, a table should have popped up at the bottom of your contents page.

532
01:31:24,180 --> 01:31:33,180
And if you look at that table, it'll have the same data that was generated and added to the injuries of future class.

533
01:31:34,490 --> 01:31:43,510
Okay. I think you can do the exercise on your own.

534
01:31:43,510 --> 01:31:48,310
And I think these are pretty straightforward tools that you need to worry about it in the interest of time.

535
01:31:48,820 --> 01:31:57,700
Let's go to the next exercise, which is lab activity 33, when you make sure not skipping any slides before that activity.

536
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:08,650
Well, I am skipping slides. So let's stop here because this next lab activity has to do with cluster analysis.

537
01:32:09,220 --> 01:32:12,940
So using distance to measure clustering of point data.

538
01:32:13,480 --> 01:32:18,970
So we'll talk a little bit about clustering before we get into lab activity 33 at this moment.

539
01:32:19,330 --> 01:32:24,399
Let's take a short break and then we'll start with the student presentations and

540
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:28,420
we'll start with the remote student first and then go on to the rest of you.

541
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:32,830
The three presentations today did I get slides from every presenter?

542
01:32:32,950 --> 01:32:37,090
If you didn't send them to me, please send them to me because I think only have two of the three.

543
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:43,870
Okay, so let's take a five minute break. We'll do presentations and then they'll do another five minute break after that.

544
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:49,990
Okay. So let's come back at four.

545
01:32:50,170 --> 01:32:53,830
Let's say 4/5, 4 to 415.

546
01:32:53,950 --> 01:32:57,400
Okay. Give you a little longer break. I think you guys are getting tired.

547
01:32:57,850 --> 01:33:01,630
And so my that's the time frame. Yeah.

548
01:33:02,980 --> 01:33:06,760
And I'll support this stuff here.

549
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:15,759
So I think I am very active on this.

550
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:17,650
Let me know that she's not going to be in class.

551
01:33:17,830 --> 01:33:28,210
I'm going to grab you to ask her just to, um, he's had some issues with a friend of hers and so things for sure that yeah,

552
01:33:28,420 --> 01:33:36,790
I didn't see any email from him, so I'm glad he told me to in a class or anything else like I was on my way is so open.

553
01:33:37,660 --> 01:33:38,770
All right. Yeah, absolutely.

554
01:33:38,770 --> 01:33:46,599
And then he said he would reach out to you either tomorrow or the next day about scheduling because he lives just half hour like an hour away.

555
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:53,770
So I am just going to let him figure out when it would be best for him to meet with you, to be on campus, and then I'll just work it into my schedule.

556
01:33:54,310 --> 01:33:57,850
Okay. For your group meeting, you guys signed up?

557
01:33:58,240 --> 01:34:04,370
I don't think so yet. And so you have to meet in person.

558
01:34:04,930 --> 01:34:11,530
Okay? Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank you. I found it like a forum, but I don't know.

559
01:34:14,230 --> 01:34:20,290
I can't hear anything. What's up?

560
01:34:21,940 --> 01:34:28,890
If you knew what the patch was on arc to get it, the symbology to work towards.

561
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:36,490
I think I have to say that to do the arrow portion of this because every time I try to do it, it would crash my arc.

562
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:42,340
Really. Okay, because I think I have the same software as you guys on this.

563
01:34:43,060 --> 01:34:46,450
So let me. Oh, only when I go to try and I'm doing it on my own.

564
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:50,200
The only thing that I can update to is 3.0. And I know we don't want to do that.

565
01:34:50,260 --> 01:34:53,020
You don't want to do that. Yeah, there are some instructions for this.

566
01:34:53,020 --> 01:34:58,750
I'm going to have to send you all an email right after class, so I'll send the whole class an email about it.

567
01:34:59,230 --> 01:35:03,190
If you don't get it right away, like before you go to bed, can you remind me?

568
01:35:03,610 --> 01:35:06,670
Yes. Okay. Yes, I'm going to say right away I'm going to.

569
01:35:06,820 --> 01:35:12,640
Yeah. And other people around. But if I don't get it by the end of the day. Yeah, you should do it tonight before I go to bed.

570
01:35:12,670 --> 01:35:20,170
Okay. Thank you so much. I appreciate it because you want to. I know what you seem to do, but every time I click on it, I can do everything else.

571
01:35:20,170 --> 01:35:23,590
That's okay. Cool. Thank you. All right.

572
01:35:23,870 --> 01:35:27,490
The question we're all asked the other class, if you're that's okay.

573
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:32,230
We can talk now and I'll sort this thing out in the second. And just really a question.

574
01:35:32,300 --> 01:35:36,340
Okay. Oh, okay. You're on it, right?

575
01:35:36,340 --> 01:35:39,430
Yeah. Okay. Because I can't tell from the Zoom meetings. I know.

576
01:35:39,430 --> 01:35:40,750
I know with masks at the time.

577
01:35:41,140 --> 01:35:49,930
But yeah, we've been I've been emailing you and with Sarah there's the other student comes here and we're trying to set up this.

578
01:35:49,930 --> 01:35:53,739
I don't know if you've seen that. I have about the student feedback meeting.

579
01:35:53,740 --> 01:35:59,770
Yeah. And so our idea, it sounded like I was okay with doing it next Thursday the 17th I think.

580
01:36:00,570 --> 01:36:04,710
And we have a room. Yeah. We've been approved to go in and to try to get students actually current.

581
01:36:04,930 --> 01:36:11,440
Yeah. And the only thing I think we're really doing is having the president suggested

582
01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:15,940
putting a cap like a cap just in case a lot of students were interested.

583
01:36:16,810 --> 01:36:19,930
So I think we have. Do you think, Sarah and we haven't heard back.

584
01:36:20,230 --> 01:36:23,530
I just wanted to ask, do you think we should 20 for that would be.

585
01:36:23,770 --> 01:36:26,830
I think that's probably more than sufficient. Yeah.

586
01:36:27,070 --> 01:36:30,610
And I kind of a more you have to start to have discussions right.

587
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:34,030
Yeah. Yeah. So it seems reasonable to me or should it.

588
01:36:34,270 --> 01:36:37,929
Would you in should be even smaller. There's always the chance.

589
01:36:37,930 --> 01:36:39,240
I don't know. 20 students. What are your.

590
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:49,000
But yeah, I mean, for me, ideally it's like ten people because I think the more you have harder it gets to get feedback.

591
01:36:50,200 --> 01:37:00,370
But if we're going to do it, I would defer to her. Yeah, I wish I could come, but I have to take my wife to the airport so I can't do it.

592
01:37:00,530 --> 01:37:00,910
Okay.

593
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:09,760
Yeah, I think she's traveling because I she said in a little earlier this week that she's in D.C. for a conference, so that might be worth the women.

594
01:37:11,710 --> 01:37:14,830
This is great for a day or so, if not just in early January.

595
01:37:15,460 --> 01:37:20,920
I'll send it in actually. Now. Okay. Yeah, we can call.

596
01:37:20,970 --> 01:37:27,660
Thank you. Yeah, it's hard.

597
01:37:30,120 --> 01:37:35,150
Yeah. Oh, yeah. You know, there's nothing like, you know, whatever.

598
01:37:35,210 --> 01:37:42,970
No, I think you need to know somebody who can hear me.

599
01:37:43,510 --> 01:37:51,420
I to do it like I don't want to go when? I don't know, until I listen to anything.

600
01:37:51,580 --> 01:37:55,930
Great. Can you say something to see if we can hear you?

601
01:37:56,520 --> 01:38:00,490
Good. Yeah. Yes, we're here in person.

602
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:06,580
So right here in about 3 minutes to.

603
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:10,950
So the first week is very remote.

604
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:16,910
I mean, you had a middle ground with the rest of the two speakers from the north and to the.

605
01:38:17,980 --> 01:38:23,790
Sure. So I'm going to just check or say something when we're ready to get started.

606
01:38:23,860 --> 01:38:30,150
Yeah. So just bear with. We understand that you have to be.

607
01:41:59,640 --> 01:42:04,590
My take. Can you hear me? Excellent.

608
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:12,390
So we're ready for you to present. You want to share screen or how do you want to share your slides?

609
01:42:14,810 --> 01:42:22,940
Great. We do see it.

610
01:42:22,970 --> 01:42:29,020
Yeah. Yup.

611
01:42:29,530 --> 01:42:34,640
It looks good. So.

612
01:42:47,900 --> 01:43:18,290
But. Right.

613
01:45:46,180 --> 01:45:50,430
If there's a hand. Can you hear me? Yeah.

614
01:45:51,200 --> 01:45:51,400
Okay.

615
01:45:51,760 --> 01:46:00,550
Well, this is just based off my knowledge of the US, but I know in the US the tobacco industry has sued on the grounds like free speech violation.

616
01:46:13,710 --> 01:46:22,800
There are tobacco ads in person in stores like corner stores, and there are also ads like online and social media and YouTube.

617
01:47:42,200 --> 01:54:03,520
They? Yeah.

618
01:54:04,750 --> 01:54:07,989
Considering it's like a cultural kind of phenomenon,

619
01:54:07,990 --> 01:54:14,770
I'd probably do something that's like a community level intervention or an education campaign that seems to

620
01:54:14,770 --> 01:54:20,710
work pretty well in the US to kind of shift the message that a lot of the tobacco companies were putting out.

621
01:54:21,010 --> 01:54:40,720
So I would maybe suggest something similar in Greece. I think there is a way to like couple what I was talking about with school policies.

622
01:54:40,740 --> 01:54:45,389
I think this like if you if you want to go to school policy that is be really careful to not

623
01:54:45,390 --> 01:54:50,610
just make it super punitive because I think people like kids won't respond well to that.

624
01:54:50,970 --> 01:54:53,360
But I feel like something's wrong.

625
01:54:53,400 --> 01:55:03,000
I don't know if there's an incentive based system or like a thing that would occupy their time when they might only use it to to use tobacco.

626
01:55:03,450 --> 01:55:08,910
And that could be coupled with like what Matt was talking about, like about a greater education.

627
01:55:09,230 --> 01:57:53,080
And I think that could be useful as. All right.

628
01:57:53,090 --> 01:57:58,970
Thank you very much. Nicely done. I think that report presentation worked well.

629
01:57:59,090 --> 01:58:05,030
So good job. I'm going to put you on mute, but if you wish to.

630
01:58:05,840 --> 01:58:12,870
I'm not going to put you on mute so you can hear the next speaker. If you wish to speak, please, please remain on the call.

631
01:58:12,870 --> 01:58:17,030
Okay. All right. How about Isabella?

632
01:58:17,510 --> 01:58:22,880
Go next, and then we'll have her. They are going to need to.

633
01:58:25,440 --> 01:58:34,740
No. This is your right.

634
01:58:34,910 --> 01:58:39,490
You know. And who?

635
01:58:50,170 --> 01:58:52,270
Okay. Hi, everyone. I'm Isabella.

636
01:58:52,270 --> 01:58:59,140
And today I'm going to be presenting on the other article that we are reading class, which is the outdoor media diet,

637
01:58:59,530 --> 01:59:06,700
the development and reader reliability of a tool designed to measure food and beverage outlets and outdoor advertising.

638
01:59:08,290 --> 01:59:13,779
And so here's just, um, oh, here is our agenda for today.

639
01:59:13,780 --> 01:59:19,180
So first, I'm going to start with the introduction and the purpose of the study.

640
01:59:19,600 --> 01:59:21,069
So at the beginning of the article,

641
01:59:21,070 --> 01:59:29,290
they were talking about how increasing rates of childhood obesity could be linked to use food environment surrounding schools,

642
01:59:29,860 --> 01:59:36,850
particularly fast food options being readily available to youth, which can influence their dietary choices.

643
01:59:37,360 --> 01:59:43,930
And so the research team was just thinking about how they can reduce obesity rates, which leads us to the purpose of the study.

644
01:59:45,130 --> 01:59:49,270
And so essentially if they focus on the food outlets that are near the schools,

645
01:59:49,270 --> 01:59:55,180
the research can provide us information on the type of food options youth are exposed to frequently.

646
01:59:55,630 --> 02:00:01,840
And so the purpose of this study is to develop a tool that documents and describes

647
02:00:01,900 --> 02:00:07,630
survey data collected on outdoor food and beverage advertising and outlets.

648
02:00:08,140 --> 02:00:17,650
And so they really emphasize the importance of using primary data rather than secondary, because the majority of the state,

649
02:00:17,830 --> 02:00:26,350
the majority of studies use secondary data as their main source, which has major implications for turning out conclusions and policy decisions.

650
02:00:26,860 --> 02:00:30,729
And so secondary data doesn't really appropriately represent the food environment.

651
02:00:30,730 --> 02:00:34,270
And so they wanted to do a study that had primary data.

652
02:00:34,270 --> 02:00:41,379
And so that was the other purpose. And so on.

653
02:00:41,380 --> 02:00:46,180
Two methods The location in which the study took place in was central Texas.

654
02:00:46,600 --> 02:00:50,920
And so they chose 34 middle schools and 13 high schools to be in the study.

655
02:00:51,610 --> 02:00:53,680
And some of these schools were in the same school district.

656
02:00:53,690 --> 02:01:03,430
So they were near each other and they used ARGs to create a 100 meter or half a mile buffer zones like we learned today around these schools.

657
02:01:04,090 --> 02:01:06,520
And so essentially within those buffer zones,

658
02:01:06,520 --> 02:01:14,920
they drove through each of the streets and they documented and took pictures of any fast food restaurants, gas stations, things of that nature.

659
02:01:15,790 --> 02:01:18,940
And so they collected all that information using an iPod touch.

660
02:01:19,150 --> 02:01:22,450
I guess you heard me write iPod Touch. I haven't seen those since 2000.

661
02:01:22,480 --> 02:01:28,690
Well, because it was compatible with an app called FileMaker, though.

662
02:01:32,120 --> 02:01:38,010
And the variables they collected during this study were organized into three categories.

663
02:01:38,030 --> 02:01:47,150
So the first one is the advertisement, which is any signage promoting food and beverage that is free standing or not attached to an establishment.

664
02:01:47,900 --> 02:01:54,170
Some examples of that are signs on gas pumps, sidewalks, frames, banners and billboards.

665
02:01:54,800 --> 02:02:02,960
The next category is establishment advertisement, which is signage promoting food and beverage attached to establishments.

666
02:02:03,830 --> 02:02:08,270
Anything like posters on windows, walls, doors.

667
02:02:09,620 --> 02:02:15,140
And then you have the establishment, which is any outlet that sells food and beverage to the public.

668
02:02:15,470 --> 02:02:19,430
So like gas stations, convenience stores, grocery stores, stuff like that.

669
02:02:20,030 --> 02:02:23,209
And then the type of variable was also collected.

670
02:02:23,210 --> 02:02:28,400
And it just means where the advertisement was located and what type of establishment.

671
02:02:28,400 --> 02:02:31,550
So billboards, street signs, gas station, etc.

672
02:02:32,270 --> 02:02:39,140
And then the subject is also collected, which just means if the advertisement was pertaining food and beverage, tobacco or alcohol.

673
02:02:39,740 --> 02:02:44,300
But the main purpose of the study was for food and beverage. So tobacco, the whole out.

674
02:02:46,010 --> 02:02:54,370
And so I have a question. Um, can you think of other types of advertisement for food and beverage?

675
02:03:07,640 --> 02:03:11,940
A lot of the stuff we see on TV will now people extreme like on commercials and

676
02:03:11,940 --> 02:03:15,630
stuff that's like usually now we're probably a lot of times if you're not driving.

677
02:03:16,140 --> 02:03:19,200
Yeah it's like your media intake. Mm hmm.

678
02:03:19,380 --> 02:03:22,650
Yeah, that's true. There, you say something.

679
02:03:23,580 --> 02:03:28,070
You pay attention to product placement and like shows like that.

680
02:03:28,300 --> 02:03:29,640
Mhm. Yeah.

681
02:03:29,640 --> 02:03:36,270
I was also thinking of like social media which if you're ever scrolling through Instagram and you see like an ad for like Wendy's or Olive Garden,

682
02:03:36,270 --> 02:03:46,710
just like how did that get there? Um, okay, so onto the next slide.

683
02:03:47,940 --> 02:03:53,130
Um, so this is what they put all the information from that previous slide into here.

684
02:03:53,550 --> 02:03:57,780
So in the left side, this is what FileMaker Pro looks like on a desktop.

685
02:03:58,350 --> 02:04:06,959
It looks very vintage and old, in my opinion. Um, and then over on the right, that's what it looks like on an iPod Touch and so on.

686
02:04:06,960 --> 02:04:09,600
That blue box at the very top is score information.

687
02:04:10,050 --> 02:04:15,780
So basically what school was in that half mile radius from the establishment or advertisement site?

688
02:04:17,670 --> 02:04:23,879
As you can see, Subway was an example. So it's an establishment restaurant that's food, food and beverage.

689
02:04:23,880 --> 02:04:26,070
And then they put the GPS coordinates on there.

690
02:04:28,080 --> 02:04:34,200
And so basically they went down every street within that half mile radius of the school collecting all the food and beverage advertisements.

691
02:04:35,450 --> 02:04:42,030
Um, so my next question is what other details might be important for this type of study?

692
02:04:57,530 --> 02:05:03,740
Go ahead. Maybe you're just like, what? Like your dreams that students are like the grades.

693
02:05:06,110 --> 02:05:11,290
Yes, those are demographics. And students at the school are really, you know,

694
02:05:11,300 --> 02:05:15,350
like maybe the hours that like the business is open because if maybe they're open during school hours,

695
02:05:15,350 --> 02:05:21,830
like would it be relevant to like school children? But if it's like open after school, that's when school children will be visiting those places.

696
02:05:21,980 --> 02:05:25,340
Mm hmm. That's a good point that you exposed.

697
02:05:26,330 --> 02:05:30,100
Yeah. Mm hmm. Yeah. Those are really good points, too.

698
02:05:30,110 --> 02:05:37,310
Like income level, especially if there's food swamps, where there's a lot of fast food restaurants and you want to know those type of demographics.

699
02:05:38,260 --> 02:05:41,810
So, and then I have another question.

700
02:05:42,440 --> 02:05:48,649
Um, so just thinking of when the research team is taking these pictures of these sites,

701
02:05:48,650 --> 02:05:52,070
what are some barriers that they could face when taking the photos?

702
02:06:03,750 --> 02:06:09,420
So I can give some examples. So we've talked about some of them in the paper and they were talking about.

703
02:06:13,040 --> 02:06:21,110
Traffic. So there's a lot of traffic and you can't get off to take pictures or if they do a wrong turn if they're traveling by car.

704
02:06:21,390 --> 02:06:23,810
Unclear directions, road closures,

705
02:06:24,650 --> 02:06:32,150
no sidewalks or the owner or the manager of the establishment doesn't agree for you to take a picture of their place.

706
02:06:34,100 --> 02:06:38,690
And also malfunctioning of the device so it doesn't get itself working for some reason.

707
02:06:41,750 --> 02:06:49,210
And so going back, one of the main purposes of the study was to rate this tool, which, by the way,

708
02:06:49,220 --> 02:06:56,450
media stands for measuring and evaluating the determinants and influence of advertising direct observation tool.

709
02:06:57,230 --> 02:07:02,750
And so in order to do that, first, they randomly selected seven schools out of their sample,

710
02:07:03,230 --> 02:07:10,220
and then next they sent out two separate teams that each completed a four data collection within 24 hours.

711
02:07:10,550 --> 02:07:14,930
So going around that half mile radius of the schools and collecting that data.

712
02:07:15,440 --> 02:07:22,070
And then third, after they did all that, they came back and manually compared both sets of data for matching and coding.

713
02:07:25,150 --> 02:07:31,000
And so in order to register, in order to measure into greater reliability, they used percent agreement.

714
02:07:31,660 --> 02:07:37,060
Percent agreements provide an overall indication of reliability between the different teams.

715
02:07:37,990 --> 02:07:41,559
So basically they are easy to understand and to interpret.

716
02:07:41,560 --> 02:07:46,120
And so that's why they use it. And so they separate the data into two levels.

717
02:07:46,360 --> 02:07:55,599
Level one was measured. If these variables right here in the bullet points were documented by both teams, level two was measured.

718
02:07:55,600 --> 02:08:01,090
If the details of the variables were coded similar, meaning that they had similar documented details.

719
02:08:02,530 --> 02:08:12,340
And so if you get both of those and you combine them, if you get perfect matching between the two, then you have a percent agreement of 100%.

720
02:08:17,850 --> 02:08:28,980
And so for the real results that they did for level one, there was a 71% match from both teams, which was pretty high.

721
02:08:29,430 --> 02:08:32,730
And then for level two, there is an 84% match.

722
02:08:33,660 --> 02:08:40,200
And so this is just the more in-depth detail of the other results that they collected.

723
02:08:41,040 --> 02:08:44,130
As you can see, the matching was pretty accurate, in my opinion.

724
02:08:47,930 --> 02:08:55,940
And so what does this mean? So the media diet can be used to document and code food and beverage advertisements and outlets with high reliability.

725
02:08:56,780 --> 02:09:01,640
This tool can be easily adapted for future research and other research topics too.

726
02:09:02,930 --> 02:09:11,239
And the success of this research study adds on to existing literature with primary data,

727
02:09:11,240 --> 02:09:14,300
which is more accurately represented compared to secondary data.

728
02:09:14,950 --> 02:09:19,850
So essentially, this provides leverage for other researchers that are interested in this similar topic.

729
02:09:22,040 --> 02:09:29,750
And my next question is what other adaptations of this tool can be useful in public health in general?

730
02:09:39,710 --> 02:09:43,220
Oftentimes we try to encourage people to take a healthier behavior.

731
02:09:43,220 --> 02:09:48,260
But I think with this, like you're actually considering the actual environment and like what children are being exposed to.

732
02:09:48,530 --> 02:09:52,609
So I feel like that's really helpful when thinking about creating an intervention of like what?

733
02:09:52,610 --> 02:09:57,920
What are they exposed to in their environment? How can you crack your intervention to kind of mitigate those factors?

734
02:09:58,130 --> 02:10:06,520
Mm hmm. Yeah, go ahead. There's a lot more using social media around there, like kids are using social media a lot more to.

735
02:10:06,530 --> 02:10:10,130
And so I wanted to talk about, like, cutting those advertisements.

736
02:10:10,160 --> 02:10:16,879
Mm hmm. Reliability. I think you have a better understanding of everything that they're seeing,

737
02:10:16,880 --> 02:10:27,020
because I think that's something that not is not being monitored maybe as much as like your external physical environment.

738
02:10:27,050 --> 02:10:32,390
Yeah. The child. I mean, when I was. When. Yeah.

739
02:10:32,660 --> 02:10:38,720
So those are both good points, you know, looking at the environment and social media for different health behaviors.

740
02:10:39,380 --> 02:10:48,260
Um, and so in the article they had some suggestions that would improve data collection in the future.

741
02:10:49,010 --> 02:10:56,899
So the first one is training. So more extensive training among the research team to minimize coding mismatches, photo quality.

742
02:10:56,900 --> 02:11:00,590
If you remember from the previous slide, there was only room for three pictures,

743
02:11:01,040 --> 02:11:05,900
so adding more photo boxes and implementing a protocol for taking high quality photos.

744
02:11:06,260 --> 02:11:11,360
This is important because you get a blurry photo that it's going to be hard to code, which could impact the results.

745
02:11:11,930 --> 02:11:14,950
Um, especially those in iPod Touch. Sure.

746
02:11:14,990 --> 02:11:18,930
But the quality, um, uh,

747
02:11:19,200 --> 02:11:25,100
conflict resolution in preparation for interacting with store owners and managers that

748
02:11:25,760 --> 02:11:30,290
they don't agree with you taking pictures of their establishment reliable technology.

749
02:11:31,040 --> 02:11:36,110
So using a database that wouldn't be compromised if the device got lost or malfunctioned.

750
02:11:36,440 --> 02:11:41,540
And so in the study, they said that they kept all the data on the iPod Touch, but they also had backup.

751
02:11:41,870 --> 02:11:43,310
So just in case they got lost or something.

752
02:11:45,350 --> 02:11:50,660
And then lastly, reliable driving instructions, which is something that they actually struggled with during data collection.

753
02:11:51,050 --> 02:11:58,670
So for future research would be preferable to have reliable driving instructions to minimize any wrong turns,

754
02:11:58,670 --> 02:12:03,860
left turns and crossing to see intersections. But but I'm pretty sure people so struck with that today.

755
02:12:05,690 --> 02:12:11,360
And then lastly, um, some strengths and weaknesses I found of the article.

756
02:12:11,690 --> 02:12:12,559
So overall,

757
02:12:12,560 --> 02:12:20,780
I thought that the article was pretty easy to read and it was interesting and I thought that the tool can be applicable to other public health topics.

758
02:12:21,260 --> 02:12:25,460
And I also appreciated the great level of detail when collecting the data.

759
02:12:26,330 --> 02:12:31,879
However, some weaknesses. There were no maps presented and I'm a visual person,

760
02:12:31,880 --> 02:12:38,060
so I would have liked to see like those buffer zones and what they look like and how many establishments were in those zones.

761
02:12:38,720 --> 02:12:42,920
And also they didn't connect the conclusion back to childhood obesity.

762
02:12:43,370 --> 02:12:49,460
So I find that kind of odd. And then lastly, I would have liked to learn more about the application of this.

763
02:12:49,790 --> 02:12:54,349
So kind of like what we're learning today on density and distance, we didn't really talk about that.

764
02:12:54,350 --> 02:12:58,880
So both in that, it was a pretty cool article. That's it.

765
02:13:04,590 --> 02:13:08,370
Thank you. Nicely done, John.

766
02:13:09,240 --> 02:13:20,280
All right. This will be the last student presentation of the semester.

767
02:13:21,240 --> 02:13:27,990
We get to see the last word there. Hopefully, I don't always feel moving.

768
02:13:29,400 --> 02:13:49,720
There you go. Okay. Take it away. But everyone knows everyone doing it.

769
02:13:54,100 --> 02:14:01,460
All right. So this was a study while we table of contents.

770
02:14:01,490 --> 02:14:02,920
Okay. Background here.

771
02:14:02,990 --> 02:14:14,840
So this is a study done post there being a lot of research done associating physical activity environments and obesity rates in children.

772
02:14:15,290 --> 02:14:20,329
And then there's also well, yeah, there's a lot of studies done just that factor specifically.

773
02:14:20,330 --> 02:14:30,830
And then there's quite a few studies done, I guess on the side also with associations of like food accessibility and health

774
02:14:30,830 --> 02:14:38,370
outcomes and not many that combine and not many that combine these two together.

775
02:14:38,390 --> 02:14:41,180
So that's what these researchers did.

776
02:14:41,720 --> 02:14:55,850
And yeah, so they looked at two main factors, which is physical activity environment and nutritional environment in San Diego County,

777
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:59,720
California, and King County, Seattle, Washington.

778
02:15:01,790 --> 02:15:13,340
So methods they split where they split up their regions by block groups and they used census data for that.

779
02:15:13,940 --> 02:15:21,469
And so these block groups were essentially split into combinations of physical activity environments and nutritional environments.

780
02:15:21,470 --> 02:15:26,870
And then also the specific age group that they were looking at was where 6 to 11 year olds.

781
02:15:32,550 --> 02:15:45,510
So okay. So physical activity environment was made up of walkability index and park, park proximity and park quality.

782
02:15:45,810 --> 02:15:51,680
So for walkability they looked at residential density, intersection density,

783
02:15:51,690 --> 02:16:01,530
also land use for civic educational entertainment, retail under 300,000 square feet and single family homes and offices.

784
02:16:02,670 --> 02:16:07,770
They also used a point 25 mile shadow buffer around each group,

785
02:16:08,130 --> 02:16:14,640
around each block group to kind of account for people that are on the edges that also might be influenced by these factors.

786
02:16:16,590 --> 02:16:21,360
They also use silver park proximity and park quality.

787
02:16:21,690 --> 02:16:32,159
They looked at public parks, open spaces, fields, anything indicating public recreational use, and then park quality measures were used,

788
02:16:32,160 --> 02:16:41,280
I mean, were assessed using the environmental assessment of public or relational sorry public recreational spaces tool,

789
02:16:42,450 --> 02:16:52,320
which looked at activity activity in water areas, playground equipment, athletic fields and surrounding neighborhoods like safety and sidewalk.

790
02:16:52,950 --> 02:16:59,550
So with these three things, they created like a GI suit file that had all these things on it.

791
02:16:59,580 --> 02:17:06,659
Also, they source these from like census data, road work, road network data and that.

792
02:17:06,660 --> 02:17:20,370
Yes. All right. Database nutritional environment was made up of these factors which were which

793
02:17:20,370 --> 02:17:25,230
were kind of like the grocery stores and like food accessibility points.

794
02:17:27,210 --> 02:17:32,880
And so these are split into high nutritional environment and low nutrition moment.

795
02:17:33,450 --> 02:17:36,690
And just from what's on bottom.

796
02:17:37,170 --> 02:17:42,360
Low nutritional environment was insane here in San Diego County,

797
02:17:42,370 --> 02:17:47,969
it was if there was more than 31 fast food restaurants within 0.5 miles of the block group.

798
02:17:47,970 --> 02:17:57,270
And in King County, low nutritional environment was more than 16 fast food restaurants within 0.5 miles of a block group.

799
02:17:57,960 --> 02:18:07,050
And then for high it was with opposite. If there was less than that were less than 31 or less than 16 for San Diego and King County.

800
02:18:07,650 --> 02:18:11,070
And then. So.

801
02:18:15,150 --> 02:18:23,190
All right. So results, this is just kind of the breakdown of the block block groups.

802
02:18:23,820 --> 02:18:26,840
They're like eligible eligibility requirements.

803
02:18:26,890 --> 02:18:31,950
There are a couple there. Have there had to be like 10% participation rate in each block group,

804
02:18:31,950 --> 02:18:37,259
meaning there had to be like 10% participation from those 6 to 11 year olds that

805
02:18:37,260 --> 02:18:40,530
were included and then also like a certain amount of restaurants and whatnot.

806
02:18:41,160 --> 02:18:44,610
So this was just kind of how that was broken up between the two.

807
02:18:45,450 --> 02:18:54,300
And then this is the map they created. I personally thought it wasn't super great because it didn't tell you a whole lot,

808
02:18:55,410 --> 02:18:59,610
but they did break it up into four into those like four, four quadrants.

809
02:19:00,600 --> 02:19:11,579
And those colors are kind of based on that that you can see there's like there's low physical activity environment and low nutritional environment,

810
02:19:11,580 --> 02:19:18,690
high physical activity, low nutritional, low physical, high nutritional and then low of both.

811
02:19:19,890 --> 02:19:23,970
So those are the more general findings that they found.

812
02:19:24,330 --> 02:19:31,830
Again, it doesn't actually tell you anything about like the correlation or association between this and obesity rates.

813
02:19:33,870 --> 02:19:38,790
I think there is a lot of interesting findings that either like did it make much

814
02:19:38,790 --> 02:19:42,479
sense compared to what you would generally think of these type of environments,

815
02:19:42,480 --> 02:19:50,969
but kind of like the at the bottom of those, like the quadrants that scored highly or poorly on both measures had the greatest,

816
02:19:50,970 --> 02:19:55,140
like had the greatest discrepancy, which I guess that makes sense.

817
02:19:55,140 --> 02:19:58,140
But in the next one's.

818
02:20:00,960 --> 02:20:07,810
And. So for me was like, Oh, yeah, okay.

819
02:20:07,820 --> 02:20:10,610
So again, from this you can't see it.

820
02:20:10,610 --> 02:20:19,310
But the findings that they had found were that King County was more compact, higher land use mix, but lower retail floor area.

821
02:20:21,740 --> 02:20:31,550
But another finding they found was that King County had more supermarkets within five miles of a block group and less food outlets.

822
02:20:31,820 --> 02:20:43,700
While San Diego County only had like a higher proportion of block groups that had supermarkets within point, five mile point, about five miles away.

823
02:20:44,090 --> 02:20:48,620
So that doesn't tell a whole lot about the specifics.

824
02:20:48,620 --> 02:21:00,260
So that in these demographic information, this kind of traffic information, and then there was some more interpretations aside.

825
02:21:01,490 --> 02:21:10,760
So an interesting one was that in San Diego, only 5.8% of households earned more than 100,000, but there was nearly 63%.

826
02:21:10,760 --> 02:21:17,090
Or there was yeah, there was there was nearly 63% that earned less than 50,000 or 50,000 or below.

827
02:21:17,450 --> 02:21:26,210
But in King County, 18.8% earned 100,000, and only 36.6% earned 50,000.

828
02:21:26,930 --> 02:21:33,920
So just from this, because there's like pretty big discrepancies.

829
02:21:35,480 --> 02:21:45,410
Just think about, I guess, the credibility of comparing these two types of spaces and the credibility of comparing or being able to generalize a

830
02:21:45,410 --> 02:21:54,110
county like King County said there is like quite a few differences that they found between these two different places.

831
02:21:54,770 --> 02:22:04,100
But yeah. So. QUESTION Do you think you would find similar results if you compared to other counties or to other places?

832
02:22:04,670 --> 02:22:06,620
So you compared like Detroit and Flint.

833
02:22:06,620 --> 02:22:16,070
Would you find more similarities between each other and between those two groups and say like Seattle or King County and San Diego?

834
02:22:20,680 --> 02:22:26,200
Okay. I think we would. But you know what goes before me here?

835
02:22:27,610 --> 02:22:28,389
I guess what?

836
02:22:28,390 --> 02:22:40,960
Strategic assets like income, if you're going, it's in the community that they have the income as well, then yeah, it could be different.

837
02:22:41,550 --> 02:22:44,570
Hmm. Yeah, I. I agree.

838
02:22:46,810 --> 02:22:55,480
So in general, there again, we're like mixed findings from this too.

839
02:22:56,200 --> 02:23:04,269
But one of the things so another thing about this article, but it was a it was like a piece of a companion paper.

840
02:23:04,270 --> 02:23:08,530
So it's like the methods, like the GIS related stuff from this like larger study.

841
02:23:08,920 --> 02:23:14,410
So I think I did mention a note about not having like educational attainment on these graphs.

842
02:23:15,280 --> 02:23:21,370
I mention that because I think that it makes a much bigger difference than just the variables that are on here.

843
02:23:21,670 --> 02:23:30,700
And I also think that they also think that that would have probably told us more about the information that we are getting from the crops.

844
02:23:33,120 --> 02:23:39,400
So I guess that gets into the my last thing of like strengths and limitations and

845
02:23:40,750 --> 02:23:44,890
some of the strengths that they had to use that the methodology was pretty good.

846
02:23:45,010 --> 02:23:50,799
I do think that there is again like discrepancies in the the counties that we did choose,

847
02:23:50,800 --> 02:23:59,080
but I think their method of creating these like categorize variables that have a bunch of other variables in it was pretty useful.

848
02:24:00,490 --> 02:24:09,130
But yeah, and that's like pretty much there's like specific cut points and there's like, oh, everything was objectively defined.

849
02:24:10,100 --> 02:24:16,660
The, the thresholds that they used for both counties were kind of like calculated based on the population in those areas.

850
02:24:17,800 --> 02:24:24,260
But limitation, these are kind of the ones that they listed that like they didn't have really like sidewalk safety data,

851
02:24:24,280 --> 02:24:29,710
which I'm assuming would make a difference, would make an impact on whether you could actually use it, right?

852
02:24:29,770 --> 02:24:33,040
Like if they have a bunch of these and none of them are safe,

853
02:24:33,250 --> 02:24:39,700
then you might have like a high p e area without actually having anything that's accessible.

854
02:24:41,710 --> 02:24:51,190
But that was. But personally, I thought the limitations kind of what I had mentioned earlier were that, um, I don't,

855
02:24:52,060 --> 02:24:56,830
I personally wouldn't use these two counties if I was looking at this type of

856
02:24:56,830 --> 02:25:02,800
factor because there is a lot more to factor and there's a lot more to consider.

857
02:25:03,430 --> 02:25:07,749
I just kind of compare it to like a city like Detroit where you could have this study and

858
02:25:07,750 --> 02:25:14,920
you would probably have very different results and probably much more uniformed results,

859
02:25:14,920 --> 02:25:17,920
like from from this from this map.

860
02:25:19,370 --> 02:25:24,639
There aren't there isn't like there isn't a lot of potter there aren't a lot of patterns going on.

861
02:25:24,640 --> 02:25:30,700
Right. There's no like clusters of of one type of place or one type of like quadrant.

862
02:25:31,150 --> 02:25:38,920
So it's a little bit harder to look at this and be like, oh, okay, this area is like this income and this education associated with this stuff.

863
02:25:39,820 --> 02:25:43,180
So those are kind of my things.

864
02:25:43,180 --> 02:25:54,370
And another thing to note was that from this study, again, the newest areas were performing the worst and the oldest areas were performing the best,

865
02:25:54,760 --> 02:26:04,990
which kind of again like gets into questioning whether that's kind of like plausible to what we already know and what we see in studies.

866
02:26:05,530 --> 02:26:09,669
So I would look into that. And again, the last thing,

867
02:26:09,670 --> 02:26:14,920
I think education plays a much bigger role enough that this graph would probably

868
02:26:14,980 --> 02:26:20,710
make more sense or have more work to interpret if that was included in it.

869
02:26:22,060 --> 02:26:25,920
So. Yeah, no question.

870
02:26:28,380 --> 02:26:37,080
Perfect. Thank you very much.

871
02:26:37,710 --> 02:26:41,960
All right. Thank you, everyone, for your presentations.

872
02:26:44,610 --> 02:26:50,640
Yeah. Sorry we didn't get to deal with the issues of data collection in terms of gas information.

873
02:26:51,390 --> 02:26:59,820
But as you can see, the technology moves pretty fast, you know, but the basic concepts remain the same.

874
02:27:00,600 --> 02:27:05,250
You basically need to develop a good form to collect the data that you need.

875
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:10,229
And the I think the technology is almost agnostic, in my opinion.

876
02:27:10,230 --> 02:27:17,190
You can use an iPod or an iPad or, you know, a Ricoh camera, G.P.S. chip in it.

877
02:27:17,940 --> 02:27:28,640
But you will get probably similar information. We use iPads and tablet Samsung tablets in India to collect our primary data and we use field maps.

878
02:27:28,650 --> 02:27:33,450
But we started with a totally different software just a few years ago, so things changed quite a bit.

879
02:27:34,560 --> 02:27:37,770
So I think there is a lot of value in collecting your own.

880
02:27:37,770 --> 02:27:45,120
Gee, I did all of this last paper was not really talking about that, but if you're interested in stuff like that,

881
02:27:45,120 --> 02:27:48,150
let me know and I can talk to you a little bit more about how to do it.

882
02:27:49,260 --> 02:27:55,649
Okay. We have about 20 minutes, so I think we can do maybe one or two more activities,

883
02:27:55,650 --> 02:28:00,690
maybe one more, because the other stuff is a little bit more involved.

884
02:28:00,690 --> 02:28:14,459
So let's get back to our lab assignments or activities and let me see tell you if you want to stay on, you're welcome to or you can hang up.

885
02:28:14,460 --> 02:28:20,280
Okay. I'm just going to leave this open for you if you need. Okay.

886
02:28:24,310 --> 02:28:34,990
You're welcome. Have a good meeting. Well, it's going to be fun.

887
02:28:35,200 --> 02:28:42,189
All right. So let's go back to our activities. We're going to do lab activity 13 now and direct 33.

888
02:28:42,190 --> 02:28:45,400
Sorry. Sure. It's getting late. Right.

889
02:28:47,200 --> 02:28:55,120
So we looked at these pedestrian injuries. We created these buffers to counter measures of density right in proximity.

890
02:28:56,020 --> 02:29:02,470
Now we can use the same point data right on injuries to measure clustering.

891
02:29:02,920 --> 02:29:09,100
And there's a simple way of doing that in our GS 4.0, which is called the nearest neighbor ratio.

892
02:29:09,580 --> 02:29:11,890
And what that basically does is it counts,

893
02:29:12,430 --> 02:29:20,139
it measures the distance between all the points in your dataset and then compares that with what would be what would

894
02:29:20,140 --> 02:29:27,820
those the the the distances between points be if they were randomly distributed across that geographic space.

895
02:29:28,210 --> 02:29:28,510
Okay.

896
02:29:29,740 --> 02:29:39,940
So let me talk a little bit about the issue of clustering and then we'll do lab activity 33 to give you some more context about this kind of work.

897
02:29:40,750 --> 02:29:48,280
So so spatial clustering is basically talking about this idea of random distribution or rent or

898
02:29:48,280 --> 02:29:57,160
nonrandom distribution of the features and or and or their attributes across a geographic space.

899
02:29:57,700 --> 02:30:05,080
For example, if you can imagine if you had a, you know, a box of marbles with a flat surface with absolutely no friction,

900
02:30:05,410 --> 02:30:10,660
and you throw it out there, those marbles out there, they would be randomly distributed in that space.

901
02:30:10,660 --> 02:30:14,559
Right. And then in terms of nonrandom distribution,

902
02:30:14,560 --> 02:30:22,990
if you have some friction or slopes or curvature that brings marbles into a specific area and pushes them out,

903
02:30:23,530 --> 02:30:27,190
an analysis of spatial clustering tries to look at those differences.

904
02:30:28,060 --> 02:30:36,580
Okay. So in terms of point data, right, you look at these two figures,

905
02:30:36,940 --> 02:30:45,360
the top figures looking at the clustering is pointing out to the right side of the figure where you have clusters of points right in the middle.

906
02:30:45,370 --> 02:30:48,580
The figure is a random distribution of points.

907
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:55,960
And then the left side of this figure is the dispersion point that they're being pushed far away from each other in a non random way.

908
02:30:57,130 --> 02:31:02,890
And that's kind of the issue that we want to try to measure statistically in the data that we're working with.

909
02:31:03,530 --> 02:31:09,630
In terms of Polygon, do we think about Polygon data with attributes with that?

910
02:31:09,820 --> 02:31:16,330
Okay. So in this case, these polygons have the color attribute, you know, like green, dark, green and purple.

911
02:31:16,900 --> 02:31:26,080
Then a clustered kind of data would look like the similar polygons are next to each other in terms of their shading or their color.

912
02:31:26,950 --> 02:31:37,930
In a randomly dispersed polygon space, you would see that those attributes are randomly distributed across the polygon in that geographic space.

913
02:31:38,200 --> 02:31:44,140
And then here they're kind of pushed away in a nonrandom way, as far away from each other as possible.

914
02:31:44,770 --> 02:31:48,100
That's what we're going to try and measure today and next time.

915
02:31:48,720 --> 02:31:53,320
And there's these two ideas about clustering that we need to keep in mind.

916
02:31:53,650 --> 02:32:02,860
You probably came across these words in the readings many times already in in your literature review for your final projects.

917
02:32:03,430 --> 02:32:07,360
But there are two basic concepts of first clustering.

918
02:32:07,360 --> 02:32:13,150
One is the presence of clustering, and the other is the location of that cluster.

919
02:32:13,750 --> 02:32:20,020
It's a first step is to measure the presence of clustering, using the measures of global clustering.

920
02:32:21,580 --> 02:32:26,830
And the next step, if you find clustering in your data, is to figure out where it is.

921
02:32:27,530 --> 02:32:30,790
Okay? So the first step would be to see if there is significant clustering.

922
02:32:30,790 --> 02:32:37,630
The next step is to find out where it is using some tool to measure what the what we call local clustering.

923
02:32:38,520 --> 02:32:49,720
And and this is an example of a paper reviewed in our class earlier which looked at I think would be killer collisions in Cincinnati.

924
02:32:50,260 --> 02:32:58,330
At the top figure is a figure of just the distribution of vehicular accidents across the space.

925
02:32:58,510 --> 02:33:03,489
Right. One thing to notice, you can examine that there is a difference.

926
02:33:03,490 --> 02:33:11,890
There is some variability from the top figure, but you can't really speak to whether those differences are statistically significant,

927
02:33:12,580 --> 02:33:21,300
that the red area is statistically higher than the blue, the lightest or the darkest food area.

928
02:33:22,150 --> 02:33:29,500
It's just a matter of how you created those bins or the categories and to how you shaded them.

929
02:33:30,220 --> 02:33:33,320
But there is no information on. About statistical significance.

930
02:33:33,320 --> 02:33:37,090
The inference that you can make from the top figures for the top analysis.

931
02:33:37,630 --> 02:33:47,140
What you need to do is an analysis of clustering, which is what the bottom figure tries to tell us that these red areas actually statistically

932
02:33:47,440 --> 02:33:56,080
different and are clustered with like high collision areas then other parts of the map.

933
02:33:56,470 --> 02:34:07,360
So there is a statistically significant higher rate of vehicular collisions in this specific area relative to the rest of the map.

934
02:34:07,870 --> 02:34:13,419
Okay. And even the lighter field of red or whatever this color might be, Salman,

935
02:34:13,420 --> 02:34:18,400
I guess, is also indicating that there is likely a statistical difference here.

936
02:34:18,970 --> 02:34:24,640
And that's the point of doing this kind of cluster analysis is to add to the corpus maps

937
02:34:24,640 --> 02:34:29,110
that we've been making in class already to really talk about statistical differences.

938
02:34:29,410 --> 02:34:37,930
Okay. So you should really move to the cluster analysis if you're working with core maps, even with pointy end,

939
02:34:37,930 --> 02:34:45,639
because you can aggregate them up to polygons and then measure clustering as we discuss with the neighborhood data.

940
02:34:45,640 --> 02:34:45,910
Right.

941
02:34:45,910 --> 02:34:54,700
And then juries, you can aggregate the injuries to the neighborhood level, make your corporate maps, and then make a map of hotspots and cold spots.

942
02:34:57,570 --> 02:35:04,170
Okay. So global clustering again assesses the presence of spatial clustering within an area,

943
02:35:04,560 --> 02:35:08,370
but does not provide any information on where those clusters are.

944
02:35:09,060 --> 02:35:16,710
And in terms of point data, you can use something called the nearest neighbor statistic, okay?

945
02:35:17,550 --> 02:35:19,379
You can use it with polygon data.

946
02:35:19,380 --> 02:35:27,150
But what we will do is will take the center of the polygon in Turkey and look at that as a point and compare it with the centroid of

947
02:35:27,150 --> 02:35:40,440
other polygons and global Morenci is another statistic to to examine polygon data primarily and not just the location of those features,

948
02:35:40,440 --> 02:35:42,450
but also the attributes of those features.

949
02:35:43,770 --> 02:35:53,070
So if you had point data, you would have to aggregate them up into a polygon and then around the global margins like the calculation point.

950
02:35:53,670 --> 02:36:01,380
So let's talk about this nearest neighbor ratio. We'll try to calculate it and then we'll call it a day and focus on the rest of the stuff next week.

951
02:36:02,100 --> 02:36:10,020
Okay. So the average nearest neighbor tool it measure the distance between each feature centroid,

952
02:36:10,290 --> 02:36:15,959
either a polygon or a point in its nearest neighbor center is location.

953
02:36:15,960 --> 02:36:19,870
And then it averages out all of those location distances.

954
02:36:19,870 --> 02:36:24,989
So it takes every single point A to kill and then looks at that over what you

955
02:36:24,990 --> 02:36:31,800
would expect if those points are randomly distributed across the geographic space.

956
02:36:32,490 --> 02:36:42,480
So if the ratio is less than the hypothetical random distribution, you would say that those features are clustered,

957
02:36:42,750 --> 02:36:50,730
but the distances are less than what you would expect if the randomly distributed footprint and if they're greater than the random distribution,

958
02:36:52,020 --> 02:36:59,130
the features are considered dispersed. So the index goes from a negative value to a positive value.

959
02:37:00,240 --> 02:37:09,180
A nested one is clustering created, the one is an is dispersion, then one is no clustering or dispersion.

960
02:37:09,780 --> 02:37:19,650
Okay. So in this case, to look at the little figure we looked at earlier cluster data and in R is less than one dispersed data is greater than one.

961
02:37:19,950 --> 02:37:24,030
And if it's not clustered or dispersed, it's randomly distributed.

962
02:37:24,660 --> 02:37:32,340
The statistic is around one. So let's do a quick calculation from the data that we're working with, which is the injuries data in Pittsburgh.

963
02:37:33,660 --> 02:37:36,510
So it's steps one and two we've already done.

964
02:37:36,960 --> 02:37:47,340
All you need to do is open up the project that we've been working on in class today and do a search for the nearest average nearest neighbor tool.

965
02:37:48,150 --> 02:37:55,500
So you can type in the command search line type of bridge and it should pop up as a first tool.

966
02:38:01,390 --> 02:38:04,550
And what we want to examine are the injuries data.

967
02:38:04,590 --> 02:38:10,510
Is the input feature? Is injuries all. I have two versions of it doesn't matter which one you choose.

968
02:38:13,450 --> 02:38:17,020
If you take the generate report button, we won't need to do it today.

969
02:38:17,320 --> 02:38:22,959
It will create a report like a PDF file or each HTML file depending on which to use it.

970
02:38:22,960 --> 02:38:29,020
Put it in your project folder. We don't need it now because it's relatively simple exercise.

971
02:38:29,050 --> 02:38:32,590
Just push run two and it's running.

972
02:38:33,550 --> 02:38:41,260
The one thing that it gives you a little warning of is that we I think in my closing and not closing of the software,

973
02:38:41,650 --> 02:38:46,840
I didn't re project my data to Pennsylvania, South Pennsylvania.

974
02:38:47,290 --> 02:38:51,280
So the warning has to do with the fact that there is no projection system.

975
02:38:51,610 --> 02:38:58,360
So you use the default projection system here and it's doing this work in meters, which is totally fine.

976
02:38:58,570 --> 02:39:02,650
But the numbers may be slightly different than what you would get otherwise.

977
02:39:02,660 --> 02:39:11,080
For example, here we got a value of sorry view details.

978
02:39:16,690 --> 02:39:20,740
So we've got a value for the nearest neighbor ratio of 0.65.

979
02:39:21,280 --> 02:39:29,140
The lab is 6.66 because I think I ran that on the projected data rather than the projected data here.

980
02:39:30,100 --> 02:39:42,970
And so that value is, uh, is less than one, right, meaning that there is clustering of injuries in the data that we're looking at.

981
02:39:43,960 --> 02:39:52,600
And the p value is highly significant, indicating that this estimate is different than one.

982
02:39:54,400 --> 02:40:03,280
So you can say from these results that the nearest neighbor ratio or the average nearest neighbor ratio indicates there's significant

983
02:40:03,280 --> 02:40:11,830
clustering of injuries in the Pittsburgh area where the pedestrian vehicular collision injuries in in the in the Pittsburgh area.

984
02:40:13,880 --> 02:40:20,660
Okay. So that's that's how you would measure presence of clustering, global clustering.

985
02:40:21,230 --> 02:40:24,560
Now, if you wanted to see where those clusters are,

986
02:40:25,070 --> 02:40:34,820
you would have to aggregate these these point data into polygons and run a measure of local clustering somehow.

987
02:40:36,230 --> 02:40:42,410
All right. So let's stop there. And then next week, we'll look at the global more.

988
02:40:42,410 --> 02:40:51,410
And I statistic will calculate the local moorlands statistic for lung cancer mortality rates in the U.S. and Michigan.

989
02:40:51,950 --> 02:41:01,730
And then we'll learn about something called the It Is or Die Star statistic, which is also a measure of hot spot, cold spot analysis.

990
02:41:02,780 --> 02:41:10,870
And finally, we'll talk about some nuances around how to think about setting up this analysis.

991
02:41:11,390 --> 02:41:17,810
And this has to do with issues of how you conceptualize the relationship between the features in your dataset.

992
02:41:19,460 --> 02:41:29,840
This came up in one of the lectures over the papers where uh, uh, features beyond a certain point were ignored in the calculation of clustering.

993
02:41:30,560 --> 02:41:39,709
And there's different options for that. And we'll talk about which one might be better to use and can talk about maybe

994
02:41:39,710 --> 02:41:44,510
using the data to help you find the right conceptualization of relationships.

995
02:41:44,900 --> 02:41:48,740
So that'll be next week and we'll start for today.

996
02:41:49,250 --> 02:41:54,650
Any questions or concerns? No.

997
02:41:54,920 --> 02:42:05,540
Good. And I will send today some information about how to update your GI is pro so your symbology doesn't crash all the time.

998
02:42:06,090 --> 02:42:09,110
All right. You're welcome. Sorry I forgot to do that.

999
02:42:09,740 --> 02:42:26,700
Have a good evening and I'll talk to you guys next week. Okay.

1000
02:42:30,100 --> 02:42:38,370
So it's not an easy to find out.
