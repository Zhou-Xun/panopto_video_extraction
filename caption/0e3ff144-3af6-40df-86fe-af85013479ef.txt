1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,840
Just fit in your sketchbook. Like what? Why did you take this class?

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,320
What did you think it was? Yeah.

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:10,860
Um, my name's Elina here.

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,790
I am also a senior,

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:23,230
so it's not like Sister and I basically have this class because I think that all

6
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:28,860
of the work that we do in public health is really important and interesting.

7
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:41,100
But I think where the most impact can be is actually at the level of like changing of day varied from going from idea to actual implementation.

8
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,649
Yeah, great. Well, thank you for that. And yeah, today you'll see.

9
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:50,490
We'll go over a lot more of the rationale for this class.

10
00:00:50,520 --> 00:01:03,210
Why I think these topics around changing health behavior are so are difficult, vitally important and really, really fascinating.

11
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:17,670
I tell you one just anecdote. A long time ago when I was just starting to work, I was in California, I was working at the VA Center.

12
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:25,580
I think I mentioned I'm still in this network of VA centers. And I was kind of shadowing a diabetic, just.

13
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:35,990
And he was kind of an old school, honestly, kind of a crotchety old, grouchy VA doctor.

14
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,049
And he let me come into the exam rooms. I'm not a clinician.

15
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:49,380
And so that was really valuable to me. And so he was meeting with a patient that had diabetes and being kind of a grouchy, old, crotchety doctor.

16
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:59,160
He looked at this old man and said, Look, you've already had two heart attacks.

17
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,090
We've talked to you endlessly about your smoking.

18
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,180
And I see you still have a pack of cigarets in your chest pocket.

19
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:11,940
Your toes are going black. We are going to have to amputate that.

20
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:21,390
This is going to kill you if you don't start getting your your, you know, self care plan together and start listening to what we say.

21
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:26,280
And he runs out of the room for whatever reason. And he leaves me along with this guy.

22
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:32,210
And the guy says to me. They think I'm an idiot.

23
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:38,890
They tell me that every time I come in here. You think I don't know that I.

24
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:44,000
And so it was it was kind of nice in a certain way, and he was kind of confiding in me.

25
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:51,230
But honestly, part of what I took away is like. And yet you still don't do any of those things.

26
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:54,500
That's wild, right? That's wild.

27
00:02:55,070 --> 00:03:02,820
But super common. Right. There's nobody that smoke cigarets that has in her legs that is like, hey, you know, that's bad for, you know.

28
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:06,770
Oh, I know. Everyone knows that.

29
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,150
No one starts knowing, you know,

30
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:18,640
takes fentanyl or crack cocaine or drives drunk or does any of those things and doesn't already know that they're bad for you.

31
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:29,890
But they do them right. That's sort of in some sense, the the the incredible is the fascinating, incredibly complicated,

32
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:36,009
sometimes very frustrating, but a very core challenge of public health in getting people.

33
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:40,520
Getting us. Getting each of us to change our behavior. So, yeah, you'll see more of that today.

34
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:45,980
Like I said, it's you know, I love this topic. I love this class. And so the other person that I just met, if you don't mind.

35
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:55,830
Same sort of thing. Like, are you kind of a a senior and, you know, say something about why you might have to take this, but I use this to pronounce.

36
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,180
I went to Senior Love. Yes, but that's the last semester I'm interested in.

37
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:04,209
This is something like this. Yeah.

38
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:12,820
Basically, yeah. Um, we are really interested in like health interventions, like actually how to implement effective programs to improve health.

39
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:16,690
But also I feel like this topic is interesting and you touched on it that there and don't like,

40
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:24,040
you know if people want to be doing these like unhealthy behaviors like kind of health, public health can be very paternalistic in a way.

41
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:27,520
Yeah. That's like effective. Yeah. I don't know.

42
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:32,709
I don't know. I know exactly what you mean. The paternalistic. I'll give you the the abbreviated revamp.

43
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:38,260
So, like, this is maybe half the half of the rationale for the class and then you could just never come back again.

44
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:41,829
But the paternalistic you kind of missed it last time.

45
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:46,120
If you email me, I'll send you. We have a lot of videos of good examples and bad examples.

46
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:49,780
The paternalistic, nagging sort of what like the doctor I just described.

47
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:56,070
But that does what we definitely know is that never what is it?

48
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:04,510
It's not just that in this case, that doctor is being kind of an unsympathetic stoner, a grouchy old doctor.

49
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:09,130
But the bottom line is, it never works. It never works.

50
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:12,190
So what do we do?

51
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:22,870
That's sort of the question of the day that this class is kind of starting to get into the topic of brief interventions they mentioned last time.

52
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:33,640
It represents sort of a a collection of ideas and concepts and maybe more importantly, strategies, you know, specific brief.

53
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:41,030
Strategies and skills that are learnable and teachable, that do work better.

54
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:46,310
They really, really do. These are the evidence based approaches to how to communicate that we're talking about.

55
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:51,390
It's not just like even sort of what we're doing right now, which is somewhat unstructured.

56
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:53,270
You said something, say something interesting.

57
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:59,810
I go off over here, know that we're talking about especially partly given the brevity of the time we're talking about.

58
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:10,910
And with the mountains of evidence, frankly, we know how to have these conversations so that they're better, so that they can work.

59
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:18,290
Like I said, they're teachable and learnable. And so it's an opportunity for us to make major change.

60
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:28,790
So I want to kind of go more into that today. And again, a lot of the, you know, a bunch of arguments for why this is important.

61
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:36,740
But also today, you know, we'll do a fair amount of time just talking about, you know, assignments and expectations and all of that.

62
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:41,420
So first, you know,

63
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:53,570
let me start here with readings like you'll see there's all the readings should be in the modules that should match the word doc that I showed you.

64
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:59,690
And we'll look at in some detail that's here, you know, and I like I said, I'll update it somewhat.

65
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:08,080
It won't change a ton, but this is sort of like the outline for the class in terms of the readings.

66
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:11,510
Let's put this here. These are kind of kind of the roadmap for the class.

67
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:17,329
But in terms of the readings, I'll be completely honest with you.

68
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:29,090
Like I'm not we're not going to spend we'll spend a minority of our time saying, okay, the third reading for today was Yarnell 2017.

69
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:33,920
You know, who can tell me what? We're not going to do that. I'm not going to be like quizzing you on the readings.

70
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:47,300
There's a ton of readings. They're kind of classic examples for you to have in general, for most of these modules that will, you know,

71
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:53,030
may serve you well if you go on in any form of medicine or public health or even nursing or some might allied health.

72
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:57,889
These are sort of the classics and those are classics for a couple of different reasons.

73
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:06,980
One, because I picked them and I kind of know what the classic articles are in all these different areas, but there's another reason they're classics,

74
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:18,290
and that has to do with one of the assignments that I'll highlight now that's worked out really well, and that is this assignment.

75
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:22,600
You do, too. And it's called this.

76
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,680
I don't see the dates are there. There are a couple times there.

77
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,830
And this semester is one of the assignments. This, I think is each.

78
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:35,710
Come on, you can do it now. This is there's two papers.

79
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:40,780
This is two brief papers. And these are times when you're going to be asked to.

80
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:47,800
It's basically here's the idea. You find an article in the syllabus.

81
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:54,770
Kind of briefly summarize and critique it. Nothing that you haven't done in other classes, I'm sure.

82
00:08:55,370 --> 00:09:04,520
And then you find another article that's not in the syllabus that you think addresses that same point and does it better.

83
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,999
And you write just in three or four pages, say, like, this is this article.

84
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,210
It does this. I found this other article.

85
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,470
I like that article even better. It makes that same point.

86
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:23,400
It's also a randomized trial about, you know, promoting condom use, but it's better in some way.

87
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:28,129
So this is one time. Well, actually, you know, two times during this semester, we say, okay, now,

88
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:31,790
this time I got to really get serious about reading some evidence and some articles

89
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:39,290
get in a very structured way and you'll see in the syllabus in the I'm sorry,

90
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:46,119
a neck on the canvas site. I hope this I'm going to stress on my computer going back and forth too much today on the canvas.

91
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:57,260
Say, you know, I think I've been very, very good. I'm not trying to stump you on any of these assignments, the in the assignments page for that.

92
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:02,950
Assignments. Yeah. Pay it forward.

93
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,970
There. It's very clear. Exactly.

94
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:10,989
What the instructions are for these.

95
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:20,200
And if you can't see them, then I'm still I guess I'm struggling a little bit that they're but they're in here that pay it forward description.

96
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:26,290
I don't know why at the moment sorry about that but it says basically, you know, in it's like two pages.

97
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:29,500
In two pages, this is this article. This is what it is.

98
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:33,880
This is what the findings were. This is why that was, you know, made a good point.

99
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:38,139
I found this other article and as I said, I see your hands up.

100
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:43,720
I'll answer your question. Just let me finish this thought. You know, there's a lot of reasons you might say this article is better.

101
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:48,410
Typical reasons for, again, like critiquing scientific evidence.

102
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:55,759
The sample was bigger. You know, instead of 200 patients that had 1200 patients.

103
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:05,600
So that usually means better evidence. It had a more interesting slash, relevant slash, heterogeneous, less specialized sample.

104
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:12,590
So instead of only, you know, like, you know, white, middle class insured people in Canada,

105
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:17,659
this had a much more compelling sample that had a much more interesting that would be a reason.

106
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:25,400
Say like this, this article is better. The follow up was longer instead of just six weeks and had follow up over a couple of years.

107
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:30,200
I mean, fair to say that it was it was just clearer.

108
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:33,559
It was just clearer. Like the article from the from the syllabus.

109
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,460
Wasn't that clear?

110
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:42,050
Then the last thing that like I said, I'm a little be a little careful about this and we'll we'll come back and remind you about it.

111
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:48,040
This idea that it's more recent because, again, everything was done like before yesterday.

112
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:51,650
And so that's very good that things are more recent.

113
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:59,479
And we do want to keep updated, but try to think through a little more like what is more recent means like, well,

114
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:05,210
this article was done in 2010 since COVID was a game changer for health care and people are using it,

115
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:12,270
you know that there's some reason besides that the date is you six a year after the date there,

116
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:21,290
because as we said last time, if we have this hype, if we have this the primacy of recency, that everything has to be reset,

117
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:29,089
that's basically saying we want to redo every study all the time without moving forward in any field.

118
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,950
And there's some things where you say, well,

119
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:39,230
this is a brief counseling intervention with the community health worker in someone that's that's drinking at dangerous levels.

120
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:45,430
Yeah, it was in 2010. But like, why would it be any different now? Like, why would those why would that conversation?

121
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:52,190
There might be a reason. But that in and of itself isn't a great reason.

122
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:59,710
You know what I'm saying? So those are things. But, you know, like I said this I'll say this a good exercise.

123
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,650
Again, it's not particularly taxing for you to do.

124
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:08,440
But also, there's been it's called pay it forward for a good reason.

125
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:16,639
I've used these and then I go through each one and mostly like I'll say, like, I buy it or I don't buy it when I buy it.

126
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:23,090
That means I'm swapping out the article in the syllabus for this study that someone has found that's made it better.

127
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:30,139
So over the last three or four years of teaching this class, the class, you know, I crowdsource the syllabus,

128
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:37,460
crowdsource the article collection, and they've found better articles because, again, I'm not an expert in every single one of these fields.

129
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:40,879
And some of the articles are getting a little older and they say, Wow, yeah,

130
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,620
in 2020, a meta analysis on this very topic just came out and I'm like, Cool.

131
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:51,570
I didn't know that. Let's swap that out. So the syllabus and the articles in the syllabus are very, very good.

132
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:56,890
He said, You know, I'm not going to be really like, you know, grading you all.

133
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:01,100
And did you read each one right before the class where that particular article's assigned?

134
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:05,810
This is one example, though, where you will be. There are a few other times.

135
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:14,030
Well, I will let you know. Like, for example, you know, some of the classic areas of brief interventions are smoking and alcohol use.

136
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,419
It may be they say, okay, we're going to do the alcohol abuse now as well.

137
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:25,940
We're going to look at that. The Cochrane, the classic Cochrane review of meta analysis of randomized trials of alcohol brief interventions,

138
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:30,559
definitely read that line, come to class because we're going to look at it. So I'll let you know.

139
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,219
But that's kind of my general feeling about readings.

140
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:39,650
And here is one of the assignments is that it comes up two times during the semester.

141
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:40,760
Now who had hands up?

142
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:53,810
Yeah, I would miss it but where we find slides, slides so they will be in modules like but I put, we'll put them up after the class.

143
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:55,490
So it is like PowerPoint that or not.

144
00:14:55,730 --> 00:15:02,900
So after that class or maybe that class after that class and but if I honestly like if I forgive you, don't remind me.

145
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:08,680
But like I, you know, probably there was much in the first classes one.

146
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:14,240
But yeah, I'll try to do it like tomorrow or, you know, worse, you know, Friday after Thursday every year,

147
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,649
at least once a week, I'll put them in there and like I said, but I, I can forget sometimes.

148
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:22,950
So please don't be shy about reminding me about that. I'm currently not paid for.

149
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:27,110
The assignment is locked until February six so that we can't see the rubric.

150
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:33,860
Thanks for that. Yeah. It's just like using some of these things that canvas are a pain in the neck.

151
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:39,439
I didn't think that the instructions would be invisible, but I'll try to fix that.

152
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,069
Thanks. Yeah. So it it's basically what I said.

153
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:50,110
It's very clear. And since for each article, say what it said, say how you found that.

154
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:53,209
Say, say what you think. Is it strengths and weaknesses?

155
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:57,940
It's all like that. So that said. Yeah, so I'll, I'll try to fix that.

156
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:01,380
I think I was just messing with it today and then I accidentally locked it.

157
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:08,450
So that's one of the assignments. Another general.

158
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:16,640
Two general points, I guess. One is about class participation.

159
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:30,240
Again. Like, honestly, I begrudgingly bought into this idea of class participation points, meaning that that's like basically taking attendance.

160
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,230
To me, honest, honestly, that feels kind of infantile to me.

161
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:40,650
But I used to not take attendance and I had to admit that.

162
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:48,380
There's no question that if someone, for example, there was there was someone in my class that was in a wheelchair.

163
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:53,750
If that person is absent, it's easier to know than if it's someone else who's absent.

164
00:16:53,760 --> 00:17:02,670
So systematically asking everyone to sign in. Every class is really the only way to fairly keep track of who's coming in for class.

165
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,030
So, you know, starting and I didn't do it this week.

166
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:15,059
I'll bring in a list on Thursday hopefully, and we'll start just sending around the thing for class attendance participation again,

167
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:23,070
like I have had classes in graduate school where I need to like people like I need to talk more to get my participation.

168
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:28,049
I'm hoping this is a little more natural than that, you know, so we won't be doing that.

169
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:29,940
So I wouldn't worry too much about that.

170
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:38,220
With that said, you know, you know, one or two of you may have emailed me already and asked about like, hey, can I zoom in to class?

171
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:43,890
And we're really being told I definitely checked with the school in the department,

172
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:49,830
like, no, this is there's no we're not supposed to be doing hybrid classes, honestly.

173
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:54,840
You know, coming in is a pain, but like hybrid classes, they kind of stank.

174
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,110
And online classes were the worst.

175
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,579
So. So it looks like. Great. You're it looks like you're all coming.

176
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:05,760
You're all right here anyway, right before this. So that shouldn't be a problem.

177
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,640
So I'm not going to be regularly recording the lessons.

178
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:13,110
If you miss a class, you know, that's definitely can happen.

179
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:21,510
You know, all the PowerPoints will be up there. You can always email me if something's not clear and we can talk.

180
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:25,830
You know about it after class. If there's anything that's not clear you feel like you really missed.

181
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:32,910
So there's that. So there's class participation, the pay it forward.

182
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:40,530
Uh, what else? Oh, yeah, yeah.

183
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:47,729
This one is us. This one's also worked out very well. This is another part of your grade forum contribution.

184
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:53,630
So the discussions, so third, there's 13 I think on them there.

185
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:57,840
That goes through the semester. There are discussion tabs.

186
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,500
Let's see if those are actually available or locked.

187
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:08,030
Yeah. This is. Oh, no, it. It's because it's doing.

188
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,680
It's because it's not listed if this was part of this, because it's doing like in a student view.

189
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:23,570
But these are forum questions. They kind of match they generally match concepts that we're talking about.

190
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:31,170
Twice through this semester, you should respond to a forum questions, which will be a thread in a discussion.

191
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:38,429
So I'll be looking for that. And again, hopefully, you know, you can get it's in there, hopefully it's not locked.

192
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:43,709
I'll make sure that it's not there. It's very clear what a response to a forum question means.

193
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:46,500
So here, like let's just randomly pick a forum question.

194
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:54,330
They're meant to be kind of, you know, when we talk about motivational interviewing, do you think you'd be a good motivational interviewer?

195
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,200
Why or why not?

196
00:19:55,830 --> 00:20:04,680
What can make how can we make sure that they're delivered as intended and that which will make sense when we know about motivational interviewing?

197
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:12,060
Here's another one How should an organization balance the goal of identifying clients who need help?

198
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:22,369
With those clients right to privacy about issues such as sexual behavior, drug use and even illegal activity, expectations for privacy.

199
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:27,710
So you know about sharing information for family members or getting information from family members.

200
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:39,900
That would be a forum question. Here's one late in the semester, dietary changes and weight loss are difficult to achieve and even harder to maintain.

201
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:44,640
Ah, the intervention then this is like a subtheme to the semester.

202
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:50,520
Are the interventions worth the effort, given that they often don't work?

203
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:54,810
When do we throw the baby out with when we throw in the towel?

204
00:20:54,840 --> 00:21:01,320
In other words, a lot of the concept of brief intervention is this idea that we can't do everything for everyone.

205
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:08,370
There's only so much time when the patient or the client comes in that you're going to have in that session.

206
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:16,800
There's only so many sessions they're going to have. There's only so much space in your community based organizations to have private conversations.

207
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:22,560
You can't have private conversations about everything. There's only so many staff that have only so much training.

208
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:31,620
So how do we think in a critical way, hopefully based on some might be based on some principles, but we say no.

209
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:37,620
This organization is all about this. And we you know, it's sort of a first principle of our mission.

210
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:44,729
This is what we're going to do. It's really important in some hopefully about evidence as we'll see, like, you know,

211
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:52,170
to be kind of critically thinking like, yeah, you know, I'm not saying this to Friday, but say, you know what?

212
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:58,230
Diet's really important. People that have a website and get them just because it's hypothetical, you know, diet.

213
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:04,799
Diet is the strongest predictor of diabetes and life expectancy and cardiovascular disease.

214
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:09,000
But the interventions never work. That's what I mean by throw in the towel.

215
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,560
The we the meta analysis showed quite clearly that none of this works.

216
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:18,770
So even though that's related to the outcome intervening, it doesn't help at all.

217
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:22,530
So that's not something we're going to focus on with our very scarce resources.

218
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:28,229
Those are forum questions. So twice during the semester they'll be these forum questions.

219
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:34,799
Again, they'll be more specific that you should be responding to at least two of those during the semester.

220
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:42,180
And again, like I've been very pleased in the past, people are very thoughtful, kind of, you know, bouncing off other people's responses.

221
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:49,050
I will try to be weighing in to the forum questions like not every week, but during the semester.

222
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:55,680
I'll be watching kind of the discussion weighing and kind of adding to the discussion and saying, Yeah, but maybe think about that.

223
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:59,879
So it's just another way to kind of engage with the material.

224
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:06,960
So that's something else. And then it's just the last piece.

225
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:16,620
Yeah. So oh, no, there's two more things that, you know, I kind of graded activities.

226
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:23,250
One is a group presentation and.

227
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:28,459
Given the size of the class. You know, these are here.

228
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:31,490
I have a sign up sheet for group presentation.

229
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:35,900
Almost all of the critiques of evidence in a particular area.

230
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:41,520
Follow roughly the same format. It's a really good format.

231
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:48,570
And again, I've been very in general, I would say very pleased with the group presentations in this class.

232
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:52,110
There's been many more than half, I would say,

233
00:23:52,500 --> 00:24:01,700
group presentations on these various topics where I would say to that group, like, you could you could get this done it.

234
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:08,340
You could give this as a noon seminar in the Department of Family Medicine here,

235
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:17,010
and that would be a very respectable review of pediatric obesity interventions and the evidence around that.

236
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:25,830
I mean, people do really well with these group presentations and like and we can we can do well.

237
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:30,120
And, you know, don't be shy about letting me know what you know.

238
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:31,799
Don't be shy about asking questions.

239
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:41,490
As this gets closer, some of the groups do want to meet with me before the group presentation, talk about how they're organizing it.

240
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:45,120
But basically, again, the structure is going to be very, very clear.

241
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:49,380
Here's the topic I'm looking at. I'll tell you very quickly.

242
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:52,680
There's seven of these. I'm going to pass this around.

243
00:24:54,180 --> 00:25:05,430
Their topics are grief interventions for intimate partner violence, physical activity, diarrhea, weight loss, suicide risk gambling addiction,

244
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:12,059
brief interventions in low and middle income countries, and kind of alternative delivery modes,

245
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:15,270
meaning peer support, family support, community health workers.

246
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:21,300
Right. And those are kind of the topics except for each one.

247
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:29,310
You know, the it's it's a very logical it's really an outline for the group presentation, which again,

248
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:36,300
matches your outline that you're going to use for your final paper, which matches a lot to, to a great extent,

249
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:42,900
one of the main sources of evidence that the world follows, definitely the United States,

250
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:50,100
but much of the world as well, which is the United States Preventive Services Task Force, some in the U.S. are.

251
00:25:50,550 --> 00:26:01,770
So they come out with guidelines. So they they digest evidence in all these fields related to mostly primary care, primary care,

252
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:08,249
specialty care and some social services, and come out with recommendations in each of their recommend,

253
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:14,459
each of their guidelines from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force usually follows the very same outline that,

254
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:18,030
frankly, you're going to be following in these various assignments.

255
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:25,680
And it's kind of like make look at one like. Let's see.

256
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:32,370
Well, let's take promoting physical activity. Why is this important?

257
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,490
Basic epidemiology. People are not physically active.

258
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:40,200
Lack of physical activity is related to these particular bad outcomes.

259
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:43,650
People that are less physically active have a greater risk of X, Y and Z.

260
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:54,450
Then the next question is always is another topic we'll get into during the semester is screening like, okay, people, physical activity matters.

261
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,660
If you're working in an organization, call it a primary care practice.

262
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:05,480
Can we identify people that have little physical activity? Like, is it realistic?

263
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:09,830
Do we have it? We have a screening tool that can reasonably identify people like that.

264
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:18,440
Can we identify people that are at risk for suicide? Like suicide risk is bad, but like, if we can't identify people, like, what are we talking about?

265
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:24,770
Like we can't make a guideline around things we can identify. So I think it was somebody near the back.

266
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:31,370
Last time we talked, they were interested in surveillance and screening. So, you know, we're going to talk about surveillance of screening.

267
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:35,270
Do we have a reasonable test? Intimate partner violence.

268
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,140
We're going to talk about false positives and false negatives.

269
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:45,230
Can you really identify people as will say like that is an example for intimate partner violence?

270
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:49,669
Like like hang with me here for a second because it's going to sound kind of polemical,

271
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:58,610
kind of almost purposely controversial from a public health primary care perspective.

272
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:04,220
We don't care if we can identify someone who has experienced partner violence.

273
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:09,200
We don't care about that. I don't care if they've experienced partner violence.

274
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:12,620
What is that? What do I mean? What am I what is my point I'm trying to make?

275
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:16,550
The point I'm trying to make is that was that already happened?

276
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:23,510
We want a screener that not just identifies what has happened, but that is predictive.

277
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:28,190
Right. Of something that's going to happen and hasn't happened.

278
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:35,110
And then the next part of the argument is, okay, it is a problem.

279
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:41,450
We can predict who's going to have this problem. And then the clincher is and guess what?

280
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:45,490
We have brief interventions that definitely work to do that thing.

281
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:50,460
That would be the argument for doing it right. If it falls down again, if it's not a problem,

282
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:57,670
us preventive version that this is not something that's associated with a high morbidity and mortality like well,

283
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:02,740
we move right on if it is, but we can't identify people that are at high risk.

284
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:11,050
There's nothing really more to say if we can, but there's nothing we can do to mitigate that risk.

285
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:15,040
Again, unfortunately, we kind of move on.

286
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:21,910
So, you know, you'll use kind of that very logical outline and look at the evidence in each of those areas,

287
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:26,350
pulling, you know, case studies in each of those areas in the group presentation.

288
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,790
And then, as I said,

289
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:35,829
there'll be a couple more topics like this in the last assignment for the semester is basically write a paper around one of those,

290
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:46,750
you know, and that's that's kind of how it works. Okay. So again, nothing that unusual I didn't do please, like not counting.

291
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:50,950
I think I know roughly how many people if you sign up.

292
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:54,069
And of course, you're going to sign it based on like when the date is.

293
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:59,350
And also the topic is if there's four people already signed up, please sign up for something else.

294
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:04,280
There might be a little bit of, you know, jostling around later on.

295
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:09,130
But that's kind of I just it's just going to be how we're going to do it. And again, it's worked out really well.

296
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:21,730
I will say that in one of the recent iterate, you know, times I've taught this class, it was last year, it was the year before one of the groups.

297
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:26,450
You know, because I said, like, I've always been very pleased with how these presentations have gone,

298
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:34,729
but one of them is clearly did it look at the the instructions that they just gave up came up and gave a very fluid discussion,

299
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:40,610
and that was really unfortunate. So we really do want you to be able to go through with that outline.

300
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:48,229
You know, every epidemiologic evidence for the problem, screening for this task, for example, intimate partner violence,

301
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:56,740
there's a whole variety of screening instruments that you can use in primary care to ask the patient, are they at risk?

302
00:30:56,750 --> 00:31:00,510
Are they not at risk? Come up with a score. How do you think about scores?

303
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:06,680
All of that. Then looking at intervention and coming up with a conclusion or a recommendation, that's kind of the outline.

304
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:11,690
And the closer you follow that outline, the better it's going to be.

305
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:18,240
Okay. And the other questions, like I said, I think this is all pretty standard stuff for you.

306
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:24,530
For you all. Yeah. Or discussions or Twitter or.

307
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:27,660
Thanks for asking. Yeah, they are. You know, they.

308
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:32,319
They kind of. Match topics through the semester.

309
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:37,809
But note there you have to have done your second one by some date near the end of the semester.

310
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:41,930
And remember what? Some date in April. That's it. So, you know.

311
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:46,690
Yeah, if you I'm not going to really be like looking, you know, some people do do it.

312
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:50,620
It's kind of nice if you check in, you know, do them through the semester.

313
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:57,819
But no. Yeah, it's they're not do it any specific time because then you really can just look

314
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:03,310
through that whole list and pick whichever one and you're just expected to do it.

315
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:06,880
Some people do would do more than two. And that's again, that's kind of really appreciated.

316
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:10,300
It's kind of nice if you can do that, but that's the expectation, too.

317
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:13,750
Any other questions?

318
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:24,370
No. Okay. Soon these first.

319
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:33,430
Now in the rest of these first few weeks, we have pull up that that general road map again.

320
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:41,920
You can see. We've kind of structured now is that there's kind of these two main pillars.

321
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,520
Like conceptual pillars for the class.

322
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:55,450
One is some basic stuff on like evidence, like in a randomized trials screening and how to think about screening tests,

323
00:32:56,260 --> 00:33:00,309
systematic reviews, meta analysis and guidelines. That's kind of over here.

324
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:04,780
How to think critically about, frankly, quantitative evidence.

325
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:13,770
That's one pillar. Then there's this whole set of, you know, kind of core skills, competencies,

326
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:19,650
elements of brief interventions and brief how to communicate with people in a more effective way.

327
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:30,190
And for the next. Maybe three or four weeks, we're going to kind of, you know, find their way back and forth between those two things.

328
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:37,570
Then, as I said, we'll start to apply those in some of the very classic areas.

329
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:45,850
And towards the end of semester. Like I said, do more like riffing on those themes and looking at more like technology use or,

330
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:50,650
you know, can we teach family members to do these things, etc.

331
00:33:51,040 --> 00:34:00,699
So that's where we are right now. You know, they're kind of, you know, kind of defining in a more concrete way.

332
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,160
What do we mean by brief interventions?

333
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:13,540
What are kind of some of the fundamental principles of health, behavior, change, some of those I'm sure you touched on in other classes?

334
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:22,990
Now, let's flip over to this evidence. We'll have a couple of lectures on looking critically at evidence.

335
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:29,730
I don't think I said last time, like I said, I think I said I self-identify as a researcher.

336
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:40,450
I am a producer of evidence and sometimes a role I really enjoy because being a communicator of evidence to professional groups,

337
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:48,950
to students like yourselves, to other people. If you want to be one or both of those things in your career, that's awesome.

338
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:53,389
Highly recommend it. Be someone that lets it like I'm going to be a researcher,

339
00:34:53,390 --> 00:35:01,250
I'm going to go on and get my Ph.D. or get my M.D. and I'm going to be an academic researcher developing more effective,

340
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:05,270
brief interventions for teen weight loss or something like that. That's awesome.

341
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:09,690
We need those people. But what the main goal?

342
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:17,190
I think the broader goal, the really important goal in public health is to have you in this case,

343
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:26,640
leave this particular class and go forth in general, I guess, after graduation, as a effective consumer of evidence.

344
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:31,420
Because that's a big problem. We have all this evidence over here.

345
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:35,650
We have the rest of the world that's working in public health over here.

346
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:38,380
And there's just not enough.

347
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:51,880
There's not enough overlap where people in the public health world don't feel comfortable consuming evidence and deciding what works.

348
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:59,140
How to make sense of it. How to make sense. Whether it applies in my particular context and what I want to do.

349
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:01,270
And that's a big problem. I mean,

350
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:09,580
it's a big reason why there's kind of a there's a lot of misallocation of public health resources because people don't know how to use evidence.

351
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:17,980
But I always say, you know, like if you were going to go right here, some of you mentioned going on into a kind of consulting world.

352
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,989
The goal or I want to say fantasy,

353
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:32,950
but it's really like a more of a concrete goal that you are going to be the person at the table that really can say, can be saying, you know what?

354
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:37,330
Well, let's put it here. Here's one classic example I like.

355
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:52,060
Like, say you're talking to a state, a county, a private health care system that says, man, we are we are very worried about teen suicide.

356
00:36:52,870 --> 00:37:01,159
In our organization. We're seeing way too many. We know the number of teens who have commit suicide in the last two years.

357
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:05,250
This has gone up, you know, 300% is just unacceptable.

358
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:10,500
We need to start screening and intervening on, you know,

359
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:20,590
all of the young people that come into our into our system for suicide so we can identify them and do screening and brief interventions.

360
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:26,590
I want you to be the ones at the table that can say and again, this is a hypothetical.

361
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:34,510
This is mostly hypothetical. So you know what I totally get that is a very big problem.

362
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:41,470
But we I just looked at what it says of the US Preventive Services Task Force, the various, you know,

363
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:49,540
the kind of the state of the art of screening for this particular problem and the effectiveness of these brief interventions.

364
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:54,580
And they just unfortunately, we don't have things that work very well.

365
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:04,870
So if we put a lot of emphasis on screening, everyone can hypothetical one one thing that is just plain true about like suicidality.

366
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:15,610
Thankfully, there's there's a there's many, many more orders of magnitude more people who when you ask them, have you thought about harming yourself?

367
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:23,210
Thankfully, there's orders of magnitude more of those people than people that go on to make a suicide attempt.

368
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:32,360
In other words, the vast majority of people that say, yeah, I definitely have thought about harming myself, do not go on to make a suicide attempt.

369
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:40,970
So if you have very scarce resources, space clinicians in our staff time,

370
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:45,980
patient time and say we're going to ask everyone that question, are you thinking about killing yourself?

371
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:50,090
And if they say, yes, we're going to arrest them into a room and have a 45 minute discussion.

372
00:38:51,120 --> 00:39:03,080
You may miss allocate resources to a great extent, resources that could be used in other ways to actually improve people's behavior and their health.

373
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:09,450
Right. So I want you to be comfortable consumers of evidence.

374
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:14,370
I looked at the customer service that has always been looking at what.

375
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:17,790
COCHRANE We are talking about. COCHRANE Reviews.

376
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:25,229
That's kind of a classic repository of evidence. There was a really interesting meta analysis that just came out that said like this

377
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:30,990
particular sort of like digital communication actually can be do a little bit better job.

378
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:38,400
We might consider that that's a low resource thing that I want you to come out to be good consumers of evidence, comfortable consumers of evidence.

379
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:45,960
Right. So that's what we're going to be talking about here. So we know the basic concept of biz brief interventions.

380
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:54,030
We talk about evidence, then we'll go start to go a little bit deeper in some of these, you know, kind of sloshing back, I guess,

381
00:39:54,030 --> 00:40:03,299
to the buy side, some of these really, you know, foot pillars of these communication styles that now that have evidence.

382
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:06,720
And then most of the interventions that we'll look at has some form.

383
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:11,730
I mean, essentially, they're motivational interviewing and some form of cognitive behavioral therapy.

384
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:15,839
Those are the strategies, those are the approaches.

385
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,870
Those are the structured communication styles that we're going to look at.

386
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:24,930
None. Like I said, we're going to start going through specific topics.

387
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:35,040
I shrunk this where, you know, we'll have we'll look at the evidence, you know, the key studies, the guidelines, etc., on alcohol use.

388
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:45,160
And I'm hoping to have some of the people from the CAPS program, if you know them that are on campus alcohol, I think maybe use your accounts.

389
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,139
Do you like Wolverines for Wolverines support? Yeah, I kind of can blur those things together.

390
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:57,180
But anyway, yeah. So these, you know, these programs that if someone gets an M.P. on campus, they get sent to the camp counselor.

391
00:40:57,180 --> 00:41:01,770
And, you know, they absolutely are following these guideline recommended approaches.

392
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:04,920
They're experts in motivational interviewing and some in CBT.

393
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,660
So we're going to look at alcohol.

394
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:18,179
I kind of used to have a separate whole module on tobacco use, and I kind of shrunk that to some extent because as I mentioned last time.

395
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:28,170
But but we may have there are tobacco use counselors in the health system at Saint Joe's or Trinity Health Care System.

396
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:35,670
These that tobacco use against one of the classic areas where these bills were designed.

397
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:45,450
And it's one of the main places that people, to put it this way, can get a job doing this work directly in counseling.

398
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:53,310
Why? Even though there's fewer people that are smoking tobacco smoking like tobacco cigarets than than there used to be,

399
00:41:54,270 --> 00:42:02,669
there's still we hire people because. Literally and I say this, it sounds like a, you know, kind of, you know,

400
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:09,030
just heaping false praise onto these kind of when they get someone to quit tobacco use.

401
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:16,470
They've they've they've added on average, seven years to that person's life expectancy.

402
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:20,270
It's a massively beneficial intervention.

403
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:25,979
So the state of Michigan, you can look I mean, if any if you know anyone that, you know,

404
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:32,850
smokes tobacco and you want to get free nicotine replacement therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy for tobacco.

405
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,740
Michigan provides that. Why?

406
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:44,639
Because the Medicaid department and the state, you know, health insurers benefit so greatly if someone quit smoking, it's massive for them.

407
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:48,120
So they're like, yeah, let's fund an entire unit to do those things.

408
00:42:48,660 --> 00:43:00,750
So those so we'll have some of that. But again, you know, we could spend more time in this, but I wanted to focus more on these topics,

409
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:03,960
which is chronic pain, which is an area we know a lot about.

410
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:08,189
One of the B.I counselors that's worked with me for many years is going to come

411
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:16,110
in and we'll look at the evidence and some of the studies that we've done, frankly, and we'll have a whole session on depression,

412
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:24,510
brief interventions and a separate session on anxiety with interventions which, as I mentioned, I want to extend.

413
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:31,110
And then we'll end with again some of these kind of kind of interesting tools.

414
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:35,940
Once you have all these concepts, you know, you're good consumers of evidence at that point,

415
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:42,680
you know, all of these specific ideas and how people think about how to make things brief.

416
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:49,830
How do you do training for brief interventions? You know, what are those different skill sets that we want brief intervention counselors to have?

417
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:57,209
We'll look at other ways that people are trying to make them even one more effective with.

418
00:43:57,210 --> 00:44:03,540
Maybe our goal is always to make them even more effective, or at least maintain effectiveness and make them even briefer.

419
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:11,130
In other words, cheaper because the cheaper it is the briefer it is, the more people that we can get these interventions to.

420
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,580
So that's kind of the general outline for the semester.

421
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:20,070
Um. Let's see. Okay.

422
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:27,090
Now we can at least jump into again.

423
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:33,040
This is kind of to me, I don't know. I find this. Fascinating.

424
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:42,810
I think it's really. It's kind of, if I may say, you know, even more relevant if you all are undergrads,

425
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:48,960
maybe on average a little less experience working out in health and social services.

426
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:54,510
And so it's almost. Difficult to.

427
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:59,970
It's hard to appreciate, you know,

428
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:11,130
how challenging some of these some of these things are in terms of the delivery and kind of where you're kind of coming into the public health.

429
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:22,500
Health care world. But this has really been a theme that has defined a lot of my my career as a researcher.

430
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:25,540
It's led me into a lot of the development of digital interventions.

431
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:29,980
And this this kind of this is the gap.

432
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:43,450
There was a time when, you know, 20, 25 years ago where you could say, yeah, we just we don't know.

433
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:52,180
Like we don't know what sorts of communications or care management or counseling or therapy really works.

434
00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:57,120
We didn't know that that was. Kind of long ago and not that long ago.

435
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:05,190
We now do know in many areas and I'm over general, I'm, you know, over generalizing a little bit.

436
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:11,460
But the fact is we absolutely we we could go through all the randomized trials, etc., etc.

437
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:17,130
If someone has heart failure, we definitely know what sort of interventions,

438
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:25,120
counseling interventions are going to decrease their likelihood of a hospitalization and even extend their life expectancy.

439
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:31,710
We absolutely know how to do that. We know how to, as we'll see, get people to stop smoking.

440
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:35,550
We know how to help people moderate their drinking.

441
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:39,390
We know how to help depressed people to be less depressed.

442
00:46:39,870 --> 00:46:49,949
We absolutely know how to do that. That's the good news. The bad news is people tend to not get most of the things that, you know can be accrued here.

443
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:52,049
But like that, as in academics,

444
00:46:52,050 --> 00:47:02,100
we churn out these very effective interventions and publish them and no one ever gets them because they're way too intensive,

445
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:09,040
their way too resource intensive in health system. Say, like, yeah, like for example, they say I think this is real.

446
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:19,200
Still roughly true in the private sector. If you're private, a private health insurer is looking at you as a member and saying, well,

447
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:24,840
on average you're going to be with me for seven years and then you're going to move to another job and you're going to get another.

448
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:29,530
Health insurance and another health care system.

449
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:37,640
So in my going to invest in interventions that I know work that are not going to bear fruit for ten years.

450
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:41,160
No. Not going to do that. Right.

451
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:47,730
So we have this gap. These are two studies that were very important as I was kind of kind of formulating that idea.

452
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:57,750
The first is Lisa Rubinstein develops is a VA researcher and she's a researchers at UCLA.

453
00:47:58,530 --> 00:48:02,970
And she developed these very comprehensive health system interventions for depression.

454
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:06,900
So like too many people have depression and suicide people.

455
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:10,319
We need comprehensive, multi-modal, multidimensional interventions.

456
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:16,080
We're going to train all the doctors in how to screen and identify people and how to counsel them.

457
00:48:16,290 --> 00:48:23,249
And patients are going to get care managers and we're going to give all these resources to the nurses, etc., etc.

458
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:29,880
And she did enormous. Multi-Site randomized trial definitely showed we can decrease.

459
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:38,870
Depression and improved depression care. The number of patients that are coming back for care, that need care, and we absolutely can do that.

460
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:48,260
And then this other person is a psychiatrist at the University of Oregon, Stephen Darbyshire, an amazing researcher.

461
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:51,800
He said, okay, well, no one's getting that thing.

462
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:55,220
And so this is kind of a theme over the last 15, 20 years.

463
00:48:56,090 --> 00:49:00,290
How do we translate that into practice? So we're going to just kind of.

464
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:03,200
Trim around the edges like.

465
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:11,170
And so instead of having one on one counseling sessions with all the doctors and teach them about depression, we're going to develop a website.

466
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:13,460
We're going to tell them they should go and look at the website.

467
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:19,459
And instead of having patients have a care manager will give them a booklet and say, you know,

468
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:26,840
you can use this booklet and trying to be as faithful as they could to all the principles of these effective interventions,

469
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:30,950
but to squeeze it into what they thought was going to be feasible.

470
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:36,620
And again, we've tried to do that many, many, many times. We did another huge multi-site randomized trial.

471
00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:40,350
No effect, nothing. Right.

472
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:46,729
So that gave everyone a lot of pause. They said like, okay, people need a lot of help.

473
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:50,210
So that's when Lisa Williams said she wrote the thing, there's no free lunch.

474
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:54,980
I mean, they were saying, like, we we you can't just give text messages.

475
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:59,690
Without being very thoughtful to people that have depression or that are at risk for suicide.

476
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:04,670
Their problems are very complex for the people that are struggling with an opioid addiction that,

477
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:09,470
per say, without being very thoughtful, isn't going to work.

478
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:20,570
So that's this kind of gap. And another way people think of the gap is that like if someone if you are I think this is correct, this math works out.

479
00:50:21,770 --> 00:50:28,220
If you're sleeping 8 hours a night over the course of a year, that's, I think, how much you're awake.

480
00:50:28,410 --> 00:50:37,340
Right. You have that many hours awake and walking around and moving through the world in your life with whatever you have, with your diabetes,

481
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:43,700
with your weight loss problem, with your addiction to nicotine and vaping,

482
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:50,000
with your struggles with Adderall, with your binge probably binge drinking, whatever.

483
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:54,049
And if you're a good patient, like and this is way more than probably most of you,

484
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:57,920
but if you're like a a diabetes patient, the typical diabetes patient.

485
00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:03,980
Is the recommendation is come every three months. Go to the doctor every three months.

486
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:11,690
Just because it gets kind of high level, that's for someone who's chronically ill. So maybe again, this is as a year, maybe you can get 15 minutes.

487
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:18,320
Four times a year, whether that's one hour. Trying to influence.

488
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:23,640
Those $5 that you write, you can kind of see that it works like, okay, I start to see.

489
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:29,740
Where. Expecting providers to do this.

490
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:36,659
One of the big problems with getting behavior change in the typical health care system is that there's this.

491
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:49,340
Huge, huge. You know, mismatch between what can be done and what is actually being done.

492
00:51:49,350 --> 00:51:55,920
So it's another thing you said, like, I kind of we all love the US Preventive Services Task Force, for lack of a better word.

493
00:51:56,370 --> 00:52:01,290
There's kind of nothing better they really summer they're the go to for evidence.

494
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:08,730
But typically what they do, I mean, you'll see they have evidence on everything and all these different topics.

495
00:52:08,730 --> 00:52:12,270
Like, should you counsel patients about smoking cessation?

496
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:16,230
Should you tell them to wear a seatbelt in their car?

497
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:24,660
Should you screen them for alcohol abuse? Should you find out if their young person using Adderall, should you talk to them about sexual health?

498
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:30,870
And like for many of these, that's like, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. And they bring together these panels that look at the evidence in that area.

499
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:37,510
Okay. But there started to be people that say, like, well, wait a minute,

500
00:52:38,290 --> 00:52:47,650
if I'm a primary care doc and I have 2000 patients and I did all of those things, what would that actually?

501
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:51,810
Mean, and this was one study.

502
00:52:51,810 --> 00:52:53,459
There's been a couple of these that they've said,

503
00:52:53,460 --> 00:53:00,030
like if you have systematically looking at all those 2500 patients and some are young people that need,

504
00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:08,760
again, counseling about contraceptives or, you know, safe sex practices that are not going to transmit diseases.

505
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:12,870
And suddenly the counseling about their alcohol that they're if I did all of

506
00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:19,110
those things that would take me as a doctor 8.6 hours a day just doing that.

507
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:25,200
And never touching what the person came in for. They came in because they sprained their ankle.

508
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:29,730
They came in because they have a GI problem.

509
00:53:29,970 --> 00:53:35,010
They came into their country. I can't do anything. This is not doable.

510
00:53:36,070 --> 00:53:39,610
In primary care. Right. So these are the.

511
00:53:40,670 --> 00:53:48,350
Kind of the arguments why we need creative uses of some of these concepts of brief intervention that, you know, that was just primary care.

512
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:53,510
Practice. These were other studies that sort of did the same thing.

513
00:53:53,870 --> 00:54:00,170
And again, if you looked at how many patients in your typical practice.

514
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:08,870
We have high cholesterol, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, depression, you know.

515
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:13,470
You know, it's a fine 20 minutes a year to talk about hypertension.

516
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:17,290
How bad can that be? You know, like you're there all year.

517
00:54:17,550 --> 00:54:23,610
And there was another, again, 3.5 hours just in a workday just to talk about this.

518
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:24,690
So now you're up to 11.

519
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:35,220
You know, it's just the typical recommendations that we love and that we're going to look at this class just are not feasible in real world practice.

520
00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:46,260
This was another study. Again, it was just like a real, you know, just kind of a reality shock to me.

521
00:54:46,270 --> 00:54:53,600
Like they looked at it's a good study where they looked around the world, 67 different countries.

522
00:54:53,610 --> 00:54:59,990
How much time? Like I said, like diabetes patients, maybe 15 minutes because nobody has 50 minutes with it.

523
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:05,910
I mean, what they do in the VA health care systems, what doctors love working in the VA, I need a lot more time with the patients.

524
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:12,240
But in a typical if you're like, you know, IHH, it's a practice here at um, you're getting your care here.

525
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:15,470
You're probably more like a ten minute. Visit.

526
00:55:15,830 --> 00:55:24,170
But around the world, when you look around the world, half of the world population is less than 5 minutes with their doctor.

527
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:35,830
So that's one of the reasons we're all very obsessively focused on just this whole idea of the brief.

528
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:41,370
Yes. A brief interventions in how we have to really think like.

529
00:55:41,370 --> 00:55:45,470
So, you know, if you're in a class that's focused on, again, intimate partner violence,

530
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:48,960
it's so you need to screen and counsel and that's absolutely true.

531
00:55:49,290 --> 00:55:52,350
But you have to kind of look at the gestalt of where people are getting care.

532
00:55:52,710 --> 00:55:57,510
And it's just this is why this one of the reasons none of those things is working.

533
00:55:57,510 --> 00:56:05,549
And we need to have this laser focus on brief interventions, by the way, like there's been a number of people that because they've had this class,

534
00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:10,560
I would say they're mostly in the master's program and then they're going out, they're going to work in the real world.

535
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:15,270
This is what this is the language that people are speaking in the real world.

536
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:21,470
This was the academic world. And so they say, I've had training and brief interventions and have gotten jobs in a number of places and

537
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:26,850
federally qualified health centers I went through and I still really keep in touch with.

538
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:31,830
She's a grief intervention counselor for the American Lung Association.

539
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:36,230
You know, so that's what people are doing out in the real world. Okay.

540
00:56:36,570 --> 00:56:44,120
So beyond this this time issue. So we have more time.

541
00:56:46,400 --> 00:57:00,770
This is this other. Problem of the the the the the real limits on the quality of communication independent of how much time.

542
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:05,379
Between providers and patients again.

543
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:08,970
Like it. A build a tenant of this idea.

544
00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:17,210
Brief interventions. Is that there are ways that we can learn and teach communication.

545
00:57:18,490 --> 00:57:26,590
That work better. But in the real, real world, this just isn't happening.

546
00:57:26,590 --> 00:57:33,850
So now, just for fun, we'll go through a whole bunch of ways.

547
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:38,840
Evidence. Why? That's true. This was a study that we did.

548
00:57:39,670 --> 00:57:45,079
I was up in Flint. In one of the safety net health care systems.

549
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:50,110
I want to see Genesis health care system and we would interview.

550
00:57:51,150 --> 00:57:59,070
We were interviewing diabetes patients about cost related of their medication and not taking my medication because it cost me too much.

551
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:07,680
And I was doing these interviews. One of the things that really impacted me as a researcher getting out in the world and I would say,

552
00:58:07,770 --> 00:58:11,310
are you not taking your medication because it's cost too much?

553
00:58:13,230 --> 00:58:16,020
And often they would say, yes,

554
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:23,720
and this would I would often be able to get them while they're waiting to see their doctor and say, like, Well, that's not good.

555
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:27,030
Are you going to tell them, like, you're going to go in their doctor right now?

556
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:37,360
And that mostly. No. Like, you know, so you see a racial you know, there's a racial issue here.

557
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:43,440
Racial difference, nonwhite patients even much less likely to tell their doctor.

558
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:52,790
But independent of that. Like most patients, the majority of patients have said, I'm not taking my medication because that's too much.

559
00:58:53,090 --> 00:58:57,900
We're going to say like nonacademic. I'm not going to tell him in advance.

560
00:58:58,230 --> 00:59:02,970
And, you know, maybe one in three, whatever they say, will someday emerge.

561
00:59:04,650 --> 00:59:11,330
But they don't. They're not telling their doctor that's a problem from their perspective.

562
00:59:11,330 --> 00:59:15,140
Right. So you have these two people in this dyad. That's the patient.

563
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:18,740
This is another part of that survey, again, that I share these results.

564
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:25,120
At the time with. A really good guy who's now since retired.

565
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:31,079
He's the head of Blue Cross Blue Shield because he really the guy in the sense that he really cares.

566
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:35,520
He was the medical director for the corner clinic. Some of you might know, like that's in a clinic.

567
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:43,350
It's where the good guy, Dr. David Chair, since retired, I share this with him and his role and you'll see why in a second.

568
00:59:43,650 --> 00:59:50,220
And it role at Blue Cross Blue Shield. These were other questions I would ask patients in that survey.

569
00:59:51,450 --> 00:59:57,480
And again, we're going to see we can focus on the difference with African-American and white patients.

570
00:59:58,630 --> 01:00:03,610
But just kind of the global is is already really important.

571
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:10,720
These were patients with diabetes taking anti hypoglycemic medication, diabetes medication.

572
01:00:11,450 --> 01:00:15,240
Okay. So when you ask. True or false?

573
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:20,390
Most prescription medications are addictive. Most prescription medications are addictive.

574
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:25,370
About 35% of the patients said yes. I think most prescription medications are addictive.

575
01:00:26,210 --> 01:00:34,010
Right. That's a problem. Again, we can see you can know for yourselves the racial difference.

576
01:00:34,370 --> 01:00:37,850
Prescription medications do more harm than good.

577
01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:46,760
One in five patients were saying that. So those that's a that's a problematic belief.

578
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:51,639
People who take prescription medication should stop their treatment for a while every now and then.

579
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:58,090
And that was a common belief that we started to use this kind of idea of like giving your body a vacation,

580
01:00:58,100 --> 01:01:01,700
giving your body a rest from these all these pills.

581
01:01:02,930 --> 01:01:10,700
But that isn't a good thing. And this was the reason I shared it with the that person I mentioned, Blue Cross.

582
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:19,040
There is a lot of beliefs about generic medications that, again, were not being identified and that when we talk about like,

583
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:25,250
you know, these this this this mismatch between what providers are doing and what patients are hearing.

584
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:30,170
Yeah, generic medications are less effective than brand name drugs.

585
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:33,500
You know, one in three said, yeah,

586
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:43,250
definitely twice as many of those being twice as many twice as twice as many African-American patients than white patients endorsing that.

587
01:01:43,490 --> 01:01:48,890
But a lot of all of the patients. Now, again, what other area of life?

588
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:54,870
Like for us. We're so in medical public health now.

589
01:01:54,890 --> 01:01:58,640
We know it's it's the same molecule. It's gone off brand.

590
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:03,140
So now they're selling it generic. It's a lot cheaper. Is that we're making judgeships the exact same thing.

591
01:02:03,830 --> 01:02:09,590
Right. What other area of normal life. Generic paper towels.

592
01:02:10,610 --> 01:02:13,970
Generic macaroni and cheese. Come on.

593
01:02:14,450 --> 01:02:18,320
Here's one car that costs, like, $14,000.

594
01:02:18,470 --> 01:02:21,890
Here's a car that costs 50,000. Don't worry, it's the exact same.

595
01:02:23,190 --> 01:02:27,780
There's no easy. Right. So it's a very normal, understandable belief.

596
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:32,700
But is there so dangerous additives?

597
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:39,750
I'd be more likely to skip a dose of a generic. And the last one which was endorsed by most.

598
01:02:40,710 --> 01:02:46,720
Of these patients. This is why I shared it with the director of Blue Cross Blue Shield is really trying to help.

599
01:02:46,870 --> 01:02:53,290
And again, they're trying to make health care cheaper, among other things, by using generic insurance plans.

600
01:02:53,290 --> 01:02:57,310
Push generics to save themselves money at the expense of my health.

601
01:02:58,260 --> 01:03:02,440
64% of the patients said, yes, that's what's going.

602
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:11,190
Right. So a problem. And again, every consensus in the every one of these beliefs.

603
01:03:11,910 --> 01:03:17,040
More likely, you know, you know what we would call unhelpful beliefs, I guess, for lack of a better term.

604
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:25,340
It's not exactly what I what the term I want, but more likely, African-American patients, black patients,

605
01:03:25,350 --> 01:03:33,839
more likely to have a skepticism about what the healthcare system is doing to them, for them and white patients, they put a lot in all patients.

606
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:42,700
So that's again. One of the reasons that we're focused on that from the patient side.

607
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:47,250
But there's. A number.

608
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:52,660
There's a number of people have done a lot and this is this you might have taken some more class if you team

609
01:03:52,680 --> 01:04:00,090
Dr. Brian segment fishers class and sticky communication other things you see this communication dynamic.

610
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:06,780
We saw an example of really poor communication last time, maybe a doctor that was very frustrated.

611
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:16,370
But I. Worrying about the mother's smoke, the implications of her smoking for the for the child, for the baby.

612
01:04:16,950 --> 01:04:21,550
Right. That's where she's coming from. And the mother saying, I want to stop.

613
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:25,460
It's just very hard. She kept saying it very, very hard. I don't know how to do it.

614
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:29,090
I don't have the time. It's so frustrating. Right. That's where she was coming from.

615
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:34,730
You have this kind of complicated dynamic that's impacted by a lot of different things.

616
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:43,100
But again, I mean, I guess I just wanting to now highlight where we're starting from.

617
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:53,060
And some of this, I guess, is maybe your you all say now or you say after all of your coursework in public health, you say, yeah, we know this stuff.

618
01:04:53,570 --> 01:05:01,340
I'm telling you when I do these lectures for, uh, well, let's see, let's say professionals,

619
01:05:01,790 --> 01:05:08,480
physicians, sadly, you know, a big issue with health professionals in the US.

620
01:05:09,790 --> 01:05:12,610
I'm generalizing, but in general it's true.

621
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:19,510
Way more of a problem in low and middle income countries where you have this kind of mismatch between communication.

622
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:26,200
So perceptions versus reality. So this was and here's another example.

623
01:05:27,580 --> 01:05:33,310
Perceptions versus reality of doctors and patients medication.

624
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:37,700
Adherent. So what you can see here, the darker bars,

625
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:46,040
when you ask the doctors what proportion of your patients take 70% of the drugs, 80% of the drugs, 90% of their drugs.

626
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:51,090
See the don't. Gray is kind of around there.

627
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:54,520
Doctors is thinking when they're thinking about 60, 70 or 80%.

628
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:58,720
But when they look at the medical records, that's where you get the light gray.

629
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:06,880
So the doctors aren't even seeing this. So they're not going to intervene because the communication is such that.

630
01:06:07,950 --> 01:06:11,540
For a number of reasons. There's there. They're coming.

631
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:15,410
They're not the doctors aren't even seeing the problem. Okay.

632
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:20,420
So that was really an interesting bit of evidence in this particular study.

633
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:25,190
They found that most doctors where when they survey them, are what they call optimistic.

634
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:28,430
And those are the ones no big surprise they were way overestimating.

635
01:06:28,970 --> 01:06:35,510
They thought the patients were taking about 72% of their pills and the patients were taking less than half of that.

636
01:06:36,260 --> 01:06:39,490
They were just way wrong. Right.

637
01:06:40,030 --> 01:06:47,830
We'll learn about one very one of the many specific communication styles that we try to teach health professionals.

638
01:06:48,220 --> 01:06:51,850
That's part of motivational interviewing. It's open ended questions.

639
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:56,110
So in other words, not to say a closed ended question to a patient is.

640
01:06:56,500 --> 01:07:00,010
So you're you're taking your medication, right? Yes.

641
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:04,720
Right. Closed. Any question can only can be answered by a yes or a no.

642
01:07:05,410 --> 01:07:09,030
Yes. Did you follow up with that?

643
01:07:09,050 --> 01:07:15,620
Yes. You know, an open ended question is can't be answered with a yes or no and you get way more information.

644
01:07:16,070 --> 01:07:19,130
How is it? Tell me about how is it going for you taking your medication?

645
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:23,460
It's a simple change. Right.

646
01:07:23,490 --> 01:07:32,090
So that's a very specific, brief intervention skill. That we can kind of teach doctors and like, Oh, I can do that, you know?

647
01:07:32,090 --> 01:07:36,770
But it's a different way of communicating with patients. Um.

648
01:07:39,770 --> 01:07:44,030
So doctors, nurses, doctors, but all professionals.

649
01:07:44,810 --> 01:07:50,390
So we have a distorted view of patients in these often brief encounters.

650
01:07:50,930 --> 01:07:55,520
What is it affected by? Some might be characteristics of the doctors.

651
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:59,230
Some of it's characteristics of the patient. So he was another study.

652
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:09,230
Oops. Sorry. Where they just documented something we've seen many times that the more overweight the patient is,

653
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:14,450
the more the doctor is likely to say that that person is not adherent to their medication.

654
01:08:15,450 --> 01:08:22,710
Okay. So their weight is one thing, certainly their age.

655
01:08:23,130 --> 01:08:29,700
If someone is an older adult, doctors kind of tend to discount what they're saying.

656
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:35,180
That would be one thing that we have to up. And then, of course, this is very sad.

657
01:08:35,190 --> 01:08:42,569
Van Rijn is someone who's done a lot of work in kind of communication and race in health care.

658
01:08:42,570 --> 01:08:45,600
And you can see it's very it's kind of it's a heartbreaking study.

659
01:08:45,930 --> 01:08:51,450
But they ask doctors about prototypical white and black patients.

660
01:08:51,840 --> 01:09:01,409
And you see that the pattern that maybe is somewhat expected after, you know, like you're kind of sensitive to these issues.

661
01:09:01,410 --> 01:09:09,569
But is that, you know, that black patients are not pleasant, they're not as very rational, they're not likely to take their medication.

662
01:09:09,570 --> 01:09:22,630
So doctors are making these. Presuppositions about patients on their weight status, on their age, on their race, ethnicity, etc.

663
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:27,909
So this is what we're trying to do.

664
01:09:27,910 --> 01:09:31,920
There's other things, again, that are on the patient's side, which we do try.

665
01:09:32,330 --> 01:09:34,240
We're not going to touch on it as much in this class.

666
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:41,260
But when we talk about patient empowerment or actually there's a field called patient activation,

667
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:49,389
where instead of just doing all the training on the provider side, we're trying to train patients to be more activated because we know in this kind

668
01:09:49,390 --> 01:09:54,460
of reciprocal relationship how the patient act affects how the doctors act.

669
01:09:54,470 --> 01:10:04,030
So doctors are more patient centered with patients they perceive as better communicators, more likely to adhere, etc.

670
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:12,280
You know, this is just a whole bunch of studies of how we can do even with brief interventions,

671
01:10:12,490 --> 01:10:21,580
train patients to be more activated patients to ask questions, to express concern, to ask if there are alternatives and they really work.

672
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:25,990
Right. So a lot of this, again, is kind of like the negative side.

673
01:10:26,770 --> 01:10:37,690
But the point is we spend most of this semester talking about the ways in which we actually can make these things better.

674
01:10:39,070 --> 01:10:50,500
Patients that often do have a sense, like, well, I don't want, you know, older adults and generalizing, but older adults have this sense.

675
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:54,159
I don't want to make the doctor angry. I don't want to ask too many questions.

676
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:57,610
He's going to feel insulted. He's a doctor. What do I know?

677
01:10:58,870 --> 01:11:06,969
So people that have this sense of social desirability are more likely to overestimate.

678
01:11:06,970 --> 01:11:13,030
So the doctors might have a distorted view of the patients medication adherence or the physical activity.

679
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:16,960
The patient says, like, No, I'm not depressed, you know, like whatever,

680
01:11:17,110 --> 01:11:22,510
because the patients are over reporting a positive view to the doctor that definitely

681
01:11:22,990 --> 01:11:27,050
there's definitely certain cultures that that are more likely to do that.

682
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:36,700
So we want to there's ways that we can train patients to be more accurate reporters and to have different sorts of assumptions.

683
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:42,130
You know, this is like an ongoing struggle with my you know,

684
01:11:42,490 --> 01:11:49,270
my elderly family members that are in Wisconsin don't necessarily have a lot of formal education.

685
01:11:49,630 --> 01:11:53,000
And they'll say, like, well, I don't even know why they changed.

686
01:11:53,110 --> 01:11:59,500
It's like, did you ask them? Like, Well, no, I'm like, oh, you know, like people just kind of don't do that.

687
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:03,730
So, you know. Yeah.

688
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:09,580
So let me you know, before. So, like, where does this all get us?

689
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:15,559
And why again, why is this so important? And these different themes?

690
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:19,580
There's not enough time and the communication is just not that good.

691
01:12:21,430 --> 01:12:26,319
This is kind of where we've been stuck in in many respects.

692
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:34,960
And you'll see, you know, before we close out some of the many areas of health care that despite some amazing advances in understanding communication,

693
01:12:35,380 --> 01:12:38,560
we've been kind of stuck in terms of public health indicators.

694
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:46,810
So here's a this a very, very famous study of diabetes called the Diabetes Prevention Program and where they had this idea.

695
01:12:46,870 --> 01:12:55,850
DAVIES Prevention. So pre-diabetes, they took patients with three prediabetes, the randomized to them to do a placebo,

696
01:12:55,870 --> 01:13:02,560
you know, basically usual care or to a diabetes medication.

697
01:13:03,770 --> 01:13:10,700
Even though they didn't have diabetes yet to control their blood sugar better or to an intensive lifestyle intervention.

698
01:13:12,310 --> 01:13:18,040
They get coaching about walking diet, they get recipes that have access to kind of group,

699
01:13:18,580 --> 01:13:23,260
you know, teach ins around cooking and, you know, substituting ingredients and all that.

700
01:13:24,310 --> 01:13:30,480
The diabetes prevention program is so famous because. It is enormous study.

701
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:40,170
And they stopped the study early because lifestyle behavior change was breeding

702
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:47,370
drugs in decreasing the proportion of patients that went on to develop diabetes.

703
01:13:48,750 --> 01:13:53,460
Lifestyle change without medication was beating it by so much.

704
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:58,350
They had to say it would be unethical to continue this study.

705
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:03,140
We already know it definitely better than that.

706
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:08,570
But with the theme of today's lecture, guess what?

707
01:14:09,170 --> 01:14:20,120
Almost nobody does the diabetes prevention program because the lifestyle intervention was is still seen as too intensive.

708
01:14:21,140 --> 01:14:28,080
It's we know it works. But it's just not sustainable out in the real world.

709
01:14:28,980 --> 01:14:36,470
Here's another. This is the classic. One called the bounce in weight management interventions.

710
01:14:37,190 --> 01:14:43,130
I think you can see it as 100 times in 100 different weight management trials with intensive behavior change.

711
01:14:43,730 --> 01:14:47,720
You put someone in a weight management class, they drop a bunch of weight.

712
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:53,970
You remove that intensive class and they bounce right back.

713
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:59,250
Sometimes going up to a weight that was higher than their original weight.

714
01:15:00,730 --> 01:15:05,290
Right. So that's kind of what I mean by being stuck.

715
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:13,240
And that's why looking at some of these creative ways in these elements of brief interventions,

716
01:15:13,750 --> 01:15:20,170
if we want to do public health in one, do primary care or address some of the main public health challenges.

717
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:25,809
This is what we have to do. Like I said, I'll end in the last few minutes and just another few.

718
01:15:25,810 --> 01:15:33,370
I know this is kind of a lot of data, but this is the last slides I put together again for some of these.

719
01:15:34,830 --> 01:15:42,989
Large lectures. I do many of them that include, you know, one it was a, you know,

720
01:15:42,990 --> 01:15:56,750
people that do lectures as part of major health insurance companies around the world that that are very excited about brief intervention and very,

721
01:15:56,760 --> 01:16:04,560
very excited about digital health interventions. And I kind of wanted to say to them that, like, we have to pay attention to this.

722
01:16:04,890 --> 01:16:11,770
And I looked here's, you know, back in, like I said, we have all we're going to look at all these amazing meta analyzes and randomized trial the are

723
01:16:11,790 --> 01:16:17,820
amazing and I'm very excited about many of these areas where we know how to make health care better.

724
01:16:18,660 --> 01:16:26,850
But despite all those things, when I put together, I put together a bunch of these slides.

725
01:16:28,050 --> 01:16:32,220
You know, this is all the money that we spent, like any kind of a dark.

726
01:16:32,220 --> 01:16:37,290
No, sorry about that. Very much money we spent on NIH on $1,000,000,000,000.

727
01:16:38,510 --> 01:16:45,500
And all these you know, all these studies that fund the School of Public Health and a lot of the other things that we do.

728
01:16:45,830 --> 01:16:49,340
So you'd think.

729
01:16:51,270 --> 01:16:55,830
Then we should start being able to some of these things should start to be getting better.

730
01:16:55,860 --> 01:17:00,990
Right. So this is population data from the United States.

731
01:17:02,590 --> 01:17:08,860
And basically the short answer is that since, you know, over the last 20 years, I mean,

732
01:17:09,380 --> 01:17:16,630
we we definitely have four or five, six, seven new anti hypoglycemic medications that have come out.

733
01:17:17,140 --> 01:17:20,380
And they're really work. They're FDA approved.

734
01:17:21,010 --> 01:17:26,170
They work. Some are injectable. Some people take only one injection a week or sometimes even less.

735
01:17:27,510 --> 01:17:33,480
So you'd think that with all of that and all that we've learned about diet.

736
01:17:35,210 --> 01:17:39,560
You know, maybe a little like it's only going up. It's only going up.

737
01:17:40,070 --> 01:17:45,230
People with diabetes the best, they don't like me.

738
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:52,400
The number of patients that are have decent control has gone down a couple percent.

739
01:17:54,110 --> 01:17:59,200
But not so much. So that's sobering.

740
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:04,540
Obesity, men and women.

741
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:07,760
We've been talking about it for a long time.

742
01:18:08,090 --> 01:18:17,750
I mean, it smell like 25 years in a lot of public health knowledge is an obesity center here that, you know, in many places in the country.

743
01:18:18,950 --> 01:18:24,350
That's not great. Rates of hypertension.

744
01:18:24,370 --> 01:18:34,690
Same kind of flare, you know, hypertension, control, if you will, and have hypertension,

745
01:18:35,140 --> 01:18:38,320
you know, we doing a better job of controlling their hypertension.

746
01:18:40,330 --> 01:18:44,830
Uh, not maybe a little.

747
01:18:45,370 --> 01:18:49,599
And, you know, people with chronic pain will. It's going to one down, one's going up.

748
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:57,580
That's only getting worse. So this is kind of again, this is the not binge drinking.

749
01:18:59,140 --> 01:19:04,700
You know, this is you know, this is the gap between what we'll see, you know, works.

750
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:07,810
But we need to have these things being moved out into practice.

751
01:19:07,810 --> 01:19:17,230
We need public health professionals to know these best practices because alcohol emergency department visits, that's going up.

752
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:25,870
And these are you know, they're super sad ones, you know, suicidality, anxiety, depression, all that stuff.

753
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:31,240
Right. So that's unfortunately kind of where we've been,

754
01:19:32,230 --> 01:19:40,840
but where we see these brief intervention practices being taught in individual health systems, things definitely do get better.

755
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:46,929
So I really like this course because it gives us something again that are these

756
01:19:46,930 --> 01:19:51,339
are skills that are like learnable and teachable and that you're going to hear.

757
01:19:51,340 --> 01:19:59,228
Like, if anything, my own frustration is that like, there's not enough of these being being disseminated.
