00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:11,550
After watching this video,

2
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,980
you will be able to use
PROC SURVEYMEANS to

3
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,260
get means and a t-test
with survey data.

4
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,895
So let's go back to our example.

5
00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:21,710
Remember our design is

6
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:23,400
a complex design and therefore

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,769
we have to use
weights and clusters,

8
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:29,130
our outcome is a binary
variable, overweight,

9
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,840
and now we are going to use

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,735
PROC SURVEYMEANS to test
the following question.

11
00:00:33,735 --> 00:00:37,755
Is the age of the mother
associated with overweight?

12
00:00:37,755 --> 00:00:40,100
Let's look at how the age of

13
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,725
the mother distributes
by overweight status.

14
00:00:42,725 --> 00:00:44,780
With simple random sampling,

15
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,405
you will use PROC MEANS with
the continuous variable,

16
00:00:47,405 --> 00:00:49,910
AGEMO, and the
variable overweight

17
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:51,325
in the CLASS statement.

18
00:00:51,325 --> 00:00:53,400
Note that similar to before,

19
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,880
PROC MEANS will not take into
account weight, therefore,

20
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,160
you will get an incorrect mean
and clustering, therefore,

21
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,510
you will get an incorrect
standard error to

22
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,695
calculate your 95 percent
confidence interval.

23
00:01:05,695 --> 00:01:08,625
PROC SURVEYMEANS share
the same cluster

24
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:11,490
and weight statements
as PROC SURVEYFREQ.

25
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,475
Note that compared to
the normal PROC MEANS,

26
00:01:14,475 --> 00:01:16,399
instead of a CLASS statement

27
00:01:16,399 --> 00:01:18,515
where we put our
categorical variable,

28
00:01:18,515 --> 00:01:20,165
overweight in this case,

29
00:01:20,165 --> 00:01:23,180
now this statement
is called domain.

30
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,985
If we run this code,

31
00:01:24,985 --> 00:01:27,380
size gives you first the mean of

32
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:30,095
the age of the mother in
the whole population,

33
00:01:30,095 --> 00:01:33,505
and then the age of the
mother by overweight status.

34
00:01:33,505 --> 00:01:35,480
Note that it will also give you

35
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,070
some nice graphs that you can

36
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,780
check to with similar information

37
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,990
but this one that I'm
not showing here.

38
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:42,740
So in this case we can

39
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,675
see that the mean
age of the mother is

40
00:01:44,675 --> 00:01:48,424
28 years old among children
with no overweight,

41
00:01:48,424 --> 00:01:52,475
and 30 years old among
children with overweight.

42
00:01:52,475 --> 00:01:56,065
Slightly higher, but
not huge differences.

43
00:01:56,065 --> 00:01:58,815
What if you want to do a t-test?

44
00:01:58,815 --> 00:02:01,700
Well, there is not
PROC SURVEYTTEST,

45
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,275
but you can add

46
00:02:03,275 --> 00:02:06,265
a diffmeans option to
the domain statement.

47
00:02:06,265 --> 00:02:08,570
Note, of course, that you
will have to check that

48
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:11,905
your distributions are
reasonably normally distributed,

49
00:02:11,905 --> 00:02:13,765
and this is your t-test.

50
00:02:13,765 --> 00:02:15,625
Note that the P value is 0.09,

51
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:17,590
so we will fail to reject the

52
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,985
known that those differences
are significant,

53
00:02:19,985 --> 00:02:21,635
which is not that surprising

54
00:02:21,635 --> 00:02:24,140
because they were
not that big either.

55
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,540
In summary, in this video we use

56
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,120
PROC SURVEYMEANS to get means

57
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,975
and a t-test with survey data.

58
00:02:29,975 --> 00:02:33,180
In the next one we will use
PROC SURVEYREG and survey

59
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,700
logistic to run linear

60
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,059
and logistic models
with survey data.
