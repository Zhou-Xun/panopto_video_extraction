1
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:06,870
I just want to make it ski. Okay.

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:16,049
Oh, well, I'm glad I made it here before most of the class had a chance to use the facilities.

3
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:20,750
But I'll be fine, I thought. I don't think I should.

4
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:32,780
Okay. Sorry, that should totally say part two.

5
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:46,430
Part three. Our last official lecture before we get started on this part, though, do y'all have any questions about what's happening on Monday?

6
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:52,790
Okay, Tuesday. Tuesday. Do you have any questions about Tuesday's presentations?

7
00:00:53,870 --> 00:01:03,620
Okay. So basically the expectation is that you will have like emailed a copy to yourself, brought it a flash drive, something like that.

8
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:09,240
I'll go by volunteers first and then I'll just start calling victims up.

9
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:15,350
You'll have anywhere between 10 to 15 minutes to do your presentation, followed by a Q&A.

10
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:24,980
The rubric in the assignment contains how the breakdown of grading your posture and your presentation will go in case you were curious.

11
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:33,860
You'll not actually be like projecting your posture, but giving a PowerPoint on your poster content and then turning your poster in on canvas.

12
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,790
You can also turn in your presentation on canvas to if you'd like.

13
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:44,210
And then I think we should be able to knock everybody out on Tuesday so we won't have class on Thursday.

14
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,569
And then the rest of the time, I'm not going to see you after that.

15
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:52,340
And you just turn in your final worker questionnaire and write up during finals week.

16
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:59,270
So I just want clarified. Yes, that's good. It is a presentation about your poster.

17
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:02,180
Poster yet? Poster topic. Poster topic. Yeah.

18
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:09,150
Because, you know, like, we don't want to be squinting, trying to read like the abstract of slides for each other, that kind of deal.

19
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:13,070
Yeah. And then if you want, you can add additional slides on background pictures,

20
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:18,350
things that made of not necessarily like fit in their poster for say that's all welcome.

21
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,250
That's. That's nice. Thank you. Mm hmm. Oh, there we go.

22
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:33,620
All right. So today we're going to pick up on programs or interventions focused focused on psychosocial factors and how they're evaluated.

23
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:42,290
And then we'll be looking at one case study on psychosocial program evaluation, and then we have a group activity at the end.

24
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:51,110
If you were a larger class, I would have set up like a Google slide for all y'all to work on, but I think it's small enough for this class.

25
00:02:52,160 --> 00:03:01,400
So just to recap, on Tuesday, we talked about basically this in detail, the six steps of the CDC program evaluation framework.

26
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:07,790
So how what does this look like in the context of psychosocial factors?

27
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:14,030
How do you even conduct surveillance on these constructs and evaluation in particular?

28
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:22,639
So as we talked about through most of this class, psychosocial factors aren't, you know, as they're constructs essentially.

29
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:31,550
So they're not as easily measurable as like age, for example, or BMI or other, you know, things that people might typically use and surveillance data.

30
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:38,690
And then number two, even though psychosocial factors has kind of been emerging in their research since the eighties,

31
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:44,450
it's only really now since the COVID 19 pandemic that we've seen a lot of workplaces finally

32
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:49,819
acknowledging some of these constructs related to psychosocial factors and workplace stress,

33
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:54,540
like job turnover, intention, job satisfaction.

34
00:03:54,830 --> 00:04:01,130
And so historically, many workplaces don't even bother to collect this kind of data.

35
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:08,870
So that is the primary challenge. And most of the research looks at antecedents of work related stress,

36
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:16,520
meaning things that may be mediating or moderating work related stress, such as well-being at work or psychological harms.

37
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:21,920
But they're not necessarily measuring workplace stress, work related stress directly.

38
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:33,500
So there was this roundtable meeting where they involved 26 international experts in organizational psychology,

39
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:42,770
stress and burnout research and surveillance systems. And they convened together in 2006 at an international conference.

40
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,269
So realistically,

41
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:55,370
the last time people have holistically looked at evaluation measures of psychosocial factors in a holistic way has been 16 years ago.

42
00:04:55,580 --> 00:05:04,760
Right, which is like very old. So this was an international review of 35 systems and then 20 countries to

43
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:09,260
look at literature on how people are actually evaluating psychosocial factors.

44
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:17,569
So they identified seven main priority areas, the first being long working hours.

45
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:21,240
And of course. Okay.

46
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:31,620
Okay. Long working hours and the impact on mental health, emotional work and emotional labor, particularly in service sectors,

47
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:39,180
is just like people who work in restaurants, customer facing occupations, hospitality,

48
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:45,450
emerging work arrangements, the interaction between work and family, or your private life,

49
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:54,240
social and corporate responsibility of organizations in regard to gender, human rights and community workability.

50
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,400
In regard to health related factors that tend to marginalize individuals from the workplace,

51
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:05,750
and then opportunities for participation and consultation between that employer and employee relationship.

52
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:10,380
So these seven priority areas were established in 2006.

53
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:15,000
Do you still feel like some or all are still applicable to this day?

54
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:25,150
Mm hmm. Oliver? Yeah. Yeah.

55
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:34,650
Yeah. I would say that they're all still applicable to this day.

56
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,750
I don't see anything in particular that's very like this is super dated.

57
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:49,150
So what they did is they looked at the content of national surveillance systems and essentially created this emergent taxonomy of psychosocial risk.

58
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,489
So they broke it out into two major categories and then the outcomes.

59
00:06:54,490 --> 00:07:03,070
So job characteristics in the nature of work, social and organizational contexts of work, and then the work outcomes themselves.

60
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:08,440
So first within the domain, they chose to look at job contents and demands,

61
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,709
and within that are the constructs of cognitive demands, emotional demands, variety, work cycles,

62
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:20,890
work interruptions, meaningless work, job skill, matched, high certainty and frequency of change,

63
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:24,250
continuous exposure to people, conflicting demands and feedback.

64
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:28,750
Then they looked at workload and pace and then work schedule in particular,

65
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:35,709
looking at shift work in flexible schedules, unpredictable hours, work hours, and then work home interference.

66
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:40,240
And then they looked at job control in terms of decision and autonomy making.

67
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:43,149
And then from the social organizational context,

68
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:49,570
they looked at organizational culture like poor communication, insufficient staff, organizational change,

69
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:56,530
interpersonal relationships, the role of the organization in organization like ambiguity and conflict,

70
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:01,810
career development, bullying and violence, and then organizational justice.

71
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:07,390
And then their primary outcomes were sick leave, burnout, job satisfaction, mental health,

72
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:12,190
organizational commitment, physical health, stress, and then turnover intention.

73
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:20,890
Okay. So what they found was of the 35 studies that they looked at across the globe,

74
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:26,350
realistically only 22 of them they were able to validate the information for.

75
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:31,210
So that's only 63% of the findings, which is like a D in essence.

76
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:39,760
And the most frequent evaluation data they used to capture psychosocial factors was face to face interviews,

77
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:44,050
telephone interviews, and then self-reported questionnaires.

78
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:57,730
Does any of this surprise you? I think that, like, face to face interviews is the most common.

79
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:06,490
Yeah, I did not expect to see that. I thought it might be like self-reported questionnaires, like paper questionnaire, the telephone thing.

80
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:13,780
Okay, I'm 26. I get that right. But the face to face interviews, I was surprised that was the primary method that they used.

81
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:19,680
I'm surprised that even like the telephone interview thing is as high as it is 34%.

82
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:28,510
Yeah, yeah. I mean, it's not high, but. Yeah, but still like a third of people that you're calling like publication bias.

83
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,040
How do you mean?

84
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:36,760
Do you feel like they're less likely to publish things that are self-reported questionnaires and more likely to publish, like, interviews?

85
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:41,160
Um. I.

86
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:50,720
Hmm. That's a good question. I don't know that I can speak to that because I feel that there is now in the year 2022,

87
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:55,340
face to face interviews are generally considered qualitative data.

88
00:09:55,580 --> 00:10:00,530
And even in 2022, people still pooh pooh qualitative data all the time.

89
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:04,520
So I imagine in 26 it was even worse than it is now.

90
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,889
But interestingly now.

91
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:20,720
So there might be a possibility of like reporting bias, because what we have moved towards in in this day and age is transparency.

92
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:28,700
So a lot of times back in the day, if your research field and your findings weren't significant or it was nothing interesting,

93
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:35,359
people wouldn't bother to publish it. But nowadays, they actually encourage.

94
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,439
Even if you didn't have significant findings but you conducted this study,

95
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,639
it's still valuable to share with the other the research community and other

96
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:48,830
practitioners like what went wrong and what can other people do better in the future.

97
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:53,630
So there's there's a possibility of some sort of bias there.

98
00:10:54,770 --> 00:11:01,370
Telephone interviews, you know, and Haines for the longest time has been collected over the phone,

99
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:09,680
as well as breakfast, which is wild to me because my phone is has been on do not disturb for like the last ten years.

100
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:18,230
Ha ha ha. I don't answer the phone for like I don't I don't answer for random numbers, but I would say like in 2006, probably.

101
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:23,419
Yeah. Remember, like your parents used to have like a separate, like, caller ID thing.

102
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:28,010
They hook up to the phone. Yeah. Don't. Okay, I know that's the thing.

103
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:31,160
Okay, we didn't have that, but. Yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah.

104
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,860
We just answered every time I got. Oh, yeah.

105
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:38,060
Well my, yeah, my mom used to have like a separate caller I.D. thing and I would say like phone call from blah,

106
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:42,650
blah, blah, like, I know number, right? Which your iPhone automatically does that now.

107
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:48,770
But like back in the day, you'd have to buy a separate machine to plug into your phone to do that.

108
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:54,680
But there were also way less spam scam calls then than there are now.

109
00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:02,990
But the majority of them looked at used random sampling techniques, so just probability sampling.

110
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:10,460
But out of the 30th of the 22 studies that they were able to validate, only five looked at longitudinal data.

111
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:18,890
And the longest being a study from Finland that looked at they started collecting measures on these psychosocial factors in 1977.

112
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:26,870
Right. But a lot only five use longitudinal data. So the evaluation.

113
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:33,780
It still thinks I'm doing an outdoor walk, which it'll figure out. Okay.

114
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:38,799
So the evaluation of the survey content. So sorry,

115
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:45,730
that should say assessment asses the majority of surveys assess both job characteristics and social

116
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:53,080
organizational contexts of work with no clear pattern regarding the predominance of measures in either category.

117
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:58,899
So this is when it starts to get a little bit hairy because if you're looking at psychosocial factors,

118
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:03,250
which all of your work questionnaires are pretty contained to either like the

119
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:08,440
job characteristics side or like the social organizational context of sides.

120
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:12,429
But the majority of these surveys, evaluation surveys,

121
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:25,060
try to do both with no clear indication of which one they thought would be more prominent or more like influential on psychosocial factors.

122
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:29,010
So it kind of gets to that issue where it's like we talked about early in this semester.

123
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:35,350
We have a really long survey. Number one, it gets unwieldy because you have all of these constructs.

124
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:39,819
But number two, once you collect this information, what are you actually going to do with it?

125
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:44,320
Right, because each construct, in essence, is serving as its own variable.

126
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:52,180
So statistically, you run into a time when you're overloading your model with too many variables.

127
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:56,200
You're not going to find anything. You're not going to find hardly anything.

128
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:02,830
So in terms of the evaluation of survey content across these studies, the most six,

129
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:12,850
the six most common job characteristics that they looked at was working hours, autonomy, overload, cognitive Disney demands, variety and shift work.

130
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:17,440
And then from the social and organizational characteristics they looked at, pay,

131
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:24,460
pay and renumeration and training were tied together as number one job insecurity and

132
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:30,160
supervisor support were tied together coworker support and then promotion opportunities.

133
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:38,740
And like I said, the most common outcome measures was physical health, job satisfaction, mental health, stress, and then sick leave.

134
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:44,400
So what does this all mean?

135
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:49,120
The goals of the review were to essentially provide.

136
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:56,230
It was a very exploratory preliminary evaluation because it tried to provide a valuable resource that identify

137
00:14:56,230 --> 00:15:02,950
first content and methodology of evaluation of psychosocial factors to kind of bridge this gap between research,

138
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:06,790
surveillance practice and then real world environments.

139
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:15,730
But there there is such significant variation in how they surveil and evaluate psychosocial factors.

140
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:23,320
So really there was like no consistency, no pattern that they could really establish.

141
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:30,070
They weren't able to look across the 22 studies and been like job satisfaction to

142
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:33,759
depression like these are the number one things that we should look at together.

143
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:43,690
They weren't able to evaluate and connect the two, and what they then identified after this whole convening in 2006 is that they said,

144
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:52,570
in the future, we think emerging issues in relation to psychosocial factors will be, number one, emotional dissonance.

145
00:15:53,020 --> 00:16:01,599
Two, Workplace bullying. Three, Acute versus chronic exposures of psychosocial factors, organizational justice,

146
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,040
organizational change, and then positive psychological states and well-being.

147
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:12,430
Is there anything on the emerging issues that surprises you or you don't think should be there?

148
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:19,840
That's like workplace bullying. Mhm. Oh no we haven't talked about that.

149
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,630
Dr. John Connolly curious what that entails.

150
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:32,280
Is that like harassment and like oh yeah an all its forms so it doesn't have to be like when you think about bullying

151
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:39,930
it's not like obviously I mean you might have some workplaces where like a coworker like shoves you into a locker,

152
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:47,970
right? But not in that traditional sense of bullying, but more so like psychological bullying.

153
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:56,100
Yes. Do you feel like that's more common now than in the past or where it's less common?

154
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:07,130
I don't really know. There's no right or wrong answer. What are the people think about workplace bullying trends?

155
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:12,390
I don't know. I don't like the word bullying for workplace harassment.

156
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:20,420
My kids like workplace violence or, you know, conflict as bullying.

157
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:29,180
I agree. I think I usually go physical, but I think it's up to more mentally to snap people not really bullying.

158
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:34,670
There probably isn't age. Maybe I haven't witnessed that. I've been a part of it. So.

159
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,310
Oh, well. Workplace violence, I would say, is definitely more physical.

160
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:47,630
Right. So this was on maybe somebody bringing a gun to work or like, you know, is Michigan a concealed carry state or open carry?

161
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:52,819
I don't know. And Oklahoma and Texas are open carry.

162
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,820
And you don't need a permit anymore.

163
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:59,090
Yeah, they just, they just took that away. Yep. Aha. They sure did.

164
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:06,110
So, you know, maybe for those places, you might be more concerned about workplace violence if someone's in a bad mood or whatever,

165
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,200
they could literally just like pull a gun on you. Right.

166
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:15,350
Workplace conflict, I think, is more benign than bullying because every workplace has conflict.

167
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:20,660
Whether that is stop microwaving fish in the communal microwave to like.

168
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:25,700
I don't necessarily see eye to eye with this person on this issue.

169
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:34,190
But bullying, I would say, is, you know, targeted multiple incidents of a a person to another person or a group of people to another

170
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:39,860
people in an effort to make either their job more difficult or their life more difficult.

171
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:44,000
Thank you for that call. That definitely helps now. Yeah. Yeah.

172
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:49,190
So what? So. Oh, there's workplace bullying all the time.

173
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:55,220
There's workplace bullying here, for sure. Yeah, not in this classroom, in every department.

174
00:18:55,350 --> 00:19:04,610
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah. I would say my, my, my trend is we're shifting away from bullying in the physical sense,

175
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:16,190
but more so like in the psychological sense, especially now that we have technology pros and cons, right?

176
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:22,040
Where the lines kind of become blurred, where before maybe someone, your colleague, you're they're only able to,

177
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:30,409
like verbally bully you or like mentally bully you over like email or if they see you in person or like in a meeting or something.

178
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:35,660
But now there's like text slack. People can stalk you on your social media.

179
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:41,870
There's all kinds of like nefarious things people can do in particular.

180
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:56,360
So I will give you an example of workplace bullying in in the academia that made the national news a couple of years ago.

181
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:05,140
It made The New York Times in particular, I would say this takes it to the next level beyond bullying, towards like retaliation.

182
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:11,540
Okay. So there is and it relates to the University of Michigan, always the University of Michigan.

183
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:24,320
So there is a woman or she they maybe who was at the time an assistant professor at Arizona State University and teaches in the humanities.

184
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:33,920
Okay. A position opens up here at the University of Michigan as faculty where she is trying to become an associate professor.

185
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:42,200
And as you've heard about this and you can add fill in details if I'm missing something, Jo Ann is trying to become an associate professor.

186
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:48,469
Okay. This person who identifies as a woman is in a homosexual relationship.

187
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:51,500
So she has a wife ratios she identifies as a lesbian.

188
00:20:52,910 --> 00:21:00,170
And so then over the course of time during this job search, because the academic job market is very competitive,

189
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:13,549
she starts getting these complaints to her department that she is essentially having inappropriate conduct with her students in that

190
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:23,300
like she would invite grad students over to her houses with parties and there would be alcohol and they would drink wine and then like,

191
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:23,719
you know,

192
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:32,750
that she was like topless and exposed herself to students and like her and her wife tried to like engage students in relations and all of that.

193
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:40,880
And then she started getting these threats from a grad student via an email and all this kind of stuff.

194
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:44,540
And then it was brought forward to her department and escalated,

195
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:51,439
as you would expect it would at a university in terms of misconduct of come to

196
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:57,230
find after deep investigation on her part right because nobody believed her.

197
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:06,080
Um, tracing tracing like IP addresses and all of that that this was actually.

198
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:15,130
One of her friends who is a gay man who was applying for the same position here at

199
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:24,760
University of Michigan and pretended to be a female graduate student to essentially,

200
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:29,770
like, tarnish her reputation so that she wouldn't get this position.

201
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,430
Guess what? She did not get this position. She's still at ASU.

202
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:38,770
So that's like a very nefarious example of workplace bullying.

203
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:41,800
But stuff that occurs, right.

204
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:48,669
Did I miss anything, Joe? I think so, yeah. So that's a New York Times piece if you want to read the exposes.

205
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:53,260
Very interesting. But, you know, those can happen at a very macro level.

206
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:58,560
Emotional dissonance. I think that we are seeing this now in the pandemic is more so like quiet quitting.

207
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:04,540
Right. That we've talked about previously or kind of just like going to work, getting it done.

208
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:11,950
Like my my job is not my life. There's different mindset that millennials and Gen Z have in the workplace.

209
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:21,279
And then I do see organizational justice kind of being more like as a shift towards things that people find important or valuable.

210
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:28,870
In my other class, we were talking about good examples of like organizations that have good like PR or marketing.

211
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:37,179
And one that these talks about was Patagonia, for example, where the CEO is very much like not for profits.

212
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:42,100
I think he just gave away like all his shares to go to climate change or something like that.

213
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:47,229
So, you know, now you see workplaces trying to be more conscientious, for example,

214
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:51,940
about like sustainability or the choices they make or the impact they have on the environment.

215
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:57,220
So I would say in 2060, we're not totally off about any of these.

216
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:16,710
I recently saw something. Not sure. But he's related to the concept of quiet quitting and that so is flipped the flipped around saying that like

217
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:28,290
people people aren't really like quiet quitting they're they're responding to their workplaces quiet firing them.

218
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:40,290
Mhm. I have seen that. Yes. I like the fact that like you're like my client hasn't given you a raise or like changed anything about treating me

219
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:50,640
better like that being this fire of like firing and then people's response to that as the sick like quitting minute.

220
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:58,590
That's kind of a natural response. Uh, it's not this sort of like passive aggressive thing that it's been made out to be.

221
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:03,510
It's actually normal and adaptive, but it's like people aren't treating you well.

222
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:07,430
Yeah. We're going to set a boundary. Yeah, yeah.

223
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:12,820
Yeah, I did read that. Thank you for bringing that up, Joe. What do you all think about that perspective?

224
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,690
I think it's very happening, too. So I think it's probably both going on at the same time.

225
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:26,680
Yeah, that I would say the quiet firing puts more of the onus on the organization,

226
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:32,260
whereas the quiet quitting puts more of the onus on the individual where possibly.

227
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:37,390
Very true. Both could be happening or one happened as a result of the other one.

228
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:44,230
But like we've talked about in this case with psychosocial factors in particular, like the individuals can only do so much to help themselves.

229
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:52,120
A lot of things do happen at the organizational level, but unfortunately we can't control others.

230
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:55,570
We can only control how we react to our situation.

231
00:25:55,580 --> 00:26:00,550
So the quiet quitting may be in response to a lack of organizational change.

232
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:07,510
Yes. And some other gaps they assessed during this like evaluation.

233
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:15,670
Large evaluation. It wasn't they didn't call it a systematic review, but it was, you know, close but not, you know,

234
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:23,620
technically one turnover intention is often not an outcome assessed as much as it needs to be.

235
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:33,550
So turnover intention. If you ask people, how likely are you to leave this job in the next three months, six months, one year?

236
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:39,280
Generally, they have not measured that as well in its connection to work related stress.

237
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:45,910
And then little attention is paid to the positive and desirable outcomes such as well-being and engagement.

238
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:52,900
So I know in this class we focus a lot on like negative psychosocial factors, but there's also positive psychosocial factors.

239
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:59,620
And a lot of literature shows that even if you're at a job and it's kind of crappy,

240
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:06,040
the positive health benefits that you get from being at a job and having some routine or structure

241
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:14,379
and like human interaction is far more beneficial than unemployment because in particular,

242
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:22,030
when adults fall into unemployment or like older folks stop working and lose that sense of purpose,

243
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:25,480
they regress a lot in terms of their mental health and health outcomes.

244
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:33,700
So like they said, like important to focus on positive psychosocial factors as well as negative is actually rare.

245
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:40,450
And then they said measurement of psycho physiological indices of health outcomes and stress is rare.

246
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:51,450
So for example, cortisol, which is a physiological measure of stress, and then also taking perceived self-reported measures of stress.

247
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:58,000
This is something that I tried to do in a recent study that I did with Waste Workers and failed wildly at it.

248
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:07,300
And it's not because I didn't it's not I think it's because I wasn't rigorous enough in the collection of the saliva,

249
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:13,299
because Dr. Neitzel has collected saliva from people in Chile and shipped it back

250
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:18,850
to America two months later unrefrigerated and they were able to like still derive

251
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:26,649
cortisol measures for my cortisol in saliva is extremely robust biomarker unlike blood

252
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:32,140
right or like urine which can decay quickly depending on what you're looking at.

253
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:39,400
It's because I wasn't very strict with my workers in terms of what they were digesting before they produced their saliva sample.

254
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:48,730
Most of these waste workers were extremely dehydrated, so they had difficulty even producing a millimeter of saliva for me.

255
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,320
I'm talking like sitting there for 20, 30 minutes trying to spit in the tube.

256
00:28:53,680 --> 00:29:00,370
But also a lot of them had drank coffee right before because I went to the landfill at 4 a.m. So I have saliva

257
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:06,640
samples with like coffee stains in it or like that are cherry red because they were like sucking on a cough drop.

258
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:12,040
So that definitely messed up my cortisol collection.

259
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:19,660
So, you know, just a heads up. But like Dr. Rosenberg, who gave the guest lecture a couple of weeks ago on cardiovascular stuff,

260
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:31,059
she also does psycho physiological indices where she looks at our static loads on the body and work stress, and she's trained in phlebotomy.

261
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:39,730
So she'll actually go herself and then do blood draws on like hotel workers, where she generally looks at like cardiovascular measures.

262
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:46,480
There is also a gap in evaluation data on non westernized industrialized countries.

263
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:55,420
So most of these psychosocial factors come from like the United States, Finland countries in the in in the European Union.

264
00:29:55,990 --> 00:30:02,110
But we know that it can be very different for countries in Asia, even like Southeast Asia, Africa.

265
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:06,670
And then are these measures consistent with the hierarchy of controls?

266
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:10,120
So the hierarchy of controls are the baseline we use to protect worker health.

267
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:15,250
On the physical side are the physical and mental side aligning together?

268
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:19,930
So these were gaps that they identified. Okay.

269
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:28,220
Kinds of questions before we move on to our case study. Yeah.

270
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:32,890
Okay. So this case study in particular is from Probst.

271
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:43,780
Golden Key, born from 28 and it is called a preliminary evaluation of solve, addressing psychosocial problems at work.

272
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:52,120
People who do interventions and if they're in public health, you better be really good at making up acronyms because they love them.

273
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,240
Acronyms. This one I found a little bit of a stretch.

274
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:59,020
Yeah, okay. Because you can see the bolded letter is where it came from.

275
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:05,200
So this intervention was developed by the International Labor Organization of the ILO.

276
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:15,099
We the ILO is essentially like a voluntary organization that creates standards because every country has their own occupational health standards.

277
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:20,290
So they'll come in and make standards that are like, okay, we think we should adhere to these guidelines.

278
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:28,419
Kind of like how my is here. So solve comes from stress, tobacco, alcohol, that should say drugs, not drugs.

279
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:38,240
I'm sorry I was doing this late last night. HIV, aids and violence is definitely like so much of a stretch for that.

280
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:42,310
And I guess I see that as from stress.

281
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:46,299
The oh, from tobacco, the L oh acronyms. Word is the first letter.

282
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:56,980
I would be jazzed and so would be asti a d h v stad and take a letter from drugs.

283
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,490
It's like skip that word entirely solved.

284
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:08,050
Go back on drugs. That could be kind of what actually I think she did.

285
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:14,260
I need to go back to. Yeah, we need to tell the International Labor Organization, I don't know where they come up with this stuff.

286
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:19,870
Right. Like M lead. Okay. Michigan life stage exposure, you know, whatever.

287
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:22,779
Cosi, one of the things, whenever you're writing a paper about a program,

288
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:27,760
you really have to look at what that acronym actually stands for because if you guess, you're probably wrong.

289
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:31,870
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. But people love to come up with all kinds of creative stuff.

290
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:40,930
But the aim of this psychosocial intervention was to reduce incidence of psychosocial problems related to job stress,

291
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:46,990
workplace violence, tobacco use, alcohol use drugs and HIV aids.

292
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:53,649
So this infographic actually comes from their manual in particular.

293
00:32:53,650 --> 00:33:01,750
So that's the logo. Look at this alcohol, drugs, violence, HIV, AIDS, tobacco, nutrition and physical activity.

294
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:10,000
Healthy sleep. I guess they needed to like pad the image because those weren't explicitly stated in the acronym and then the stress.

295
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:17,800
So what this intervention consisted of was a 32 hour policy development course,

296
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:24,250
plus 18 months of intensive training to educate employees about the fact about the causes,

297
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:28,780
consequences and methods of prevention for those five domains.

298
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:35,590
So they grounded this in cognitive behavioral theory, phonemes specifically on the health belief model.

299
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:38,620
So health belief model, I'll show you in a minute again.

300
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:44,170
But the assumption is that, number one, our behavior is influenced by our cognitions.

301
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:50,710
Number two, knowledge is necessary, but not necessarily sufficient for prompting behavior change.

302
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:56,469
Just because you know you should do something doesn't mean that people do it right.

303
00:33:56,470 --> 00:34:00,490
We know smoking is bad for you. People still smoke.

304
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:07,809
I know I probably should be eating a piece of cake every Friday night because I was obsessed with cutting carbs.

305
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:10,030
But you know what? Just let me have it.

306
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:18,040
I don't do drugs or anything else, and then individual perceptions of skills and social contacts will obviously influence your behavior.

307
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:26,620
So this solve intervention, they have indeed implemented it globally and they specifically target resource poor countries.

308
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:32,260
So Thailand, Swaziland, South Africa, Philippines, Malaysia, India, etc.

309
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:37,780
So if we look here at the health belief model, refresh yourselves.

310
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:48,850
This is an individual level model theory that has been validated where we're trying to get somebody to do like a positive health action.

311
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:54,700
Right. So distal to that our demographic variables and psychological characteristics.

312
00:34:54,970 --> 00:35:02,320
But the key thing is that they have to look at how susceptible do they think they are to it, how severe do they think it is?

313
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:08,740
What are the benefits of participating in this action and what are the barriers of participating in this action?

314
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:13,240
And that leads to, again, the motivation and then their cues to action.

315
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:22,270
So, for example, if we wanted somebody to do something like breast cancer screening,

316
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:27,410
right, if they find out, you know what, they have the Baraka one gene.

317
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:31,030
Which makes them highly susceptible to getting breast cancer.

318
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:35,350
The severity of that is pretty high because it progressed to stage four.

319
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:40,040
The benefits of getting a mammogram is finding whether or not they have breast cancer.

320
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:44,680
If it's early enough, they can catch it. And then the barriers might be things like, well,

321
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:52,420
the mammogram really hurts because essentially just like a pancake it or maybe they have transportation issues, something like that.

322
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:56,680
So from a workplace standpoint, right,

323
00:35:56,980 --> 00:36:05,830
if we were to think of a some kind of action here where it would be something that might benefit your psychosocial factors.

324
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:14,080
So something like work life boundaries that is very big and nebulous.

325
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:23,260
Right. So what about we take something like an action item that's more concrete, not working on the weekends.

326
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:28,270
What's what do you think is their susceptibility to working on the weekends?

327
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:33,610
Just say, I'm like a full professor. Like, what's my susceptibility of working on the weekends?

328
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:40,370
Uh, peer pressure, maybe? Mm hmm. Personal anxiety.

329
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:45,110
Mm. That's.

330
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:49,569
Yeah. Feeling like being like your personality or that.

331
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:53,810
Like you've just been. You just work a lot.

332
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:57,530
Yeah. Yeah. You love your work. Keep hanging out with it.

333
00:36:57,770 --> 00:37:02,930
Yeah. People sometimes also do that where? So they don't have to think about other issues in their life as well.

334
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:07,580
What about the severity of it? Like working on the weekends?

335
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:12,420
What's the severity? I mean, you know, some people can just work for a few hours, right?

336
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,380
Some people will work the whole weekend. Yeah.

337
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:20,489
The Independent, like the reason why they're working is like delay of a deadline they're trying to meet.

338
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:24,450
So the severity is probably pretty high. Like, Oh, I need to get this done like a grants do.

339
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:28,770
Mhm. Now what are the benefits of working on the weekend.

340
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:36,510
Hopefully have more time during the week to be more productive.

341
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:43,710
Yeah. Some people feel like depending on their work environment or culture, you have to work on the weekend.

342
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:47,850
Right. This place is very much that kind of place.

343
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:52,310
It's a lot of people think it's a flex that they don't sleep.

344
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,430
I personally don't think it is. But a lot of people talk, a lot of faculty talk about it.

345
00:37:57,270 --> 00:38:01,200
And then what are the barriers to that? I have a family.

346
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:06,090
Spend time with them. One of the faculty that I talked to in another school,

347
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:12,329
she said that she schedules time to spend with her family on Saturday for a couple

348
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:17,550
of hours and that her children in rotation get to choose what they want to do.

349
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:26,640
It's like a business partner. Mm hmm. Yeah, but, you know, I guess you got to do it to each their own, right?

350
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:31,349
So that is, you know, extrapolated to, like, the workplace.

351
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:34,620
So let's take a look at a course advertisement for this.

352
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:38,220
Solve intervention is great.

353
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:44,610
So it comes from the ILO. Here we are. And this one was conducted in Turin, Italy.

354
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:48,270
Okay. There's that beautiful infographic.

355
00:38:49,290 --> 00:39:02,400
Okay. So you would go to this facility and the attractive banks of the River Po 21 pavilions, 287, study room slash bedrooms, the amenities.

356
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:03,990
Who cares about those? Right.

357
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:13,169
But essentially for this one, they kind of talk about interestingly changing world is making it increasing demand on workers,

358
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:18,120
downsizing, outsourcing, etc. So stress is not a new phenomenon.

359
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:26,520
It's now fully acknowledged. Psychosocial factors, stressful environments lead people to smoke more, drink more, use drugs more.

360
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:32,940
I get that. I don't get how the HIV aids fits into it.

361
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:40,080
They shove that in there so the [INAUDIBLE] they had these objectives for the intervention.

362
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:48,370
Describe the nature generation process and impact of the following problems work related stress, work violence and unhealthy habits.

363
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:53,190
Okay, I can get all of that. The HIV aids, though, kind of still don't see that connection.

364
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:58,860
Say, explain potential interrelationships among these health related problems.

365
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:02,400
Identify measures to avoid causes of these problems.

366
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:07,470
Describe the elements of a policy which will constitute the foundation of an organized strategies,

367
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:11,100
organizational strategy, and then apply a management model.

368
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:18,419
So this course or this intervention is really geared towards owner managers, managers, human resource people,

369
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:28,710
occupational safety and health directors, policy makers, senior executives, managers, professionals operating in health promotion and professors.

370
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:35,490
So this really isn't an intervention geared toward like the average frontline worker.

371
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:41,420
It's really at the managerial level where a person makes these policy decisions.

372
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:50,820
Okay. And this course in the year of 2011 cost €2,000.

373
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:57,930
Would you do it? And you have to do an application. Okay.

374
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:02,220
Most of the time, your workplace would pay for this if they wanted you to do it.

375
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:07,740
Yeah, I. They ask that. So solve.

376
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:13,050
They call it an integrated multilevel longitudinal organization or intervention.

377
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,040
It's two pronged.

378
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:21,840
And first, they say that it focuses on the development of holistic organizational policy around occupational safety and health needs,

379
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:29,070
including psychosocial problems, and to educating employees regarding the recognition and prevention of these problems.

380
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:36,030
So it's targeted at the organizational leaders and representatives of nine level employees.

381
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:44,730
So 32 hours of interactive activities, 4 to 5 days of lectures where they do like case study analysis,

382
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:51,809
simulation exercises, policy development activities, and a week long training that focuses on education.

383
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:54,210
And at the conclusion of the training,

384
00:41:54,570 --> 00:42:03,600
participants are providing changes to existing organizational policies and creating a personal action plan with goals of behavior change.

385
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:08,760
Follow up. Longitudinal. Three months.

386
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:15,880
Okay. So how they evaluate this empirically.

387
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:22,480
The problem this is they did a preliminary evaluation only since there's no rigorous quantitative

388
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:27,280
assessment of the short and long term effectiveness of solve and its impact on workers.

389
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:36,100
So potential evaluation criteria that they could have used was, number one, employee reactions of the training.

390
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:38,620
Hey, the training here was really boring.

391
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:46,450
When I do when I do worker trainings, the most common one was like, Ah, we wish you had provided coffee and donuts.

392
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:48,340
That's considered a reaction as well.

393
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:55,870
Learning, transfer of training, meaning are you taking what you did in the training and actually implementing that in the workplace?

394
00:42:56,260 --> 00:43:02,050
And then bottom line measures like our impact evaluation, we talked to that on Tuesday, return on investment.

395
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:04,900
So they had two hypotheses.

396
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:16,480
The first was that employees will exhibit significantly more knowledge regarding the five solved domains after the training compared to the pretest.

397
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:24,579
Second hypothesis is that knowledge improvements will be consistent over time, regardless of the of course,

398
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:29,620
they attended the country that the course took place and the language it was offered in.

399
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:39,310
Okay, so what did we look at? We looked at 268 SOF participants from seven countries.

400
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,940
Belgium. Canada. India. Sri Lanka. Malaysia. Namibia.

401
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:48,410
South Africa. Interesting spread of countries because.

402
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:52,190
That's right. It's supposed to be geared towards under-resourced countries.

403
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:58,310
I don't know if I would consider Belgium and Canada in that vein. No, but it's supposed to be generalizable.

404
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:09,200
But interestingly, the evaluation measures was just someone who had only attended one out of 15 of the policy training courses since 2001.

405
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:20,090
Mean age 41. Mean work time at their organization was close to 12 years, though, and it was, you know, pretty gender balanced.

406
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:27,410
And the pre and post test of their evaluation measures was just a pre and post test of declarative knowledge.

407
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:31,790
Self-reported 12, multiple question, multiple choice items.

408
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:36,280
That was it. Okay. So here's the data.

409
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:41,900
Okay. We'll talk about the hypotheses in a second. Let's look at the table first.

410
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:45,010
So these are the 12 questions.

411
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:53,540
And if you look at the general like improvement, they did not disclose to me what the 12 questions on the pre and post test were.

412
00:44:53,540 --> 00:45:01,610
But for the five domains, they have some questions about like HIV, AIDS, workplace violence, work, stress.

413
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,670
So, you know, generally like on one, you see about a 20% improvement.

414
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:16,220
On two, you see about a 15% improvement. Three, you actually see a decrease of 35%.

415
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:21,070
Four, you see a decrease. Say those are the p values.

416
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:26,220
My bad. Oh, proportion.

417
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:32,879
No, that is the percentage. Okay. So therefore people 80% got it right.

418
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:37,080
But in the post test, only 10% got it right. 5.83.

419
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:40,620
2.7.92. 2.8. 1.2.

420
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:51,840
2.8. 4.51. 2.1. 9.922.65.532.58.62.82 and then .572.38.

421
00:45:52,140 --> 00:46:00,970
So I would say on half the items they did better and then on the items they did significantly worse than before the training.

422
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:03,660
Something is happening here, you know.

423
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:12,990
So hypothesis one, which if you recall that is they'll exhibit significantly more knowledge regarding the five solved domains.

424
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:20,520
They actually did find this to be significant, increasing from 69%.

425
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:30,059
Correct on the pretest standard deviation of 18, which is quite large to almost 80% on the post-test standard deviation of 20.

426
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:37,020
Again, partially really large partial ADA squares, an effect size of 0.23 and that's a medium effect size.

427
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:40,290
So in essence, it was significant, but this really doesn't mean anything at all.

428
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:46,469
Okay. And then a hypothesis to knowledge improvements will be consistent over time.

429
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:51,000
Regarding course attended country. It took place in language it was offered in.

430
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:58,260
So for hypothesis two, there is no significant interaction between the course and the time,

431
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:05,850
no significance between the course, the country and the time, and no significance between language and the time.

432
00:47:06,330 --> 00:47:09,540
So totally nil, nada.

433
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:13,590
So my question for you, what does it mean?

434
00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:21,180
I got to know there was another meme I wanted to use with Jackie Chan, but I was like, Is I going to be racist?

435
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:30,059
Okay, so the practical implications for this is that this intervention may be effective at improving employee knowledge regarding causes,

436
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:35,040
consequences, and methods of prevention for major psychosocial workplace issues.

437
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:39,690
Insufficient evidence that transfer of training was going to occur.

438
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:46,469
Potential generalizability against multiple contacts do positive attitudinal and behavioral

439
00:47:46,470 --> 00:47:51,900
effects in the organization occur as a result of a participation in the intervention?

440
00:47:52,620 --> 00:48:03,930
So with this being said, now you have all the information about what the intervention is, was, is what it actually covers.

441
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:09,000
So this evaluation is nearly 15 years old.

442
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:18,060
Okay. First, if you yourselves were able to do the solve intervention, what would you change about it?

443
00:48:18,090 --> 00:48:21,270
You can choose multiple things to change about it.

444
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:25,500
You might choose to change the content. You might choose to change the timeline.

445
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:30,870
You might choose to change the delivery of my load. So I want you to talk about that first.

446
00:48:31,290 --> 00:48:39,020
And then number two, how would you choose to evaluate this intervention differently than the authors did,

447
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:43,380
keeping in mind they only did 12 multiple choice, pretest, post-test.

448
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:54,150
Okay. Does that make sense? So I'm going to have you break up into pairs, discuss this, and then one person is going to report back.

449
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:58,200
So make sure you're like jotting down some notes or something. Is that is that clear?

450
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:03,500
Yes. Okay. You all do that. And then I'm going to go downstairs, the back end of that.

451
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:19,780
I'll be back. And she just said, yeah, I think one thing maybe is looking at remote work is that one tended to be virtual.

452
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:30,240
She? And you should understand that.

453
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:11,300
I don't know. I guess she kept talking as if he had been there.

454
00:50:11,350 --> 00:50:16,540
We should look at that. Maybe expanded or diseases that are coming.

455
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:23,820
It was it was a quick. Oh, I feel like something like stress reduction.

456
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:30,000
It takes yeah. Like time in practice especially like on a biological level.

457
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:37,430
Sounds like a long time. I wonder if you were, like, addicted to.

458
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:44,649
Stress and. You can't.

459
00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:51,610
You can't just. It takes some time for the body to recalibrate.

460
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:57,100
Definitely a longer time between.

461
00:50:58,310 --> 00:51:05,020
The. And. It made me feel like.

462
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:16,070
You think they were? I think we're just going to look at other conditions such as home life or other conditions

463
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:23,860
outside of work and at least with extreme stress or to just kind of these areas.

464
00:51:23,870 --> 00:51:29,230
But. Is that realistic?

465
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:43,560
Yeah. And I think that evaluation is doing like an exam pre test process.

466
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:47,070
Um. Make sense of one way.

467
00:51:57,430 --> 00:52:02,770
I mean. I need to get comfortable.

468
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:11,520
With employee reactions, employee trainings and housing.

469
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:19,950
A lot of my measurements for such as now more so than anything, do more.

470
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:25,520
Visual feedback from people, 6% is virtually nothing.

471
00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:34,820
There is a smaller section so it doesn't work anymore, right?

472
00:53:22,750 --> 00:54:11,670
Because if you don't have. Kennedy polls are increasingly changing.

473
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:14,400
I think it's because, you know. I'm just going to let you know that would have been good for me because it's really quiet over here.

474
00:54:17,473 --> 00:54:22,203
Yes. Boy. Oh, boy.

475
00:54:22,363 --> 00:54:28,303
Very good point. All right, let's start.

476
00:54:30,483 --> 00:54:37,763
It's not that. Let's start over with Sam. And. So what would you change about this intervention if you were change?

477
00:54:37,923 --> 00:54:41,343
Going to change it? Um, I don't know.

478
00:54:41,343 --> 00:54:47,583
I haven't. If there's like 32 hours intervention, four or five days of lectures like this, a lot is just getting thrown at people.

479
00:54:48,003 --> 00:54:53,783
So I would wanted to break it up more. I don't know if this would be like long our days, but if this intervention,

480
00:54:53,843 --> 00:55:01,773
this kind of heavy lectures, um, people might not get a lot out of it, then that's one thing.

481
00:55:01,893 --> 00:55:07,163
And then maybe if they're looking at stuff, if it is 15 years old, you know,

482
00:55:07,203 --> 00:55:10,953
like one of our main things that we were talking about is just like it wasn't addressed in that case,

483
00:55:10,953 --> 00:55:13,953
study was like the HIV aids wasn't really addressed somewhere.

484
00:55:13,953 --> 00:55:19,533
So it's like making sure you're staying within the scope of the mission and like addressing those

485
00:55:19,533 --> 00:55:26,343
different areas and potentially new stress indicators have come up with like kind of different,

486
00:55:27,483 --> 00:55:33,513
different causes of stress that we were talking about, like virtual world and virtual workplaces.

487
00:55:33,513 --> 00:55:39,243
So addressing that level as well, would you you still look at the five domains they did?

488
00:55:39,513 --> 00:55:43,443
Yeah. You'd still look at HIV AIDS from an HIV.

489
00:55:43,443 --> 00:55:48,333
I want to broaden that more and think to what maybe.

490
00:55:52,073 --> 00:55:56,483
Cause this is like our chronic disease.

491
00:55:57,833 --> 00:56:07,523
Yeah, I think that's where I was. Meaning more chronic, maybe, like common issues or diseases you see come out of these workplaces and.

492
00:56:10,303 --> 00:56:16,633
Right. Because let's go back to this figure. Okay. The most of this makes sense to me.

493
00:56:17,723 --> 00:56:22,163
And then the HIV aids, I think, is a little bit of a stretch, I think.

494
00:56:22,243 --> 00:56:25,363
And I feel like whenever you talk about HIV AIDS prevention,

495
00:56:25,363 --> 00:56:37,182
traditionally it is like preventing drug use or like mitigating the risks of drug use for HIV transmission or like risky sexual behaviors.

496
00:56:37,183 --> 00:56:42,793
But I don't really know that that fits into the scope of everything else other than like the drug.

497
00:56:43,063 --> 00:56:51,053
Yes. Yes, I think that. The connection, obviously the connection between stress and alcohol and drugs.

498
00:56:51,083 --> 00:56:56,383
Great. Makes sense to us. Right. And we've talked before about opioid use in the workplace and all that then.

499
00:56:56,393 --> 00:56:59,843
Okay, stress and violence totally makes sense to me, right? Or stress and smoking?

500
00:57:00,113 --> 00:57:06,053
Yeah. Stress and poor nutritional choices. Stress and ability to do physical activity, sleep, etc.

501
00:57:06,383 --> 00:57:11,603
I think they didn't explicitly stated. So I am totally like trying to extrapolate what they were thinking about.

502
00:57:12,053 --> 00:57:18,743
This was probably created in the nineties 2000 where HIV AIDS is a more pervasive issue.

503
00:57:19,073 --> 00:57:24,923
So I think maybe they were trying to connect this to stress and risky sexual activities,

504
00:57:26,603 --> 00:57:32,963
whereas I might broaden this to likes stress and like safe sex practices or something like that,

505
00:57:33,353 --> 00:57:37,972
because now we know where there's like super chlamydia and super gunnery and all this fun stuff going around.

506
00:57:37,973 --> 00:57:45,293
But HIV and AIDS is pretty in the United States, at least pretty well controlled now.

507
00:57:45,503 --> 00:57:49,853
Still not tested very well. Another thing, though, is that they're focusing on low resource countries.

508
00:57:49,853 --> 00:57:56,243
Yes. Oh, that's true. That was their intention, not necessarily what they did where HIV and AIDS spreads more easily.

509
00:57:56,363 --> 00:58:04,342
Yeah, yeah. But then we saw countries like Belgium and yeah, you know, Finland partaking.

510
00:58:04,343 --> 00:58:07,633
So I don't know, I. Yeah. Yeah.

511
00:58:07,643 --> 00:58:12,533
Other changes you would make to this. I think so.

512
00:58:14,843 --> 00:58:18,133
But so. Which is still make it so. This class is in person right now.

513
00:58:20,693 --> 00:58:24,143
I would one said option for virtual.

514
00:58:25,163 --> 00:58:25,613
Okay. Yeah.

515
00:58:25,883 --> 00:58:33,713
Well, again, to make this point is this is for underserved countries and those are probably in person depending on like what the job focus is.

516
00:58:34,133 --> 00:58:39,593
So it's just I guess knowing your population of interest and then that's what it's about.

517
00:58:39,883 --> 00:58:48,803
Okay. Why did you all talk about for number one? Um, we focus more on like the follow up,

518
00:58:48,803 --> 00:58:53,243
like we would say were followed later and probably more frequently since the things

519
00:58:53,243 --> 00:58:58,523
that they're trying to address take time to resolve themselves in the work place.

520
00:58:59,273 --> 00:59:04,433
And then you have to talk about like continuing to share resources with participants like

521
00:59:05,003 --> 00:59:09,503
through a newsletter and really follow up webinars because more programs like that,

522
00:59:09,513 --> 00:59:18,233
that's like keep up with the learning. So potentially follow up like three, six, nine, 12 months, something like that.

523
00:59:18,873 --> 00:59:26,783
Okay. Okay. To build in some sort of like accountability system so that not just at those like.

524
00:59:27,993 --> 00:59:31,263
I left markers, but throughout the entire time.

525
00:59:33,323 --> 00:59:43,923
I think there is some sort of something. Like holding people to actually making behavior change, not just like a person.

526
00:59:43,933 --> 00:59:46,933
A policy change. Mm hmm. Okay.

527
00:59:48,433 --> 00:59:53,833
Now, how would you choose to evaluate it differently than the authors did at the right here?

528
00:59:54,573 --> 01:00:01,273
Uh, we prefer getting more information on since the training is for upper management,

529
01:00:01,813 --> 01:00:07,392
but the fact that they want to see like organization wise, like before and after the intervention,

530
01:00:07,393 --> 01:00:12,552
like in information on like employees perception of like stress and like all the other risk

531
01:00:12,553 --> 01:00:16,723
factors in the workplace so that you can like follow up and see that's actually decreasing later.

532
01:00:17,323 --> 01:00:21,702
And we have talked about like the implementation of policy, like some way to evaluate that,

533
01:00:21,703 --> 01:00:25,033
to make sure that what they're doing in the work that's actually happening.

534
01:00:25,543 --> 01:00:28,923
Okay, how about y'all? Um, yeah.

535
01:00:29,113 --> 01:00:35,333
If they dress like they're like this, I'm sure that this is a lot of knowledge, and knowledge doesn't necessarily mean change.

536
01:00:35,353 --> 01:00:41,773
So kind of assessing that to kind of go into like how you're following up with these areas and like making sure that there's

537
01:00:41,773 --> 01:00:49,093
no new knowledge leading to something and see what is motivating people to kind of adopt this policy changes in my mind.

538
01:00:49,243 --> 01:00:58,093
Mm hmm. So in addition to maybe like the pre and post test surveys, maybe Bridget and Jill, what you talked about, maybe at their workplace,

539
01:00:58,123 --> 01:01:06,343
maybe conducting either another survey or like conducting a focus group with their employees before the intervention is rolled out.

540
01:01:06,673 --> 01:01:13,213
And then post intervention, maybe six months, six months down the line with the same group of employees for a focus group.

541
01:01:13,573 --> 01:01:23,773
You could also look at records to see actually like, did they physically, like actually change any policies or make any statements as well?

542
01:01:24,103 --> 01:01:30,973
You could potentially look at things like injury and illness logs and records like absenteeism,

543
01:01:31,333 --> 01:01:34,923
sick days away from work time that people are taking off.

544
01:01:34,933 --> 01:01:38,043
So kind of trying to keep it even. Right.

545
01:01:38,053 --> 01:01:45,613
So like obviously if you look at like sickness, sick leave days off data in like November or December,

546
01:01:45,913 --> 01:01:53,292
you can't necessarily compare that to May and June. Right, because you have other factors affecting why people might be taking work off of that time.

547
01:01:53,293 --> 01:01:59,033
But you could do a year later in that same time frame to follow up on that.

548
01:01:59,053 --> 01:02:05,773
Yeah. Yeah. Did you all discuss anything else on how you might choose to evaluate it differently?

549
01:02:07,663 --> 01:02:12,923
Not really. Okay. I thought this was a really weak evaluation.

550
01:02:13,413 --> 01:02:19,103
But keeping in mind that they are trying to implement it in lower resource

551
01:02:19,103 --> 01:02:27,712
countries and reduce the burden of the burden on the actual participant itself,

552
01:02:27,713 --> 01:02:31,673
they obviously don't want to do an evaluation that's very cumbersome,

553
01:02:32,513 --> 01:02:40,162
but obviously I myself could not figure out like the exact details of the contents of the 32 hour policy trading,

554
01:02:40,163 --> 01:02:44,392
because you actually have to like pay into it to receive all the materials.

555
01:02:44,393 --> 01:02:48,983
But this is one of the few global interventions that tries to address psychosocial factors.

556
01:02:49,703 --> 01:02:54,143
So it's a good start. It's a good start. 15 years old.

557
01:02:54,143 --> 01:02:57,473
And this is the best that we have, actually. Not a good start. Yeah.

558
01:02:57,623 --> 01:03:01,013
Yeah. So lots to think about in that sense.

559
01:03:02,483 --> 01:03:05,933
And with that, that's all I've got for you today.

560
01:03:07,103 --> 01:03:16,732
So when we return on Tuesday, you all will be taking the charge, leading class hope and.

561
01:03:16,733 --> 01:03:21,863
Oh, and just as a reminder, you do have to turn in all your stuff by the time class starts on Tuesday.

562
01:03:22,463 --> 01:03:27,463
So by 1 p.m. for everybody. Okay, cool.

563
01:03:27,533 --> 01:03:29,411
Thank you. Hey, what do you want to.
