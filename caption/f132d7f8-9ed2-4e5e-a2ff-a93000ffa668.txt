1
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:10,230
So, I've been talking with you about
using the inverted triangle structure.

2
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,990
Am I serious about how important
using this structure is?

3
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,920
I really am, so let me give you some
examples of why this structure matters.

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,100
First thing I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna give you some good examples,

5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:25,270
some paragraphs that fit this inverted
triangle structure really clearly.

6
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:30,150
So here's one, influenza, commonly called
the flu, can be a dangerous disease.

7
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,370
In some cases, the flu can cause death or

8
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:36,750
other serious complications such as
pneumonia or bacterial infections.

9
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,760
The flu is especially dangerous for young
children and infants, pregnant women, and

10
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,140
the elderly, but it can cause death or
serious harm for

11
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,910
people of any age or state.

12
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:49,690
Notice that I've bolded
that first sentence.

13
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:54,070
The core idea is,
the flu can be dangerous and

14
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:58,050
all the other information in this
paragraph supports that point.

15
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,840
It can cause death, it can cause
complications, it can harm young children,

16
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,780
it can harm the elderly.

17
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,380
All supporting this basic point of
flu can be a dangerous disease.

18
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:13,280
Here's another one, c-section deliveries
disrupt the exposure of newborns to their

19
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,060
mother's vaginal bacterial community,
also known as the vaginal microbiome.

20
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:23,150
A microbiome is a unique community of
microbes in each area of the body,

21
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,950
much like the diversity of species
that exist in different climates.

22
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:30,920
Naturally delivered babies adopt
the beneficial bacteria present in their

23
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,800
mother's vaginal microbiome,
whereas c-section deliveries do not.

24
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:41,400
Again, notice the core point here is
that c-section deliveries are disrupting

25
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:47,730
the exposure of newborns to the beneficial
vaginal bacteria of their mother.

26
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:51,770
And the two other sentences in
this paragraph support the idea

27
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:55,540
that this is a valuable exposure
that is being disrupted

28
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,780
because of the method of delivery.

29
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:03,820
Now let me show you some paragraphs
where the writer tries to do too much,

30
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:07,790
they're trying to get too
much across in one paragraph.

31
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:10,350
So here's one about
Graphic Health Warnings.

32
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:15,170
Graphic Health Warnings or
GHWs are messages that use exemplars,

33
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:18,770
human characters or
relevant graphic images to try and

34
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:22,440
make health warnings salient for
widespread audiences.

35
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,170
In anti-smoking campaigns,

36
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:30,010
GHWs use emotionally evocative exemplars
to make people remember the messages.

37
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,870
One example that people usually remember
is the Healthy versus Smoker's Lung

38
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:38,780
graphic with the message,
smoking causes lung disease.

39
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:42,400
The use of human exemplars is particularly
important for anti-smoking campaigns,

40
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,790
because they can affect
people's perceptions and

41
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,980
interpretations of a health warning.

42
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:51,120
The goal of using exemplars in tobacco
GHWs is to make health consequences of

43
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,190
smoking visually authentic and
of serious concern to people.

44
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:59,710
Now, all of this is related to smoking and
graphic health warnings,

45
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:04,040
but there's actually a couple
different things going on here, right?

46
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:09,040
This first part is really describing
what graphic health warnings are,

47
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,500
whereas the second part of
the paragraph is describing

48
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,200
the fact that using human
exemplars is important.

49
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,440
So, why are we making this one paragraph?

50
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:22,300
It would actually be much
better if we broke it into two.

51
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:26,788
Now, those two highlighted sentences
actually serve as the central message for

52
00:03:26,788 --> 00:03:27,844
each paragraph and

53
00:03:27,844 --> 00:03:33,808
we're back to having more of
an inverted triangle structure here.

54
00:03:33,808 --> 00:03:35,660
Here's another example.

55
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:39,665
This one's about discussion
of Angelina Jolie and

56
00:03:39,665 --> 00:03:44,056
her discussion of her mutation
related breast cancer.

57
00:03:44,056 --> 00:03:49,640
So, the paragraph goes, pertinent risk
information was left out of many articles

58
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,740
reporting on Angelina Jolie's medical
announcement of her BRCA mutation and

59
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,520
elective mastectomy.

60
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,690
Though many articles described
the increased risk of breast cancer

61
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:04,030
due to a BRCA mutation,
only a third of articles describe

62
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:07,920
BRCA mutations as rare in
the general population.

63
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,452
Only some articles address the relative
efficacy of surgery relative to other

64
00:04:13,452 --> 00:04:20,429
prevention against breast cancer, 30%, and
fewer presented risks of mastectomy, 10%.

65
00:04:20,429 --> 00:04:24,405
We know the selective use of information
in media can influence the audiences

66
00:04:24,405 --> 00:04:28,960
perceptions by limiting their range of
interpretations for complex topics.

67
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,662
Exclusion of pertinent risk
operation may have implications for

68
00:04:32,662 --> 00:04:38,468
the public's future utilization
of BRCA genetic testing.

69
00:04:38,468 --> 00:04:40,900
Did you hear as I was
reading through that?

70
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:45,120
There was some sort of shift, the first
part was all about the statistics of

71
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,280
what was included in the articles.

72
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,500
The second part was the implications
of the fact that that information

73
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,056
was not included in the articles.

74
00:04:53,056 --> 00:04:56,760
And you can again, find that sentence
in the middle of the paragraph,

75
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,980
that's where that transition is happening.

76
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:04,100
So again, if we break that apart and make
it two set paragraphs rather than one,

77
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:07,260
there's a natural second central message.

78
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,950
The second one is about, we know that

79
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:14,900
selective use of information in the media
can influence audience perceptions.

80
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,110
And by making a second
paragraph about that,

81
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:21,180
it actually makes the whole flow
of the argument a lot clearer.

82
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:26,980
Now, sometimes the problem is that
the point is there, it's just at the end,

83
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:31,490
that academic triangle where you
only get to the point at the bottom.

84
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:34,080
So let me give you an example of that.

85
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,200
Sentence 1, though not traditionally
seen as health professionals, pastors

86
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,960
play vital roles in facilitating health
behavior change of both congregants and

87
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,210
the surrounding communities of churches.

88
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:48,070
In the African American community,

89
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:51,750
pastors are viewed as highly
respected authority figures and

90
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:56,050
are extremely influential to their
congregants and surrounding communities.

91
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:58,820
Pastor endorsed health materials therefore

92
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,960
have a strong probability of
influencing behavior change

93
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,990
to help alleviate the health disparities
that affect African Americans.

94
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:10,440
Now, notice that sort of the core
point here is the last sentence,

95
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,430
the idea that pastor
endorsed health materials

96
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:19,120
might be particularly influential
in inducing behavior change.

97
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,940
But it's at the end,

98
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:24,670
I had to work my way through
details about pastors to get there.

99
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:27,400
So, what if we just flip this around?

100
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,700
Move and
put the pastor endorsed health materials

101
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:36,150
have a strong probability of
influencing behavior change, first.

102
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:38,730
Now actually the whole
paragraph works very smoothly.

103
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,940
You start by making the core idea,

104
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:45,080
that these types of materials
might be particularly influential.

105
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,180
And then you support that point by
noting that pastors play vital roles in

106
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,060
facilitating behavior change.

107
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,880
And that they're highly
respected authority figures,

108
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,000
both of those points
support the core idea.

109
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,500
Next I'll give you a harder one.

110
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,030
This one's a bit more complicated,
as it's got a lot going on in it, but

111
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:05,410
it's a good example of the kind
of editing that you can do

112
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:10,100
to make an inverted triangle
paragraph that's much clearer.

113
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,940
So, here's the paragraph as it starts.

114
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:16,940
The way your community is designed can
increase your child's engagement in

115
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,810
physical activity.

116
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:23,280
The design of a community might
actually discourage physical activity.

117
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,820
However, communities can
also be designed and

118
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:31,360
built to promote active lifestyles through
utilizing smart growth principles,

119
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,290
which include walkable streets,
spaces to gather, diverse housing and

120
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:41,330
transportation options, and
walkability through creating proximity.

121
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:46,546
Motivation for physical activity
can be built into the environment.

122
00:07:46,546 --> 00:07:48,920
Now, there's a lot going on here.

123
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,690
And so I'm gonna start by
breaking apart the sentences

124
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:54,100
into their separate components.

125
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,940
So, as written,
there are four separate sentences.

126
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,890
The way your community is designed.

127
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:03,480
The design of a community might
discourage physical activity.

128
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:07,500
This big sentence number three
that's got of ideas about

129
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,920
things that can be done to
promote active lifestyles.

130
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,910
And then a sentence at the end that
says motivation can be built onto

131
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,560
the environment.

132
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,050
The first problem is that the same
point basically gets said three times.

133
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:24,010
That there is a link between the physical
environment and physical activity.

134
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:27,280
And sentence two is essentially
the same statement in reverse.

135
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,619
So, look at this, there's all this
highlighted stuff in blue is basically all

136
00:08:31,619 --> 00:08:36,113
saying the same thing and number two is
actually the same thing almost in reverse.

137
00:08:36,113 --> 00:08:40,280
There's a lot of repetition here
that doesn't need to be there.

138
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:46,557
So, lets get rid of that redundancy and
basically start with sentence three.

139
00:08:46,557 --> 00:08:50,447
If we get rid of that redundancy
the core idea becomes,

140
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:55,900
communities can be designed and
built to promote active lifestyles.

141
00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:00,320
That's a nice central message,
it's got a lot of potential impact and

142
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,720
it expands into implications.

143
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,060
Notice that sentence three had all
those different kinds of ideas

144
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:11,160
about how you might
promote physical activity.

145
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,870
So now that we've gotten rid of
the extra stuff at the beginning,

146
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:18,150
we can start to break these up and
make the points clear.

147
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:23,370
So if I break up sentence three,
you've got smart growth principles,

148
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:27,720
walkable streets, spaces to gather,
diverse housing and

149
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:32,338
transportation options and
walkability through proximity.

150
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:37,052
So now I'm gonna reorganize a little bit,
combining the two parts that have

151
00:09:37,052 --> 00:09:42,062
the main point, which were 3a and 4, and
creating separate sentences for each

152
00:09:42,062 --> 00:09:47,163
of the remaining points, these different
ways of promoting physical activity.

153
00:09:47,163 --> 00:09:51,450
And so, here's the paragraph
as I've restructured it.

154
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:54,400
Sentence A, the core central message,

155
00:09:54,400 --> 00:10:00,700
communities can be designed and
built to promote active lifestyles.

156
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:04,365
B, smart growth principles
can build motivation for

157
00:10:04,365 --> 00:10:07,309
physical activity into the environment.

158
00:10:07,309 --> 00:10:11,570
C, for example, close proximity,
walkable streets,

159
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:15,831
and spaces to gather all create
a sense of walkability and

160
00:10:15,831 --> 00:10:19,320
encourages people to
walk rather than drive.

161
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,972
D, diverse housing and transportation
options, such as bike trails,

162
00:10:23,972 --> 00:10:27,340
can also encourage physical activity.

163
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:32,420
Notice that B, C, and D are now all
specific points that support the larger

164
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:38,190
idea that communities can be designed and
built to promote active lifestyles.

165
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:41,230
Even though this, in fact,
shorter than the original,

166
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:45,460
it has all the same points and
even a little bit more detail.

167
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:50,310
But that inverted triangle structure means
that everything is clearly connected to

168
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:55,190
that core point,
communities can be designed and

169
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:58,200
built to promote active lifestyles.

170
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:03,060
Whether you're writing a proposal,
an external report, an internal memo, or

171
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:06,800
something for the public like
an op-ed piece, it doesn't matter.

172
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:12,410
You need to think in paragraph chunks,
one point each and

173
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:16,900
whenever you can use that inverted
triangle structure to make it easier for

174
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:22,660
people to see the connections between your
supporting evidence and your core points.

175
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:28,988
Trust me, it will make you clearer and
more effective as a communicator.
