1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:09,660
Okay. Hello, everyone. Um, so today we're starting week for our week on cancer registry.

2
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:18,870
So the material is on canvas. Our learning objectives for this week are to describe the goals and characteristics of cancer registries.

3
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:27,600
Determine how to specify a cancer in terms of its international classification of disease codes and histology codes.

4
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:33,750
Now to be part of the lab and download and visualize cancer incidence data from the cancer registry.

5
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:41,670
Because for this week and next week, we're going to need software that is only available on PCs.

6
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:48,420
We are going to meet in a different room next Monday and the Monday after, which is 2615.

7
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:55,920
It's in the slides and I'll make an announcement on campus. So the next two weeks will be meeting in that lab.

8
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:01,150
If you have your own PC laptop, you're more than welcome to just download it on there.

9
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,580
But because not everyone does. We will meet over there.

10
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,720
Okay. So cancer registries.

11
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,580
So what is the cancer registry?

12
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:19,120
Cancer registry is an information system designed for the collection, storage and management of data on people with cancer.

13
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,380
So pretty basic we want to think about,

14
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:30,299
particularly if it's the collection of information on every single case of cancer identified in a specific population

15
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:40,230
over a given period of time and with a fairly complete set of information about cancer and cases of cancer.

16
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:50,100
Then we can do that. But the important things about understanding how trends are evolving over time.

17
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:53,350
What are things like? Survival incidence, so on and so forth.

18
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:57,540
So we can only do that with a very good collection of information.

19
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:07,050
And so these registries play a really critical role in cancer surveillance, and that can tell us how the cancer burden is changing over time.

20
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,900
And a lot of the surveillance data is really the foundation for a lot of the work we do in cancer research,

21
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:18,270
as well as trying to plan and evaluate cancer prevention and control.

22
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:27,030
You may think that there is already systems in which, like every cancer in the U.S., all goes into one cancer registry.

23
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:30,270
That is not the case. We are not there.

24
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,620
So let's talk a little bit about different cancer registries.

25
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:43,230
So every different cancer registry collects, so a different set of data and may collect data on things like patient characteristics.

26
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:50,400
This may be as simple as sort of age. Sex race may include geographic location.

27
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:56,490
Sometimes you have risk factors like things like smoking, but that's pretty rare in cancer registries.

28
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:01,830
Sometimes I'll have insurance status, perhaps partner status.

29
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,870
A couple of other things you'll sometimes see.

30
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:14,370
I think I'll have information about the tumor characteristics in a particular site where the location of the tumor histology stage a diagnosis,

31
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:20,970
perhaps others. Sometimes you have treatment characteristics, whether the person underwent surgery, chemo, radiation.

32
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:28,050
And if it's something like. Yeah.

33
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:38,220
Again, these are usually fairly not, uh, detailed in a lot of cancer registries.

34
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,760
Outcomes may also differ.

35
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:49,020
Um, often you just get overall survival, which is just if that person is alive or not, and if they died at one point, they died.

36
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,070
That's usually not as helpful as disease specific survival.

37
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,480
So did they die of their cancer or did they die of other causes?

38
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:02,129
Um, and also fairly rarely you'll have information on recurrence.

39
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:07,220
So if that cancer was treated, did it come back and when did it come back?

40
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:16,799
So this is just probably not super visible here, but I just wanted to get a sense of different cancer registries collecting different data.

41
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:23,820
So unless this is the seer or Surveillance Epidemiology and results database and this is the National Cancer Database,

42
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:31,800
so you can see this has got 10 million cancer cases as of 2018 or whenever this was published, 34 million in NCD.

43
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:37,030
So it's much larger and you can sort of pick a couple here.

44
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:42,180
Um, I do. I want to point out.

45
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:51,030
Yes. So outcomes in particular, both of them have overall survival, but only SEER has disease specific survival and CTP doesn't.

46
00:04:54,040 --> 00:05:02,320
A.B. also does have tends to have a little bit more in terms of covariate information here in our.

47
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:14,450
So history of cancer registries. So they first started in Europe around 1900s with the first one in Germany in 1926.

48
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:24,590
The US in particular for Connecticut. So in 1935 we generally see them more in developed middle and high income countries.

49
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,740
Sometimes you have AIDS or site specific cancer registries,

50
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:38,580
so there's like childhood cancers or maybe gastrointestinal cancers, specifically World War II.

51
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:45,770
But again, they these these these registries are still fairly, um, not centralized.

52
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,100
They're decentralized. They're more than 700 worldwide.

53
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:57,170
And a very small fraction of the population is actually covered by a population based cancer registry.

54
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:07,010
So if you get cancer in most of the world, that's not going to get reported in cancer registry and particularly in Asia and Africa.

55
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:17,850
In the U.S. The surveillance of immune allergy and results are clear, which is what we're primarily going to be working with.

56
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:25,680
Started in 1973 and collected data starting with nine states and up to 22 states.

57
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:33,450
I believe National Cancer Database is a joint project of the American Cancer Society and the American College of Surgeons.

58
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:48,660
So you can see her is a government, the US government based entity and CDB is in what we first did in 1992, the Cancer Registries Amendment Act.

59
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:57,660
This was to help states set up cancer registries, and before the 1990s, ten states didn't even have a cancer registry at all.

60
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:07,930
So what's the point of cancer? So we've already said that the goal of the cancer registry is to collect information.

61
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:12,310
Every case, specific population in a specific period of time.

62
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:17,770
And so to define your cancer registry, you need to know exactly what your catchment area is.

63
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:27,580
The catchment area being the geographic bounds of people that are going to be the information is going to be collected in the registry.

64
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:36,280
So like the University of Michigan is often the catchment is defined as like everywhere in Michigan except for the thumb,

65
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:42,550
because the thumb is a Henry Ford kind of Belmont area catchment area.

66
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:52,540
But for Michigan Cancer Registry, that'll be in Michigan this year, cancer registry is these particular 22 states.

67
00:07:54,010 --> 00:08:00,370
You need to have a pretty reliable population denominator. You need to know how many if these you were getting like ten cases of cancer.

68
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:09,499
That's out of how many people, 20,000 different that cancer needs to be diagnosed and therefore collected.

69
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:18,010
And so there has to be enough of the health system there and the information about cases, pathology, clinical data,

70
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:24,640
death certificates has to be accessible for the cancer registry to be able to pull so that information is not available,

71
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:32,830
becomes difficult to have a cancer registry. So let's dove in a little bit more into Sierra and CDB.

72
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:37,810
So Sphere currently covers about 48% of the U.S. population.

73
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,990
That's up from even just a couple of years ago where it was, I think, 35%.

74
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:50,469
They've got about 10 million cases of cancer. What's nice is that they have disease specific survival.

75
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:54,100
So, you know, if they died of the specific cancer or not.

76
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:59,560
And for our purposes, what we need is that it's a population based cancer registry,

77
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,910
and that allows us to estimate rates and trends and patterns of care,

78
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:09,459
because if we have a really clear denominator, we know how things are changing over time.

79
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:14,740
We can do our age adjusting in contrast to the population based.

80
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,340
And CBP is a hospital based cancer registry.

81
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:24,940
So it's all patients who receive care and cancer program accredited by the American College of Surgeons,

82
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:31,150
which is in the US, about 30% of hospitals covering about 70% of population.

83
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:39,370
They have a much larger set of information on cancer patients, 34 million that they do not have disease specific survival.

84
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,020
They have only overall survival.

85
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:49,690
And because of the hospital based cancer registry, it's not particularly good for the kind of research that we're going to be doing in this class,

86
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:55,750
because we don't have a really good idea of the underlying population in each of these hospitals.

87
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:01,650
So the catchment of a hospital is like sort of ill defined.

88
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,899
You know, we said for U of M, it's everywhere about the thumb.

89
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,400
But like, that's not really true.

90
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:14,140
Like, people go to different hospitals depending on their location and some people that are closer to one might go to the other, for example.

91
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:21,549
But what hospital based registries are really good for are for understanding, for good about population.

92
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:26,710
But if you have a person who has cancer, what were their outcomes based on things like clinical care,

93
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:32,360
their surgery, chemotherapy and other sorts of treatment options?

94
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:42,360
So if you're doing that kind of work and CDB is really great, but if we're looking at kind of like is our cancer rates going up, we need to.

95
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:49,680
So this cancer registry data exists.

96
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:53,090
How did we get it? How do we download it? How do we work with it?

97
00:10:53,420 --> 00:11:04,820
So, like I said, we're going to be working with Seer and that's access through a their own software available only for Windows called SEER staff.

98
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:15,170
So at the end of the today, I'm going to direct you to request access a download series that when I was talking last week,

99
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:20,060
I realized that some of there are ways to go about this have changed.

100
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:23,670
But I think I figured out what I need all of you to do.

101
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:29,390
So at the end of class today, we're going to hopefully step you through how to access here.

102
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:37,430
And definitely, we want you to have access to Seer before Monday because we're going to be downloading data from Thursday,

103
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,440
and that shouldn't be a problem. But if it is, we will cross that bridge when we come to it.

104
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:47,000
So Seierstad and I don't have serious on this computer,

105
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:55,430
but it is on our computers in 2016 at least I should actually double check that, but that's what it tells me.

106
00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:05,600
So if you're serious that they think that Comic Sans is like an appropriate for professional programs.

107
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:11,150
So you know that it's built by National Cancer Institute, but it works.

108
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:17,990
Most of the rest of this lecture is going to basically be an introduction to the software.

109
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:28,850
I don't necessarily want you to like memorize this as we're just kind of talking about what were the basic things that we're

110
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:34,460
doing in the software that these slides are going to be there for in the lab when you go back to do it for your cancer?

111
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,980
Okay. So this is what the stat bar looks like.

112
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:51,410
The thing that we're going to be looking for in this stuff in this this week is looking at the ring session, which is the Sigma.

113
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,170
I don't know why they picked that as their ringing session, but that's what we're going to be looking at.

114
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:07,340
So we're going to reduce that for remittance trends over time. So when I click on that rate session Up pops this great session with these tabs

115
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:15,140
and there is like an overwhelming number of possible databases to look through.

116
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:20,420
When you're doing actual research, it is important to understand the nuances.

117
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:32,420
For our purposes, I want you to pick one of the sort of top ones which are going to be either eight, 12 or 17.

118
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,880
Those are the number of registries.

119
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:46,160
Generally speaking, the the one of the fewer the fewer the farther back you want to go, the fewer registries you have available.

120
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:55,280
So you're trying to want to figure out whether you have if you if you're going to be working with a cancer that has relatively few cases,

121
00:13:55,610 --> 00:14:00,559
you probably need more cancer registries, but that gives you less time to go back.

122
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:10,810
But if it's a cancer, that's very high incidence, something like lung cancer, you can go all the way back to 1975 with that on it.

123
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:18,500
So one of the things that you'll be doing in the lab is picking a cancer of your own to work with.

124
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:25,670
And among other things, you have to decide which is the appropriate database to work from.

125
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:32,840
And you can do all of them or like a couple of them and just kind of figure out it's not that hard to to to download the data.

126
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:41,570
So what I say here is try to get the like the longest time range as long as the numbers aren't too choppy.

127
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:50,680
Okay. So in the second tab, we're not going to do anything, but I just wanted to show it.

128
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:59,170
For now, we're going to use the age adjusted rates. We're going to age adjust to the US population and we want single ages.

129
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:14,840
Okay. In this election we are going to subset our data to only because this is now currently all cancer is of all types at all time periods.

130
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:19,550
So we need to subset to specific things. So I'm beginning to pick certain ages.

131
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:28,580
Um, we're going to try to include certain you can subset only certain sexes if you want.

132
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:32,010
So if you're doing breast cancer, you might want to remove men.

133
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:37,160
There are the breast cancers in men, but that's probably not what you're looking for.

134
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:41,990
There's not that many of them. And if you want only three years of diagnosis that go in here.

135
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:48,950
And finally, we might want to subset two other variables. And this is the important one for choosing your specific cancer.

136
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:55,790
I'm going to show you the example of head and neck cancer.

137
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:01,970
So I'm going to subset only ages, I think 25.

138
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:07,700
Uh, actually, here, here I think I'm just dropping the 85 pluses.

139
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:17,400
We can kind of go through that in the specifics depending on which of the sea registries you use.

140
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:21,090
You may have access to different race and ethnicity data.

141
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:28,080
I think I used zero eight here, so I have only access to all races, white and black.

142
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:34,020
The more recent ones also had Hispanic and possibly Asian depending.

143
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:41,390
We also need to be specific for our site histology.

144
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:49,010
So the international classification of disease codes are what we want.

145
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:54,650
Normally I use primary site. I think that affords us the best fine tuning.

146
00:16:55,280 --> 00:17:10,520
But we also may need to worry about histology. So histology are has to do with the different kinds of subtypes and growth of cancers.

147
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:16,790
Some biology aspects that I'll be honest that like are not my area of expertize,

148
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:25,490
but this is things like squamous cell carcinoma versus adenocarcinomas or something like ovarian cancer.

149
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:30,170
You have like clear cell for lung cancer, you have small cell and non-small cell.

150
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:40,280
These types histology can be very important for specific subtypes in terms, especially for things like survival, but also incidents.

151
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:49,700
And sometimes you have like certain races have higher incidence of certain subtypes versus others or have certain subtypes others.

152
00:17:50,130 --> 00:18:00,080
So my goal as for the for your cancer analysis will be to pick a cancer that has at least two subtypes of interest.

153
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:09,120
So here I subset to only squamous cell and I've picked some sites for head of.

154
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:19,219
Okay. So if I go now to my table tab, we'll come back to this in a second.

155
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:22,970
But the first thing we're going to do is we're going to create our own variables.

156
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:28,310
So not all variables we don't use.

157
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:34,580
All of the variables that's here has sometimes had extra information or we want to subset from them.

158
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:40,370
So that's very new here. So first, we're going to get rid of a we're going to edit our year of diagnosis variable.

159
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:47,870
So if you click on your diagnosis, it's going to pop up the dictionary and I'm going to create a new one based on your diagnosis.

160
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:54,380
I'm going to rename your diagnosis to your diagnosis with that age range.

161
00:18:54,710 --> 00:19:01,130
And basically I just want to get rid of this grouping of 1975 to 2019 because I actually want my incidence to

162
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:06,880
be over years and not to have this like additional information where it's just like the whole blob of cancers.

163
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:11,960
I'm just trying to make my life simpler for when I get all the data, I'll put it.

164
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:18,170
So I'm going to delete that so that the values that are only 1975 to 2019,

165
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:24,470
once I've done that, I have my new variable shows up here under user defined,

166
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:32,720
and I'm also going to create a new variable to distinguish between my subtypes, which are going to be subsets of cancer.

167
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:44,360
So based on the primary site, I'm going to create these groupings and each grouping is going to have different combinations of the primary sites.

168
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:51,620
So things that are HPV related include pharynx, higher form, sinus and so on and so forth,

169
00:19:53,990 --> 00:20:02,090
whereas HPV unrelated include hypo pharynx and some other things other than my head.

170
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:08,780
I don't remember. You may be asking how do I know what the ICD codes are for my cancer?

171
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:14,390
It's usually pretty standard to look it up in the literature and that also be part of the lab.

172
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:25,990
So the table is going to tell us how serious are going to output the data, which combinations of groups it's going to tell us about.

173
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:31,330
So I'm going to have a different page for race, sex and for the next websites.

174
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:38,440
So it's going to give me all combinations of race, sex and subtype as well as the all three of them.

175
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:46,000
And I want each row in that table to be my year of diagnosis variable without range was just going to be single years.

176
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:58,030
Then I'm going to hit my lightning bolt execute and this is what I get that I will ignore the stuff on the left side.

177
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:08,260
This is what you get. You get this matrix here. And so this is the matrix for all races, men and women, HPV related only.

178
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:12,670
So each year I have the number of cancers and the population.

179
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,540
So I have that population based up here.

180
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:19,630
I can change. I can go to my dropdown menu and pick different tables.

181
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:30,970
Okay. It's spitting out all of these kind of like awkward, like spreadsheets in the software.

182
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:35,610
You can copy and paste them into Excel, but the better thing to do is to export them.

183
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:44,040
So if I go in and matrix export them as a text file, there's a couple of different options.

184
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:50,990
Um, if we're going to work with the data in R, which we're going to do for incidents, I like to work with the CSP defaults.

185
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:55,590
So that's if we're going to do want to do something different when we do a joint point next week.

186
00:21:56,260 --> 00:22:00,510
Um, but that's what we're going to do for this first.

187
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:09,370
Okay. This is just FBI from me to point of view for now.

188
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:14,440
Or if you want to get ahead of things, you could just explore and think about ways.

189
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:21,370
Okay. So now that I have the data, what can I do with it? So we can.

190
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:25,780
This is a for example, how I got the data that you used in Lab one.

191
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:34,390
So Lab one week we've been plotted age adjusted incidence by combinations of race and sex.

192
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:41,080
So we saw that four that men had higher issues related to cancer than women.

193
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:52,750
And in particular, we see a large increase for men in the last couple of decades overall for HPV, unrelated here in the middle.

194
00:22:53,410 --> 00:23:00,820
Again, men have higher rates, but the rates are kind of coming down as rates of smoking in particular.

195
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,340
But also to some extent, alcohol use.

196
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:13,570
This is oral tongue, which is a very specific sign of cancer that tends to have a very different kind of etiology than the other two.

197
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:21,050
And there's some thought that maybe that there's like a viral ideology here, but it's not really well understood.

198
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:26,960
But I pulled them out separately because it doesn't really belong with necessarily either of the authors.

199
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:38,070
Okay. So this is the interactive portion of today's class.

200
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:44,970
How do you get access to here? So the first thing you need is an ER raikkonen's I.D.

201
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,729
So some of you may already have in the area comments I.D. if you are involved

202
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:55,650
in research for the area commons is at NIH this National Institute of Health.

203
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:05,940
Way of like being aware of you. If you don't already have one, you need to register for an account with you again.

204
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,250
And you can do that by clicking on this link.

205
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:16,110
And I think it's basically just you put your name, you need name into your Google form and then like in a couple of minutes they just do it for you.

206
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:26,640
That's my hope and expectation. If that doesn't happen, we will follow up once you have your ERA comments and you can request access for us here,

207
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:31,410
here, and I want you to do this as soon as possible, just in case there are any issues.

208
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:37,019
And I know it takes a couple of days sometimes to get back to us.

209
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:40,320
So I want to make sure that we're not, like, scrambling.

210
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:45,090
Um, if for some reason you don't have access to us here by Monday, we'll just,

211
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,690
you know, partner with you, with somebody that does something, make it work.

212
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:57,450
So I'll come back to that in a second. Just to finish up again next week, we're going to meet in 2615 Crossroads.

213
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:01,890
What you'll be doing is picking a cancer of interest to think about this. In the meantime,

214
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:09,780
is there a cancer site that you're particularly interested in as part of the lab so you don't necessarily need to do it ahead of time,

215
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:16,050
though it does may help its literature search for cancer incidence,

216
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:22,440
and the goal is largely in addition to just sort of understanding the epidemiology of that from a basic sense,

217
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:28,590
determining the ICD codes for primary site and appropriate site histology codes

218
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:33,390
and a relevant set of some sites that could definitely help you with that.

219
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:41,280
Um, but you can start thinking about it and then it's going to be a fairly simple lab other than that, not as involved as like box two and three.

220
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:45,870
It's literally going to be like go through the steps that we did in the lecture

221
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:51,570
today for your cancer and then plot it using the same plot as lecture one.

222
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:58,770
Um, I guess if you had a knack, it will also work on a Windows emulator.

223
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:05,190
If that's a thing that you have enough to do, that's like the steps that you just showed before, if we wouldn't actually be doing that.

224
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:11,010
Yes. Um, because yes.

225
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:21,390
So the one thing I didn't mention, so Cyr is just the software you need to log into it in order to have access to the databases.

226
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:33,480
And this is the steps for getting access to the databases. It's not enough to just download the program any other questions today.

227
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:44,270
Otherwise, they're mostly going to keep working on Lab three and also making sure that you had your ERP Commons ID and access to Sierra.

228
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,730
You don't have any more questions. I will stop there.
