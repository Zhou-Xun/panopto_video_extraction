1
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,500
Okay. Good afternoon everyone. And try to see you are here.

2
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,670
And I have four, three, four students.

3
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:32,700
Give me your last minutes or different. You know the reason of all relate to health some of the last minutes of some of yours.

4
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:44,060
You know, respiratory tract infection. So I hope you were stay healthy and it's getting to the end of the semester.

5
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:53,569
Everyone may not sleep, love. That could also make you more prone to infection.

6
00:00:53,570 --> 00:01:07,200
So if I come here and listen to your last stage of this study or last your time of the semester easier.

7
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:20,750
But know, I also want to say once again, since I was The Apprentice, I'm pretty simple to workshop into the symposium today.

8
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:33,050
So if I haven't to respond to any email in the last couple of days, I also would be, before I work it back to you after the class today.

9
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:37,400
So I'm quite up with all that. That's another thing.

10
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:52,130
And then one of the more important and I think you probably want to hear about the posting of floor assignments greeting.

11
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:59,809
I think overall everyone from your work, I can see you to the extent of the learning experience.

12
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:14,120
I'm actually trying to put all together the submit the studies sample in one big combined file that will be shared with everyone so that you have,

13
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:23,060
you know, all the different work. So this is also a good contribution participation.

14
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:27,440
Everyone contributes to the learning of the course.

15
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:40,729
But I, Ryan, I was trying to do that I thought was very straightforward because I have a PDF professional version of the PDA, a PDF editing software.

16
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:52,670
I went to Harvard School and there were some files submitted, had some issue, so I got stop multiple times.

17
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:58,190
Now I turn that project to one of the administrative assistant or our department.

18
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:03,770
Help me to troubleshoot. Once that's done it, it would be posted.

19
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:16,450
And for some of you who didn't probably pay close attention to the assignment instructions,

20
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:31,070
I didn't submit the PDF file or use the unpublished study you may have for only 10% less than that one was.

21
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:42,740
In theory, you really following instruction. You're supposed to submit the PDF file or not use an analogy back off or clinical

22
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:47,930
trials files because those are ongoing and the study design can also be changed.

23
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:52,230
You don't necessarily have a result for summing up them.

24
00:03:52,670 --> 00:04:00,290
So that's why I asked some of the published studies that's just generous.

25
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:07,129
And one of the I had some notes for everyone's work.

26
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:16,640
If anyone want to discuss the you know what you didn't do well, it didn't address well.

27
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:28,010
I wish to discuss I'm happy to see your comment of his hour or you can schedule special session with me to go through.

28
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:37,940
But I didn't really spend time. I didn't have time to write the individual comments to send back.

29
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:45,980
But I do have to record notes for every office and there's no standard, you know?

30
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:55,190
Component studies are different, but once that's clear from this assignment,

31
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:02,420
you will see a wide range of study design variation, especially for phase one.

32
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:16,280
So I think that's great. You have full exposure to the wide range of the clinical trials and of course some the I think for

33
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:26,020
this segment it's really trying to get everyone to appreciate the diverse possible study design.

34
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:29,960
So when it comes to study design, once there is.

35
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:40,700
Studies emphasize that what kind of population important and location is also important.

36
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:45,200
These are some critical and how many doses of difference is specific.

37
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:54,450
So it's just to a good extent and the standard knowledge about priorities.

38
00:05:54,830 --> 00:06:00,650
But I think overall, I was really pleased to see that white readership for collection.

39
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,400
I think you would like to have a copy, but I apologize.

40
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:17,840
So I just listened to what the iconic Christian group has promised to assist and just like to give back to you,

41
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:27,470
whether about the preparation for the presentation, which will be next week, right?

42
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,580
This is next week, 18th. Yeah.

43
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,300
So have you guys start to work on that?

44
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:43,850
Yes. Yes. I want to say more as everyone be involved doing something already.

45
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:57,620
Yeah. Okay, good. You know, every year that's presentation was always marked as one of the most enjoyable events,

46
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:11,870
and the people really enjoy the participation in a significant way to share your findings to all the investigations.

47
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:22,310
So I hope I'm going to make a list of I think the three or four episodes of 513 student may have

48
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:30,560
to go to the epidemiology department for the presentation or I think you need to do that too,

49
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,860
right? You all need to do that. Okay.

50
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,650
So do you do make arrangements with your team so if you are not here or you have

51
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:46,580
managed to schedule your presentation so that you could still participate?

52
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:53,200
Presentation. Okay.

53
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:59,150
And. Oh, yeah. If we, if we had a second session.

54
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:09,710
Well, yeah. Please let me know if you would be able to attend to parts of the presentation here and the what's the arrangement

55
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:22,730
that's so our for certain students you may have to present on behalf of your team also that's also includes.

56
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:26,570
Um, if it affects the question I'm sure you will forgot regards.

57
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:36,530
But I thought I would take advantage of the last the cross before the presentation to talk about that's a little bit.

58
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:49,030
All right. So let's talk about today's topic HIV, AIDS, drugs, where we are before now.

59
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:59,780
How has even for those who have or taken any class, uh, prior to this class where you discussed the HIV.

60
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:09,400
Pretty much everyone. Jack, we don't have any costs where you talk about HIV.

61
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:19,420
Yeah. Okay. So, um, how many of you do have the token?

62
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:30,130
Um, I would think that from basic public, um, sarcasm or some coverage.

63
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:34,000
And so one major. Even your pencil physiology class.

64
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:44,470
Right. Yeah. So then we will reveal some of the contents here then then have come to.

65
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:49,540
And after that we're talking about the HIV vaccine.

66
00:09:49,720 --> 00:10:03,250
But why do we want to understand all these points like the people who are HIV patients with HIV biology, GoPro, HIV molecular epidemiology?

67
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:10,930
This has something to do with one of the questions I asked you earlier and to develop, uh,

68
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:21,790
what's the of your research, what these are the disciplines that are involved in vaccine development.

69
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:35,799
Clear this out and, and kind of show know what knowledge would be one of the relevant to that so we need to kids and for the development

70
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:49,210
of vaccines and the HIV vaccine development is particularly challenging for one very important biological features.

71
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:56,050
What is that? And you can start to think about how we can get there.

72
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:56,750
So absolute. So it's not so.

73
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:15,170
All right. So. Evolution of HIV AIDS epidemic.

74
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,600
We want to know where we are, this HIV evolution.

75
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:30,020
Also, you know, relate to discuss this, relate to we always talk do we need a vaccine?

76
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,790
We need more treatment and we need both.

77
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:40,549
So this has relevance and to HIV pathogenesis.

78
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:43,400
We want to understand how it causes diseases.

79
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:55,790
And you can target some mechanism that's causing these disease to develop a vaccine and the biology financially and the molecular epidemiology.

80
00:12:56,030 --> 00:13:06,920
Why it's important is because we have repeated emphasized this concept genetic diversity of cancer kill.

81
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,799
You all have suffered from COVID 19 vaccine.

82
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:22,560
Now we have to do new vibrant vaccine to do the to get the, you know, cover the defense financing violence.

83
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:29,510
Then at the end of work, have a discussion about HIV vaccine development.

84
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:39,340
So HIV AIDS, you all have learned I'm sure this slides is very familiar to everybody, probably the most of the media.

85
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:43,580
Basically, what is the HIV virus? What is the cause?

86
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:54,740
When we see AIDS, it's really the virus that has caused the significance of passive pathology in humans.

87
00:13:55,280 --> 00:14:02,870
Most significant indication is the compromised immunity.

88
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:15,950
So it's a pattern immune system, weakening a person's immunity and increasing the person's vulnerability to other infection and the diseases.

89
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:24,080
So it's not just the infection for long time. We know HIV course, you know, other opportunities,

90
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:34,270
the infection that's now there have been increased emphasize and it's a link with cancer HIV related.

91
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:42,380
The cancers are a very interesting area of research supported encouraged by knowledge.

92
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:53,990
So you definitely have laboratory results showing the significance of separation of the host, the immunity.

93
00:14:54,830 --> 00:15:12,590
As a result, you have all these outcomes one HIV virus or AIDS as the importance of medical public health problem was first reported.

94
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:21,680
You remember the early story about the old epidemic of HIV?

95
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:27,920
I know you want to see this movie on it.

96
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:35,220
That's in 381 about how when it first started happening was only.

97
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:45,600
It really was considered when they were thinking about it and also how the government was treating it that way.

98
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,770
And they were being very secretive with their research and treatment options and.

99
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:54,740
Became really desperate to try to find a treatment for it.

100
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:59,000
And at times they were even trying things that weren't even approved.

101
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:05,450
That's 1981. Yeah.

102
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:08,970
1981. More than 40 years.

103
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:16,980
Right. So you remember the first report that came out is the CDC.

104
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:37,490
A main topic of Morbidity and Mortality Weekly report this is CDC is a publication that's really that and others of.

105
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:48,870
Any new outbreak important emerging infections as well as the UN report you see is a trend.

106
00:16:49,390 --> 00:17:00,340
This is one of the CDC surveillance results oriented the disease outbreak or.

107
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:06,860
You're. You're so HIV positive.

108
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:12,900
So that's a disease. Now it's become a consequence.

109
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:20,750
It's tangible consequences. It's no longer a you know, it's a disease.

110
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:37,440
As in the past, as I just say, a lot of the activities that reports and the, you know, fear the October 19, May 1981.

111
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:47,520
That's the first to report reported the five cases of person with pneumocystis pneumonia.

112
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:53,260
Apparently, it's an infection in Los Angeles, California.

113
00:17:53,280 --> 00:18:00,990
That's the first report came out of the WPA in June 1981.

114
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:19,380
And this report had to have a global effort that's led to the identification of the HIV virus and all that and the hands watching for AIDS.

115
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,980
And then in less than 40 years,

116
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:40,170
HIV AIDS has been transformed from a past fatal disease to a manageable chronic year is due to ground breaking research,

117
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:52,320
basic biology of the HIV virus and to human immunology, immunology and to human HIV pathogenesis.

118
00:18:52,620 --> 00:19:01,580
Basically studying the mechanism, which is, of course, the development of safe and effective antiretrovirals.

119
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:13,380
But then there is also a significant contribution by lung pharmaceutical intervention.

120
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:26,300
And, you know, we just heard from the high risk population have been identified through epidemiological studies,

121
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:32,760
then stop transmission, different things, including the use of condoms.

122
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:42,830
Dr. Horton actually also uses that as an example in this lecture a lot.

123
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:58,710
I think we're still talking about that. So this really has made a huge impact and I know we're trying to do something to this country.

124
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:02,370
So how has the HIV epidemic evolved?

125
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:14,910
Oh, well, I'm thankful here. Over the last four and more than four decades, I was thinking to see since 1981, and then I made it and it's a trend.

126
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:21,090
So share your thoughts how it has been changed over time.

127
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:29,130
You can based on your general knowledge or anything you have learned from your classes.

128
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:32,980
I think for you.

129
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,870
When you see how it can change, you typically see.

130
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:10,240
Yeah. And that kind of rate has decreased.

131
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:23,040
More effective treatments. It is fixed.

132
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:41,129
You know, so much good. Yeah.

133
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:43,530
There is a wider range of activity.

134
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:58,860
Uh, what you have shown here is more from, you know, better understanding the thesis and also what's important for making it happen.

135
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:04,320
Yeah. And the world, in terms of surveillance, that's great. Or these are relevant.

136
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:10,760
Mm hmm. Still heavily affects some populations of population.

137
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:24,960
Yeah women's stories auto and we just to come actually poppy properties come out now in.

138
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:36,390
Infectious disease, the American Society of Infectious Diseases, the Journal called the Open Forum of Infectious Diseases.

139
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:42,739
It's about women. Such a study.

140
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:47,520
If you are interested in you can look at so.

141
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:58,650
Currently I have an iPhone. My students are doing a study using some data that has to show actually women have

142
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:07,650
more access and are more likely to have received HIV treatment than male whites.

143
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:19,139
That I could share some thoughts on that they are less case of becoming AIDS doesn't see so it's no longer a fatal disease or going to AIDS.

144
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:22,830
AIDS therefore is you know, you comfort. Good.

145
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:29,580
Thank you for all these contributions to the discussion.

146
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:36,430
I also have a little highlights about what has happened since.

147
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,940
One of them is like some of the comments.

148
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:47,070
If you show its gratitude epidemiologically,

149
00:23:47,940 --> 00:24:09,690
you can see what I highlighted here is a gradual decrease in the number of new HIV infection has been absorbed since it is peak 1999 years per year,

150
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:15,060
or this is some precursor of the same x axis.

151
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:23,390
So since the peak, the gradual decrease in the number of new HIV infections.

152
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:29,350
So that's I think another observation here.

153
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:40,870
This is from 1904, the Disease Burden Research, which is located in University of Washington.

154
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:47,799
If you are interested in looking at the disease, epidemiological transition of the disease,

155
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:52,110
the global burden of all kind of disease, this is an excellent.

156
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:57,860
So another point I think we've seen the process.

157
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:10,100
Some of what you have for the upcoming that's the you know, the best quarterback HIV positive reviews as you can see from here,

158
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:29,660
you know, to some of the critics who say that there's this 1.95 minute and to date not the more recently 2017.

159
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:36,100
That's. Watch a review of what happened on this night.

160
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:41,720
So it's a cop. That's reduction.

161
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,590
There's also gender disparity, of course, all of these.

162
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:55,230
You can see some of the increase in global average sperm coverage.

163
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:59,870
You have a place, I should add, this, which is.

164
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:03,900
I think so.

165
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:10,080
Well, Christine, the total number of people, you know, with HIV.

166
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:14,490
So this means really people living longer.

167
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
HIV infection no longer cure people. Of course,

168
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:26,979
this also means that they are more vulnerable population or development where you have

169
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:36,510
food increased the immunocompromised population with the potential to develop compromised.

170
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:45,830
Then you can expect or other conditions really to come from you unit you could think.

171
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:55,080
So it's progress. It's also challenging what has happened with HIV epidemic.

172
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:58,870
But it's it reflects a lot of progress.

173
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:12,390
At the same time, it also presents new challenges because we have a larger pool of people with the potential to experience compromised,

174
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:19,170
immune, to be more prone to infection and other chronic disease.

175
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:27,630
I'm going to teach a course the link between infectious diseases, chronic disease.

176
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:32,430
So you can see this is really a good example and that's important.

177
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:43,950
So this is the United Nations AIDS data, 2021 epidemiological estimates, person to patient they have.

178
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:51,870
If you are interested in HIV epidemic, then you should visit, say, United, the National AIDS Program's website.

179
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,290
They had a very informative presentation.

180
00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:03,560
So what's the this shows you this yellow point that's not here.

181
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:09,630
This is a topic this is a what for actually estimated to have high.

182
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:17,700
So what's this a very good. What's this think of?

183
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:31,580
Yeah. Still having to the goal. There is a gap between the.

184
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,880
You know, what's actually able to the Gulf.

185
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,550
And let me ask you another question.

186
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:56,300
If giving HIV treatment and access to antiretroviral treatment has been very successful in terms of prolongs people's life.

187
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:09,990
If we're not for completely clear the virus in the body and but it's a that still holds the virus from replication,

188
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:22,290
which ultimately of course, will reduce the risk for develop to acquire with the.

189
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,250
Um. Immune come back.

190
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:33,720
But why do we still need the vaccine?

191
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:37,350
HIV vaccine development is a big effort.

192
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:48,510
If we have these antiretrovirals, which is seems to have made a significant contribution to the reduction of infection.

193
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:59,190
Well, not really reduction in infection, but it's really a key for HIV infected people living longer,

194
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:13,500
not getting to the clinic and immune compromised or the conditions as a result of HIV replication.

195
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,860
Why do we still need the vaccine?

196
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:24,390
Just because vaccines are a form of primary prevention, so it makes it more effective.

197
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:32,350
In the first place. Like, for example, if you are infected with HIV, if, first of all, it presents a.

198
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:43,580
Potentially the high cost of all of those medications, but it also makes it so difficult to that medication regimen.

199
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:49,810
There's none you could become famous for. You could become a serial killer, then you're compromised.

200
00:30:50,680 --> 00:31:00,400
So if there is any further back up in life or any financial or physical or whatnot, you can do well in that treatment program.

201
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:06,790
Better to. Yeah.

202
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:13,200
That's a good show. Thank you. I think it's a very.

203
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:22,350
And after that you very rarely have infected.

204
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:28,040
And you pretty much have. Great.

205
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:53,550
In the beginning, we're very aware of. Right. Good.

206
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:56,840
Thank you. And your other question.

207
00:31:57,060 --> 00:32:01,530
I think you two have covered a lot. Yeah.

208
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:07,410
And also with parsley from the fetus.

209
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:15,990
And so, if anything, you're just preventing the prevention or you're just preventing transmission.

210
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:23,040
And also because pregnant women are obviously susceptible to different things.

211
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:28,480
And also it's harder to treat pregnant women because not every drug is okay for pregnant women.

212
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:33,910
Sure. Thank you. You think? Probably.

213
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:38,330
Yeah, for a number of reasons, as we have heard.

214
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:46,600
We need the vaccine despite the availability of antiretroviral treatment.

215
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:50,910
When you come to treatment. Preventive treatment?

216
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:55,450
Of course it has. Of course. It also has. Not just a financial cause.

217
00:32:56,020 --> 00:33:07,060
HIV antiretroviral treatment actually also conflict to hasten the impact TB treatment.

218
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:13,380
And so treatment doesn't completely.

219
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:18,730
If it's a focus on people already infected.

220
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:22,540
Right. And we want to reduce the infection.

221
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:30,580
And there are a lot of pharmaceutical intervention, but that's not enough.

222
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:45,100
So we still hope would because what we have here is so we have we in fact, we had two people got HIV infection already infected.

223
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:57,670
And so our to enter for treatment, it's really focused on this with this group of people.

224
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:01,450
But what about the here we have like women.

225
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:08,240
This is the time. Back to the people.

226
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:23,140
So we have more. Currently we have some public health intervention to to give these people to not get people to these.

227
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:35,010
But this could be like the health behavior related intervention and the like.

228
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:42,790
If you have a vaccine, you could reduce this risk to the people out of these,

229
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:50,020
then you would not have to deal with all the issues like we just revealed five different.

230
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:58,000
And the treatments could have conflicts with other major infectious disease treatment.

231
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:02,080
It could also, you know, there are some populations.

232
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:11,890
I'm more prone to some side effects of the impact of cooking and the more expensive stuff.

233
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:21,760
So here we need to vaccinate. Vaccine and some public health.

234
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:29,089
I would say public has enough public health related information.

235
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:40,490
So vaccine, it's because this is the ultimate the control this disease and especially we have like fat here.

236
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:55,910
That means our lung pharmaceutical lung PACs and really the intervention worked while we simply to work look at it it's suppose states

237
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:12,270
decline this means our public health interventions are working but it's not really allowed and so we still need to develop vaccine.

238
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:20,840
Here's some statistics. You can find the WTO or United Nations AIDS.

239
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:26,710
We have use of this data source quite a lot to one of our student and I every

240
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:36,350
student had a paper under review that basically a look at the trends of HIV and TB.

241
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:42,639
Oh, these two. Yeah. Especially when mainly come as I say, this two.

242
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,790
Apparently we are doing some study in Zimbabwe.

243
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:52,450
More than 50% of the children TB patients are co-infected by HIV.

244
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:59,970
So if you think about this is a conflict between the treatment and then having our vaccine

245
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:09,909
reduce the people who need to have this treatment that will assist the TB treatment.

246
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:22,510
Correct. So if I ask you a question later and why we still need the HIV vaccine, I hope to you we're used to what our students to have showed.

247
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:26,020
And I was saying and then understand.

248
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:32,360
So next then I will do like, okay, now query again.

249
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:39,390
And how does HIV cause AIDS acquired immunodeficiency syndrome?

250
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:43,570
Basically it's become disease, as you just say.

251
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:47,620
It's not a real one infected and this sort of developed aids.

252
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:55,900
So then what's the mechanism we know compromise, immunity and what are the mechanisms difference?

253
00:37:55,900 --> 00:38:09,590
And that kind of that's. How did that come about?

254
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:16,430
For those of you who haven't taken HIV virology class, you must know this more than.

255
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:29,730
It's targeting cancer. Killington sells great.

256
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:37,080
Large amounts of self feces, gas exposure.

257
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:48,130
These are all immune function. Oh, yeah, we do it all the time.

258
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:55,270
Process that requires CD4 count and a certain number of hair.

259
00:38:55,870 --> 00:39:03,970
So it looks like T-cells and cytokines be considered by many of you.

260
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:14,230
So now let's take. Um. Okay. Raccoons are more susceptible to disease because we can get T-cells.

261
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:21,420
Okay. Good.

262
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:27,210
Thanks to everyone's contribution. HIV Pathogenesis.

263
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:39,480
One basic impact is PASSO Artes activates the immune system and what mechanism?

264
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:45,180
Healing immune cells directly. You mentioned the T-cells.

265
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:48,420
This is definitely one function.

266
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:58,860
Then you also cause cells suicide and also caused the deaths of innocent bystanders.

267
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:06,060
So this would not. When we see innocent bystanders, it means those who didn't have HIV.

268
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:17,430
Concurrent HIV virus destruction of immune precursor cells where immune precursor cells are generated.

269
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:24,060
Remember when we're talking about organs of the immune system?

270
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:37,430
Bone marrow. Bone marrow and this. So these are the places where you have HIV.

271
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:48,230
Could a hand in bone marrow like pulling. So also, is it also a killer fighting system or is it just.

272
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:58,660
There are other things, too, but it is one where it's a state of.

273
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:03,780
Okay. Yeah.

274
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:06,710
Clearly immuno cells director everyone.

275
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:21,730
Most of our cancers have attached to these basically killing as directed basically CD4 T cells infected with HIV compounds.

276
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:25,100
HIV may be killed a lot. How will that happen?

277
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:32,510
Well, a large amount of virus is produced and both parts are out from the cell surface.

278
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:47,930
And you can see this is some electronic map of the like graph of HIV and this virus, which it's a part of the cell surface that destroys the cells.

279
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:54,590
So this is cells that's actually being infected by this virus.

280
00:41:55,480 --> 00:42:01,670
Um, another mechanism abuses sales of HIV infected cells.

281
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:15,370
And so, you know, up to this is it's a mechanism host use to destroy mutant cells and functions.

282
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:24,170
It's a mechanism of the host to use to make healthy cells in the body.

283
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:33,320
But when the regulation of cells, machinery and the functions become grossly distorted because of HIV replication,

284
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:41,910
the infected cells may commit suicide by a process of known as the programed cell death or after a process.

285
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:53,270
So it's important the biological function of the to maintain healthy, normal cells that destroy, for example,

286
00:42:53,270 --> 00:43:04,310
cancer, pre-cancerous cells that perhaps then when HIV infected our immune cells, this cell will commit suicide.

287
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:15,080
There's evidence that up to this occurs. It occurs most frequently in the bloodstream and lymph nodes of people infected with HIV.

288
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:22,250
Another mechanism that's of innocent bystander cells.

289
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:28,810
What's the vice cancer cells? Cells that are not infected with HIV may also die.

290
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:32,390
And so a direct result of the effects of HIV infection.

291
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:41,030
How this works is how what's the mechanism for these basically antibody dependent cytotoxicity,

292
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:49,970
which may bind to the cell surface, making it appear as if the cells is infected.

293
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:59,900
Even HIV didn't go into the cells, but if we saw on the surface it could market as infected.

294
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:12,770
The antibody of course, where it interacts with HIV on the surface that's it kills sales may be 60 killer T cells

295
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:22,610
that's the host cause there's this pencil pattern and the cell surface then our host,

296
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:29,600
the killer T cells may mistakenly destroys the cells.

297
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:42,460
So in a way, HIV mark normal cells and the CD8 cells, it's what we call the killer T cells basically, you know,

298
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:50,770
destroy uninfected, which actually is the same as the first point because some HIV enveloped proteins.

299
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:58,120
Another interesting is that they are some resemblance to certain molecules and CD4 t cells.

300
00:44:58,130 --> 00:45:04,070
The body's immune response may mistakenly damage the cells.

301
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,310
This is very important because, you know, in drug development,

302
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:14,389
same for vaccine development you whatever targets you actually you want to to

303
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:26,000
study the homologs of the pathogen targets and human cells or human antigens so

304
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:36,350
that for the vaccine or the immunity induced the vaccine targeting and the pathogen

305
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:43,700
components that have some homologous to human or the not a pack of forces.

306
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:56,930
In fact, this is particularly looked at and I think in vaccine you want to say that these two uninfected cells may undergo,

307
00:45:56,930 --> 00:46:03,080
of course, the HIV envelope. Along or went back to antibodies.

308
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:07,900
Sometimes sends an inappropriate signal to CD4+ t cells.

309
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:13,930
This can cause the cell to undergo appearances, even not practice.

310
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:24,190
Then destruction of immune precursor destroys the precursor cells that later mature into cells

311
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:35,170
because each bone marrow has been found to be a niche for persistence of HIV in the body.

312
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:42,850
So that's also where the precursor was developed.

313
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:57,160
It was produced, as we discussed, the early bone marrow where the precursor so immune cells generated, so they became mature in surplus.

314
00:46:58,170 --> 00:47:01,430
So that's the.

315
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:16,720
Pathogenesis and. Any questions of our constituents compromise immunity and through this mechanism.

316
00:47:16,810 --> 00:47:20,770
Okay. So biology, let me ask you a question.

317
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:29,290
I'm not too poor now. I didn't have time to generate a lot of the question that came back from the symposium.

318
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:33,670
But the ones that I want to ask you is why?

319
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:40,030
You know, when I put that companies that hold school, there's always the relevance,

320
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:45,940
the relevance to vaccine development, which is the focus of this course.

321
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:51,190
So what's the the major biological characteristics of HIV?

322
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:57,700
That presents a major challenge to HIV vaccine.

323
00:48:00,770 --> 00:48:22,209
We know from our. In fact, this slide tells you there's some HIV biology and of course, there are many other characters,

324
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:28,280
but I'm focusing on those with implications for vaccine development.

325
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:36,320
Okay. So by the way, if I ask some questions, sometimes you can find my answer.

326
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:43,630
So it represents a genetically diverse population of virus.

327
00:48:43,810 --> 00:48:51,790
This super high genetic diversity presents a major challenge to HIV vaccine development.

328
00:48:53,410 --> 00:49:03,070
The virus was discovered a couple of years after the first case report and a sufficient variation in DNA sequence.

329
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:10,210
BLANKLEY Is this important?

330
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:20,410
Because it's this means we need to have a distinct HIV vaccine for each group.

331
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:25,600
I heard you before the you know, the new technology.

332
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:32,020
That's Edison. Dr. Owen and Edison all talked about this.

333
00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:43,030
It's almost unthinkable that today, with a synthetic vaccinology system and all the bioinformatic tools,

334
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:49,300
we are better positioned for that paper to do the vaccine development.

335
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:53,770
So that's this very important.

336
00:49:54,460 --> 00:50:00,400
And then HIV, too, which it was discovered a little bit later.

337
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:04,450
It's the only cause aids in Western Africa.

338
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:06,550
I hope you are thinking,

339
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:22,900
wondering why somehow some lineage of the pathogen can be so successful and while others seems to be very confined in geographic region.

340
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:31,810
What's the selection? I can tell you another story since I already talked about TB, but they are relevant to this.

341
00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:39,100
I recently read a paper about TB from genetic study and there are seven major

342
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:45,310
lineages have been described for Mycobacterium tuberculosis of this seven lineage.

343
00:50:47,080 --> 00:51:02,980
I think, uh, three, two or three were defined as Asian lineage, while other four identified as modern lineage.

344
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:10,990
Recently there was one very elegant study reported in Nature Communication that says

345
00:51:11,410 --> 00:51:21,700
it's a serious of in vitro animal studies showing all the modern lineage lost one gene.

346
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:39,810
What's the one region of the past which in general and this region also contain some protein of the pantheon that differentiates the.

347
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:47,610
Modern lineage from the ancients lineage is a modern lineage,

348
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:59,640
apparently very successful white offspring and is the ancient one where confined in also Eastern Africa or India.

349
00:52:00,390 --> 00:52:07,050
Asian region limited while as a limited to two for three.

350
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:08,860
So all over the works.

351
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:26,160
So similar in HIV biology you also have these currencies, some like HIV one, HIV two, these two major French have distributed very different HIV one.

352
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:30,360
Basically, they are very distinct.

353
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:42,360
They even don't share the cross-reactivity part of the two virus and then they also differentiate the distribution.

354
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:51,930
I would not go into details, but so some of the surface of protein and the HIV structure at the target of vaccine,

355
00:52:52,800 --> 00:53:04,080
you are not to get any test for that for sure, but for those of you who are interested in, you can look at this basically HIV replication cycle.

356
00:53:04,410 --> 00:53:13,000
You understand its use the host the machinery and it's also once it's a tool allows it will get out.

357
00:53:13,050 --> 00:53:19,440
So it's the first fusion of HIV cells to the host the surface.

358
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:29,970
This is how someone to the bystander innocence of bystanders cells can be mistaken as infected, even just outside.

359
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:44,900
But of course, the winks getting sides into its will and into the host cells where use the host the machinery that's approved to induce some.

360
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:59,760
We see the process which is suicide programs suicides and then we to go allows it where for the surface of the cells that's the direct the killing,

361
00:54:00,690 --> 00:54:14,570
you know, the safety for cells. And then we have all these markers, see the x ptosis t cell where the potency also killed the cells.

362
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:21,120
So and if you don't remember the mechanism, you could look at this,

363
00:54:21,570 --> 00:54:29,880
this picture to understand the my kind of this could be the basis of what is making it.

364
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:45,790
As I just mentioned, the most important feature for biology i b is the diversity of extensive diversity here.

365
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:55,959
But so for vaccine development, molecular epidemiology study defines a financial distribution of four different lineages,

366
00:54:55,960 --> 00:55:02,200
sublimated clades or strains across the different geographical regions.

367
00:55:02,650 --> 00:55:08,530
And they are how much epidemics they are.

368
00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:18,880
Each is separate in nature. This is responsible, has implications for vaccine design, which in which you create your focus.

369
00:55:19,330 --> 00:55:28,000
So look at this a complexity. You know, fairly genetically HIV one is the most widely distributed.

370
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:33,070
We are close to seven virus commensal virus in chimpanzee.

371
00:55:33,070 --> 00:55:39,640
They don't support disease in chimp, but they cause severe disease epidemic in human.

372
00:55:40,150 --> 00:55:55,090
This one can be put into three major groups M and O and the M responsible for the mature couple of global epidemics.

373
00:55:55,990 --> 00:56:02,200
This is the epidemiology study we talk about. Watson these seven these four vaccine people.

374
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:11,860
You can see how each works. This is phylogenetic study molecular epidemiologists reported the where you fall back so which one we

375
00:56:11,870 --> 00:56:19,750
should the focus that right of course is the most broadly distributed or have priority in the exam.

376
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:27,910
And then what's really challenging is this major widely distributed one also classified

377
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:36,700
hence to support the claims and TB record of this particular group as major they meet.

378
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:41,530
Then we also stay within each. Maybe there's supplementary place.

379
00:56:42,130 --> 00:56:49,209
So these are some terminology. Sometimes you might figure out what in so many different terms,

380
00:56:49,210 --> 00:57:02,920
but conceptually it just isn't a highly diverse the with you have branched out in many many lovers you know and when we designed backs

381
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:14,220
of where we should focus should we worry individual strength or should we worried we do supplement or we should worry major news.

382
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:20,380
It depends on the clinical epidemiological relevance of the.

383
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:34,220
So yeah, I use all these examples, I just try to make some points that's actually applied applicable to both passages.

384
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:45,730
So this is then besides those claims, they are also some interplay of recombinant strength isn't complicated.

385
00:57:46,870 --> 00:57:51,880
Yeah, some this is called a circulating recombinant form.

386
00:57:52,240 --> 00:58:01,750
So it's like you have for many many different you start with we have.

387
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:14,290
HIV, too. HIV one and of course, HIV.

388
00:58:14,650 --> 00:58:21,480
It's not what you think. And then you you you become this major group of this,

389
00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:37,740
the three major group aim and o and the reason these you have four different clay with you separate it's a you start off of this career path

390
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:54,520
and just so you can then there's also some recombinant the different clay recombinant form the new circulating recombinant from Austrian.

391
00:58:54,970 --> 00:58:58,450
So this is called forms.

392
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:04,030
Yeah. It's all the term. So it's very complicated.

393
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:12,040
That's a study. This is important. It's not just a study from biology standpoint, from epidemiology.

394
00:59:12,370 --> 00:59:36,250
This slide show you and for how these sense of branched out you know ways of HIV one and all these this really spread out it has a defensive play to

395
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:44,650
all these medicine but then different play also can conform um supports the

396
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:53,020
circulating recombinant form and basically takes a different play together.

397
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:58,960
You don't have to memorize all the branch, but you get the cancer right.

398
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:04,690
And what's important is to say the distribution where the burden of the disease is,

399
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:11,860
what are the major genetic lineage or good clay or circulating form.

400
01:00:12,230 --> 01:00:19,840
So by looking at the global distribution, you can determine if we in sub-Saharan Africa,

401
01:00:19,930 --> 01:00:23,860
we have the highest the burden of disease, what has circulating there?

402
01:00:24,310 --> 01:00:31,530
That's where our focus. Yeah.

403
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:35,180
It's also gets the sense from the coroner, Cody.

404
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:46,290
It's a very sort of population. True population. That's why you want to do good epidemiology monitoring everywhere.

405
01:00:46,870 --> 01:00:51,210
And then next course, you make the ask the person understand this.

406
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:55,350
We will be able to come up with stress, HIV technologies.

407
01:00:55,840 --> 01:01:02,380
I'm sure you have already mentioned these, but they may not be included here.

408
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:13,450
Why is this so, so different? You know, when you look at the HIV sequence, I mean, this it's only nine pages, very small.

409
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:19,000
Puts it in context, give you some comparison. Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

410
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:30,560
It's like a formidable force on some of the genes in mycobacterium tuberculosis.

411
01:01:30,610 --> 01:01:41,710
It's a four MP and. But with HIV virus one nine keep you servers.

412
01:01:42,310 --> 01:01:53,350
But they two so diverse shows 25 to 35% better between place and up to 20 beverages with any giving claim.

413
01:01:53,530 --> 01:01:57,580
That means even it's one plane, it has many different strengths.

414
01:01:57,940 --> 01:02:05,770
There only is, you know, 20% to one fifth of their genetic content of their.

415
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:13,240
This comes each of these survivors comes through a formidable challenge to vaccine development.

416
01:02:14,010 --> 01:02:21,280
This figure, just to show you the mechanism, why it's a high mutation rate.

417
01:02:21,790 --> 01:02:28,250
And that is, you know, because you start to make your mechanism high mutation green.

418
01:02:28,810 --> 01:02:39,490
It's naturally wanting a have this mutation and that because it's a intracellular it meets a different clay made

419
01:02:39,490 --> 01:02:49,620
in the same microscopy they have temporary confirmation process going up this tool course for Asia and then.

420
01:02:51,900 --> 01:03:01,320
Of course, when you come to end this virus for money, it can easily escape from,

421
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:06,960
you know, the immune system because these people are constantly changing the mask.

422
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:11,310
They will not be recovered enough. So that's the challenge.

423
01:03:12,940 --> 01:03:25,360
When? HIV, too, just a little bit of closely related to different species of virus of course and different it's common.

424
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:35,260
So virus in a lot of human primate species less virulent, geographically linked with Africa.

425
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:47,320
This is a global distribution. I don't need to memorize, but to just appreciate the variation in distribution here again.

426
01:03:47,350 --> 01:03:54,220
Similarly, just looking out of the corner, you can see how different from region to region.

427
01:03:55,180 --> 01:04:04,180
And another importance antibody response to envelope protein in HIV infection is very complex.

428
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:11,470
So one of the strategy, it's a strength specific when you has so many different strengths.

429
01:04:12,190 --> 01:04:22,850
If we saw strains specific or clade specific, if you were to develop against one type, you would analysis of the epidemic but another.

430
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:29,700
And by understanding which are the predominant CRE strain population.

431
01:04:30,190 --> 01:04:34,750
That's that's the help but it's very complicated.

432
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:38,900
There are different kinds of antibodies can be induced by HIV.

433
01:04:39,730 --> 01:04:44,469
Why is building a binding but not neutralizing this?

434
01:04:44,470 --> 01:04:56,910
We're not comfortable. HIV is if they could even, you know, occupy some a people and a strength specific.

435
01:04:57,160 --> 01:05:03,460
It's very effective for particular strength if we smash.

436
01:05:04,030 --> 01:05:08,950
But what's really ideal is this a broadly neutralizing response.

437
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:18,820
So one subclass of antibodies can neutralize different, diverse, diverse.

438
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:24,010
So this is what we want to look for for HIV vaccine development.

439
01:05:26,050 --> 01:05:36,970
Here, it's just some. We can skip this. You can review these now based on the understanding of this biology pathogenesis.

440
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:42,970
I think it's not so difficult to understand HIV vaccine strategy.

441
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:48,190
The ultimate goal, it's a vaccine to prevent HIV infection.

442
01:05:48,220 --> 01:05:51,310
We already talk about why we need to vaccinate.

443
01:05:51,310 --> 01:05:55,780
Right. And then infection.

444
01:05:55,930 --> 01:06:01,230
We also talk about it kind of provides complete protection against infection.

445
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:03,850
It could also provide protection.

446
01:06:05,260 --> 01:06:15,220
This packet on disease vaccine that could significantly alter the course of disease and the infection of people infected with HIV.

447
01:06:15,550 --> 01:06:21,940
When you reduce the severity of the disease, that it means less virus growth.

448
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:25,570
And then this individual, of course, would be less infectious.

449
01:06:26,290 --> 01:06:29,530
So this is the overall HIV goal.

450
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:36,100
So if I ask you HIV go, you want to think about the different aspects.

451
01:06:36,730 --> 01:06:42,220
Don't see perhaps I can see infection.

452
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:50,050
You can also protect against severe, acute, highly infectious disease.

453
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:55,600
And then there's the specific objectives to achieve that goal.

454
01:06:55,780 --> 01:07:04,120
It's like when you write out grant proposal your head over ultimate goal, then you have a specific aim how you can develop that vaccine.

455
01:07:04,330 --> 01:07:12,370
You have to have some specific a target once a stop of viral entry into the cells and interrupt the

456
01:07:12,370 --> 01:07:19,080
viral replication so that the broadcasting of the virus from the initial site of the infection,

457
01:07:19,090 --> 01:07:23,680
you want to limit the entrance, prevent to spread to another person.

458
01:07:24,190 --> 01:07:28,000
So there are multiple, specific objectives.

459
01:07:29,060 --> 01:07:41,620
And of course, very importantly, giving the diversity, giving this place specific antibodies response you want is against all subtypes.

460
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:45,429
Be simple to be inexpensive.

461
01:07:45,430 --> 01:07:52,660
These are specific objectives, understanding the difference between objectives and the goals.

462
01:07:53,290 --> 01:07:57,160
Or you can also say objectives and specific aims.

463
01:07:57,910 --> 01:08:06,940
So the development of basically a two complementary approach ways empiric approach,

464
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:13,840
this relies on observation and experimentation to quickly move back.

465
01:08:13,930 --> 01:08:16,770
And candidates into a human killing trust.

466
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:27,220
Another is a strategic approach that basically designed vaccine candidate based on an understanding of the immune response to HIV infection.

467
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:34,710
So this is the base on which you design. Another is really experimental approach.

468
01:08:35,980 --> 01:08:51,040
I gave a wonderful example of the current development, but I do not have time to do this in a way here.

469
01:08:51,070 --> 01:09:07,030
This HIV vaccine development was possibility to develop a proven vaccine rate in the in 2009,

470
01:09:07,030 --> 01:09:14,950
when the results from the larger IPI 144 trial showed for the first time that an investigational

471
01:09:14,950 --> 01:09:23,620
vaccine which could come offer a modest degree of protection against HIV infection today.

472
01:09:24,010 --> 01:09:28,590
And I assure use of allergy and infection and reduce global partners.

473
01:09:28,780 --> 01:09:41,379
Continue to learn from all these trials to modify the vaccine design and then surgical approach.

474
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:51,690
To develop an HIV vaccine based on serial involves establishing understanding of the immune response to HIV infection so that you,

475
01:09:52,300 --> 01:10:02,830
based on those understanding you, you try to develop the vaccine that could deliver induce that kind of immunity,

476
01:10:02,830 --> 01:10:10,060
mostly occurrence of problem neutralizing antibody to address that diversity.

477
01:10:10,660 --> 01:10:18,790
And the research has been focused on multiple areas where pre-clinical research.

478
01:10:19,030 --> 01:10:25,780
Now we use this as the example to review our process of vaccine development.

479
01:10:26,380 --> 01:10:41,920
So basically in both pre-clinical translational research and then a number of approach have been explored.

480
01:10:43,420 --> 01:10:47,020
If you remember the vaccine technology,

481
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:58,450
basically they were saying is is export what we had like a recombinant vaccine and the

482
01:10:58,450 --> 01:11:05,800
genetically engineered vaccine put the HIV gene into plasma and life breakthrough.

483
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:15,549
Some existing pathogenic organism, including BCG, is also now attenuated.

484
01:11:15,550 --> 01:11:25,900
The strain that could the use of for a recombinant genetically engineered vaccine developed and the viral

485
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:35,709
protein or viral peptide vaccine and its use and chemically synthesized the piece of HIV peptides or

486
01:11:35,710 --> 01:11:49,330
protein that's this strong and B-cell response and then creates some HIV virus microparticles that's based

487
01:11:49,330 --> 01:11:57,100
on the ly infectious shows of the HIV envelope protein that's a mimic the outer holds of the virus.

488
01:11:57,220 --> 01:12:05,110
But the lack of inside so were not replicate but these were induced immunity.

489
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:13,930
How then the last two important questions relate in that age so go to develop vaccine

490
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:22,060
is the what approach we can take to address the biodiversity the major trends.

491
01:12:22,540 --> 01:12:31,180
Why is the use of immunity that incorporates a combination of variants of genes or proteins from represent

492
01:12:31,810 --> 01:12:41,500
virus groups and you can have different peptides and made from different representing importance of epitope.

493
01:12:42,790 --> 01:12:47,500
Then there's also research use the hypothetical viral gene sequence.

494
01:12:49,060 --> 01:12:58,740
Basically based on phylogenetic studies, you create a new form of HIV virus that represents the diversity.

495
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:10,230
And then last the constructs of ancestral sequence because and this sequence up

496
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:17,980
upper in the branch where sequence will be shared by everyone offspring rights,

497
01:13:17,990 --> 01:13:31,000
our ancestry. Some major is passed on for generation, while each generation also evolved so that some new genetic accompanies by generation.

498
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:37,740
HIV in animal models for seminal experiments and TV Faizan no idea.

499
01:13:37,810 --> 01:13:46,510
Animal model but long human primate can be useful and the mouse model on the

500
01:13:46,510 --> 01:13:55,659
development of the and this that some areas of NIH research on HIV vaccine

501
01:13:55,660 --> 01:14:08,980
continue to study these clinical trial information to understand the immunity and identify strength to stimulate the broadly neutralizing antibodies.

502
01:14:09,490 --> 01:14:22,530
And so you remember that the nature article I cited earlier was they talk about three type of antibody can be generated by HIV virus infection,

503
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:27,760
but we are looking for the last category which is broadly neutralized.

504
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:34,090
Why do we need a broadly neutralizing antibody? Very simple question to causal today.

505
01:14:34,390 --> 01:14:37,900
Why do we need to find the support neutralizing antibody?

506
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:49,640
That's of broad neutralizing antibodies. Yeah.

507
01:14:52,650 --> 01:15:00,830
You only drink? Address that diversity address.

508
01:15:01,750 --> 01:15:08,770
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Broadly, neutralizing antibody basically can respond to all.

509
01:15:09,430 --> 01:15:15,620
And because we have this large diversity, we want that kind of vaccine.

510
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:29,740
Yeah, that's it. Thank you. Summarize the development for safe and effective HIV vaccine remains key to realize a durable end to the HIV pandemic,

511
01:15:30,130 --> 01:15:41,740
because although antiretroviral treatment have extended the life expectancy for HIV infected individual at the same time,

512
01:15:41,740 --> 01:15:50,190
it's great to increase some pool of potential immune compromised individuals in the future.

513
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:58,180
Right? Especially when you get older and you are seeing a significant progress that have been made.

514
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:02,250
And so if you want to look more and you have additional website,

515
01:16:02,530 --> 01:16:09,130
currently there's no licensed HIV vaccine due to many different challenges, at least to this year.

516
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:15,340
Um, yeah. Paradigms approach, empiric approach, and that's all.

517
01:16:17,270 --> 01:16:24,950
I know you have all heard HIV, but lots of different lectures or talks.

518
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:36,830
I hope this and some of you use the knowledge to what you know and also stimulate some new thinking in the context of life.

519
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:42,110
Yeah. Good. Let's pick.

520
01:16:42,290 --> 01:16:49,160
Any questions? No burning questions. Let's take a few minutes to break up the homework.

521
01:16:49,460 --> 01:16:52,610
I just hope for those the student the other session.

522
01:16:52,610 --> 01:16:58,249
Was you upset? Yeah, because it's such a great opportunity.

523
01:16:58,250 --> 01:17:05,030
And I think you were like, to hold this lecture very much is a faculty.

524
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:09,540
From health policy management to very different field.

525
01:17:10,530 --> 01:17:19,070
Okay, have a little break. Yes, everyone can break the Internet.

526
01:17:28,530 --> 01:17:34,220
Oh, I think. For the first.

527
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:48,830
The virus is. I'm.

528
01:17:50,790 --> 01:18:10,040
This is. If you want to.

529
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:17,940
I. Yeah.

530
01:18:20,130 --> 01:18:36,850
You know, you can see they can you do certain things like, for instance, we have this 15 year old.

531
01:18:42,910 --> 01:18:46,180
Hi. How are you? Good, good.

532
01:18:46,710 --> 01:18:52,600
And we are taking a few minutes as we talk to you.

533
01:18:53,170 --> 01:18:56,330
They also have. I said.

534
01:18:58,180 --> 01:19:01,660
Like the symposium on science.

535
01:19:02,190 --> 01:19:13,400
I think of some. So that's what they were doing today.

536
01:19:17,530 --> 01:19:25,040
Oh. So I know I'm ready to do that.

537
01:19:25,910 --> 01:19:30,760
So you have you have this you don't have additional slides you want to use.

538
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:34,340
It's just like the ones I sent you. Okay. I can put in a few.

539
01:19:35,410 --> 01:19:40,770
Yeah, I can pull for you, but I have.

540
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:46,330
Oh, okay. Is Panopto automatically recording?

541
01:19:47,050 --> 01:19:50,140
Yeah. I will record yours, but I.

542
01:19:50,470 --> 01:19:54,640
I don't know what I just did or. Yes, I wa.

543
01:19:55,060 --> 01:19:58,320
I may have not recorded my own notes.

544
01:19:59,110 --> 01:20:05,500
I mean, this is on, I think, I think, you know, some of the classes it automatically it this one's not.

545
01:20:05,830 --> 01:20:11,620
Okay, I have to I so I haven't seen that.

546
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:16,670
But anyway, I can pause. Yeah. It says recording if you have Panopto.

547
01:20:17,380 --> 01:20:22,190
Yeah, I have to. It says recording. Oh yeah.

548
01:20:22,510 --> 01:20:23,620
So I couldn't stop.
