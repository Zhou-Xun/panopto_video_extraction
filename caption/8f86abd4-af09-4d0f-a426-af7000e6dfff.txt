1
00:00:03,696 --> 00:00:07,505
But if we can go ahead and get started.

2
00:00:07,506 --> 00:00:13,596
I think so. I think for today we're just introducing the class and introducing one another.

3
00:00:13,986 --> 00:00:19,986
So I thought we could go around and introduce ourselves and then I can kind of introduce you to what the format of class is going to be.

4
00:00:20,406 --> 00:00:29,045
And does that sound good? Okay, so why don't you go ahead, start just a name and then maybe like who your advisor is,

5
00:00:29,046 --> 00:00:34,406
what you're interested in studying, and anything else you'd like us to do to study it.

6
00:00:34,806 --> 00:00:40,716
Because I would forget. So Cervantes unit program she hers my advisors Dr. Martin.

7
00:00:41,676 --> 00:00:48,876
So infectious disease epidemiology. But I would bring in a social assessment as well as like U.S. analysis anything else.

8
00:00:49,386 --> 00:00:52,686
Born and raised in the Midwest by the consensus in the last five years.

9
00:00:52,706 --> 00:00:56,266
So. But yeah. Like a fun fact. That's cool.

10
00:00:56,526 --> 00:00:59,956
Yeah, that's great. Yeah. I mean, anything. I don't know. I'm just a little get to know you think.

11
00:00:59,956 --> 00:01:03,146
Cool. Thank you. Right. Yeah.

12
00:01:03,436 --> 00:01:12,646
No, no, no, I don't. That's hard to get here when I have my advisors.

13
00:01:12,646 --> 00:01:18,266
That part of the more I'm interested in studies at the, uh.

14
00:01:21,276 --> 00:01:24,456
Uh. You must book.

15
00:01:24,786 --> 00:01:30,156
Okay. Sure. Yeah, I have that, like, literal librarians behind her.

16
00:01:32,496 --> 00:01:39,096
All right, well, I. And then, you know, right now it's Crawford Smith and a few weeks.

17
00:01:41,096 --> 00:01:45,526
Yes, yes, number of years. You know, I think they are.

18
00:01:45,576 --> 00:01:53,166
They are probably. Oh I am I advisors real Neil Young.

19
00:01:54,236 --> 00:02:00,706
I am interested in maternal and child health and me and I grew up in Arkansas.

20
00:02:01,026 --> 00:02:06,186
Don't go there. That's not what I remember.

21
00:02:09,006 --> 00:02:15,036
My advisors are very good advisors.

22
00:02:15,336 --> 00:02:31,236
Oh, yeah, right. They're sitting there listening to this study and I think I'm so I think this is an answer.

23
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:45,006
But I didn't. I just. Okay, foster children like advertising and high frequency experiments.

24
00:02:47,016 --> 00:02:54,486
So it's just something that's working on a product of your generation.

25
00:02:56,536 --> 00:03:02,776
And I'm actually involved in this now.

26
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:17,796
I do. The main metric of reporting for infectious diseases.

27
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:34,716
This is the body of a virus. And it's something I didn't I didn't have any contact on February 21.

28
00:03:35,016 --> 00:03:48,336
There's a baby coming in January 1303, which I guess.

29
00:03:48,456 --> 00:03:51,996
Is this your first year? Congratulations. Very exciting.

30
00:03:53,406 --> 00:03:59,106
I fell asleep in class houses. Pretend I didn't. That's right.

31
00:03:59,746 --> 00:04:14,936
It's. Okay. So I can understand right now the good guys are trying for the rover and they're interested in my life on them and super weird.

32
00:04:15,086 --> 00:04:19,476
But in fact, I think sometimes it really doesn't happen.

33
00:04:19,496 --> 00:04:24,896
So I don't know why, but that seems to be the most surprising thing about being in a small state.

34
00:04:25,016 --> 00:04:29,316
So I can that I think I.

35
00:04:30,296 --> 00:04:33,446
Did you ever actually serve on a jury? They've never selected me.

36
00:04:33,476 --> 00:04:39,806
I actually got citizens up there in Michigan, and they were like they're like state court, which is like, you know, corporate.

37
00:04:39,876 --> 00:04:43,616
And it's like I just wanted one more thing.

38
00:04:44,066 --> 00:04:49,196
And so it's like really big cases. And I got some one of those, but I can't go because of Michigan.

39
00:04:49,446 --> 00:04:56,246
But yeah, so I, I was like one of my contacts is that I actually almost,

40
00:04:56,246 --> 00:05:01,706
when I went to my application was considering like what to do and I was considering like a masters in forensics.

41
00:05:02,216 --> 00:05:13,016
But I did turns out that like the actual day to day of that doesn't actually sound it's not like, see, if I did, you know, what was it like?

42
00:05:13,856 --> 00:05:18,866
I think you're either the person who works in the lab and like is running literally the same DNA test every single day,

43
00:05:19,616 --> 00:05:24,836
the same way so that you can go to court and tell them, punctuated by going to court to tell them,

44
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:31,286
Yes, sir, I did the DNA test the exact same way like I always do or.

45
00:05:32,876 --> 00:05:39,355
You're actually a sworn officer and you're going to pick hairs off of dead bodies in the middle of the night carrying a gun,

46
00:05:39,356 --> 00:05:46,586
which wasn't really my damn. So the cool places I think are kind of like a once in a career, kind of, you know,

47
00:05:46,586 --> 00:05:50,275
the ones that end up on Forensic Files or like the one where they're like this, oh, my God.

48
00:05:50,276 --> 00:05:58,046
I got to tell you, this one story that happened this one time, you know, and the rest of it is necessarily very regimented and boring.

49
00:05:58,766 --> 00:06:02,796
So. Hi. Hi. I'm Andy.

50
00:06:03,886 --> 00:06:07,486
I work with Dr. Ian Wagner and Matthew Bolton.

51
00:06:08,596 --> 00:06:20,736
I study vaccine hesitancy and vaccine preventable diseases, and we'll help you find that to me immediately when I enter the master program here.

52
00:06:20,746 --> 00:06:28,896
I worked for everyone around me that I will never, ever continue to the Ph.D. program and even in many ways are like,

53
00:06:28,906 --> 00:06:36,276
I worry because I worked with him during my master. Like he asked me, Oh, do you want to continue to do that?

54
00:06:36,946 --> 00:06:44,505
I said, No. And yet, well, we're glad you stayed.

55
00:06:44,506 --> 00:06:48,466
We're glad they wear you down. All right. So I'm Allison Mandel.

56
00:06:48,466 --> 00:06:57,706
This is my first year teaching this class. I have been here since 2014, so that's a lot of years now.

57
00:06:59,026 --> 00:07:05,116
I am a cancer epidemiologist, so I study a lot of modifiable risk factors in cancer.

58
00:07:05,116 --> 00:07:08,116
I'm also an investigator now and research is where we're enrolling.

59
00:07:08,896 --> 00:07:14,385
We're starting a new get funded to start a new cancer cohort to study environmental risk factors for cancer.

60
00:07:14,386 --> 00:07:20,295
So we're enrolling 100,000 Michiganders and collecting blood spots and all kinds of cool stuff.

61
00:07:20,296 --> 00:07:28,455
So we're very excited about that. I am more exposure focused on my work, so I have studied multiple different cancers right now.

62
00:07:28,456 --> 00:07:30,586
I'm kind of doing a lot of work on head and neck cancer,

63
00:07:30,706 --> 00:07:37,096
but I've done a lot for prostate in the past and I'm down with another breast and bladder and kidney of that.

64
00:07:39,556 --> 00:07:44,656
So some facts about me. I have an 11 year old son.

65
00:07:44,806 --> 00:07:50,446
He's in fifth grade and I have a dog named Nugget who is actually doing has these shampoos.

66
00:07:50,716 --> 00:07:55,035
So that's one that I did myself as a picture.

67
00:07:55,036 --> 00:08:03,546
Correct, dermatology. So that's another thing to listen to actually two great podcasts you do you learn

68
00:08:03,556 --> 00:08:07,956
that you learn a lot of things though like that's why the door is not good now.

69
00:08:07,966 --> 00:08:12,806
Very hard not to do that now, but that happens.

70
00:08:15,106 --> 00:08:20,806
All right. So I hope that we can be very collegial and have a lot of discussion in this class.

71
00:08:20,806 --> 00:08:26,356
I don't want it to be like lectures, I will say. So this is sort of the this is the course schedule.

72
00:08:26,536 --> 00:08:31,576
And you can actually we can go download the actual syllabus at the moment if you want.

73
00:08:32,296 --> 00:08:36,496
So this is how it is set up. This kind of tells you what's happening in the class.

74
00:08:37,686 --> 00:08:44,046
Generally the way it's going to be is so that kind of I think this the purpose of this class is sort of twofold.

75
00:08:44,046 --> 00:08:47,676
I would say it is to, number one, prepare you for comps.

76
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:55,145
Right. And number two, I would say also to kind of introduce you to some more advanced methods that I don't think anybody is going to,

77
00:08:55,146 --> 00:08:58,625
as they might expect you to kind of know about them and be able to bring them up as

78
00:08:58,626 --> 00:09:03,935
a possibility for like study design or how to address issues in a study in comps,

79
00:09:03,936 --> 00:09:05,646
maybe particularly on the take home part.

80
00:09:07,566 --> 00:09:14,666
But no one's going to ask you to like know them in depth and like do them as part and do anything about those part of the course, I would say.

81
00:09:14,676 --> 00:09:19,866
But understand what they are and kind of what issues they address, I would say, is what you should be able to do with those items.

82
00:09:21,996 --> 00:09:26,606
Some of those, I would be honest. Be honest and vulnerable here.

83
00:09:26,636 --> 00:09:30,766
Looked at the syllabus when they asked me to teach this class and I was like, I don't know,

84
00:09:32,346 --> 00:09:37,586
I have not learned that, which means I am not equipped to teach someone else about it.

85
00:09:38,336 --> 00:09:39,656
So what are we to do about that?

86
00:09:39,956 --> 00:09:50,486
So I actually have a friend for some of those lectures and we are having for things like IP rating and marginal structural models.

87
00:09:50,486 --> 00:09:54,625
Yes, I knew what those were, but I would have if I wanted to implement them in my own research,

88
00:09:54,626 --> 00:10:03,566
I would probably find a bias that's going to help me with that, or a very smart, bushy tailed student who had recently taken this class, for example.

89
00:10:04,286 --> 00:10:07,736
So we're having someone come talk about that g g g methods.

90
00:10:07,736 --> 00:10:11,125
I had g estimation. I literally have not ever had that.

91
00:10:11,126 --> 00:10:15,266
So I'm looking forward to learning about that as well. We're having another colleague come speak about that.

92
00:10:17,856 --> 00:10:21,276
And some of the other stuff in the latter half of the course.

93
00:10:21,276 --> 00:10:24,636
I have found experts in those things to come around at those.

94
00:10:24,636 --> 00:10:28,506
But generally I will be giving the lectures in the first half of the course.

95
00:10:28,896 --> 00:10:35,426
We're going to focus more on sort of in-depth discussion of some things that you have definitely covered in your business classes before.

96
00:10:35,436 --> 00:10:40,476
I mean, I don't think any of that is going to be brand new, but kind of in depth into which we discuss it will be will be different.

97
00:10:42,576 --> 00:10:49,955
The general structure is going to be there will be the kind of the there will be a lecture session and then the

98
00:10:49,956 --> 00:10:55,356
second session you will be doing the homeworks in groups and we will then discuss the answers to the homework.

99
00:10:56,976 --> 00:11:03,635
It will likely be beneficial for you to have looked over or kind of taken a stab at the homework on your own before you

100
00:11:03,636 --> 00:11:09,216
come to class to then kind of go through it with your group and then we'll go through it as a larger group together.

101
00:11:09,996 --> 00:11:11,976
So I think that will be kind of the way that should work.

102
00:11:11,986 --> 00:11:17,466
So you'll have the lecture on the topic, then you'll go home and work a little bit on your own,

103
00:11:17,946 --> 00:11:22,506
and then you'll finalize the homework in class and talk about the answers that make sense.

104
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:32,886
Okay, next week it's going to be Tuesday is the lecture, Thursday is the homework thereafter because we are skipping January 17th.

105
00:11:32,886 --> 00:11:37,776
I have a big meeting I need to go to insulin's that day. So we're skipping January 17.

106
00:11:38,466 --> 00:11:47,766
So thereafter it will be lecture Thursday. You'll have like the weekend to kind of prepare homework in class, work Tuesday and so on and so forth.

107
00:11:48,486 --> 00:11:53,786
And you'll kind of have a little breather between, although there are a lot of readings to show you that are similar.

108
00:11:54,516 --> 00:12:01,956
Okay. So that's the general structure we are going to in the second half of the class when

109
00:12:01,956 --> 00:12:09,755
you're having kind of the more advanced methods that we're being introduced to, you will have the lecture and then the following class.

110
00:12:09,756 --> 00:12:14,316
In groups of two, you guys will take an empirical research article that uses that method,

111
00:12:15,456 --> 00:12:21,246
and you will, as a group of two, lead a class discussion rather than doing homeworks on the topic.

112
00:12:21,246 --> 00:12:26,945
We will do a class discussion about the research article that uses that method that you guys choose.

113
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:36,516
Does that make sense? Okay. If we go now, actually, I'll go to modules first.

114
00:12:36,546 --> 00:12:43,836
These are the readings. There are basically two text books that a lot of this comes from.

115
00:12:43,836 --> 00:12:48,606
Plus, there are PDFs here of all of the articles that are like journal articles, right?

116
00:12:48,786 --> 00:12:59,015
So there's some articles, some textbook chapters. The main textbooks are one by Miguel Hernan, which is available online for free at his website.

117
00:12:59,016 --> 00:13:02,376
And I think the link to that is in the syllabus excuse me.

118
00:13:02,386 --> 00:13:08,406
And then the other one is modern moderate of the LG, the big flash rock and book.

119
00:13:09,366 --> 00:13:15,515
Another book that I don't believe, I don't think I have actually assigned any readings from it.

120
00:13:15,516 --> 00:13:19,256
But another book that I also think is helpful is the solo.

121
00:13:20,506 --> 00:13:24,846
Do you know that one? Beyond the basics, I believe it's called.

122
00:13:25,686 --> 00:13:32,226
I think that is a nice textbook. I like that one personally a little bit better than modern genealogy, I will admit that.

123
00:13:32,616 --> 00:13:38,255
So this one book is more intermediate, I would say, and the modern technology is more advanced than that, I will admit to.

124
00:13:38,256 --> 00:13:45,246
Sometimes I read things from modern genealogy like wheat bread and my brain kind of turns off

125
00:13:45,246 --> 00:13:48,666
partway through and I have to go back and like return my brain on and try to read it again.

126
00:13:49,266 --> 00:13:53,496
But if you can make yourself digest it, it's actually really a good book, I think.

127
00:13:53,496 --> 00:13:56,765
But the way it's written is somehow my brain just sort of like skids off of it.

128
00:13:56,766 --> 00:14:01,356
Sometimes it goes over here and doesn't really absorb what's on that page.

129
00:14:02,196 --> 00:14:08,015
So I think if you need something intermediate between the two that's global, that's actually like a contact.

130
00:14:08,016 --> 00:14:11,526
Who was my teacher? But it was for my intermediate AP class.

131
00:14:12,006 --> 00:14:17,776
He's great. I like him very much. Okay.

132
00:14:18,556 --> 00:14:27,865
So. These are all of the readings. I don't want to say whether I mean, I think everybody's a little bit different.

133
00:14:27,866 --> 00:14:33,236
Right. Some people may they're associated with like this is associated with next week's lecture at home.

134
00:14:33,236 --> 00:14:37,586
And this one is then associated with the following Thursday, Tuesday lecture homework series.

135
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:43,766
Right. You could read them before the lecture. You could get the lecture and then read them before the homework.

136
00:14:44,036 --> 00:14:47,846
I mean, whatever works, your students, whatever works for you.

137
00:14:48,356 --> 00:14:52,226
But I do think the readings are going to be helpful in helping you digest the material there.

138
00:14:56,606 --> 00:15:05,316
All right. I guess I didn't hurt you or anyone that says from his perusal that police had to come and have an article.

139
00:15:05,366 --> 00:15:09,476
I do like him because it is nice to see what other people's comments and thoughts were.

140
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:13,706
Is that something? I don't know what that is. Oh, can you tell me what that is?

141
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:20,536
Well, in my understanding, it's actually like a like a crowdsourcing art.

142
00:15:20,546 --> 00:15:23,366
So you post the article and then multiple people can comment on it.

143
00:15:23,606 --> 00:15:27,686
Okay, I like things and you can see other people's perspective and you can weigh in.

144
00:15:28,346 --> 00:15:31,946
We're also using American social ethics in the semester. We're using it there.

145
00:15:32,336 --> 00:15:35,695
So I just I. Oh, I would be happy to do that.

146
00:15:35,696 --> 00:15:39,686
I'm not sure how to implement it. Okay. If you don't either. But I can definitely like.

147
00:15:40,436 --> 00:15:43,586
Look. Yeah, I mean, if you don't, right. Yeah.

148
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:47,946
Sarah Sarah's on the set of her. Sarah Who are Adaa?

149
00:15:47,966 --> 00:15:52,696
Okay, thank you. I'm not making either. Yeah, yeah, yes.

150
00:15:52,736 --> 00:15:55,795
Okay. I will ask her about that. That is a good idea. I like that.

151
00:15:55,796 --> 00:15:59,266
As long as it's not hurting someone, use something. Others would be interested.

152
00:15:59,286 --> 00:16:03,706
So is that something you guys think would be helpful? Yeah, I think that would be great.

153
00:16:03,716 --> 00:16:09,716
Okay, just for the journal, I was thinking each of them and like, we can wait.

154
00:16:09,716 --> 00:16:13,376
Like, we don't have to repeat a lot.

155
00:16:14,036 --> 00:16:18,756
What is without a requirement on correctly that requires comments.

156
00:16:18,856 --> 00:16:25,106
No, no, no, no. If if people want to weigh in to be like this one thing, it's versus thing.

157
00:16:25,106 --> 00:16:31,196
Like if I referenced this one on this page, it's like a sculpture. But we haven't heard from this network yet.

158
00:16:31,556 --> 00:16:39,576
So it can be a tool for. The instructor to know that you've done the reading because they like make you read

159
00:16:39,576 --> 00:16:45,036
the comments that are like common issues or do we think that it is one of the.

160
00:16:45,696 --> 00:16:55,206
It's definitely it can we understand there. And I'd have to take full I don't know what perusal I mean after the scope of it.

161
00:16:56,606 --> 00:17:02,436
Can you search like not and and it's all about 811.

162
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:13,086
Yeah. Maybe with the C some l.

163
00:17:19,766 --> 00:17:26,156
Rock it. And these are how you and I will figure it out.

164
00:17:26,856 --> 00:17:30,566
Ow! Oh! Oh! I knew it was going to be there.

165
00:17:34,116 --> 00:17:41,406
Okay. I'll figure this out. I will figure it out. Um, if it isn't, like, a huge lurch to add it, I would do that.

166
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:44,606
Oh, no, they close it.

167
00:17:44,986 --> 00:17:48,786
It is. If you click it or the. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The.

168
00:17:51,906 --> 00:17:57,496
I'm going to take you to my banking coach. Sorry. Okay. I think you can find it.

169
00:17:58,496 --> 00:18:02,826
We'll just go here. We'll do it the old fashioned slow way.

170
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:06,816
All right. So I will look into that. That's a good idea. Yes.

171
00:18:06,816 --> 00:18:10,895
And I mean, if you have suggestions like that, then let me know. Like I said, this is my first time teaching this.

172
00:18:10,896 --> 00:18:13,296
The format is a bit different than it has been in previous years.

173
00:18:14,586 --> 00:18:20,075
So, you know, I have I have reworked a bunch of things that that said, I will tell you,

174
00:18:20,076 --> 00:18:23,316
I know that some people really like to have the slides ahead of time.

175
00:18:23,646 --> 00:18:30,966
I will post them as much ahead of time as I can, but I'm making the lectures as I go so they don't.

176
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:34,716
But some of them don't exist yet. They may not exist until the night before the class.

177
00:18:34,896 --> 00:18:43,326
I'm not going to lie to you, so I will get them up as soon as I can. But that is the the nature of having me as the instructor for the first time.

178
00:18:43,326 --> 00:18:48,126
So I apologize for any inconvenience for that, but I'll get it done as soon as I can.

179
00:18:49,806 --> 00:18:54,175
Yes. Okay. Syllabus. All right.

180
00:18:54,176 --> 00:19:01,106
So here it is. This is all the stuff about the competencies.

181
00:19:02,396 --> 00:19:07,196
I've mentioned this little book, although it's, you know, it's not required.

182
00:19:07,616 --> 00:19:14,435
This is the link to the handbook. Okay.

183
00:19:14,436 --> 00:19:17,226
So the course grade is going to be homework.

184
00:19:17,226 --> 00:19:23,465
So 30% of the course grade, really, that's not going to be it's going to be did you do it or not kind of thing.

185
00:19:23,466 --> 00:19:27,576
Right? You're doing them in groups of two in class. It's going to be did you turn it in?

186
00:19:27,576 --> 00:19:28,566
Did you complete it?

187
00:19:28,926 --> 00:19:34,056
Because the answers are going to be given out in class and presumably you're going to be making those other than changing them in the moment.

188
00:19:34,056 --> 00:19:37,385
Right. So it's not I'm not going to grade them for it. Did you get the answer right?

189
00:19:37,386 --> 00:19:40,106
Because we're going to go over all the answers in process, just disappear.

190
00:19:42,426 --> 00:19:45,036
The empirical paper discussion that you're going to lead is going to be 30%,

191
00:19:45,036 --> 00:19:48,996
and there's going to be a final paper and presentation, which will be 40% of your course grade.

192
00:19:49,836 --> 00:19:54,956
So the homeworks in the first part, I'm going to structure a bit like the methods questions that are on the cross.

193
00:19:55,706 --> 00:20:00,396
You guys are going to get a lot of practice. We can't say no. You're probably starting up your own study groups.

194
00:20:00,396 --> 00:20:07,806
You're going to be given you may already have been given like previous years comp exams to to work off of the study from.

195
00:20:08,376 --> 00:20:13,955
I'm going to also structure the homework for this class to be similar to the kinds of questions you will be asked on an analysis.

196
00:20:13,956 --> 00:20:20,196
I think a piece that was a little bit in the thing that people struggled with a little bit in the class in recent years

197
00:20:20,496 --> 00:20:28,806
was or that they didn't get a lot of practice with was doing kind of the designing a study piece that is on the table,

198
00:20:29,046 --> 00:20:35,796
right. So on the take home, generally they give you pieces of a paper, they're like, Hey, this is the paper.

199
00:20:35,796 --> 00:20:41,255
And then they tell you, now we're going to have you address this new research question.

200
00:20:41,256 --> 00:20:43,326
It's kind of similar to whatever is in paper, right?

201
00:20:44,196 --> 00:20:51,456
So they actually give you pieces of a paper and then tell you what research question you need to design a study in order to

202
00:20:51,966 --> 00:20:58,146
address that research question I'm going to be having to do something very similar for your final presentation project.

203
00:20:58,146 --> 00:21:03,185
It's going to be essentially you pick an article might be a really good opportunity to pick an article that's

204
00:21:03,186 --> 00:21:08,616
in your house for your research to maybe get started thinking more deeply about one of the aims of your work.

205
00:21:10,536 --> 00:21:16,536
So go ahead and pick an article. You are going to answer some questions about that article and kind of the first

206
00:21:16,536 --> 00:21:21,306
part of that research paper or the paper that you're going to the presentation.

207
00:21:21,306 --> 00:21:26,076
We're going to go over this in more detail a little bit later in the course, but you'll you'll look through that.

208
00:21:26,466 --> 00:21:31,116
You'll you'll answer these questions about your paper, about what the actual papers that you collect.

209
00:21:31,966 --> 00:21:36,306
Then you'll be asked to pick a research question that sort of spins off of that.

210
00:21:36,306 --> 00:21:40,296
Right. It can either be a different outcome with that same exposure.

211
00:21:40,506 --> 00:21:47,826
Addressing the remaining questions from that paper right at the end of like, Oh, our paper was great, but we couldn't address this,

212
00:21:47,986 --> 00:21:53,255
then you might say, Oh, well, the assignment to try to address that piece of the research question, how would I do that?

213
00:21:53,256 --> 00:21:59,646
Right? Maybe you want to look at the same outcome, but would like a related exposure, right?

214
00:21:59,646 --> 00:22:07,355
I think one of the one of the questions last year I was asking about was a study that looked at some sort of common medication and ovarian cancer.

215
00:22:07,356 --> 00:22:11,616
And then we asked about a different conversation in different to address that.

216
00:22:11,886 --> 00:22:12,215
Right.

217
00:22:12,216 --> 00:22:20,675
So you rather than as you would be in the take home exam other than being told what the research question is based on the paper everybody's assigned,

218
00:22:20,676 --> 00:22:23,736
you're picking your own paper, taking the research questions,

219
00:22:23,766 --> 00:22:28,656
and the last piece will be kind of the same structure as the typical exam will be the practice for that.

220
00:22:29,046 --> 00:22:32,646
So the paper is smaller here, in fact.

221
00:22:33,456 --> 00:22:42,306
So against the papers, that group, the presentation, the, the, the, the final paper and presentation is not in groups.

222
00:22:42,306 --> 00:22:47,496
The empirical paper discussion is and I will go to the group page in a moment to show you that.

223
00:22:48,306 --> 00:22:53,316
So you'll do homework in groups of homeworks, in groups of two, you will pick up,

224
00:22:53,346 --> 00:22:57,846
you will be in groups of two to pick a paper based on the advanced methods that we're

225
00:22:57,846 --> 00:23:03,186
going to hear from our guest lecturers on paper research on what use that method,

226
00:23:03,186 --> 00:23:10,806
at least a class discussion on that topic. And then you'll also be doing this final presentation on paper.

227
00:23:10,896 --> 00:23:15,016
Does that make sense? Okay.

228
00:23:16,516 --> 00:23:23,886
So that is the grading. So now we're talking about absences and that kind of thing.

229
00:23:23,886 --> 00:23:28,416
We are we are recording. We're in the pilot program for the recording.

230
00:23:29,076 --> 00:23:32,166
So I guess we recorded some of our conversation before we started.

231
00:23:32,766 --> 00:23:37,836
I don't know. Everybody be aware of that. They're automatically recording us starting at 130 every day.

232
00:23:39,696 --> 00:23:42,486
So we'll see how that goes. But so the lectures will be recorded.

233
00:23:43,326 --> 00:23:48,136
But if you I anticipate that there will be this is this is not supposed to be a hybrid class.

234
00:23:48,396 --> 00:23:52,956
It's supposed to be an in-person class. I think it functions best that way. I think we'll all get the most out of it that way.

235
00:23:53,916 --> 00:23:57,005
That said, I know there's going to be COVID stuff.

236
00:23:57,006 --> 00:24:00,696
I know there's going to be you know, if you're sick, don't come to class right with you.

237
00:24:01,056 --> 00:24:06,276
There's weather stuff we can we can pivot to online. But so if you are sick and can't come,

238
00:24:06,906 --> 00:24:14,706
just email me before the class and let me know if you want to join on Zoom and I will send you the Zoom link and we'll ask you on Zoom for that day.

239
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:22,806
Okay, then I want to make it just an open joint on Zoom if you want to kind of thing, because then it becomes a hybrid class.

240
00:24:22,806 --> 00:24:27,266
And I did that last semester with it last year with a different class that I was the only one to show up.

241
00:24:27,276 --> 00:24:32,526
And that wasn't that wasn't great. I don't recommend that happening.

242
00:24:32,526 --> 00:24:40,156
So so I think, you know, it's expected to be an in-person class, but if there are extenuating circumstances, we can advise.

243
00:24:40,416 --> 00:24:45,036
Does that make sense for me? Okay, cool.

244
00:24:48,246 --> 00:24:53,436
Yeah. So just email me prior to class time. I'll check my email right before class and see if anybody needs to join by Zoom.

245
00:24:53,976 --> 00:24:58,296
And then also that's really, really warm in here.

246
00:24:59,226 --> 00:25:02,976
So anybody remembers that for next time. Layers. Layers for this room.

247
00:25:03,846 --> 00:25:09,616
Okay. Any questions? About that kind of stuff.

248
00:25:16,366 --> 00:25:19,695
All right. The assignments are here. I believe I have already made them available.

249
00:25:19,696 --> 00:25:31,926
So you can see, like for the article discussion, this is the the document that tells you a little bit more about how you're going to be doing that.

250
00:25:34,536 --> 00:25:37,646
And that's where that is. And then for the final.

251
00:25:40,316 --> 00:25:43,556
That's great. Oh, and I said this one.

252
00:25:43,676 --> 00:25:46,406
Think that's why I set this one up as a discussion.

253
00:25:46,406 --> 00:25:53,906
Not because I want you guys to post responses, but I wanted you to be able to submit your article in a way that everybody can see it.

254
00:25:54,746 --> 00:26:00,836
So prior to class, like, you know, you need to give people a couple of days and you need to submit your article ahead

255
00:26:00,836 --> 00:26:03,836
of time so that people can read it and come to the class prepared to discuss it.

256
00:26:04,016 --> 00:26:10,586
And the way that I think, rather than like you submit it on canvas in me somehow, something that sounds profane and everyone's like,

257
00:26:10,586 --> 00:26:16,156
So if I just set it up as a discussion that you can upload everyone, everybody can just sit back.

258
00:26:18,516 --> 00:26:22,306
I'm here. Not the.

259
00:26:25,686 --> 00:26:33,096
That is weird. You are right. It is not. Others announcements and announcements only shows that when you make an announcement.

260
00:26:33,696 --> 00:26:36,816
That's why. So announcements is one of those. Like if I.

261
00:26:36,936 --> 00:26:40,346
If I send out an announcement, suddenly it will be there. But you were right.

262
00:26:40,356 --> 00:26:49,926
Let's fix that right now. Note that sections that always do that wrong.

263
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:58,626
Oh. Anybody remember? I always forget where the says. Think it might be under modification?

264
00:26:58,926 --> 00:27:02,746
Yeah, it is. You're right. Where are you?

265
00:27:03,966 --> 00:27:07,896
Discussions. Are you. Are you?

266
00:27:12,406 --> 00:27:23,306
Like this? Yeah. Just click the three dots and then enable you to think you did it.

267
00:27:25,976 --> 00:27:29,726
Look at me. You get this thing, or you get to say, Oh.

268
00:27:35,766 --> 00:27:39,966
Yeah. I did read some places where they're too aware.

269
00:27:40,396 --> 00:27:53,506
Oh, okay. And able. And they will hate you, can't you?

270
00:27:53,596 --> 00:27:58,276
Yeah. Okay, look, I did it, all right?

271
00:27:59,716 --> 00:28:02,716
For real this time. I actually did it. I didn't just practice doing it.

272
00:28:02,746 --> 00:28:10,846
Okay, so. So I think that is that. There was one other thing that I was going to say.

273
00:28:11,776 --> 00:28:15,105
Now I can't remember what it was, but it will come to me. Oh, yes.

274
00:28:15,106 --> 00:28:23,476
I was going to go to people and show you the groups. All right. So I have signed you up already randomly for.

275
00:28:25,786 --> 00:28:33,106
Groups. These are your. This is not.

276
00:28:34,576 --> 00:28:38,286
I can get rid of that. That's not supposed to be there. Like I said, that's going to be individual.

277
00:28:38,296 --> 00:28:42,646
So this is the empirical article groups. So these are what you are a science.

278
00:28:45,276 --> 00:28:49,056
If anybody has like I know sometimes you guys are going to conferences or something like that.

279
00:28:49,056 --> 00:28:53,556
If you know for a fact, you're going to be gone during one of these dates and it's not going to work.

280
00:28:53,646 --> 00:28:58,736
Let me know as soon as possible and we'll try to do that.

281
00:28:59,886 --> 00:29:06,246
And then these are the in-class groups. I tried to make them different so that she would get to interact with different folks.

282
00:29:07,056 --> 00:29:18,786
One reason that you might if you if you would like, is please make it look like if there's a reason that you would like to switch your in-class group.

283
00:29:19,026 --> 00:29:26,376
Let me know. One reason could be that you're already like in a study group with this person and you would like to interact with somebody different.

284
00:29:26,486 --> 00:29:30,456
You know, as you prepare for it, kind of mix it up a little bit and that would be totally fair.

285
00:29:31,056 --> 00:29:44,796
So just let me know. And then we will work on when we get closer to it.

286
00:29:45,336 --> 00:29:49,176
We will figure out dates for the presentations.

287
00:29:50,496 --> 00:29:55,336
It's going to be like three, 3 to 2, essentially two days of three people and two days of.

288
00:29:58,916 --> 00:30:04,166
Somebody. Maybe you have a plan sheet or something like that for for something.

289
00:30:06,176 --> 00:30:13,076
We don't have to do like this. That's a problem for March, Allison.

290
00:30:15,066 --> 00:30:18,926
I heard somebody say that once in Wisconsin in the classroom. That's a feature.

291
00:30:19,686 --> 00:30:23,076
You know what? That is a great idea. But it isn't.

292
00:30:23,076 --> 00:30:26,226
It isn't because then you just say it's a soap opera problem sometimes.
