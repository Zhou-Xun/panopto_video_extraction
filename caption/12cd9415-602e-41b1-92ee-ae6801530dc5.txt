1
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:29,450
OK, we're going to get going.

2
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:35,060
I have two different lectures for today. One is on blood. Bloodstream infections.

3
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:40,220
And then I have another one that I put in that I think will be very useful for you all.

4
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,490
So we're going to get going on bloodstream infections right now.

5
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:48,110
And since everybody is having masks on, I'm assuming that we still have to wear masks.

6
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:59,300
OK, so bloodstream infections are probably bloodstream infections and infections of the central

7
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:05,540
nervous system are the most critical types of infections that we deal with in the laboratory.

8
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:10,490
And we have a number of methods that are available for culture.

9
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:17,000
And now we have a number of molecular methods and the molecular methods are wonderful.

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,380
They're fast, they're accurate. They don't give you a susceptibility.

11
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:27,050
They may tell you resistance to one or two or three drugs by detection of resistance factors,

12
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:30,950
but they don't give you an entire panel of susceptibility results,

13
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:38,300
as you would get if you were to do a A and I or curve ball or something in the clinical laboratory with the Iceman.

14
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:46,970
But they are a great way to start out with with very, very critical types of infection, such as sepsis or meningitis.

15
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:58,250
So general considerations for bloodstream infections, it's not that staph is worse than Pseudomonas or anything like that.

16
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:07,410
All major groups of microbes can cause bloodstream infections, so we don't limit it to gram positive or gram negative rods versus Cox.

17
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:17,380
So they can all cause horrible problems can result in shock, multiple organ failure and death.

18
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:20,380
They can also be transmitted to people who are working in the lab,

19
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:29,620
in the hospital or who come family members who can come and visit them if they're coughing and choking and not covering up.

20
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:33,790
So to treat patients appropriately,

21
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:42,400
we have to recover the etiologic agent or have it in a first detected in a specimen maybe not recovered physically, but detected in the specimen.

22
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,570
And there's a lot of different factors that we have to consider we being the

23
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:51,610
laboratory and the hospital to consider when we say we're going to do blood cultures,

24
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:58,570
we're going to do CSF cultures and so on. So can we detect all the organisms that might be causing this?

25
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:06,130
Well, we can detect the vast majority, but not all of them. OK, how are we going to collect the specimen?

26
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:09,520
Are the collection methods standardized for that?

27
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:15,550
The staff up on the horse in the hospital who are obtaining the specimens and sending them down to the lab?

28
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:24,790
So there needs to be a lot of conversation back and forth with the phlebotomy team, with the nursing teams and so on, as well as the physicians.

29
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:30,070
And how many specimens do we need? One, two, three 15.

30
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:35,200
You know, we don't want to have so many specimens of the patient is anemic.

31
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:46,690
So generally, four blood cultures and blood cultures three specimens and they need a fourth one and has to have approval by it or the laboratory.

32
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:52,870
And then what's going on with the patient? Do they actually need blood cultures? Sometimes they're ordered needlessly.

33
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:58,210
So there are a lot of factors that really need to be considered here. Next slide.

34
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:04,300
So bacteremia bacteria in the blood, what's most common cause gram positive?

35
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:11,500
Karzai. No question about it. They can be staph aureus, obviously quite positive.

36
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:16,630
Staphylococcus. What about coin negatives? A Staphylococcus that we think they're not so bad,

37
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:24,130
but in a patient who has a lot of other medical issues going on may have a lot of hardware in their body.

38
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:31,330
Quite negative stuff can cause a big problem in macaques Toxaa Streptococcus.

39
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:35,980
They can all when they get in the wrong place, which is a person's bloodstream.

40
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:47,310
They can cause big problems. As can the entire gram negative rods, so the bacteria and pseudomonas, Diana Ross,

41
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:57,050
we don't see positive blood cultures for Arabs that often, but when we do, we have to think about foster radio and Bacteroides.

42
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:01,490
So there is something else you to consider, and I don't know how many of you know this.

43
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:08,180
So if you look at the next line, if we isolate certain organisms in blood and blood from samples of blood,

44
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:12,170
there are they are markers for cancer in the body.

45
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:21,560
And so a couple of them are listed here, Clostridium skeptical and Streptococcus bovis and that subspecies Bella Lucas,

46
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:28,460
too, are both known to be present in the blood in a patient who has cancer of the GI tract.

47
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:33,470
And so it's kind of a little, hey, you know, and so when you're working in the lab, you see one of these in blood.

48
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:43,010
You call your favorite doc and say, Hey, take a look at this and they know about it, and they can talk to the oncology specialists.

49
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:52,220
But what about fungi? Well, the moles are not nearly as common in bloodstream infections, as are the yeast.

50
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:57,690
But we do see fungi both ease and mold in positive blood cultures.

51
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:05,360
If the patient is severely immunocompromised or if they have severe underlying disease, something else going on.

52
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:11,720
So obviously the most common use Candida albicans, OK, it's part of everyone's normal flora.

53
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:19,610
But the other Candida species can also cause problems, but they don't as frequently as albicans.

54
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:31,160
Cryptococcus neoformans that that beast gave me my Ph.D., and it can cause huge problems acquired outside working,

55
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:39,200
you don't know when you're walking through an area where there's been a lot of pigeon droppings and you can be picked up very easily there.

56
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:44,570
And as the patients immunocompromised, it can cause huge problems.

57
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:54,470
So if we do a blood culture and we see yeast in the blood culture, it means there is a focus elsewhere in the body.

58
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:58,730
So if it was an encapsulated yeast, which you can't really tell from a gram stain,

59
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:04,190
but you can from an A. We think what we need is spinal fluid right away.

60
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:09,950
If it is looks like canned albicans or but in yeast, we're going to look not us.

61
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:16,100
The physicians will go ahead and look and start searching to see where else in the body could this thing be hiding out?

62
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,950
Let's start doing a lot of other lab tests and so on.

63
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:26,470
And then we have our friends, the dimorphic fungi that are used face in the body and more about nature.

64
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:30,450
OK, so here we're talking about Sammy. Tell me what we're talking about.

65
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:37,260
Name one. That we see in this area.

66
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:46,920
This plasma, that's love. OK, these are these are one that's one of the small, dimorphic fungi.

67
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:54,060
We don't see a whole lot of them here in Michigan, but they are there and they can disseminate from the lungs via macrophages.

68
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:59,370
They hide out, these face, hides out in macrophages, takes a ride through the body,

69
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:05,220
gets to a place and says, Oh, I think I'm going to set up house here. It looks really nice, sort of.

70
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:12,570
And that's how they get through around the body when they start out in the lungs.

71
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:20,370
Next slide. So we could also have bloodstream infections from parasites.

72
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:28,440
And what I have here is Toxoplasma can disseminate and infect the brain, the eyes, the lung, the liver and heart.

73
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:33,420
None of these are any good. It is. It is horrible. It doesn't happen very often what it does.

74
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:39,810
It's devastating to think about malaria or anything with the microfilm area,

75
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:46,560
the trick ourselves that we can see this if we do a gram stain of bird nanograms.

76
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,390
Excuse me, I misspoke a wet mount of a sediment from a centrifuge specimen.

77
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:57,420
We can see them swimming in there. OK, but you don't count just on that to say, are they there is anything there you do,

78
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:02,760
the cultures you do the theory you do everything, the full workup to make sure that nothing is there.

79
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:08,550
And when you're considering parasites, remember they're not always circulating.

80
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,220
It's like they're on a clock. They circulate at certain times.

81
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:19,380
So if you were thinking about a specific parasite, make sure you obtain the specimens at the right time frames.

82
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:23,880
And then we have our friend the viruses and they can disseminate through the blood.

83
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:31,130
But the actual pathology that the devastation to the tissue is at the site where the tissue is infected.

84
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:40,160
OK, so they may travel through the through the body, in the blood, but where it's actually growing in tissues, where the infection is.

85
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,820
Next slide. So I've already mentioned a couple of types of Bactrim.

86
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:50,940
I'm going to go over them again, so we have transient bacteremia and that can be spontaneous or incidental.

87
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:57,030
And so think about somebody brushing their teeth very vigorously. You get a transient bacteremia.

88
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:02,880
Sometimes from that, particularly if someone has some gum disease, can happen with chewing food.

89
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,660
It's really maybe it's not cook very well. It's really tough.

90
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:16,050
You can get a transient bacteremia and then we can also get a transient bacteremia from surgical manipulations of non-sterile sides.

91
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:21,330
However, when that's going on, patient is generally on antibiotics also.

92
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:30,240
So that's transient bacteremia. Then the next one is intermittent bacteremia, and that can happen simply from an untrained abscess.

93
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:38,720
Maybe the health care provider doesn't know that the patient has an abscess, or they're going to take care of it on Thursday or Friday.

94
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:44,760
And until that time, it's leaking some bacteria that can get throughout the body.

95
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:55,860
It's not when it's under an abscess unless it ruptures, the bacteria or other organisms are let out intermittently, OK.

96
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:04,470
And these can cause very various serious types of illness, meningitis, pneumonia and osteomyelitis.

97
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:14,130
And then for the last type of bacteremia is continuous, and this is where bacteria and other organisms are let out constantly at a constant rate.

98
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:19,080
And this happens when there's septic shock due to damage to cells.

99
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:27,000
And if there are endovascular infections because the vascular tissue is injured and they can get out and,

100
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,640
you know, as as the blood is flowing through. Next slide.

101
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,210
So going on more on types of bloodstream infections,

102
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:43,080
the more intravascular infections they they originate in the cardiovascular system, as you might expect.

103
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:50,250
So I'm sure everyone has heard of infective endocarditis, very, very serious type of illness.

104
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:58,680
It can be congenital. So a patient has it or or acquired from damage to the heart endothelium.

105
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:06,360
So how would the heart endothelium be damaged? Anyone might take a guess.

106
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:12,250
Anyone? Yeah.

107
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:21,440
Immune response, probably. Yeah. Yeah. And clots will form on damaged tissue or in areas where there's poor flow, so it's not.

108
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:29,150
The flow is not very good. It's flowing very slowly or intermittently, gives bacteria greater chance to infect and grow.

109
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:36,620
The vegetation will develop. And it's commonly caused by oral organisms, organisms from everyone's mouth.

110
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:41,390
OK, so they've had some dental work and some bacteria got in the blood.

111
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:47,930
And this is why patients who have underlying illnesses, oftentimes when they go to the dentist will take antibiotics.

112
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:55,460
My older son, who's had three open heart surgeries, always is on antibiotics at the dentist.

113
00:12:55,460 --> 00:13:01,220
So the organisms that causes a strep and enterococci at Erekat's are, of course, is a Streptococcus.

114
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:07,910
And it can happen with if a patient has their own heart valves or prosthetic mouth.

115
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:13,640
So bacteria aren't real picky about that.

116
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:19,760
So here's an example I know I don't know if you all are familiar with what the heart looks like, so a nice little schematic here.

117
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:25,610
We've got the right atrium and the left atrium, the aortic valve kind of here in the center.

118
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:35,780
Then the mitral valve, the left ventricle, the right ventricle, the tricuspid. And here we have a vegetation right here.

119
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:43,550
And so you can see it's very close to the pulmonary bell. It looks like it's growing over here, close to the aortic valve,

120
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:49,610
and it can get into the bloodstream and infect other organisms, and it can grow there.

121
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:56,620
And this is what the vegetation, if you were to do a biopsy, obviously this is from an autopsy if you look at this size to a piece of tissue.

122
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:02,710
This is what the vegetation to look like. Next slide.

123
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:08,900
So more on types of bloodstream infections, we have intravascular infections,

124
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:14,990
and these are associated with intravenous catheters and catheters, as you all know,

125
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:25,280
or are used to administer fluids, blood products, medications, antibiotics, you name it nutrition, and they're also used for hemodynamic monitoring.

126
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:29,000
It's an easy way. And when you have that needle in a patient,

127
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:37,430
it's an easy way to get a blood sample because you don't have to stick patient against the tip of that needle stays in the bloodstream.

128
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:44,360
So anything that gets on that needle that's not sterile can get travel through the body.

129
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:49,790
It can become colonized with many, many different organisms gram negative gram, positive yeast, you name it.

130
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:58,770
They can all do that, and they can also cause biofilms to form and biofilms really protect the organism.

131
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:10,370
It's kind of a slimy Mukasey type of a film, and the bacteria can be in there bacteria, yeast can be in there, and they're protected by that biofilm.

132
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:17,510
And the ones that can produce but not in production of biofilms are quite negative staff and fungi.

133
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:31,940
So but there can also be spread outside the veins and arteries from skin flora, patient's own skin flora or hospital workers.

134
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:38,510
OK, so hand-washing is critical and the key to hand-washing.

135
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:47,210
And this is what we've taught years and years and years seeing the Happy Birthday song twice out loud and don't speed through it.

136
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:49,970
That's how long you have to have to wash your hands,

137
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:59,210
actively wash it not just but actively washing your hands if you want to do a good job and get rid of as much flora from your hands as possible.

138
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:03,140
Happy birthday song! Twice through singing slowly. You don't have to sing it out loud,

139
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:11,300
but you sing it yourself so hospital workers can be spread a lot of organisms if they don't take care of their own hands.

140
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:17,690
And just taking a little bit of hand sanitizers we have in all the rooms in the halls everywhere.

141
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:26,230
It's still 30 seconds. It's supposed to rub it until it's dry, which is about 30 seconds.

142
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:35,530
So. Let's talk about extra vascular bloodstream infections, so this in an extra vascular bloodstream infection.

143
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:41,320
The organisms into the bloodstream through the lymphatic, different parts of the body.

144
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:47,680
And the lymphatic kind of serve as a clearinghouse to get rid of organisms in the body.

145
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:58,000
But sometimes they break through. So you can have bloodstream infections and extra vascular infections, and they can occur simultaneously.

146
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:07,130
Usually, they're the same organism, but not always. Can be caused by just about any type of bacteria and fungi.

147
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:14,780
And what I say fragile, I mean, primarily yeast. It's much more difficult to have a fungal infection with a mold.

148
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:18,860
It happens particularly in profoundly immunocompromised patients.

149
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:24,310
But yeast are much more common.

150
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:36,670
So more on clinical manifestations of sepsis, so septicemia or sepsis, the organism or their product for the toxins can cause harm to the host.

151
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:39,310
And there are some signs that health care workers look for.

152
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:47,140
These are very objective signs, or they may be discovered by an exam, maybe some bloodwork or a physical exam of the patient.

153
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:56,080
It could be fever, very commonly hypothermia, the opposite of sea fever, where patients temperature drops hyperventilation,

154
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:02,180
breathing too rapidly and oftentimes when patients hyperventilate, they don't really fill up their minds.

155
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:07,330
If they're not really filling up their lungs, close the skin lesions.

156
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:15,510
Other can even be mental status changes and diarrhea, so the variety of different signs for sepsis.

157
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,770
Worse than sepsis,

158
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:28,000
worse than having bacteria circulate throughout the vascular system is septic shock and septic shock has fever causes acute respiratory distress.

159
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,350
Oftentimes patients are have to be put on a ventilator.

160
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:39,270
There can be hypoxia, extreme hypertension and then, worst of all, disseminated intravascular coagulation,

161
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:45,210
where your your blood coagulating your in your bed, the vessels in your veins.

162
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:52,470
This is mediated or caused by cytokines produced by activated macrophages or monocytes.

163
00:18:52,470 --> 00:19:01,680
Lipopolysaccharide or an endotoxin from gram negative bacteria can mediate numerous systemic side effects.

164
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:10,200
Endotoxin is a tough thing to fight because most of the gram negative bacteria have a lot of endotoxin of patients infected with gram negatives.

165
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:18,040
That would be a lot of endotoxin present. Then we get to what happens if patients immunocompromised also, and this is even worse.

166
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:23,340
So immunocompromised patients, these would be ones who had organ transplant.

167
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:29,600
Their being their immune system is being deactivated practically in the elderly people,

168
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:36,630
patients with malignancy or patients who have an HIV infection that has not been treated appropriately.

169
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:42,870
They can be infected with a wide range of organisms, including those that we would normally say.

170
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:47,700
This is just cognitive stuff, and I don't worry about it. Now you treat all those seriously.

171
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:56,880
And this is where in the laboratory we have a lot of conversations with our physician partners for infection prevention as partners and say,

172
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,450
Can you work this one out? You know, it doesn't look that bad. No, this is what's going on.

173
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:09,240
Yeah, we'll be glad to work it out. So how do we detect bacteremia?

174
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:17,430
So we have to have a good specimen first? And you can have real organisms causing disease or you have contaminating

175
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:23,130
organisms that just got in there because the site was not cleaned appropriately.

176
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:29,910
They can both grow blood cultures to site preparation is critical. So blood cultures, site preparation.

177
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:34,620
I have said this over and over and over to physicians.

178
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:38,960
And sometimes they listen to me and a substance of the site.

179
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:47,060
70 percent alcohol or if your hospital system uses another another disinfectant, that's fine.

180
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:54,720
Such as chlorhexidine, but or best to use 70 percent alcohol, nerdcore chlorhexidine.

181
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:01,140
You put it on a cotton swab or cotton bludgeon till it's dry.

182
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:04,710
The site is dry, do not ever tie.

183
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:11,100
Try to clean your own fingers you put on a sterile glove. You cannot clean your own fingers adequately.

184
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:16,470
Start trying to figure out where the vein is. You've just contaminated the site so you put on a rubber glove.

185
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:25,680
It's terrible. Also, prep the tops of the blood culture bottle stoppers with alcohol, and it's not just a simple swab.

186
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:33,510
Do it until it's dry. It's not going to hurt the rubber stopper, but it will prevent contamination and help prevent contamination.

187
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:41,100
Once again, phlebotomist must wear gloves and any blood contaminated surfaces must be decontaminated.

188
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:49,540
Decontaminated. So one of the things that licensing agents such as the federal government and the College

189
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:55,180
of American Pathologists look at is what is your blood culture contamination rate?

190
00:21:55,180 --> 00:22:02,560
And it needs to be below three percent if it's higher than three percent and then it goes down the next month.

191
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:07,560
Sometimes that can be explained. But if it stays higher than three percent for three or four or five months,

192
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:12,850
you know your hospital is going to lose funding and they will be in big trouble.

193
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:21,570
So that's making sure that blood cultures are done appropriately is everyone's responsibility.

194
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:28,200
So here is just a graph of some data. The pink are the volume of blood cultures.

195
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:34,170
The blue line is the positivity rate and the Green Line is the contamination rate.

196
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:40,200
And there was a little blip in 2002, and it started going down through 2012.

197
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,520
So huge attention to how the scan and area,

198
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:56,170
the venous puncture site is prepped and how the blood cultures are done has helped this institution tremendously.

199
00:22:56,170 --> 00:23:01,540
So let's go back to specimen collection, how much volume do we need for blood cultures?

200
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:11,050
Well, many better images have very few very low numbers of organisms in the blood, so the colony forming unit count is very low.

201
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:21,070
So you have to collect a sufficient sample, so 20 male 20 milliliters per per collection because you have two bottles, OK,

202
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:27,610
and you have an Arabic bottle in an anaerobic bottle from both cultures and you're going to put 10 of the blood in each one.

203
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:33,550
So the stabbers, both stories have to be cleaned off before you start.

204
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:39,250
So you inject your strawberries, you clean, your hands are clean, the gloves are on the side has been prepared.

205
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:43,510
That's when you can get the blood for the blood culture access.

206
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:54,130
So blood cultures that once again, one aerobic and one anaerobic per bottle and generally blood cultures are ordered times two or times three.

207
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:59,710
So you might collect one set at eight o'clock, another set at nine o'clock notice, then at 10 o'clock.

208
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:04,900
Or it could be if they know the patient has had a spike in fever at certain times of the day.

209
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:13,950
They may want blood cultures collected during that spike and fever that would correlate with more bacteria getting into the blood.

210
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:18,210
OK, for children, it's, you know, children don't have as much blood as the adults,

211
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:26,400
so you can't take his large volumes of blood, so the blood culture bottle to use for pediatrics don't contain as much fluid.

212
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:33,390
OK, so but that dream is in. Children have a much higher level of organisms,

213
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:39,720
so they might have 100 to a thousand colony forming units per milliliter of blood from a pediatric patient.

214
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:46,170
So generally, for a pediatric blood culture, you take anywhere between one and five milliliters per bottle.

215
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:51,600
Now remember I said we have an Arabic balloon anaerobic bottle for adult pediatric patients.

216
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:56,130
Don't get the anaerobic bile, they don't have anaerobic infections. Rarely they do.

217
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:59,340
But for the most part, you know, greater than 95 percent.

218
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:09,060
They don't have anaerobic bloodstream infection, so you only have to collect five mils blood and inject it into one bottle.

219
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:13,980
Next slide. So how many blood cultures should you obtain?

220
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:18,270
So as I said before, there's some periodicity associated with certain diseases.

221
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:23,880
So generally, you get two or three cultures per episode, and the nursing staff will be pretty able,

222
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:32,130
fairly able to tell you this patient's temperature went up at seven a.m. and yes, it went up four hours before that and then four hours before that.

223
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:42,840
So you know when to collect the blood cultures? So regardless of whether it's continuous sepsis or an intermittent sepsis,

224
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:48,090
greater than 90 percent of the positive blood cultures are collected by the food sample.

225
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:57,090
So it's three samples. And once again, they all need to be collected from separate being a punctures at separate times,

226
00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:03,540
not 30 mils all at once or 50 mils all at once and settled into bottles.

227
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:08,950
So do not collect 30 miles of blood from one being a punctured and distributed and three by three cents vials.

228
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:14,140
No, do not ever do that. So what about the timing?

229
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:22,030
If it's continuous fever, which marks the spikes, if it's continuous fever spacing is that critical.

230
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:30,550
If it's intermittent, you spread out that blood culture draws over over time.

231
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:41,920
A couple of other miscellaneous facts we can use anticoagulants, blood can be collected with EDTA or sodium polythene sulfate.

232
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:51,970
And what the dilution of blood into bottles is a minimum of one to five blood media to dilute any inhibitors present in the blood,

233
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:58,480
and the media is just a basic nutrient broth. Nothing special about this basic nutrient broth.

234
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:04,840
It does have some additives. It has resins to bind toxins, and they will also bind to antibiotics.

235
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:10,990
They're not perfect. They can't bind every antibiotic, but they do help.

236
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:21,730
So we have instrument based blood culture systems, the two that I'm familiar with are back to back tailor made by different companies.

237
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:25,810
And when bacteria grow in the bottle, you see a color change.

238
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:31,990
Now you may have hundreds, several hundred black culture bottles incubating at one time.

239
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:39,340
So the machinery actually detects the color change that somebody doesn't have to come in and pull out and look at the quality of the machine.

240
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:43,750
Does it all? And the machine is constantly monitoring the bottles.

241
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:51,610
It will tell you when there are positives, it'll be poor squawk or something or say, Come, come, get a bad baloney.

242
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:56,470
So black culture incubated for five days, thirty five to thirty seven degrees,

243
00:27:56,470 --> 00:28:02,710
we're shaking to make sure everything is exposed to as much media as possible.

244
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:11,110
And then when it says, Come get me, bottles are taken off, take off both bottles for one patient, for one draw.

245
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:15,220
If if two or three sets all pop up positive at the same time, you could take more.

246
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:21,400
You have to check each one, each set. There is a licensed centrifugation method.

247
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:25,210
These are the isolated tubes that you see down here.

248
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:33,460
They contain 7in ESPs and E.T.A., and you can incubate some blood in them in an isolated tube.

249
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:46,160
When it's positive, you centrifuge it and the sediment is right there, you can play it right on media and you just have to examine what's a day?

250
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:49,430
So how do we handle positive blood cultures?

251
00:28:49,430 --> 00:29:02,630
Everything is done in a biological safety cabinet with mask, gloves in the lab coat grandstand, a drop of fluid from the bottle after it's well mixed.

252
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:07,220
If you don't see anything that's a reason to centrifuge some and then do that stuff

253
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:11,420
to see if you can pull down anything that was making the bottle fly just positive.

254
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:18,780
This is a critical value. The physician is to be paged or contacted immediately.

255
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:27,570
If you can't use your position, is there, who do you contact the contact infection prevention, you can contact infectious diseases,

256
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:34,710
you can call the floor and say who is which physician is taking care of this patient that got a positive blood culture.

257
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:40,500
It is a critical situation and everybody works to get it handled correctly.

258
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:47,400
And when you notify the clinician, you document that the physician was contacted and what the message was,

259
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:52,140
the time that the physician was contacted and who spoke to the physician so that

260
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:59,160
you have all that information in case it's needed and handling blood cultures.

261
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,170
This is joint commission. You have to do all of this.

262
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:08,520
There's no ifs, ands or buts, so you submit to a blood on your plate and chop it on a plate babbin cap if their gram negative rods,

263
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,290
you said so, contrary to McConkey.

264
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:21,430
Also, if there's mixed organisms gram positive and gram negative, you're going to want to use a CNG, which will isolate gram positives as drugs.

265
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:26,310
And it wasn't enough acid to get rid of gram negatives and a mcconkey plate,

266
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:31,330
which will get rid of gram positive so you can see the individual colony Typekit.

267
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:45,120
And if you see it, you can always add a sapling. $7. If the growth is only in the anaerobic model, you have to set up anaerobic cultures,

268
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:52,080
anaerobic also, but make sure you set up anaerobic cultures and then as there is growth,

269
00:30:52,080 --> 00:31:00,210
which would probably be the next day, you would identify and do susceptibility testing in that entire process takes two to three days.

270
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:07,950
So this is the conventional method of doing blood cultures.

271
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:15,750
Now we have molecular testing and with molecular analysis, this, as I said, there's a number of different systems out there.

272
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:19,750
The bottle flags is positive. The machine can be different.

273
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:29,710
It's a separate machine. Put an alcohol into to put in a specialist to put it into the machine, and you can do a blood culture analysis on that one.

274
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:37,350
Now, it does not have the genetic information for every organism in the world, but it certainly has become also will have clinical staff.

275
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:42,480
They will have staff was equalized in most regions and all the common ones it will have.

276
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:52,200
And then what about susceptibility testing? Well, once you isolate the organism, which will take 24 hours and then you do an identification,

277
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:57,360
you have to do a susceptibility, the machinery that's doing all this molecular work.

278
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:02,730
Kit can tell you what resistance factors.

279
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:12,210
The organism is is can handle. OK, so if it's resistant to have this water resistant to germs, but you still need a full susceptibility,

280
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:16,690
which will come about a day or two after that, after you have a nice day after that.

281
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:20,070
I stood on a plate day after that. You'll have a full susceptibility.

282
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:26,790
So, you know, not just that it's resistant to General Meissen, but what is it susceptible to and how can the patient be treated appropriately?

283
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:30,540
So as soon as is a kind of blood clotting that knows its gram negative boom,

284
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:42,650
there are two or three drugs until they can really maximize what it is they should be getting, but that's just the starting point.

285
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:52,520
OK. So if there were no immunocompromised patients out there, it would be very much easier than it is now,

286
00:32:52,520 --> 00:33:02,660
but we have an increasing population of immunocompromised persons and they can they can be immunocompromised, compromised for many, many reasons.

287
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:09,980
So immunocompromised person who gets a quite negative staph in their blood, that's pretty serious.

288
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:13,600
You can't ignore it. OK, now that the lab would ever ignore it.

289
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:18,260
But sometimes they think the medical staff thinks it's not that important.

290
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:23,030
Well, when you get about two or three sets of blood cultures, it's very important.

291
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:28,370
So if patients immunocompromised, there needs to be additional therapy and more blood cultures,

292
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:34,510
and it's just something that happens so we can get the best medical care for all the patients.

293
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:44,700
Failure to recognize the positive blood culture and the implications of it can be lethal for the patient.

294
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:49,590
So we do have probable contaminants, you cannot just blown off.

295
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:54,570
But if you see this list Bacillus, Detroits, Propionibacterium,

296
00:33:54,570 --> 00:34:00,630
quite negative stuff and only one of several sets of blood cultures that would indicate it's probably a contaminant.

297
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:08,370
But once again, if you get it in three sets of blood cultures knowing not no ignoring it, it's important.

298
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:11,550
So if you grow multiple organisms from one of several cultures,

299
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:17,820
so you have a poly microbial infection in one blood culture bottle, one said about cocktails, but not the others.

300
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:27,880
That's probably a contaminant. But the actual invasive organism that's causing all the problems might be in that group of organisms.

301
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:35,800
So it does require a lot of discussions and advice to both the physicians and the other physicians

302
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:42,080
and work with the lab to make sure that everything is that needs to be done is being done.

303
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:48,720
So if the clinical presentation is not consistent with sepsis.

304
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:55,850
This is a decision only the doctor can make, and it may just be a contaminated blood culture.

305
00:34:55,850 --> 00:35:02,840
Also, if the probable contaminants. If the blood clots arise, that doesn't match an organism from the primary site of infection,

306
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:11,990
say you've got an E. coli UTI and the blood culture comes back with quite negative staph.

307
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:20,330
It's probably a contaminant. So there are probable pathogens in the way that you pick these out or you get growth of

308
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:26,360
the same organism in repeated cultures obtained at different times from different sites.

309
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:34,010
So three different vena punctures from different sites. A patient maybe has a UTI, maybe has pneumonia.

310
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:37,390
Things kind of go together that way.

311
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:43,520
And so a probable pathogen might also be a growth of certain organisms from patients with certain clinical presentation.

312
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:51,940
So Enterococcus is a common cause of endocarditis.

313
00:35:51,940 --> 00:36:01,420
So if you see growth metrics, strep pneumo, gram negative and robes and Group Strep, they may have similar clinical presentations.

314
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:07,000
It's an unusual group, but it might be a GI problem.

315
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:16,360
And also isolation the commensal same thing the climate Mr. Ethanol from patients is suspected of being bacterium and immunocompromised,

316
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:23,350
or they have a prosthetic device. That's what we really start seeing, especially the prosthetic devices when one prosthetic device,

317
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:30,820
quite negative stuff comes floating along its devices as I can stick to this and I can eat whatever I want from the blood.

318
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:34,780
I'll be happy. Patient has a prosthetic device.

319
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:41,730
You always worry about bloodstream infections in patients who have prosthetic devices.

320
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:50,640
Special considerations. OK. And this helps give special considerations, require special conditions.

321
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,180
They may be organisms that are infrequently recovered.

322
00:36:54,180 --> 00:37:00,390
So the lab is not adept at identifying them, and maybe it needs to go to Mayo or to the state lab.

323
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:08,340
It helps it for the doctor to notify the lab if he thinks his patient has a certain situation or disease,

324
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:13,740
or the disease is different than some others. And these are what the haystack organisms.

325
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:23,640
These are fastidious gram negative bacilli. They can be cause of causes of infective endocarditis with the haystack organisms.

326
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:27,540
They don't grow, they don't multiply as rapidly as other organisms do.

327
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:35,220
So it's not unusual to get a request of all the blood culture for 10 days or 14 days, as opposed to just five days.

328
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:40,650
And so some of these fastidious gram negative stuff that listed here Haemophilus profitless actual bacillus

329
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:46,200
actually mycetoma commandants took me a long time to learn how to spell that cardio bacterium hominids.

330
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:56,640
I know the Crohn's and king of Kings. We don't see them very, very often, but when we do, they're very serious and they can be quite resistant.

331
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:06,120
So we have special considerations here, also for fungi, so we can recover Candida and Cryptococcus in our in our standard black cultivars.

332
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,280
However.

333
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:17,250
If you're thinking about systemic fungi, still blast the and so we have to use the isolator with the blood in the area or lies the red blood cells.

334
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:18,480
Why is the white cells everything?

335
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:27,060
So I spin it down, you put the sediment on plates and so you set up a submerged place within with antibiotics and so on.

336
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:31,560
We rarely rarely isolate moles.

337
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:35,680
The actual mole form from blood cultures.

338
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:45,390
If the physician is considering a Michael bacterial infection, the laboratory absolutely needs to know about it because if the lab has a BSL three,

339
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:51,930
the model should be incubating back there because the rapid growers the group for mycobacteria can grow on a rapid blood culture,

340
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:59,100
our regular blood culture. And while we would think that everybody using optimal procedures when they tap

341
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:05,940
the bottle skin and some of the blood infected blood out doesn't always happen.

342
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:13,260
So if you're thinking about Mycobacterium avium and cellulari, it requires an isolator once again or a special bio.

343
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:19,230
And remember, tuberculosis does not cause bacteremia, but those atypical.

344
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:28,050
And then Brazil, Brazil is one of the most dangerous organisms that we can work with in the laboratory.

345
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:34,140
It may require venting. It may require extended hold.

346
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:39,060
It requires every person in the room. Whether they're a secretary attack.

347
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:44,550
The person washing the floors doesn't make any difference. Everybody's got to mask the envelope.

348
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:55,320
And so when you have a suspect brucella or the patient's head Myrcella before or the doctor says you're kind of worried about this, it needs to be.

349
00:39:55,320 --> 00:40:03,900
The bottles are only opened up in a laminar flow hood, and I can tie containment laboratory.

350
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:10,800
And if it is suspected, you must notify the laboratory immediately.

351
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:19,150
We want to keep everyone as safe as possible and it is highly infectious.

352
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:24,010
Next slide. So I always put this in protect your microbiologist.

353
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:32,450
So these organisms pose a significant occupational health risk to health care workers handling specimens and cultures.

354
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:37,870
Please notify the Klin Micro Lab if you suspect any of the following I'm not going to read the list to you.

355
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:45,880
They're all very dangerous to work with. Now I put COVID on here because we really don't know how dangerous it is.

356
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:53,920
It's the virus. I would think that people would not be inhaling it, but I put it on here because I thought we were safer doing it.

357
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,330
It's one of the I mean, avian influenza is here. Ebola is here.

358
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:02,380
Until we have more information on COVID, we know it has to be handled under containment.

359
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:09,320
Does it have to be a BSL three? I don't know. The others are BSL two, two and a half or three.

360
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:14,730
Next slide. So key points for lab diagnosis of bacteremia, the most critical factor,

361
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:20,560
and I've said this a couple of times now is the volume of blood collected, not the timing.

362
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:24,310
OK, a drop is not enough.

363
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:31,060
This, in fact, the data puncture site with chlorhexidine or two percent iodine tincture in adults and children go than two months old.

364
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:35,980
You cannot use chlorhexidine in children less than two months old. OK.

365
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:41,890
It's toxic for you. Draw the blood before initiating any therapy, if possible.

366
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:50,440
Sometimes therapies are even started in the emergency department, but as much as possible to get the specimens before you start therapy.

367
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:55,360
If the patient has a catheter and the suggestion is just draw the blood out of the catheter,

368
00:41:55,360 --> 00:42:00,610
no, there's a very high likelihood that that blood will be contaminated.

369
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:05,280
False positives never, ever refrigerate the blood prior information.

370
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:13,750
And these go directly to the laboratory. Do not submit catheter tips for culture without submitting your blood culture.

371
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:20,020
Also, because I know that we can take the catheter tip and sterilize, roll it on a plate or two and see what's on it.

372
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:27,430
But that doesn't really tell you what's in the blood. So if you want to submit a catheter tip, we have to have blood cultures.

373
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:38,620
Also for adult needs to be two to three sets of blood cultures for at least one Arabic and one in Arabic and each step for children.

374
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:46,540
Children only use Arabic bottles, and so one or two sets for one to one or two Arabic bottles for children.

375
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:50,950
The two bath draw at different times, though not at the same time.

376
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:57,490
And so when you think about the last thing, strep nouveaux and some other bacteria clearly are Arabic organisms,

377
00:42:57,490 --> 00:43:01,420
but sometimes the Arabic organisms grow best in anaerobic.

378
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:11,110
So if the growth first shows up in an anaerobic bottle and it's small gram positive Cox, you can't rule out strep pneumo or anything else.

379
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:21,350
You have to wait until you have some identification. So getting down to the end of blood cultures, how do we report the results?

380
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:27,350
So we report results immediately because it can impact patient care decisions.

381
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:35,390
That is a telephone call to the provider, the nurse, the physician herself on the floor that will take the fall for the patient.

382
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:41,600
And at the same time, the doctor may ask the laboratory a person who's making the call for the medical technologies.

383
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:46,910
Do you have other positive findings and they can report micro can report results from micro.

384
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:52,760
They can report results from chemistry and hematology that there could be a mistake made there.

385
00:43:52,760 --> 00:44:01,820
Initially, you report the number of positive blood cultures so that so patient has three blood cultures, steps down and tour positive.

386
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:09,050
There would be a common two or three blood cultures. Sets are positive around the report, as well as the Bernstein results.

387
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:11,480
You report as specifically as possible.

388
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:18,710
This is a life threatening illness and make sure that the person who's taking the report understands what you've just been saying.

389
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:24,140
So at the end of this, OK, do you have any questions? Yes, I didn't quite get this.

390
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:27,290
OK, well, let's go over this again.

391
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:34,580
Record the name and identification of the person other than the person taking the report that will be on the computer.

392
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:40,880
So if Jill Smith took the report, then may I have your I.D. number is my number.

393
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,480
The report was taken by Jim Smith, and here's the idea number right?

394
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:49,130
I'm on the computer. These are critical results.

395
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:53,990
The Joint Commission requires a positive read back of all results,

396
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:59,720
so we can say this report was taken by Jim Smith, and he reported the results positive.

397
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:12,420
Read back correctly. OK, same type question, which organism will grow on a standard blood culture about HIV and tuberculosis,

398
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:19,390
Plasmodium or Staphylococcus, if you miss this when you have to start this course over?

399
00:45:19,390 --> 00:45:25,090
Anybody want to take a guess? OK.

400
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:36,720
You got it. She just saved everybody. OK, now we're going to talk a little bit about sterile body fluids and tissues.

401
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:46,140
So we've been talking about blood important sterile body fluids, anything in the central nervous system.

402
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:51,260
So the spinal fluid. Any tissue, any biopsies, anywhere in the body are actually sterile.

403
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:57,720
Sterile body fluids can accumulate in any space in response to an infection.

404
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:02,940
Yeah, so let's ActionScript can also.

405
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:08,900
Hear that. Yeah, this is we're just going into another type of infection.

406
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:17,670
People could just throw bodies side so. So if you if you had a liver infection, that's a sterile body that could come from the blood.

407
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:26,430
Most likely, it will come from the blood. But sometimes patients had surgery, and you don't know it.

408
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:34,830
So example here on the slide is pleural fluid between the lung in the chest wall that should be sterile if effusion is is excess fluid,

409
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:40,500
it can develop in response to infection or malignancy or an autoimmune issue.

410
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,650
So it's not just an infection that can cause a fluid buildup.

411
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:53,550
There are other reasons it can result in responses to pulmonary infection and may contain the same types of organisms, but it may not.

412
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:57,150
So that's why there are a number of cultures done. Hopefully, they're all negative.

413
00:46:57,150 --> 00:47:03,210
But if they are, they compare them the organism identification and the susceptibility patterns.

414
00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:09,400
And in the here was the sterile body fluids. The specimens are collected by needle aspiration.

415
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:17,430
And a fairly large syringe. So if it's peritoneal fluid, OK, this is from the abdomen, abdomen,

416
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:27,180
peritoneal cavity contains gastrointestinal organs and the bladder, you've developed societies that fluid in accumulation.

417
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:34,560
Here, the organisms can come from the GI tract, the genital urinary tract, bloodstream or trauma.

418
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:39,060
So there could be a wide variety of different types of organisms causing infection of

419
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:47,520
the perineal have primary peritonitis can present in a variety of different ways.

420
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:53,280
There may be no apparent focus of infection, and the organisms may vary by age.

421
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:57,810
In children, though, children are like a whole new classification.

422
00:47:57,810 --> 00:48:07,410
In microbiology children peritonitis may be caused by strep normal, which is a strange place to have strep no group Streptococcus the terex,

423
00:48:07,410 --> 00:48:16,350
which yes, would be pretty common for staff in adult primary peritonitis can be caused by E. coli strep no.

424
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:22,830
More Group B strep again. So it just depends on where it's developing and what organism got into the wrong side.

425
00:48:22,830 --> 00:48:32,500
That's Premier Paradise. Now there's secondary peritonitis also, and that follows perforation of the visceral organs may be present in a car accident.

426
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:38,070
They get jammed in the abdomen or surgery or trauma or some sort of destructive disease.

427
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:43,080
And when this happens, you get a floor from the bowel.

428
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:45,420
And we all know the intestines have a wide variety,

429
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:50,310
especially large intestine has a wide variety of different types of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria,

430
00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:57,630
as well as yeast, and they can set up an infection, an infectious site, wherever they land.

431
00:48:57,630 --> 00:49:04,540
So it could be an terex could be anaerobic, could be Streptococcus, you don't know until you start working on it.

432
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:17,710
So there can also be infected peritoneal dialysis fluid, and this can happen with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis COPD.

433
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:25,300
And in this way, this works is that fluid is injected and removed as a substitute for kidney function.

434
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:32,950
It's performed through a catheter, so any skin organisms that get through that breaking the skin can set up an infection.

435
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:38,740
Common organisms here called negative staph staph aureus any other Streptococcus side,

436
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:49,210
but generally the Group Strep are not as common as some of the other Streptococcus and gram negative rods, Candida and the its.

437
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:52,420
Then we have pericardial fluid,

438
00:49:52,420 --> 00:50:00,160
and I can't think of much that is worse for having and fluid around the heart unless you start thinking about central nervous system fluid.

439
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,940
So the pericardium, as you all know, is the lining around the heart.

440
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:11,470
So excuse me, fluid can collect in that space between the pericardium and epithelium and viruses.

441
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:17,450
Now, we haven't said much about viruses. Today, viruses can infect pericardium.

442
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:25,280
As canned bacteria, then there's myocarditis, which is inflammation of heart muscle,

443
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:31,400
it is difficult to identify because most bacteria don't grow very well in culture.

444
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:36,980
So a lot of molecular assays and so on are useful.

445
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:42,200
Then we have joint fluid and joint fluid, highly infected.

446
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:47,240
There can be infectious arthritis that can affect any joint in the body.

447
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:57,920
The common organisms are the ones shown here staph aureus, the beta hemolytic strep, GCA, Neisseria gonorrhea and Haemophilus influenzae.

448
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:10,670
But it can be other organisms also. Then we can have an infections of bone or bone marrow live in bone marrow.

449
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:17,240
You can get a sample by aspiration or by a biopsy, and you can see on the slide.

450
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:24,110
A wide variety of different types of organisms can be present in bone marrow brucella,

451
00:51:24,110 --> 00:51:29,930
which fortunately is very uncommon histoplasmosis, blessed and psychosis and tuberculosis.

452
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:39,320
Like mainly, they can all be isolated from bone marrow, but they're not very common organisms that cause disseminating disease.

453
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:47,930
And HIV patients can also be found in bone biopsies, and there's a wide variety of those organisms.

454
00:51:47,930 --> 00:51:54,200
So if you get a bone biopsy, that's an indication that the physician thinks the patient has osteomyelitis.

455
00:51:54,200 --> 00:52:00,830
So there will also be a lot of histopathology going on in chemical testing about chemical testing also.

456
00:52:00,830 --> 00:52:10,280
So a potential bone infection results from hematology to spread from the initial site of the infection to the bone.

457
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:17,240
It can also invade from an adjacent site, can get there from trauma or surgery, or a lack of adequate circulation.

458
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:20,780
Some patients, particularly the elderly, don't have very good circulation.

459
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:30,440
Most common organism staph aureus and that is acquired mostly by a and thread spread through the blood vessels.

460
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:34,220
And then there can be infections of solid tissues in multiple etiology.

461
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:40,170
Just about any organism can infect solid tissue. Diagnosis is made be a surgery.

462
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:47,650
Get a sample out, send it to the lab or, unfortunately, autopsy.

463
00:52:47,650 --> 00:52:53,610
So what do we do in the lab? We.

464
00:52:53,610 --> 00:52:57,570
Get this person added as rapidly as possible.

465
00:52:57,570 --> 00:52:58,200
Hopefully,

466
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:07,710
they will not send them through the tube system because differences in air pressure in the tube system can have specimens leak out of the container.

467
00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:12,030
If they leak out of the container, other things can leak in. They are rejected.

468
00:53:12,030 --> 00:53:15,000
They have to walk to the laboratory,

469
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:22,350
so the fluids and aspects are collected by a needle aspiration minimum of one to five a.m. Sometimes you can't even get one male.

470
00:53:22,350 --> 00:53:27,360
You call the doctor and he will do what we can. But there's not much there.

471
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:33,240
More is better. One hundred mills is not necessary if you're looking for MTB.

472
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:38,580
We need more specimen. OK, more spokesman for MTV.

473
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:46,750
If you're looking for an anaerobe need to be assessed as part of the specimen needs to be sent in an anaerobic transport tube.

474
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:54,080
And then if it's synovial or peritoneal, those specimens can be inaccurate, inoculated into blood clot battles to increase the sensitivity.

475
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:57,850
Now you can still have multiple organisms growing in the blood culture bottle.

476
00:53:57,850 --> 00:54:05,840
And if you have a couple of different coordinators, staff, maybe an E. coli and maybe, uh, strep something like that,

477
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:12,490
physicians are going to have to figure out what's most important and probably treat a couple of the.

478
00:54:12,490 --> 00:54:20,920
Helps to have the gram stain of the finish of the initial specimens and the growth patterns on the initial plates.

479
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:26,230
You can see there's a lot of staph aureus and maybe just a few little cognitive staph fuel gram negative.

480
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:31,600
It's probably the staph aureus that's causing all the problems. What about bone and tissue?

481
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:40,010
We put it into an isolator for more specific workup. OK, what about sputum processing?

482
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:47,750
Excuse me, specimen processing. It's a if it's a fluid or an aspirin from into your site in the body, we're going to concentrate.

483
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:58,330
Spin it down. Concentrate. Take the sediment to a gram, stain on the sediment and use that sediment to set up the cultures as much as possible.

484
00:54:58,330 --> 00:55:04,930
Obviously, when we when we stand down, we'll have SERMO, but you can't get the sediment out without some of the fluid also.

485
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:16,060
But that sediment is very important if it's born. It is very, very difficult to grind bones because you know how hard bone is.

486
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:21,970
We can try and cut it into little pieces. But the risk is that the piece of the whole flying,

487
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:28,600
so generally what we would do if it's gone is drop it into both cultures and see if

488
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:35,090
we can subculture out of there after 24 or 48 hours and see if we grow anything.

489
00:55:35,090 --> 00:55:38,270
If it's tissue, we're going to grind it up, modernize it.

490
00:55:38,270 --> 00:55:48,140
We'll do a gram stain on the sediment and we will play it for appropriate gram positive culture, media, gram negative culture media.

491
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:52,160
If they say anything about a new story, if you will do that also.

492
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:58,280
So what we generally do in tissue nowadays is grind it out, put it some of it into black culture bottles.

493
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:04,930
In addition to setting up culture plates, bacteria seem to grow that seem to be grow faster and broth than they do on our plates.

494
00:56:04,930 --> 00:56:11,600
So we're really trying to improve things for the patient as rapidly as possible.

495
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:18,920
So another example type question how Fitzgerald fluids be processed for a room, stay disinfect with formaldehyde,

496
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:29,950
concentrate by centrifugation, homogenize of the tissue grinder or no processing negative if necessary.

497
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:36,220
If anybody said anything else. Oh yeah, be concentrate by centrifugation.

498
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:46,840
OK. That is the end of this slide show. Now any questions about this before we go on?

499
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:58,350
OK. If I can figure out how to do this, I have another.

500
00:56:58,350 --> 00:57:09,350
Another. While here someplace.

501
00:57:09,350 --> 00:57:20,320
OK, you're going to take a break. I find it. You get five minutes, another chance so that we we are still working on the grading on those.

502
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:38,220
OK, I'm going to have to get out of a number of things here.

503
00:57:38,220 --> 00:58:10,180
So we're going to stop this and. Okay.

504
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:18,570
Did you create the huh? Yeah, but I need to find another lecture, I don't, David.

505
00:58:18,570 --> 00:58:23,430
It's just yeah, right, yeah.

506
00:58:23,430 --> 00:58:29,430
Yes. OK.

507
00:58:29,430 --> 00:58:38,040
Verification that. And then I need to start Panopto again.

508
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:50,230
To just. One.

509
00:58:50,230 --> 00:58:54,630
This is due. OK. I just can't do that.

510
00:58:54,630 --> 00:59:00,390
Yeah. OK, so we're going to talk about validation of MALDI-TOF.

511
00:59:00,390 --> 00:59:10,840
So you may wonder why I'm talking about this. It has become one of the most useful pieces of equipment.

512
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:19,570
And testing types in the clinical micro laboratory, it can identify many, many organisms that we have never even heard of before,

513
00:59:19,570 --> 00:59:26,650
and that can become very confusing, but it can also identify everything very rapidly.

514
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:37,030
And so I want to talk a little bit about maldi-tof matrix system laser desorption ionization time of flight.

515
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:48,250
OK, so if anybody doesn't know about the bomber hospital in real life, looks like that was it, and I was on the third floor of this building.

516
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:55,070
OK, maldi-tof, do you verify or do you validate? Anyone know?

517
00:59:55,070 --> 01:00:01,670
You told me afterwards. It's all here in Cuba tech series are published by the American Society for Microbiology,

518
01:00:01,670 --> 01:00:07,310
and it tells you in this document 31 How to bring up a new test.

519
01:00:07,310 --> 01:00:10,970
Does it make a difference that equipment is still researchers don't use only, yes,

520
01:00:10,970 --> 01:00:17,030
it makes a big difference, like you can't charge for a test of its research use only for a test.

521
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:21,740
Does it make a difference if you verify or validate, you can all tell me that after this.

522
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:28,370
So why do we need FDA approval for our tests? Per 1998,

523
01:00:28,370 --> 01:00:35,900
FDA considered microbial identification system says nonexempt medical devices and required premarket five

524
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:44,750
10-K submission and review that slowed down everything was very hard to get a new test out on the market.

525
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:57,140
The 1997 FDA Modernization Act reclassified this type of medical device as a Class one exempt status and no longer required five 10k clearance.

526
01:00:57,140 --> 01:01:01,730
Today, these ID devices only need to be registered with the FDA.

527
01:01:01,730 --> 01:01:11,330
That's all they need to do. It doesn't mean you can misuse them, but they do need to be registered with the FDA to meet current FDA standards.

528
01:01:11,330 --> 01:01:15,980
They must meet the same criteria as prior to reclassification.

529
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:23,960
We have to establish performance characteristics and criteria as if we were submitting it to the government for a five take,

530
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:30,680
and the data package must be assembled and retained for the life of the product and kept available for FDA inspection.

531
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:35,180
Lifetime not for 10 years, 20 years his lifetime.

532
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:44,990
The MALDI-TOF systems have not gone through prior 510 approval and FDA approval is necessary.

533
01:01:44,990 --> 01:01:51,460
But why? Why do we have to have FDA approval?

534
01:01:51,460 --> 01:02:00,640
The reason is Medicare does not pay for services, which it considers to be experimental or for research use.

535
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:05,770
Therefore, takes it the bench may not know which tests will be billed to Medicare.

536
01:02:05,770 --> 01:02:13,930
In fact, I can guarantee you they don't know which tests will be built Medicare. They're too busy to separate Medicare versus non Medicare specimens.

537
01:02:13,930 --> 01:02:20,500
That's a very inefficient way to go. You just work them all up and then let the billing system take care of.

538
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:28,930
Other third party payers may have different coverage conditions, but for most hospital laboratories, this is the way that it is done.

539
01:02:28,930 --> 01:02:38,400
So definitions of verification versus validation verification is a one time process performed to determine or confirm it.

540
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:45,280
Tests expected performance prior to implementation of that test in the lab, as I put it here, simply,

541
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:53,060
does the test work because we have validated some tests in the past that didn't meet their claims.

542
01:02:53,060 --> 01:03:03,090
And they went back. Validation is an ongoing process, monitoring each test to make sure it continues to perform as expected.

543
01:03:03,090 --> 01:03:06,030
Simply put, as I said, does this test still work?

544
01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:12,360
It can include personnel competency, which is mandatory in the laboratories assessment, quality control,

545
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:17,040
proficiency testing, and all of these are part of the Laboratories Quality Assurance Program.

546
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:21,240
You're asking me, I can see the looks on your faces. Why do we have to listen to this?

547
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:26,880
Because as future infection prevention as you need to know this information.

548
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:36,290
A laboratory maybe may have to say at some point in time. I'm sorry, we can't do this test until we finish this evaluation.

549
01:03:36,290 --> 01:03:44,040
And then the test would have to be sent out to another lab and probably have a delay in receipt of specimen of results.

550
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:52,140
So a modified test is an FDA cleared or approved test performed outside of package insert instructions,

551
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:58,440
so we have a test for influenza on, say, throat.

552
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:02,340
And the physician calls and says, Oh, please could to do it on this serum.

553
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:04,210
No, we can't. We can't.

554
01:04:04,210 --> 01:04:14,220
We all get in trouble with the government laboratory developed tests or procedures developed in-house that have not been cleared by FDA.

555
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:20,610
They may incorporate commercial reagents not cleared by the FDA for diagnostic use or reagents produced in-house.

556
01:04:20,610 --> 01:04:26,130
They are generally research used only procedures and generally not used in clinical labs.

557
01:04:26,130 --> 01:04:33,130
They may be used in research labs. What is verification?

558
01:04:33,130 --> 01:04:43,090
Verification is making sure that the test performs as the manufacturer's specified specifications state.

559
01:04:43,090 --> 01:04:53,700
So what do you talk about getting FDA cleared and approved diagnostic ID or any antibiotic susceptibility test?

560
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:58,200
And when does it have to be done for any new test procedure or a different manufacturer?

561
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:05,490
So you can tell there's a lot of quality assurance going on in the clinical micro lab as they bring your new test or they might change reagents.

562
01:05:05,490 --> 01:05:09,540
How is it done? There will be might be several analysis on at least 20 specimens.

563
01:05:09,540 --> 01:05:24,360
These are not huge hundreds of specimens assays, but we have to make sure that in our hands, the test performs stated a minimum of 20 specimens.

564
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:29,670
Well, these are if you're going to do a verification, I haven't really gone through the verification components.

565
01:05:29,670 --> 01:05:35,970
We have to look for accuracy. And this requires both sensitivity and specificity testing.

566
01:05:35,970 --> 01:05:44,370
We have to look for reproducibility if we test the same sample five times or 10 times when we get the same result.

567
01:05:44,370 --> 01:05:49,170
What is the reportable range? Does it hit that reportable range when it should?

568
01:05:49,170 --> 01:05:52,980
What is the normal reference range? If it has one?

569
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:58,860
And are there any other test characteristics that are applicable, such as precision analytical measurement,

570
01:05:58,860 --> 01:06:06,630
range, etc. So there are a number of factors that have to be included in a verification process.

571
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:13,960
So if we have an unmodified FDA cleared test, we have to test for accuracy.

572
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:19,980
Now we have to test at least 20 specimens of those 20 specimens, a mixture of both positive and negative specimens.

573
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:26,410
And depending on the reference method, you should achieve at least 90 percent accuracy.

574
01:06:26,410 --> 01:06:31,290
We have to test for reproducibility. Can you get the same result?

575
01:06:31,290 --> 01:06:38,850
On several specimens at the same time, so several members of the 20 specimen panel want a duplicate or triplicate,

576
01:06:38,850 --> 01:06:48,950
a second run and with a second different operator just to make sure that it is reproducible and you get the same or comparable results.

577
01:06:48,950 --> 01:06:55,880
Next slide. So what if we have have to do a verification of an unmodified FDA cleared test?

578
01:06:55,880 --> 01:07:00,140
We have a reportable range and we have a reference range.

579
01:07:00,140 --> 01:07:06,410
OK. So the reportable range includes positives from a 20 specimen panel with low and high values.

580
01:07:06,410 --> 01:07:11,210
And you should be able to you must be able to detect both weak and strong positives.

581
01:07:11,210 --> 01:07:14,810
You can only detect strong positives. You're missing something.

582
01:07:14,810 --> 01:07:18,470
You can only detect weak when you're seeing all the others around. Are there was a bad specimen?

583
01:07:18,470 --> 01:07:24,630
No, we need to be able to detect accurately both weak and strong positives.

584
01:07:24,630 --> 01:07:30,120
If you look at the reference range, the normal range, you can use negative specimens from a 20 specimen panel.

585
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:36,330
The values need to be negative or produce values below the cutoff for a positive.

586
01:07:36,330 --> 01:07:41,700
You can use a manufacturer's reference range in the package insert if you're testing the same

587
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:47,370
patient population of the same type of patient population that the manufacturer tested.

588
01:07:47,370 --> 01:07:56,730
And you can also use a published reference range and all this is in X-51A or the CMS document.

589
01:07:56,730 --> 01:08:04,260
How do you verify an unmodified FDA cleared test? You have to have a verification panel and you can use your own patient eyes.

590
01:08:04,260 --> 01:08:14,910
So most laboratories save positive blood culture, isolates them in the refrigerator and save them for six months or a year,

591
01:08:14,910 --> 01:08:18,100
depending on how many positives you have and when you run out of space.

592
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:24,420
And so you can use your own patient isolates, your current identification test will serve as the reference method,

593
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:31,080
and then you can send out to an outside lab if there's no agreement between the new method and your reference method.

594
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:34,590
You can get isolates from another laboratory or from the vendor.

595
01:08:34,590 --> 01:08:41,670
It's very common here in the metro area to call one of our colleagues at a different lab and say, Hey, can you verify a new test?

596
01:08:41,670 --> 01:08:49,260
Can you? What do you have in this for this organism? I need to borrow so we all do it isolates through test.

597
01:08:49,260 --> 01:08:54,360
It can be from proficiency. Samples are from quality control isolates.

598
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:59,080
They should be an appropriate matrix having analyzed in the clinically relevant concentration.

599
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:06,510
So you don't want to test something that the analyzed identification is way up here when the normal reference range is down here.

600
01:09:06,510 --> 01:09:12,120
You can use spike samples. They can be from your own lab or provided by a vendor.

601
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:16,920
They have to be an appropriate matrix and the analyzed and clinically relevant concentrations.

602
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:24,340
But there are a number of ways to do a verification of an unmodified FDA cleared test.

603
01:09:24,340 --> 01:09:26,470
So going on with this,

604
01:09:26,470 --> 01:09:36,190
operators doing the verification who routinely do patient testing should do the verification and verification so you don't bring in someone special,

605
01:09:36,190 --> 01:09:45,250
you don't have the boss doing the person doing the work normally. Vendors often offer to assist with that.

606
01:09:45,250 --> 01:09:52,810
It's OK only if it's a fully automated system where interoperate availability is not an issue.

607
01:09:52,810 --> 01:09:57,370
If they offer to do all the work, hands-on work on the bench. No, no.

608
01:09:57,370 --> 01:10:04,330
There's I don't want to say that I wouldn't trust any vendor, but I do know of things that have happened.

609
01:10:04,330 --> 01:10:12,640
We can get free reagents and data analysis for complex systems from a variety of different sources.

610
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:19,300
And I will tell you that all the labs in one area help everybody else out with this.

611
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:24,940
What about modified test or lab developed tests? These are a little bit different.

612
01:10:24,940 --> 01:10:31,420
So a modification examples change and sample handling, incubation time or temperature.

613
01:10:31,420 --> 01:10:40,540
OK, so say normally you test a sample within 24 hours of receipt in the laboratory for some analyte?

614
01:10:40,540 --> 01:10:46,430
Well, the hospital just acquires another facility and it is three hours away.

615
01:10:46,430 --> 01:10:54,100
They want to send their specimens over. You're not going to get it within an hour. So you have to do some validation so that.

616
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:59,120
There can be a change in specimen of reagent dilution changing different calibration material.

617
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:06,220
But you might want to see if you can eliminate a procedure step to make the procedure a whole bit faster.

618
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:10,990
There can be a change in the cutoff method, calculating the cutoff for severe quantitative assays.

619
01:11:10,990 --> 01:11:23,350
But any change in intended use, you have to make sure that you test different types of samples plasma blood, CSF, other body fluids, urine and so on.

620
01:11:23,350 --> 01:11:30,470
If you if you're using a test for screening versus diagnostic or vice versa, you have to test that out.

621
01:11:30,470 --> 01:11:43,330
And if you're changing the type of analysis, qualitative versus quantitative, there needs to be tested thoroughly also, and this is all part of clear.

622
01:11:43,330 --> 01:11:51,040
So what about verification versus establishment of performance characteristics under Clear Labs

623
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:57,340
must perform established performance characteristics of modified test or lab developed tests.

624
01:11:57,340 --> 01:12:06,370
OK. These require more analyzes, more rigorous studies, and I'll tell you, the laboratory staff, oh, here.

625
01:12:06,370 --> 01:12:10,480
But if it has to be done, it has to be done classes.

626
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:19,960
Verification studies plus analytical sensitivity, specificity, interfering substances and and others are applicable for these rigorous studies.

627
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:25,360
The College of American Pathologists says perform validation study of test samples

628
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:30,100
or collection devices or use other than those specified in the package insert.

629
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:38,290
So you're changing some conditions here. You have to validate modified test cutoff values for positive results.

630
01:12:38,290 --> 01:12:45,370
And also, if the modified assay has at least equivalent performance in the validation.

631
01:12:45,370 --> 01:12:50,140
Studies include a reasonable distribution of samples for each specimen type.

632
01:12:50,140 --> 01:12:56,380
So maybe 15 samples of serum 20 samples of urine spinal fluid is more difficult

633
01:12:56,380 --> 01:13:02,170
to get maybe 10 samples of the wide variety of different types of samples.

634
01:13:02,170 --> 01:13:10,680
And if you go back to the Q and took thirty one, it's it gives you. The Rebecca group recommended number of samples to test.

635
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:24,420
So there are guidelines for modified tests and lab developed tests if it's at least 50 positive specimens and at least 100 negative specimens,

636
01:13:24,420 --> 01:13:29,970
celebrities and 150 specimens, which is not an insignificant number.

637
01:13:29,970 --> 01:13:39,690
The rationale is that it's scientifically justified and labs performing lab tests a modified test have to have the resources to do larger studies.

638
01:13:39,690 --> 01:13:48,390
If you're going to take this one, the number of samples can also depend on how much modification you're doing to the test.

639
01:13:48,390 --> 01:13:53,370
And this is a recommendation. Neither player can specify the number of specimens.

640
01:13:53,370 --> 01:13:59,520
But if the laboratory then gets inspected and they've only done five or 10 specimens or 20 specimens,

641
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:09,160
that's not enough and they will get get done that. So you have to then write a verification report and summarize the performance of your

642
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:14,600
verification study did make your acceptance criteria that you set out in the beginning.

643
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:20,470
Yeah. And that should be in your verification protocol. You have to attach a raw data.

644
01:14:20,470 --> 01:14:28,810
The director of the laboratory or designee, must sign off on it, stating that even though you're using an alternate sample type,

645
01:14:28,810 --> 01:14:35,170
the test performs as its manufacturer specified and then you have to keep the data for at least.

646
01:14:35,170 --> 01:14:44,220
The life of the athlete was two years. So we have some problems.

647
01:14:44,220 --> 01:14:53,070
You need to verify a new acid, but there is no data from the manufacturer with which to compare.

648
01:14:53,070 --> 01:14:56,670
You need to determine accuracy and precision reproducibility,

649
01:14:56,670 --> 01:15:02,580
and you don't really have any reference ranges or reportable ranges when I die indentifying organisms.

650
01:15:02,580 --> 01:15:10,850
So what are you going to do? You can't send everything out to a reference lab where you won't have a laboratory.

651
01:15:10,850 --> 01:15:17,780
So to determine the accuracy of a test, at least 20 eyes, that's probably more.

652
01:15:17,780 --> 01:15:24,230
And we have interpreted this to be a 20 step or is 20 E. coli, 24 kilos, 20 Merci, et cetera.

653
01:15:24,230 --> 01:15:29,150
For less common isolates, test at least five. And here, once again, call your friends in other labs.

654
01:15:29,150 --> 01:15:32,600
Get isolates sent to you.

655
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:43,350
You can do a mix of gram positive and gram negative, and you need at least 90 percent agreement with the method currently in use in your laboratory.

656
01:15:43,350 --> 01:15:51,210
And remember, if it's not FDA approved, you may have to defend it use to a College of American Pathologists inspector.

657
01:15:51,210 --> 01:15:57,720
And those are the people who licensed the laboratory. What about precision and reproducibility?

658
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:58,800
We've already talked about this.

659
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:07,710
This is fairly easy to repeat with multiple isolates to ensure the same or nearly the same results are obtained and have since and

660
01:16:07,710 --> 01:16:15,590
then have several technologies perform the assay with multiple rounds to ensure reproducibility that takes care of that very easily.

661
01:16:15,590 --> 01:16:20,480
What about pre analytical factors, and there are many pre analytical factors there could be culture,

662
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:27,680
media or the the tube that or a specimen container as it's received in the laboratory that can affect the test.

663
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:33,320
Is the media the differential or selective? Does it contain antibiotics? How long do you expect?

664
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:37,310
What's the temperature of incubation? Is that thirty five? Is it thirty one to thirty eight?

665
01:16:37,310 --> 01:16:41,600
What is it? How many subcultures of the ISO do you need to do?

666
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:48,540
Do you need a formic acid overlay and what's the density of the organism for spotting on a slide?

667
01:16:48,540 --> 01:16:58,440
So if you look at Gram negative ices for it and burn them down at a loss in St. Louis looked at media effects with gram negative bacteria,

668
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:04,740
both per gram negatives and glucose, not from any gram negatives 24 and 25.

669
01:17:04,740 --> 01:17:08,940
The entire gram negatives results were similar with or without formic acid.

670
01:17:08,940 --> 01:17:13,950
Plus were identified if grown on Hector, but they are no misidentifications.

671
01:17:13,950 --> 01:17:19,650
So there was pure growth, less growth on Hector than on another gram negative plate.

672
01:17:19,650 --> 01:17:25,440
If they looked at non fermenters, there was one misidentification from McConkey.

673
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:30,180
Burkholderia gladioli was identified as Ginny's, I can't pronounce it,

674
01:17:30,180 --> 01:17:38,930
but otherwise IDs ratio greater than 90 percent to less than 60 percent on some media.

675
01:17:38,930 --> 01:17:44,360
What about additional studies necessary of Gram negatives? What about growth temperature?

676
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:52,490
What if you think increasing the temperature or decreasing the temperature may affect the rate of identification?

677
01:17:52,490 --> 01:17:59,540
If you look at the entire types of bacteria, approximately 94 percent were identified after patient 37 degrees,

678
01:17:59,540 --> 01:18:03,350
but this dropped by 24 25 percent when incubating at four degrees.

679
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:06,990
So the temperature of incubation is critical with the non fermenters.

680
01:18:06,990 --> 01:18:13,700
The rate of identification was cut in half at room temperature and declined a little over 30 one percent of four.

681
01:18:13,700 --> 01:18:21,880
So temperature makes a huge difference. What about serial subcultures for both groups of Gram negative organisms,

682
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:26,640
the farmers in the non from the scores and rates of ID are essentially identical.

683
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:31,140
In fact, there's a subculture that's good. What about heavy versus light inoculum?

684
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:36,690
I know we've mentioned have you knock on the light and I've done in the entire group

685
01:18:36,690 --> 01:18:42,780
heavy inoculum with the formic acid overlay was better in the non phonetic group.

686
01:18:42,780 --> 01:18:49,450
Why don't I come with formic acid was inferior, so it makes a big difference.

687
01:18:49,450 --> 01:18:54,110
What about post the analytic factors?

688
01:18:54,110 --> 01:19:03,980
If you looked at scoring for us, you use the proper maldi-tof, which is one of the two big modified tax systems in the United States.

689
01:19:03,980 --> 01:19:08,420
They cut off scoring cut off for a positive as a two point zero.

690
01:19:08,420 --> 01:19:13,840
And for some, it might go down. You've you're only got to identify to the genus. It's 1.7.

691
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:19,150
OK. But when Britain found that the terror group.

692
01:19:19,150 --> 01:19:26,290
All eyes that's greater than equal to one point nine score incorrectly identified to species level, and that you could use the score for Guinness,

693
01:19:26,290 --> 01:19:37,030
also resulting in 80 percent total correct identifications, which was a six point seventy five percent agreement and the not from that group.

694
01:19:37,030 --> 01:19:40,660
This was divided into fastidious isolates versus non fastidious isolates.

695
01:19:40,660 --> 01:19:43,630
The fastidious isolates didn't grow Aynak.

696
01:19:43,630 --> 01:19:52,900
The non fastidious, did grow in that they use 2.0 for identification of fastidious isolates and used one point nine for non fastidious isolates,

697
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:58,690
and they raised the overall ID rate for this group seventy seven percent.

698
01:19:58,690 --> 01:20:04,720
So what about proteolytic factors for Gram positive could be media need for a formic acid overlay on your on your plate,

699
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:15,640
these the isolate icon density of spotting how much organism you put on, how frequently is the organism re cultured and the incubation temperature.

700
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:24,730
And so for gram positive organisms, when you use maldi-tof and MALDI-TOF clearly is the way to go nowadays for

701
01:20:24,730 --> 01:20:30,040
grandpa's device of the heavier inoculum with a formic acid overlay works best.

702
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:35,500
Yeah, a lot of organism there, and the formic acid keeps anything else from being in there.

703
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:42,070
It's essential for strep, but doesn't necessarily increase the number of identifications of staff.

704
01:20:42,070 --> 01:20:49,070
But if you don't know if it's a staff or a strip, you just do formic acid on everything.

705
01:20:49,070 --> 01:20:53,030
So what about media studies program positives, so you could take?

706
01:20:53,030 --> 01:20:56,210
Can you use any media to take an eyeful of that?

707
01:20:56,210 --> 01:21:03,710
Like, the blood out of us is a chocolate tiger versus some other type of lager and do your spotting on your plate for MALDI-TOF.

708
01:21:03,710 --> 01:21:10,130
No, I sort were misidentified at any incubation temperature by four degrees with slightly better than a temperature of 35 degrees.

709
01:21:10,130 --> 01:21:15,800
But how often do we incubate cultures at four degrees then have on average

710
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:20,810
maldi-tof scores were not significantly better or different if I saw two of them?

711
01:21:20,810 --> 01:21:24,140
She bled over chocolate or plus another Sargassum,

712
01:21:24,140 --> 01:21:32,690
which is a gram negative media with the grand prize in media with antibiotics in it for to get rid of gram negatives.

713
01:21:32,690 --> 01:21:37,250
I thought you were so cultured up to five days and analyzed each day.

714
01:21:37,250 --> 01:21:41,820
Scores of correctly identified isolates were nearly identical, but identification of isolates decreases.

715
01:21:41,820 --> 01:21:50,650
Subculture increased. And finally, formic acid increased the number of gram positive isolates identified by Maldi.

716
01:21:50,650 --> 01:21:56,060
So what about status for this is the score that is given by the MALDI-TOF.

717
01:21:56,060 --> 01:22:04,180
Okay, so you as an infection prevention, as you call the lab and say, Hey, you reported this and I don't really understand what you're talking about.

718
01:22:04,180 --> 01:22:07,600
Well, that's the spectral score similarities that the susceptibility know.

719
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:13,880
That's totally different. This is how we identify it and how you can.

720
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:21,110
Trust the identification that we give you. And so the reduction of speckle score for grandpa went from two to one point

721
01:22:21,110 --> 01:22:25,940
seven and increase the genus level identification fifteen point five percent,

722
01:22:25,940 --> 01:22:32,600
increase species level identification to fourteen point three percent and only there's only one myth identified Iceland.

723
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:34,790
So here's an example.

724
01:22:34,790 --> 01:22:47,600
Test data When a laboratory validate a new test such as MALDI-TOF and compares it to either another maldi-tof or two biochemical identification,

725
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:54,230
we have to say what we got if there were no peaks found that the error who it did didn't.

726
01:22:54,230 --> 01:23:00,800
It was not positive when it should have been if there was no reliable identification and so on.

727
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:04,170
And if there was no work on a particular type of media and all of this testing,

728
01:23:04,170 --> 01:23:08,570
when you're validating something goes into the procedure that you use in your laboratory.

729
01:23:08,570 --> 01:23:12,950
So if you can't take it off gram negative media, mcconkey and so on,

730
01:23:12,950 --> 01:23:20,420
you're going to to a blood culture, blood on your plate or top it on your plate to do the Maldi.

731
01:23:20,420 --> 01:23:25,430
And here's Maldi results with fastidious bacteria, and we have a positive possible.

732
01:23:25,430 --> 01:23:30,530
Bordetella pertussis and NBC age confirm that that would be our health department here.

733
01:23:30,530 --> 01:23:36,500
The positive another positive pertussis. And you can see they go to M.D. result was heavy.

734
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:40,520
They're not feeling well, the result of light inoculum and from different types of media.

735
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:44,660
These are from blood already from McConkey other than it was extraction needed.

736
01:23:44,660 --> 01:23:50,190
So this all of this goes into validating maldi-tof for use in laboratories.

737
01:23:50,190 --> 01:23:59,120
Now, MALDI-TOF has been in use, probably for the last 10 years or so, and there are still it's an expensive system.

738
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:01,940
There are still laboratories that are bringing it up,

739
01:24:01,940 --> 01:24:08,290
and they need to consider things like this and they do consider things like this when doing a verification.

740
01:24:08,290 --> 01:24:17,320
So we get one bomber, when we first got our maldi-tof, we did least first because they were more difficult to identify the bacteria.

741
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:22,450
So we did this first and we got all killed.

742
01:24:22,450 --> 01:24:28,420
The only problem we had was all. Candida cruisy slash inconspicuously were identified just as Candida cruisy.

743
01:24:28,420 --> 01:24:36,040
I couldn't separate out the two and one Candida from Canada was Can the Lusitania by all the time?

744
01:24:36,040 --> 01:24:38,770
Who knows if that got contaminated somewhere along the line?

745
01:24:38,770 --> 01:24:44,220
But other than that, we had ideal results and these are not going to go through these easily.

746
01:24:44,220 --> 01:24:48,970
Our yeast results, you can see how many we did. It was a never ending process.

747
01:24:48,970 --> 01:24:56,980
So verification guidelines for a not FDA approved test, but the FDA verification is easy if it's not FDA.

748
01:24:56,980 --> 01:25:02,500
It is more difficult. You decide whether you're going to start with the gram positive or gram negative isolate.

749
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:03,790
Most places don't do both.

750
01:25:03,790 --> 01:25:12,490
At the same time, the isolate should mirror those that you see in your laboratory, and you need to test hundreds of organisms.

751
01:25:12,490 --> 01:25:19,690
OK. Generally, it's not hard to do this. You don't do it in one week, but you can easily do it in two or three weeks.

752
01:25:19,690 --> 01:25:28,910
Try to test at least 20 of each common species. For less common isolates, at least five of each and do reproducibility studies.

753
01:25:28,910 --> 01:25:34,960
If you use the same Iceland five times, you get the same result five times.

754
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:39,100
How you do with at least the reproducibility with at least two different people doing it,

755
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:43,100
then you decide which medium will you will use to get the best results.

756
01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:49,810
And you can suggest the use of heavy or dense spots with formic acid overlays in duplicate, if that's what turned out best for you.

757
01:25:49,810 --> 01:25:53,800
That was what turned out next for us. We used it.

758
01:25:53,800 --> 01:26:02,500
So additional verification guidelines, after analyzing your test scores, determine if you will lower your cutoff scores.

759
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:06,910
Did you test work better or worse than what you are using?

760
01:26:06,910 --> 01:26:16,330
Determine how you'll handle those results when MALDI-TOF does not identify this real easy way here in Michigan State is free and they'll do it.

761
01:26:16,330 --> 01:26:23,500
You need reference methods, but they don't do susceptibility testing so many lives lost in the mail or something like that.

762
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:26,890
Determine if you won't report results before it is FDA approved.

763
01:26:26,890 --> 01:26:34,990
Most labs will not do that because they can't charge for the test once it's FDA approved or you do a full analysis, you can.

764
01:26:34,990 --> 01:26:42,830
You can do that. And that's this is a discussion with the attorneys at the institution.

765
01:26:42,830 --> 01:26:44,270
OK.

766
01:26:44,270 --> 01:26:53,060
The equipment maybe research use only by the end of any year when the equipment comes out within that year, in the next year, it will be FDA approved.

767
01:26:53,060 --> 01:26:56,090
Now this was specifically talking about MALDI-TOF,

768
01:26:56,090 --> 01:27:06,770
but there's newer equipment from different types of assays for molecular assays and so on that it may not be FDA approved salesperson comes says,

769
01:27:06,770 --> 01:27:14,450
Hey, we've got a new test here. I'll try it out. You know, if it works for you, we could sell it to you before it's FDA approved.

770
01:27:14,450 --> 01:27:18,460
Try it out. See what happens? OK.

771
01:27:18,460 --> 01:27:25,840
Here's just a bunch of references. OK, that is it for the lecture today.

772
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:31,810
I wanted to bring that up to you because you all will be working in different situations.

773
01:27:31,810 --> 01:27:38,560
Some places will have a very large what. Some places will have a very limited, limited amount of work that they do in their microbiology lab.

774
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:46,300
And you need to know what's available. You can always call your colleagues at other institutions, say, what would you do in this situation?

775
01:27:46,300 --> 01:27:54,980
And then gently bring that up to your superiors. OK. Any questions?

776
01:27:54,980 --> 01:28:00,320
Yes. I am not the second part here.

777
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:07,770
Yeah, no, I just wanted to bring it up. I mean, maldi-tof will be on it, but how do you validated a license?

778
01:28:07,770 --> 01:28:13,210
No. OK. I want to bring it up because you never know what you're going to be working on.

779
01:28:13,210 --> 01:28:18,720
I want to give you as much information as possible. OK.

780
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:23,680
Yes. I guess I'm sorry.

781
01:28:23,680 --> 01:28:31,470
We'll be examining. Well, would you do the one?

782
01:28:31,470 --> 01:28:36,710
Well, I don't know what is. I thought it.

783
01:28:36,710 --> 01:28:43,650
Yeah, I think it's whatever they I think I told you the twentieth, the twenty twenty three.

784
01:28:43,650 --> 01:28:47,760
I thought maybe the twenty seven, it's one of the worst.

785
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:53,400
It's assigned by the first day of the week that your question for us is on Monday.

786
01:28:53,400 --> 01:29:00,960
But I'll tell you the next week. Or you can call you miss that if you look for a final exam schedule.

787
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:08,290
Twenty twenty two. Whatever. OK. What a question.

788
01:29:08,290 --> 01:29:20,080
Yes. No. No, what they have to here.

789
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:48,746
Any other questions? OK, don't be jealous that I really want to hear you play, but one of these days I'll outside, maybe know, probably better.
