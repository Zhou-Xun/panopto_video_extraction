1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,750
All right. So today's going to be a fairly straightforward day.

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:14,160
We are going to go over the quiz and then the chance to work on problems at five, which is last year's midterm.

3
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,519
So you'll get a chance to go through midterms, see what they look like.

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:25,530
And then the engaged learning for today is actually like a little survey quiz me that I have set up on canvas.

5
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:30,120
You just need to fill that out and that counts for your points. I'm fine.

6
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,449
If like, if you're solid on the quiz, that's really cool.

7
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:40,799
If you want to just like, head up, that's fine. I don't think you have to, but I am offering the invitation and then say when we get through the quiz,

8
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,570
if you feel like you're good in my mind, if you leave early but you can stay.

9
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:51,299
Obviously, I would love to have you, but just giving you the option, I won't do that either.

10
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:56,010
So. All righty. So yeah, that's basically what I just said.

11
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:02,040
We are going to also review problem set for six because there are some questions.

12
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:10,740
Yeah. And before I forget some pre midterm announcements, it will be a paper test in section next week.

13
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:14,699
So I will hand it out. Class for you.

14
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:23,340
Writing utensils, please. I will try to remember to bring some, but I might forget a project and bring a calculator graphing aside.

15
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,930
You could ostensibly do this without a calculator. It would just be division.

16
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:32,640
So if you want to divide long decimals by hand, that's fine. But pretty calculator.

17
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:36,720
No smartphones, please. So it has to be a double calculator.

18
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:42,450
Do you guys have extras here? Oh, yeah. Good point. And the other said she was going to try to find some.

19
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:48,000
Any of it? Somebody doesn't have one. I don't have one. And I am going to try to find it.

20
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,980
I'll try to remember to add like the ones I have lying around at home, too.

21
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,580
Yeah. Just like a regular. Yep. Anything I can do today.

22
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:02,190
So you're basically just going to be calculating ratios, proportions, is that right?

23
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:05,610
So anything that can divide is good, but please don't use your phone.

24
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:13,370
But there is some information material we know like we can, stuff like or files or anything.

25
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:21,090
So there might be true. False. So the problem set file that you're going to work on today and it's also your homework is

26
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:27,920
last year's midterm so it will be your midterm coming up will be very similar to what

27
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:34,470
problems that by this yeah so a chance and then all the documentation should be online

28
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:38,550
you will see an example at the formula sheet looks like so you can get comfy with that.

29
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:44,070
So yeah. Okay. So any questions before I move on?

30
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:49,770
Okay. All right. So quiz.

31
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:53,790
How do we feel about the quiz? Question six is hard.

32
00:02:54,150 --> 00:03:02,580
Question six is hard. Know there is one guy I don't remember. I think, okay, well, we will get through and you talk about it with me here.

33
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:11,580
Okay, cool. So the mathematical formula where the numerator is not contained in the denominator, I know it's a curve, but it's a ratio.

34
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:17,790
Are there any questions about this? Okay, this is one of the subtleties of the epidemiology.

35
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:21,239
I just want to say we're bouncing around a lot that the ratios of proportions and

36
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,170
just keeping track of what is what's in our denominator is really essential.

37
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:31,170
Like this is this is mostly epi is just like making sure that the group you're looking at is the correct group.

38
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:35,160
So if you keep those two kind of squared away, then okay.

39
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:43,950
All right. I'm referring to this figure at baseline zero years.

40
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:48,780
How many persons are at risk of the disease? Anyone want to answer?

41
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:56,099
I know the answers up here, but the speed of and.

42
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,190
Yeah, exactly. So is there any questions about this?

43
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:03,600
Does this diagram make sense? Is there. Okay, I'm seeing some nodding.

44
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:07,500
If you are too shy to say no, you can come up to me later.

45
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:17,640
That's right. All right. So what is the total number of person years of follow up during the five year study?

46
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:22,710
It is 11. Did people understand how to find this value?

47
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,110
Do you know why it is 11? Yes, yes, yes.

48
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:37,479
I'm saying some. Okay. All right. If you have any questions about this, please, you can feel free to reach out.

49
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:45,240
That's terrific. And then what is the incidence of the disease?

50
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:50,230
It's one case per one person is why is it just one case, not two?

51
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:55,920
Because one participant showed up with an existing case.

52
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,250
So they're not counted as a double. Nina Exactly. Yeah.

53
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:02,450
Okay.

54
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:11,450
The number of deaths due to a disease occurring in persons with that is with that disease over a certain period of time is the case fatality rate.

55
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:17,240
Mortality rate would simply just be people out of the entire population.

56
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:21,560
Police brutality rating specifically looking at deaths among folks who have the disease.

57
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:28,970
Does that make sense? And it's not really a rate. It's it's kind of this weird thing that we call the rate anyway.

58
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:35,660
Any questions about that? No. Okay. Okay.

59
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,389
So this is saying there is a population in Detroit.

60
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:49,219
We have two time periods, January one, 2000, at which point we have 700,000 people without lung cancer.

61
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:54,080
And then there is a follow up period.

62
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:55,970
Oh, yes. Yeah. I'm sorry.

63
00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:05,120
So we have a million people without lung cancer on January one, 2000, and then you have 700,000 people with cancer and December 31st, 29.

64
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:13,660
And then during the follow up period, you have 17 people who were diagnosed for 17,000 people who were diagnosed with lung cancer.

65
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:19,790
And it's asking for the incidence rate expressed in 12 person years.

66
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:26,420
So if anyone want to walk me through the calculation, like why? So why are we why are we fighting the midpoint?

67
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:32,810
You know, kind of tell me what's going on. Does anyone want to try to get down their answers?

68
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:37,579
Yeah, I just school was on the PowerPoint. She went over it.

69
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:41,530
And I remember I went back and. Look, that's her.

70
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,580
That was solid answer. So what's going on?

71
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,680
There are different ways that you can come to lay population size.

72
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,760
If we're doing a time span and we have the start population and then the population during that time span,

73
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:05,300
one very easy way to get an estimate of the population is just to take the midpoint average.

74
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:11,240
So that's essentially what we're doing here. We're saying, you know, a million people at 1.700 thousand.

75
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:16,700
Another point, I don't really know what that true number is during that time frame.

76
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:25,460
So for purposes of argument, let's just assume there is an average of 850,000 people and it sort of works out to the math sort of work out.

77
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:33,830
So that is our assumption that we're going to work with a sort of an average population of 850,000.

78
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,849
Then we just need to calculate the person years and that's fairly straightforward.

79
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:41,410
So it's persons times, the years of follow up.

80
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:45,160
So we have 850,000 times ten years.

81
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:48,110
That gives us 8,500,000 years.

82
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:59,390
And then so now that we have our person, you have you have our denominator and we have our incident, case or incident or cases.

83
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:09,380
We can additionally was just like make the value and then multiply it by 200,000 to get something that's interpretable.

84
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:16,820
Does that make sense? And why do we add the newly diagnosed?

85
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:26,540
Over 17,000 into the popular population sites because they're already contained here.

86
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:30,170
Oh, no. It's the result of lung cancer. Oh. Lung cancer.

87
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,010
Yes. Without lung cancer. And this. People with lung cancer.

88
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:38,010
Yep. So we want to find the incidence rate of lung cancer.

89
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:43,549
So the I guess the objective here, and I realize it's not really clearly stated,

90
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:50,420
is that we want to find the incidence rate of lung cancer in Detroit from 2029.

91
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:54,350
Right. And so in order to do that, we need to know the population size.

92
00:08:54,860 --> 00:09:02,330
We need to have some estimate of person died, which we can obtain through this these measures.

93
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:07,700
And then we also just need to know how many people developed lung cancer during our follow up period.

94
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:16,670
And that's this. So they're already members of the population. Oh, are they part of the average population size?

95
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:26,600
Yes. But well, may the people with lung cancer and this of 700,000 people, it's also always also lung cancer.

96
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:36,499
Anybody here. The way we work around this is you can just find the average.

97
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:43,520
It's sort of like a it's an estimate. And that's and that's something that kind of buried by our estimates, not like absolute values,

98
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,860
but to deal with change in population sizes, which is the thing that you encounter often.

99
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:57,560
One way to sort of work around this is just to assume an average population size of of that and will get you in to the ballpark.

100
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:01,470
So ballpark of. Any questions?

101
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:05,089
Yeah. You just repeat again is the only reason we're looking for the midpoint here.

102
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:08,750
Just this is a kind of stable population. Yep, yep.

103
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:13,579
This was a closed population of, like, a million people. No one here, no one left.

104
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:18,720
It stayed fairly constant over your time period. Then you could just say it was a million.

105
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:29,000
But here we have some movement folks. So again, this is an estimate, not like, yeah, some sort of hand-waving is involved.

106
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:32,809
So I would like the average population size.

107
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:40,280
Does it mean like the population who are at risk instead of like the whole population.

108
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:44,540
Yeah. Is that okay. Oh yeah. Sorry. Yeah, yeah.

109
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:49,939
So so if you if people in Detroit already had lung cancer, they would not be included in this.

110
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:54,310
We're only interested in folks who are disease free at the start of our call up together.

111
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:58,460
Does that make sense? I think.

112
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,910
Think about it. We can come back to it. Okay.

113
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:12,660
Okay. The quantity expressed is the number of people in an hour. Could you please go back to that?

114
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:23,160
Sure. Um, I made a mistake. £200 of 500,000, but I chose 0.0 to 1.

115
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:31,230
I don't remember the options. It was something like 0.00 to 100000.

116
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:35,880
I drew that one. Yeah. So do we know?

117
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:46,830
Yeah. So usually with incidence rates, if we get a fraction, that's rather hard to like, visualize or interpret in a meaningful way.

118
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:55,830
And so what we will do is scale that up, we'll multiply it, we'll skill that up by some factor that gives us whole people.

119
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:59,640
And that's essentially what we're doing here. And you can do this with your calculator right now.

120
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:08,000
If we take 70,000 and we divide that into 8,500,000, you should get some decimal.

121
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,990
Yeah. 0.000.020202002.

122
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:20,690
Yes. But you get that number on a per person here.

123
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:30,410
Yes. Okay. So what does that mean? Like, what does that mean that that fraction of a person gets like that?

124
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,640
That's kind of hard to interpret and it's hard to visualize.

125
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:42,270
So one way we can work around that is by multiplying that value by some like factor to give us whole people.

126
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:52,920
So that's saying that we have like two, 200,000th of a person gets lung cancer every year.

127
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:57,630
Is it hard to sort of visualize? It's hard to sort of make sense of that.

128
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:09,270
But if we scale that up, say, 200 people per 10,000 person years gives us a little bit more to understand.

129
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:14,520
Yeah. Yeah. It's just we do it for interpretability reasons.

130
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:21,420
Okay. Yeah, that's a good question. Okay.

131
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:26,580
Um, the quantity expressed as the number of people in Ann Arbor who had diabetes on January 1st,

132
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:32,880
2010 divided by the total population of Ann Arbor and 2010 is the point prevalence.

133
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:37,810
Why is it not the period per month? You know that. Hmm.

134
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,890
Yeah. January 1st. Yup, yup, yep.

135
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:45,670
But we're not looking at a period. We're just looking at one day.

136
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:50,380
And that was. Okay.

137
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:59,300
Okay. Refer to figure two. Um, we're looking at mononucleosis.

138
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:04,670
What is the point? Prevalence of mononucleosis on January 1st, 2010.

139
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:09,770
I know. Here it's two out of three.

140
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:15,870
Well, given it's kind of hiding in here, it's sort of sneaky. But we're told that the total population is a thousand college students.

141
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:25,470
So it is two per 10,000 or 2/10 of a percent of Polish Russian.

142
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:32,220
Does that make sense? Okay. And what is the period prevalence?

143
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:37,830
It is five out of 1000. Again, we know our denominator. It listed up here and we see one, two, three, four,

144
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:47,760
five individuals come down with mononucleosis during the study duration in the study period and so five goes into 1000.

145
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:52,920
Does this make sense that this does the difference between point prevalence and period prevalence?

146
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:56,850
Makes sense? Yes. Yes. Okay. Okay. Cool.

147
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:08,010
Look at a fixed population. What happens to the prevalence of a disease when the incidence increases slightly if the duration?

148
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:13,590
So we're also asking you to think about the duration and thinking about how prevalence and incidence relate.

149
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:19,740
If the duration of a disease increases or stays the same, the prevalence increases.

150
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:25,720
Any thoughts about this? What is diversion means here?

151
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,860
Yes, the duration of the disease like so and so.

152
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:36,790
This is I think this is looking more like a chronic disease or something that sort of longer lasting,

153
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:41,530
not like a cold where you can have it and then get better again. So that's something to sort of bear in mind.

154
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:47,530
Does this make sense? Okay, everything sometimes. Yeah.

155
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:52,620
So if the duration of the disease increases, so the person's time is going to decrease, right?

156
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:58,629
If the duration of the disease increases that person time because of the incidence here.

157
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:08,850
The incidence rate. Well. So how is the program calculated?

158
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:15,710
So we're not giving a calculation necessarily. It's more of like a it's more of a conceptual question.

159
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,740
So like if we're going to do a census like.

160
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:32,800
If we know that an incidence if the incidence of a disease occurred or incomplete increases slightly, what could happen to the prevalence?

161
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:39,730
And this kind of question of the student. But it's asking you to think indirectly about the duration of the disease.

162
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:46,599
So I can understand why if the duration stays, the same, problem increases.

163
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,799
But what's the logic between if the duration increases as it?

164
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,660
Just like the longer you have it, the longer it takes for you to not have it and potentially get it again.

165
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:59,210
Or like, what is that really? Right.

166
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:07,010
So this is this is sort of pertains to a very sort of I won't say narrow range of illnesses, but like more chronic diseases.

167
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:12,879
So for instance, and for something that once you get it, you can't recover that sort of infection is that you can't recover.

168
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:20,620
So let's say like cardiovascular disease we've had and this is actually going to come up again on March five,

169
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:29,590
we have had advances in medicine that had a lot of people with CVD to live longer and so they are still in our population when we're counting them.

170
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:33,090
And so the duration of the illness, they still have CVD.

171
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:40,980
So there's, they're still considered sick, but they're, they're living longer and the duration of the illness as total has extended.

172
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:41,830
That makes sense. Yeah.

173
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:47,650
I think I was getting confused with kind of like the cumulative incidence and how much you already present with that you can't really count.

174
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,130
Yeah, I think that's I was getting tied up. Yeah.

175
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:56,230
Yeah. It doesn't make sense. Easy to do any other questions like this kind of question.

176
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:05,380
Is it okay to just like, look, I know there is like exclusion food and you just is unreliable to like think about what happens with that.

177
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:14,679
It was like prevalence is like almost equal to it's not exactly untrue like duration, times, incidence.

178
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:18,999
Can you look at that? You just imagine that like, yeah, yeah.

179
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,370
I just want to. Oh, yeah, totally. Any other questions?

180
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:30,669
All right. All right. Problem set for question six.

181
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:34,510
Did anyone have issues with this? I'm just curious. No.

182
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,300
Okay, well, it's on the slide deck, so I'm going to go through it anyway.

183
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:45,060
Um, so the question asks stroke is currently one of the leading causes of death and disability in the United States.

184
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:54,970
According to the CDC, approximately 795,000 of their 35.7 million people living in the U.S. have experienced a stroke in 2017.

185
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:58,720
Of these events that many were fatal.

186
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:07,060
142,142 were fatal. So it's asking you for the cumulative incidence rate.

187
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:15,340
And so let's see, we are given right.

188
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,000
And then the question is, okay, so,

189
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:31,630
so it's asking for the cumulative incidence that we calculate using the number of cases among people living in the United.

190
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:41,050
But. Total population at risk.

191
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:45,060
All right. So you can find the value.

192
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:54,970
What she goes on to ask is, why is the denominator the entire U.S. population and is the entire U.S. population at risk of stroke?

193
00:19:55,690 --> 00:20:02,050
The main thing she wants to bring home or point out about this question is it depends on how we want to think about stroke incidence.

194
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:08,500
There's a couple different ways we can think about stroke incidence. We can think about any incidence.

195
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:15,160
So this includes people who have already had stroke. We can include them in the denominator because you can get stroke more than once.

196
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:20,470
Right. So we don't necessarily prior stroke doesn't necessarily eliminate you from the denominator.

197
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:27,370
If, on the other hand, you wonder if it's an it's a first ever stroke,

198
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:34,140
because there is some suggestion that I think there's like previous stroke sort of makes you at risk for your stroke.

199
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:39,970
I don't know if that's entirely true, but it's possible if you wanted to find the for a stroke,

200
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:47,530
then you have to be more careful and you would have to remove people who have already had a stroke and only look at those who have been stroke free.

201
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:53,440
Does that make sense? Yes. So.

202
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:55,770
Okay. All right.

203
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:04,800
For the homework I did, I didn't see the question about why the number of the U.S. was in the denominator like that didn't come online.

204
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:08,910
Yeah, no one said it. Yeah. Oh, interesting.

205
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,000
Uh, pretty.

206
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:19,620
You just said be sure to.

207
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:28,270
Yeah. The question six also asked for mortality rates.

208
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:35,230
Yeah, but it didn't ask about why the whole they didn't have that second one that's bolded.

209
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:39,810
Interesting. I will look into this. I'm sorry.

210
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:51,259
I will see what is going on there. This essentially what she's trying to get out like and this is just like a good take home message in general is

211
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:56,690
if you want to make sure when you're thinking about especially chronic diseases that can happen repeatedly,

212
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:05,240
like heart attacks and stroke, do you want first only stroke or do you any any stroke in any sequence matter to you?

213
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:14,150
But yes. All right. All right. I will look into that slide that was newer to me.

214
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:21,800
And in the meantime, there is an engaged learning survey to take and on canvas.

215
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:26,600
And then problems at five is what you can work on today. Any question?

216
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:29,900
Any questions? So we don't have to do anything to do so.

217
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:35,030
The survey on canvas is what you're turning it in for your engaged learning?

218
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,580
Yeah, it's very easy words. No wrong answers.

219
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,000
No wonder.
