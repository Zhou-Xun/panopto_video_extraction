1
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:09,230
So we're going to talk about cognitive impairment and dementia today.

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:14,570
And it's hopefully with the time that we have, we're going to also try to talk a little bit about why,

3
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:18,170
you know, this is a huge is the leading cause of mortality.

4
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:22,640
This is a affects literally millions of people in the United States.

5
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,880
This is projected to continue to increase as the population ages.

6
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:30,499
We do not have any effective treatments for Alzheimer's disease. So why why is that?

7
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,500
So it's not a lack of attention. I'm going to tell you today.

8
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:38,510
It's not a lack of effort that leads to a rather sort of really kind of showing

9
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:42,020
you the challenge when we don't fully understand the etiology for a condition,

10
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,020
how difficult it is for us to identify an effective therapy.

11
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:50,409
So today we're going to talk about getting first.

12
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:53,680
I'm going to get oriented to what it means to be a neurocognitive disorder.

13
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:59,020
So last week we talked about autism. This is early life today. We're going to talk about this later life.

14
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:03,249
We're going to do it in class activity, which is actually how you assess cognitive functioning,

15
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:07,390
because it's different than anything else that we've talked about in this class. You don't ask somebody, how's your memory?

16
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,350
All right. We'll talk about why that why you don't do that.

17
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:17,290
Then we'll talk a little bit about cognitive impairment and different things that lead to cognitive impairment.

18
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:22,150
And again, close with talking about the treatment trials for Alzheimer's disease.

19
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:26,229
As a reminder, Wednesday is our conversation with our first class guest.

20
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:29,800
This is Trish Cortez. She's the CEO of Washtenaw County Community Mental Health.

21
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:35,049
She's going to join us by Zoom. So you can you're welcome to take that that Zoom call from in here.

22
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:40,510
I will take it from my office. But you do not need to physically be here on Wednesday.

23
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,110
All right. You will have an assignment to do after that.

24
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:51,430
So one or not, that conversation is not recorded. And second, you do have a small group assignment of reflection piece after that that is due.

25
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:55,030
So there is going to be an assignment that comes after that. After today's class.

26
00:01:55,030 --> 00:02:05,290
I will send a Google doc out to where you can just list your questions for her on on the this week's module

27
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:09,910
you can see I've got a hyperlink out to her organization so you can read a little bit about the organization.

28
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,030
She's not going to do a presentation. This is a conversation through a few of questions about careers.

29
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:19,409
She's I've already kind of given her a heads up that I know many of you do have questions about this.

30
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:27,550
So she's she's sort of going to be able to field some of those, but also about what it's like to actually work on the frontlines of behavioral health.

31
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:32,530
All right. And then just a reminder, your check point number five is due on the 16th.

32
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,559
Checkpoint number four, really screened for checkpoint number three.

33
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:45,670
Last night's other main thing that people lost points for our off was simply just not not having all five citations be scientific literature.

34
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:50,409
So sometimes people had like a government report, for example, and that's technically a non academic stakeholder, right?

35
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:54,639
So the scientific literature is of mad science, etc.

36
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,900
Right? So you can, you should use those citations that you provided in your final paper,

37
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:03,490
but they just sort of just didn't fit exactly the requirements of this checkpoint.

38
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:14,060
Any questions about what's coming up next. What we ought to be asking.

39
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:18,919
No, no, no. I just know that's a great point. So the question is,

40
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,329
to repeat it is that you do not need an annotated bibliography for your final and

41
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:29,719
you don't have to use all the citations you gave me for checkpoint number three. So if you find new citations or other citations for some of you,

42
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,230
I might have given feedback like this looks like a great review article, but it's 20 years old.

43
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:40,879
Maybe. See if other papers have cited that article that would give you like a more updated for example, like estimate of the prevalence, for example.

44
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:47,030
So yeah, there's I don't go back and check like did you use that same article that you gave me in three great questions.

45
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:54,400
Other questions. All right.

46
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:01,560
So, I mean, you're familiar with this book. Oliver Sacks, the man whose music, his wife or how can you tell me?

47
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:06,580
Tell us the class about what this book is about. Well, for my own research.

48
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:17,710
But I'll tell you. So it's a series of case. So Oliver Sacks, as you may know, is a very famous neurologist who passed away a few years ago.

49
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,779
The movie Awakenings is based on an actual experience he had as ideologist in

50
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:27,530
an inpatient clinic where they were discovering L-dopa for the first time,

51
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,090
which is a treatment for Parkinson's disease.

52
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:36,240
So this is a book where he describes it's a really wonder if you're interested in today's conversation and to get your picture,

53
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:43,249
I recommend you read this book. It's a wonderful collection of stories of people who've been dealing with different because

54
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:48,409
of a head injury or some sort of illness impairment in different domains of cognition.

55
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:54,110
And he also really helps explain how we know what we know about where these things are located in the brain.

56
00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:01,010
When people talk about cognitive impairment. Let's just talk about like what is cognition before we talk about what happens when it's in care.

57
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,730
So cognition refers to many different things, right? So different domains.

58
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,659
So first is orientation, which is, do you know, things like what is today's date?

59
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:11,870
Who is the president like, you know, where are you? Right.

60
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:16,009
So if you've ever been in a car accident or something like that, somebody I'm certain asked you those questions.

61
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:20,630
The reason they were asking you those questions is they wanted to understand you had did you know where you were?

62
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:26,719
Right. Those are questions about orientation, but other domains of cognition relate to attention.

63
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,260
So are you able to keep on task for a certain period of time?

64
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:36,140
There's also, of course, memory loss that's impaired and Alzheimer's disease, but it's not the only one that's impaired.

65
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:42,620
So this can include both verbal memory. So you're going to do some exercises today on word recall.

66
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:49,400
And I'm going to ask you to do a non-verbal memory task in a minute, which you sort of figure from memory.

67
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:55,429
And then the other part that's important to think about is this idea of executive functioning,

68
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:59,600
which refers to essentially all the things that you're very good at as a student at the University of Michigan.

69
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:05,360
So this is organizing, planning, problem solving, the way that we measure those things.

70
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,310
Are you going to do some of these examples in our class activity in a few minutes?

71
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,870
One is called the Wisconsin court card, sort of where you're trying to kind of get as much instruction,

72
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:20,989
figure out what the next card is going to be or what the rules are. The rule is for the cards and then the test.

73
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:23,059
I'm going to show you that. I'm going to show you examples of all these in a second.

74
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:27,980
But the point is that that's what I mean by executive functioning. I mean organizing, planning and problem solving.

75
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:32,330
The other two domains of cognition are language.

76
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:37,100
So this involves both speaking and understanding speech.

77
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:42,499
Let me show you an example. I'm sorry of this sort of expressive aphasia.

78
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:48,910
So this is a challenge. So aphasia is this is an example of not being able to express specific words.

79
00:06:49,580 --> 00:07:11,430
And this is an example of someone experiencing that after a stroke. Always want to try to find the right word.

80
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:18,370
I am going on a different.

81
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:36,430
Yeah. I think an event is a communication when you say things and I said and I them.

82
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:44,330
It's not like I know my life and life is here.

83
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:50,890
So I guess you knew since some of the exposure to the.

84
00:07:53,060 --> 00:08:00,200
You can kind of pull your brains, any one of those ditzy morons to see something in your mouth.

85
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:09,460
And the words just wouldn't come out on top of that.

86
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:13,070
And I was I was sorry.

87
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:22,700
I mean, I've just been drinking, as you said. And in fact, I did have a stroke and all in the wrong moment.

88
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,690
So we're moving on now.

89
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:33,240
I hate to do things to Bob, and I think so.

90
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:40,700
I think nice knowing that one day I figured it out.

91
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:49,860
So I'd like to. So you can imagine how frustrating it must be to just have the words and not to be able to to say them.

92
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:57,090
I stopped the video there because I was literally on a flight many years ago where a flight attendant was having trouble speaking,

93
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,740
like she was giving the announcement that you gave at the beginning of every flight, you know, like a scissors.

94
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,380
And literally the people around, like, I think she's drunk.

95
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:11,970
Like there were concerns that she was, like, intoxicated. And this sort of got literally like the whole whole plane is buzzing around this.

96
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:18,930
If someone talks to another flight attendant, she and the woman came actually back on the announcer and explained that she had

97
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:23,249
had a stroke and that she was okay to serve and that she was having this effect.

98
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:29,790
I mean, it was like that, that and of course, I'm sure that she was both very embarrassed by what had happened.

99
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,649
We were, of course, embarrassed. But when it happens like that,

100
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:39,030
it's you sort of sense the things that go through your mind when you meet somebody who's experiencing aphasia are not necessarily like,

101
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:45,359
oh, this person's had a major medical problem. And there's some other like, oh, there's other, you know, like that something else might be happening.

102
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,710
So I stopped there because I think that's actually not a very uncommon experience.

103
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:55,010
And then the last things about cognition have to do with visual spatial ability.

104
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:00,569
This is I like this quite a bit in terms of being able to rotate things in three dimensional space.

105
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:03,000
But I mean, let me show you some examples of these.

106
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,990
And again, you're going to play these in a second as you play them in that like they are, they are like kind of gamified tasks.

107
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:16,319
So this is an example of measuring processing speed, which is part of executive functioning.

108
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:22,049
And so what the person is given, they're given the sheet of paper, they're told this is the key here.

109
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:26,700
And then they're like, okay, whenever I see a two, I'm supposed to write an upside down take.

110
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:31,040
Whenever I see one, I'm supposed to write it. That's right. As you give this to the person that you just timer.

111
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:36,570
And the question is, how quickly can they move between these two elements here?

112
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,010
All right. So that's that's an example of how we might measure processing speed.

113
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,100
This is a Stroop task. So this is an example of inhibition.

114
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:51,050
That is, you're supposed to say the color that the word is printed in, not the color of the word.

115
00:10:52,070 --> 00:11:03,870
I'm a volunteer to go across the top performing. Red, yellow, red, blue, yellow, red and blue.

116
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:07,459
Ocean. Red. Yellow, yellow. Red.

117
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:11,300
Red and blue. Green. Red, red. Green.

118
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,440
Blue. Yellow, green. It's hard. So this is. So this is.

119
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:20,390
This is. Thank you for that. So you're going to do this in a minute, too, with your with your partner on this on this task.

120
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:26,959
But like, this is an example you have to and, you know, again, if you if there was a neurological condition that's happened,

121
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:32,570
this is really it's already difficult for people who are not experiencing neurological condition to go through this.

122
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:36,950
And again, the test here is number of mistakes and how quickly you can you can work through this.

123
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,959
This is the Wisconsin card. So you're going to play this. I'll play this for you right now.

124
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:47,210
So you're going to love that. So this is you're going to do this for a second.

125
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:50,860
So. The way that.

126
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:57,820
So what's going to happen is it's going to show me some cards and I'm going to try to figure out what the rule is.

127
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:03,080
There's a matching rule so I can either match on color, shape or number.

128
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:08,300
All right. Those are the three things I can match of color, shape or number. Let me show you what I mean.

129
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:15,230
All right. So here it is. So if the rule is match on color, then I should put this card here.

130
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:21,500
If the rule is match on shape, I should put this card here. If the color of the rule is match on number, I should put this card here.

131
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:26,239
But nobody tells me what the rules. What happens is I put the card somewhere and I either run.

132
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,260
Am I right or am I wrong? That's all I learn. I don't learn where I should have it.

133
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:37,179
I just learn when my right. Or am I wrong? So the Wisconsin courts are you can see how this is a test of executive functioning,

134
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:43,150
because I have to sort of take that information and then do something different in the next trial to figure out what the rule is.

135
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:48,010
And then once you figure out the rules, everything's fine for a while, and then they change the rule without telling you.

136
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,580
And suddenly now you're at what was right is now wrong.

137
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:55,629
It's it's hilarious. All right. So here we go. All right.

138
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:59,240
So spacebar. Yes. Usually arrows.

139
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:04,600
Oh. Quick to start recuperating. The first test is all right.

140
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:10,720
So I'm going to say. So I got the rule right the first time.

141
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:14,460
Oh, it's going to yell at me. First the volume. You.

142
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:22,390
Let's see if that helps. Okay. Well, what was it like for you?

143
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:28,770
Oh, now I'm certainly in good shape.

144
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:31,990
Okay, I've got shape.

145
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:45,070
All right, no problem. I'm on. My mom's going to do this, too.

146
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:49,000
I got to get it.

147
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,820
Yeah. See, now the rule is so that's all I learn.

148
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:05,530
I that it's not how I'm going to train now.

149
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:10,330
I have to continue to keep going. You're going to play this in a minute.

150
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:21,410
So back here. This is an example, another executive touch.

151
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,330
You're not going to do this one today, but this is what the trail's A and B.

152
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:29,620
And so for this, what you're trying to do is you're trying to go from again, it's a paper pencil test.

153
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:33,400
You're going to go from one to the letter F, which is here.

154
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:37,610
And you're going to go to next to. Then the letter B, right.

155
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,320
You can't take your pencil off the paper. So the question is, how can you move again?

156
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:46,190
How many mistakes do you make? How quickly can you move through it? So you've got to kind of keep the letters in mind.

157
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:49,909
He's going to be able to visualize the entire field that you're looking at.

158
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:53,150
Right. You can see how this is a complex, complex task.

159
00:14:53,810 --> 00:15:05,299
All right. I need you all to go sheet of paper for me. You're not turning it.

160
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:10,310
It's just a scratch. This is what I need you to take my consideration.

161
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:15,170
So strategy. And I just want to make sure you have a tablet that you can write on.

162
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:30,200
That's fine, too. But I need you to be able to draw something. All right.

163
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:35,400
So these are things that we just learned over our tests of processing and executive functioning.

164
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:43,350
But now it's not about memory. So verbal memory is challenging because it has to do with my memory with certain words.

165
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:50,240
But non-verbal memory is a little bit easier. So this is the figure that we use for testing nonverbal memory for people.

166
00:15:50,250 --> 00:16:00,810
That's cognitive decline. So you get 30 seconds. Don't draw anything out of bounds four times.

167
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:26,830
She is battling. Yeah.

168
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:34,330
One minute. Suppression.

169
00:16:42,450 --> 00:17:19,140
This. And seconds.

170
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:33,380
All right. How do you do that?

171
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:37,550
So it's supposed to be challenging. Let me make it clear. It is supposed to be challenging.

172
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:46,280
All right. So many of you probably got the overall box of maybe the diamond just the right sort of people kind of get these elements.

173
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:53,690
So this is an example of somebody with Alzheimer's disease doing that exact same task that you just for me.

174
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:58,360
So as we give you help, sort of understand why this symbol,

175
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:03,650
like this visual memory looks like this, is that this is a person doing a task of a copy task.

176
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:07,510
So they actually have the picture. The picture never goes away and they're just trying to reproduce.

177
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:11,299
So you can see that this is not just memory,

178
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:20,810
but actually being able to visually get this neurological connections to what I am seeing and what I can make my heart do to reproduce the pictures.

179
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:27,230
So just again, to help me understand what you know, what memory.

180
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:32,780
When we say memory impairment for somebody with Alzheimer's disease, what that what that connection, what that actually means.

181
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:42,610
So oftentimes in the etymological surveys, we don't have any of the tasks that you're going to do in this class or even what you just did.

182
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:48,270
Instead, what we typically have are there's an example of a mini mental state exam.

183
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,300
This is something that you do.

184
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:56,120
And if you've ever been in a car accident or the emergency room, I can guarantee you you've gotten some version of this task.

185
00:18:56,570 --> 00:19:00,559
They'll ask you to remember. I'm going to say three words. Don't you remember what you are?

186
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,810
Absolutely. I ask you about those words later.

187
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:10,729
They might ask you to subtract seven from 100 and then subtract seven from that number and sort of like understand that you get this idea of memory,

188
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:13,880
but also sort of like executive functioning.

189
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:18,979
They will ask you to, you know, like an hour watch.

190
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:23,080
But if I was, I would show you this and I say, what is this thing? Right. That's a test of aphasia.

191
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:27,200
So somebody who's experiencing aphasia might not be able to tell me that this was a watch, for example.

192
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:31,820
So. And what were those three words against the table?

193
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:37,700
Yes. So so those are typically what we what we have, which are used again in the emergency department.

194
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:41,540
If somebody comes in with a traumatic brain injury or delirium or a car accident,

195
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:47,610
the advantages are that these are really brief so they can be done in an emergency if you need to get somebody into surgery, for example.

196
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:55,130
And it's important to do. And they can tell whether somebody should go into further screening and the tests that you're going to do in a minute.

197
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,620
But the disadvantage is that they're really not sensitive to change over time,

198
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:04,550
and they're not appropriate for detecting, for example, something like mild cognitive impairment.

199
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:08,270
They're not as they are not designed as a diagnostic tool and they're designed as a

200
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:12,500
screening tool in a clinical situation to sort of determine what should happen next.

201
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:17,360
And then I'll close here with this sort of just beginning,

202
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:21,680
beginning the conversation about how do we test technology that just like all parts of medicine,

203
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:27,650
AI or artificial intelligence is also coming coming into this in terms of a potential way

204
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:33,110
for us to identify people who are at elevated risk for early stages of Alzheimer's disease.

205
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:37,940
This is I didn't ask you to read this paper, but I'll show you what this paper did.

206
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:47,780
So this was using artificial intelligence to actually read that the people were asked to describe a C and then they were followed over time.

207
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:51,559
And the the A.I.,

208
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:57,590
the algorithm was able to identify sort of distinct ways that people talked about the picture that

209
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:02,209
were more common among people who went on to develop Alzheimer's disease versus people who did so.

210
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:10,490
For example, somebody who was unimpaired would describe this scene as a young boy as reaching for a cookie jar.

211
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:16,399
He's standing on a stool and is almost falling over his sister, standing beside him and talking to him and his on the other side.

212
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:22,070
His mom is wiping the dishes, for example, or somebody with some impairment would say things like,

213
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:26,810
in this case, the algorithm is like, boy taking cookies, mother washing dishes, water, overflowing insects.

214
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:31,070
So they've got the P elements, but there's not sort of a whole narrative that's happening.

215
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:36,889
And then somebody with more impairment would have potential, like just washing dishes,

216
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:43,580
but without the noun, not the person named, they're spelling errors, etc.

217
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:49,879
So that the idea is that rather than necessarily having these kind of make believe tests that you're about to do,

218
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:56,240
we're kind of like artificial tests to sort of give a situation and just let someone use whatever words they would normally

219
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:03,680
use to describe it as a way to potentially identify people who are at elevated risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.

220
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:09,370
So to summarize, cognitive function is not something that we assess by self-report.

221
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:13,480
We don't ask somebody who likes to hear reaction time feel slower these days or you're having trouble.

222
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:19,870
I mean, we can ask people, are you having trouble concentrating? But that is not in any way considered a test of cognition.

223
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:26,920
So instead we use these performance based measures. But I want to make it clear that just because they're objective, quote unquote,

224
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:30,790
doesn't mean there isn't greater influence or bias or other measurement challenges.

225
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:36,819
And it is also the case that many, but not all domains of cognition are going to decline over time.

226
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,639
That is not in and of itself indicative of cognitive impairment.

227
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:48,940
So just because there's a decline in processing speed or a decline in memory doesn't mean that that is necessarily leading to cognitive impairment.

228
00:22:49,750 --> 00:23:01,390
And so I guess like with cognitive functioning that's related to mental illness or like other like depression,

229
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:07,690
like bipolar, are there tests where because I feel like,

230
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:19,750
yeah, I guess are there tests that are not self-report that are targeted towards cognitive functioning as a result of like other.

231
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:24,130
Yeah, so that's a great question. So the question is just are there, you know,

232
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:29,590
how is there is there is kind of special way to measure cognitive impairment when it comes in the context of bipolar

233
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:37,030
disorder or depression versus an older adult who maybe has had a stroke or maybe is suspected as having dementia.

234
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:41,620
And the answer is no. So we use these same tasks no matter what, because they're sort of agnostic,

235
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:52,960
or at least not they're indifferent to whether what the condition is that's causing the sort of decline or impairment in performance.

236
00:23:52,960 --> 00:24:00,270
So so for example, like the attention tasks that we would use in ADHD for example, like those would be the same tests that you might use in cognition,

237
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:07,300
but you, you would probably sort of potentially do more of that testing because you sort of think that's the domain that's impaired here.

238
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:12,130
Um, but yeah, so, but the test itself would not be distinct.

239
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:23,440
It's a great question. I just had a poll, so I guess are those tests like general use when if if someone comes in and you know they're getting

240
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:27,999
because we talked a lot about how like it's kind of hard to diagnose when you're doing like,

241
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,120
you know, just depression, bipolar, whatever. So is cognitive functioning tests like.

242
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:39,600
Something that's regularly used or like. Would that be an area for better diagnosis?

243
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:41,790
Yeah. I mean, it's funny you mentioned this.

244
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:47,669
I mean, I literally I was on the phone, my mother yesterday talking about my aunt who's got is in her late sixties,

245
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:51,270
has severe depression and is also experiencing severe memory. Right.

246
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:55,319
So what what we don't know is, is this memory impairment part of the depression?

247
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:59,190
And so therefore, maybe, you know, a different treatment strategy would be helpful?

248
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:04,380
Or is this depression part of early Alzheimer's disease in which antidepressants are going to have zero?

249
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:08,940
So that's so the short answer is.

250
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:15,270
Is it for older adults, it's going to be more likely that you're going to sort of see this type of testing.

251
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:20,790
It wouldn't be used in like a differential diagnosis situation for most younger people.

252
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:23,669
I mean, you know, people in twenties like don't develop Alzheimer's disease.

253
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:27,540
It doesn't mean they can't have cognitive impairment on the heels of like traumatic brain injury.

254
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:32,310
Right. So you would potentially see a lot of which also comes along with depression.

255
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:35,700
And so like it's these things, it's a line in the sand between them.

256
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:42,329
But they wouldn't they the person would almost certainly be demonstrating some challenges in some area.

257
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:46,889
Maybe they're having trouble with school, maybe they're having trouble communicating, for example.

258
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:51,600
And then they would do these tests to sort of further isolate what's actually happening.

259
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:57,659
And, you know, we don't we don't really have specific medications to solve specific issues here,

260
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:01,020
but at least would help somebody understand why is it that you're having so much trouble?

261
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,480
You know, you're you're not able to find these words, for example. Yeah. Oh, yeah.

262
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:12,460
Some ask their specific test of like all of these that is considered more like the standard or they all just kind of like very someone.

263
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:18,750
So, I mean, so what would be considered sort of comprehensive is testing multiple domains.

264
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:23,940
So you would never do so if you were in an emergency room or came into it, you you would get the mini mental state.

265
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:25,020
Exactly messy.

266
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:33,120
That's the and they would depending on your performance on that that would then either lead them to do some of these additional tasks or not.

267
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:36,000
Right. So it's literally just a left or right door type of thing.

268
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:44,819
Um, we, if somebody is either, either complaining of memory impairment or a family member is saying like,

269
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:48,740
you know, it seems like you're having, you know, cause sometimes the person may not know that they're,

270
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:55,049
they're experiencing that you would you would typically see a neuro psychiatrist is the

271
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:59,400
type of person you would see could be 3 to 4 hours long like they're very intensive.

272
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:03,900
And so, as you know, even that might get broken up to two days.

273
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:08,610
And so the the short answer is that you would want to test all domains of cognition.

274
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:13,950
It is simply not sufficient to just like drawing tests that we just didn't kind of call it.

275
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:21,209
Right. So. So let me let me let you have at it.

276
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:25,440
So. Well, okay, so here's this.

277
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,330
You're 57 years old. I'd like to get that down a bit.

278
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:36,660
So what I'd like to do, we're not going to spend 20 minutes on this, but let's, let's, let's in 15.

279
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:44,560
So what I'd like you to do is on today's module, there are all of these tasks.

280
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:48,890
So if you scroll down here, you're not going to turn anything in front of this.

281
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:52,260
It's really just for you to get ready to go through this.

282
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:55,890
For example, if you want to pick the Stroop, if you want to do the Wisconsin card,

283
00:27:56,130 --> 00:28:02,550
which I just did for you, just to kind of get an understanding of what what these tasks actually are.

284
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:10,050
If you were to have ever had a neuropsychiatric workup or if a family member needed one, I write something over here.

285
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:15,690
I'll ask you to just consider a couple of questions. So like, do the task easier?

286
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:23,520
How do you feel when you do poorly on a task? Imagine that you're somebody who's just basically you're just the computer for the Facebook.

287
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,670
Right. What additional challenges might happen? Right.

288
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:30,989
Or what might we have to consider? And then we'll just debrief to talk about it a little bit.

289
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:34,140
So I just want you to kind of get a little sense of what this is like.

290
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:39,980
So I'm going to set a timer for I'm going to check in at ten and we'll see where we are and then we can do another five.

291
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:43,280
But I think everybody you can do a partner or doing it.

292
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:46,650
All right. Just keep these questions in your mind, okay.

293
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:53,480
All right. All right.

294
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:57,890
And they're going to make noise about that volume down.

295
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:20,940
You. As a consequence.

296
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:52,310
Since you like to stream films from so many reasons that told you why it should come down, what will it the.

297
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:58,860
Oh, the friend that was like you was.

298
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:05,690
But I was in the hospital. Oh, actually. Which is the opposite of your Italy.

299
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:13,830
What do you do for mental illness? I don't want to engage in an MBA from a lot of schools.

300
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:17,980
Don't trust law school or anything.

301
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:29,920
Should you choose, do you know the alternative to online education?

302
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:34,240
I think I live here. It's like here.

303
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,209
I'm waiting for it to come up and then eventually one pops sets. Like,

304
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:47,230
I'm not going to cook it because it's patterned and it wants to like how fast you can click the green on like 730 something and then you will answer,

305
00:30:47,490 --> 00:31:01,360
okay, you get on the plane, are you ready for my pockets or what is that?

306
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:17,870
And what it means to know because it's so classic, because we're popular, just because it doesn't matter.

307
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:30,040
So that's I think that's true. I would just sort of like give me an election in which I was on leadership and the story of gerontology had gone quiet.

308
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:40,090
But I was also sort of how all this was good for me.

309
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:49,720
Actual training, leadership prior. Like my the question I asked the panel was how long is how much money do this crowd think?

310
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:55,990
I just have to just just keep doing more like there's very little else.

311
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:02,830
There's more stuff. I feel like at some point that's just one that's unsustainable.

312
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:09,710
But it's also just. You know, it's not recognizing the values that leadership.

313
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:23,899
I mean, it's a part of it as a woman or as your immune system doesn't cover or space speech,

314
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:30,080
like you said, it's like somehow that we're going to go, yeah, I'm actually just not not understand.

315
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:34,540
Never really.

316
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,690
As for you, I think that's fascinating.

317
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:52,000
I think that they were recommended as this other speakers was to get them getting some way to me where I stand before you in the name of Jesus first,

318
00:32:52,280 --> 00:33:01,880
because nobody seems to have too much to be able to hold on to that.

319
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:07,490
So that's what I want to know.

320
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:17,750
And I just want to tell them what to do no matter what.

321
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:27,820
So much of their training, school prayer, just so many that.

322
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:39,660
You know, when I saw people ask me the same thing and I went to the point they're talking about someone I feel like personal,

323
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:46,620
just the best, which is is a way for us to space is right.

324
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:57,200
And so it has been able to teach students about to teach epidemiology.

325
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:08,510
You know I think going should get anywhere any longer over over graduation.

326
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:18,220
First students at my age, Fred, who's now it seems like a good thing.

327
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:23,020
And she came to talk about things like what?

328
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:28,550
She cried when she went to go one way to do that.

329
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:33,710
But it's a place where she works really fun, actually.

330
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:52,010
William Davidson It's such an important because it's like, I don't care if it's funny, I know I'm terrible.

331
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:55,130
I guess I won't even try. That is really working.

332
00:34:55,880 --> 00:35:03,020
For the first time I did. I like immediately just because it's a range of the words, but she's like,

333
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:09,259
she had a company that was really trying to use and I was like, I wish it wasn't so much more interesting.

334
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:15,710
I should be able to just learn and then also like really easy to answer different types of questions.

335
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:26,380
So I just think it's sort of like she's like part of the local community is so awesome and like

336
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:38,000
so has done canvasing he's doing it for us like I at she's done raising the children she can do

337
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,549
something to you today that's so important because the first first draft of the curriculum would draft

338
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:53,230
for your first I guess this is about 25 years ago when they went and met with the whole nation.

339
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:59,749
I mean, it's like, oh my God.

340
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:12,210
And I was like, I find something that works well that I would naturally and I would never do able.

341
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:26,680
Yeah. So why this you just at some point you just come up with something like that.

342
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:30,530
I saw the other way. I know. I remember.

343
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,040
She stood up and down.

344
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:39,800
It's just different, really, when you get tired of it, you know,

345
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:54,500
you don't want to go down from something that's pouring into my job because it was an interaction like not so hard because it's not okay.

346
00:36:54,740 --> 00:37:01,550
Well, and it's also not because I was like, yeah, I can't even.

347
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:05,760
You feel like you've got something I think is going to find this is.

348
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:11,159
Because I know the sort of thing that a lot of cities don't actually have.

349
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:21,720
But, you know, I don't know. I don't think that I don't know when somebody ways like the census.

350
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:28,590
I mean, since I'm sorry but it doesn't make sense for all these cases and that you know,

351
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:44,130
it's not like include information systems that more and more people are considered and I think will be considered, which is unusual.

352
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:47,250
Yeah. So it's really good. Well, usual.

353
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:58,290
Well, if you have 100%, then somebody will assume it's a it's because we actually don't bring in to it much differently than computers,

354
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:13,530
which I didn't intend to do with the average person, which is not close, I think, but I'm not sure why some reason to do it.

355
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:16,840
Yeah, I don't know. But I would like person I don't know. Yeah.

356
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:20,910
Because I mean you always. Yeah, I think I already have.

357
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:32,470
I know we do. And as that I understand it, I think it's very much against it and.

358
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:37,920
Yeah, I, I guess, I mean, it's like.

359
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:42,750
It's a really interesting one.

360
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:46,210
You can put things right.

361
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:49,919
So that's about 10 minutes. Do we want more time on this?

362
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:57,360
Or you're like, You're right. You're gonna want to share some reflections about.

363
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:07,520
How it went. How he felt about Windsor. You're concerned for your grandparents that they were doing this town for them?

364
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:11,510
Well, there are definitely ones that were, like, a lot easier than others. Yeah.

365
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:14,899
Which were easier. Like the Wisconsin test.

366
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:18,470
Once you kind of think of it. I feel like it wasn't you. Yeah.

367
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:23,450
Yeah. Is it the drawing? One, two. Or maybe it's just the computer, but.

368
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:27,890
Yeah. Yes. No, the mirror drawing is very. That is a very challenging.

369
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:31,520
And so, you know what the mirror drawing task is?

370
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:36,500
Testing is not how well you draw factors, but your persistence.

371
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:44,230
So we also use that task, um, like for us, we talked about remember,

372
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:49,610
remember way back at the beginning class talk about art and the idea of like getting to these fundamental ideas about human behavior.

373
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:55,420
While that task is also used to measure kind of distress, tolerance or perseverance or you know,

374
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:03,500
or all sorts of that, that, again, we think are kind of play a role in all sorts of mental health conditions.

375
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:10,610
Okay. I'm. QUESTION on the strip task, the strip of fat.

376
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:15,210
What's like. Like what do you want the score to be?

377
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:19,650
Or what do you want it to be? Yeah. Yeah. So it's not that there's.

378
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:24,590
Well, I got a warm feeling. What does it mean?

379
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:34,220
Oh, well, it's testing whether it can inhibit your natural impulse to say so.

380
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:37,670
The it's also a test of are you willing to.

381
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:40,850
Normally, we also sometimes use this as a stressor.

382
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:46,520
And so if you get the word wrong, we'll play a very loud, obnoxious sound and make you start at the beginning.

383
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:50,780
And so then the two and we're intentionally attacking the poor people.

384
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:54,860
This is this is after informed consent. Right. People know they're going to go into a stressful situation.

385
00:40:54,860 --> 00:41:00,559
But we we require that the thing what it's testing is shifting.

386
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:05,930
Can you shift between the color and the word? Can you persist even when you make mistakes?

387
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:10,850
Well, we use this as a stressor. The performance is in front of a group of people.

388
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:14,719
So like you're not privately doing in front of a computer, but you would be doing it front of the class,

389
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,450
like standing up and every time you made a mistake, a big noise. Right.

390
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:23,340
And if you were taking a long time to answer, if you were really going slow, I would say, can you please speed up?

391
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:28,670
Right. I would do things. So so the point is, is that we we can use these tools in different ways.

392
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:36,649
It's just like with the autism, we're talking about autism. It's not that there's a diagnostic threshold for any of these, but rather and say like,

393
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:40,210
okay, well, you're in like the 10th percentile of performance on the street, right?

394
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:46,940
So that's the kind of thing that it would be poor performance on this in combination with poor performance on this,

395
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:54,830
in combination with poor performance on this, that would lead somewhat to a diagnosis of cognitive impairment or even specific,

396
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:59,780
especially if somebody had a head injury where we sort of could see it in combination with imaging.

397
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:05,030
We could see what part of the brain had been damaged to like really understand what was actually going on in a person.

398
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:09,770
Yeah, go ahead. Ask him how effective are these in determining or diagnosing concussions?

399
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:16,000
Because I remember doing all we have that yeah, I think that's an area.

400
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:20,300
So the question is around concussions and like how effective are these in terms of determining diagnosis so

401
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:26,810
that the the short answer is that that is an area of like very important research that's happening right now.

402
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:32,420
But it also sort of points to the challenge of using these, because these are used to like clear people to continue playing.

403
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:36,830
Right. And so like, oh, well, you didn't you know, you know, your your test before was here.

404
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:41,989
You're a little bit worse, but not that much. Right. And so and what we think about this, we now believe that,

405
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:46,640
like the damage from concussions is not in the immediate aftermath of the concussion that like longer term,

406
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:52,309
you know, after max of the concussion, which would potentially be decades later, you know, that you would see performance.

407
00:42:52,310 --> 00:43:00,590
So but it's a great point that people are using these tests to determine decisions that were not from their intent,

408
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:05,920
I think that are well beyond their original intent. Other questions.

409
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:13,530
How do you him? All right.

410
00:43:13,770 --> 00:43:17,420
So let's talk about a few Common Core. So now you know what cognition is.

411
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:23,850
Let's talk a little bit about some of the causes of cognitive impairment. So I already showed you a video of somebody who'd experienced a stroke.

412
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:28,169
Stroke. About a million people in the United States have a stroke.

413
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:30,719
It is that it is it is a leading cause of death.

414
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:42,090
But thankfully, we've actually had very important advances in terms of if we can get someone to care quickly, which is this thing we talk about,

415
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:50,190
the strokes is like time is brain like that's the kind of shorthand we use to we can actually we can not only save people's lives,

416
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:54,960
but really preserve as much neurological functioning as possible.

417
00:43:55,740 --> 00:44:03,450
The vast majority of strokes are happening after age 65, but the incidence of stroke among younger adults is is also increasing.

418
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:07,020
And African-Americans and Latinos have highest risk.

419
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:13,890
Another to find out concussion and other common cause of common impairment is head injury.

420
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:20,750
Traumatic brain injury is essentially any brain injury that's caused by some sort of weather.

421
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:28,950
You don't have it. You can have a traumatic brain injury even if you not your skull has not you know, there's not there's not a broken bone.

422
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:35,390
For example, we have over almost 3 million emergency department visits annually for for TBI.

423
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:43,559
The populations here are a little bit broader than who's at risk of stroke, which is predominantly older adults.

424
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:47,160
But here we have children, athletes, people in the armed forces.

425
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:53,130
People work in rural areas where they might be jobs that are are require.

426
00:44:55,110 --> 00:45:06,149
I don't require you to be in machinery. And if and then dementia, which is the leading cause of cognitive impairment, it's not called dementia.

427
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:14,730
And the DSM five, it's now called neurocognitive disorder. This is in part because of trying to efforts to, um, to destigmatize the word dementia.

428
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:20,370
We're going to talk about that a little bit towards the end of class. If we have time, I'm going to continue to use the word dementia, though,

429
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,290
in this class just to kind of make sure that we're all on the same page with what that means.

430
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:30,269
So the first thing to say about dementia is that there are many types of dementia.

431
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:38,320
So, well, Alzheimer's disease is a common force that should be present.

432
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:44,990
It causes 50 to 75% of cases of dementia are caused by Alzheimer's disease.

433
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:57,330
There are other types of dementia, including HIV and alcohol related dementia to the reading that was shared earlier today about infectious disease.

434
00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:01,649
You probably have heard about long COVID and the idea that COVID is protected

435
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:06,540
by people who have experienced COVID also have neurocognitive impairment.

436
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:09,599
And it's possible that when I give this talk in five years,

437
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:15,960
like I'll be listed here as a potential cause of dementia, depending on how these studies play out.

438
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:27,620
So so the the part of the reason why dementia is such an important problem for public health is because the population is aging.

439
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:34,650
So these are called population impairments, the way to look at them. So on the side are females, the side male on the x axis here,

440
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:42,959
it's just that sort of percent of people in 5% of the population that's in these particular age groups from the bottom is eight 0 to 4.

441
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:47,610
All the way to the top is age 85 plus. So this is a decade ago.

442
00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:53,460
The answer is 30. This is what the US population looks like. Here's where we are today, right?

443
00:46:53,470 --> 00:47:00,810
And so you can see for 2040 we're not really going to have a pyramid and we don't really we barely have a pyramid now,

444
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:07,260
but instead we're really getting a rectangle, kind of a trapezoid, I guess, with this little kind of part here.

445
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:16,710
But so the entire population is aging. And since age is such a strong risk factor for dementia, even if nothing else changes,

446
00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:22,829
there will be more Alzheimer's 20 years from now than there is today, even if literally nothing else changes.

447
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:31,799
If we get no new risk factors, you know, just like TBI doesn't become more common, stroke doesn't become more common, nothing else changes.

448
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:39,940
We will have more dementia in the future. So we currently have about 6 million older adults are living with dementia.

449
00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:48,909
That's expected to more than double by 2050, again, just simply by the U.S. population ages and animal health care costs.

450
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:54,820
When people talk about, you know, where the vast majority of the U.S. budget is spent.

451
00:47:55,090 --> 00:47:59,919
So this goes to things like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid and Medicare alone.

452
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:05,010
Animal health care costs for dementia are $3 billion. This is a huge cost.

453
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:13,490
And then that doesn't count in any way the additional estimated 1010 billion in annual cost from unpaid caregiving.

454
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:17,169
That is from the examples that you listen to with the podcast.

455
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:26,440
For example, David Satcher, a former U.S. surgeon general, has argued that Alzheimer's is the most underrecognized threat to public health.

456
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:33,909
And while we can debate whether this language around threat is an appropriate way to talk about what is fundamentally a health care condition,

457
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:37,660
the point is, is that it's something that we don't necessarily think about.

458
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:43,230
It's also a leading cause of death among all those over age 65.

459
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:47,979
But as was pointed out in the readings, this is not something that kills you right away.

460
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:55,720
So on a median survival for somebody and from time of an Alzheimer's diagnosis to time of death is seven years.

461
00:48:56,050 --> 00:49:01,090
It's shorter for vascular dementia. Vascular dementia is a form of dementia that's that usually is coming on the heels

462
00:49:01,090 --> 00:49:06,370
of strokes or they don't necessarily have to be clinically identified strokes.

463
00:49:06,370 --> 00:49:14,620
We often see people who we can identify through imaging after the fact must have had some sort of vascular event.

464
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:17,019
But they don't ever report experiencing that event.

465
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:24,850
That is that is their brain is experiencing minor infarcts without there actually being an expression of of stroke.

466
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:30,500
And we have no effective treatments to reverse reverse impairments. And most of our efforts, therefore,

467
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:37,540
most of our efforts are focused on either slowing progression from initial assessment to very

468
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:43,150
severe dementia or on straight up delaying onset because and this is kind of this weird,

469
00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:47,020
at least the first time I heard this, I felt weird about it.

470
00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:53,470
But because this is a condition that has an onset until people are in their seventh and eighth decade of life on average,

471
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:58,209
if I can delay onset by five years, it means you die or something else like that.

472
00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:04,030
That is actually a major public health strategy in trying to reduce the number of people who are affected

473
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:09,550
by Alzheimer's disease is by not necessarily figuring out how to prevent it from happening completely,

474
00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:15,750
but just delaying it long enough that because it's happening at the end of it, towards the end of life.

475
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:21,969
Right. So it's an important sort of it's not it just sort of became the first time I heard this strategy.

476
00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:28,210
It just felt a little uncomfortable. That's not uncomfortable when you think about how do we can in the absence of treatment,

477
00:50:28,450 --> 00:50:33,250
the worst thing we could do is progress, is prolong the amount of time people live with this condition.

478
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:38,890
That's the worse thing. The worst worst thing is develop a strategy that changes this from 7 to 10 years.

479
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:44,590
Right. What we want is this this median time from diagnosis to onset to be as short as possible.

480
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:53,220
Or we want to cure or or cure in the absence of a cure.

481
00:50:53,520 --> 00:51:01,140
We want that to be as short as possible. So Alzheimer's is, again, a form of dementia that the primary feature is memory impairment.

482
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:07,970
I'm going to skip through these slides a little bit quickly, but to kind of just help you understand the importance.

483
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:12,870
Again, I haven't tried to any frame and print images for anything else that we've talked about in this class,

484
00:51:12,870 --> 00:51:16,130
and it's because they aren't really used for any other diagnoses like we don't.

485
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:19,650
I mean, sometimes people with schizophrenia, for example,

486
00:51:19,650 --> 00:51:23,729
might have brain imaging done to rule out other things that might be explaining their symptoms.

487
00:51:23,730 --> 00:51:27,340
But brain imaging is almost always done in assessment.

488
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:33,690
It's almost always on. It can be a component of assessment and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.

489
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:34,499
And you can see here,

490
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:45,540
it's an example of just like literally just less brain like area in cerebral spinal and there's just more liquid in the center versus here.

491
00:51:49,050 --> 00:51:53,820
Now, the Alzheimer's has some very specific what we call ology.

492
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:58,440
That is, if you look at the brain of people who eventually die from Alzheimer's,

493
00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:03,690
we probably heard of these ideas of beta amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.

494
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:10,050
These these this histopathology has guided drug development for the last 30 years.

495
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:15,420
And as I said at the very beginning of class, we have no effective treatments for Alzheimer's disease.

496
00:52:16,110 --> 00:52:21,040
So we'll talk a little bit about where. We're not wrong here.

497
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:25,420
But the point is we have some specific histopathology, but we don't know, is this causing the condition?

498
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:29,220
We're just coming along with the condition or a consequence of the condition.

499
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:34,600
We do not know the answer to that. That's what I just said here.

500
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:36,310
And it's again,

501
00:52:36,310 --> 00:52:44,260
only in the past decade have we even been able to quantify just getting out of plaques in the brain before and more before the PET imaging scans.

502
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:50,290
And we but we have known for a long time using mortality studies that the that

503
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:54,910
you can have many people die with lots do not die from Alzheimer's disease.

504
00:52:54,910 --> 00:52:59,830
But if you look in their brains they have lots of tangles and plaques and yet they did not die of Alzheimer's disease.

505
00:52:59,830 --> 00:53:07,230
And so it isn't that there is not a 1 to 1 relationship between the amount of pathology and the actual cognitive impairment.

506
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:11,620
And this is a famous study from John Snowden. He has a study called The Non Study.

507
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:21,669
This is a study of people who like guns. So guns are, you know, notorious for their wild lifestyles and, you know, really poor lifestyle choice.

508
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:30,040
No Lanzarote. Nuns are notorious for not drinking, not smoking, you know, being very, you know, and having a strong social life, etc.

509
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:35,260
So when it was a study of all of these nuns in this comment agreed to donate their brains to science after they passed.

510
00:53:35,930 --> 00:53:43,540
It was really incredible. So this is one of the incredible generosity of people to help us understand what is happening.

511
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:52,710
And so he has taken the brains of almost 700 nuns who completed multiple cognitive assessments and were followed until their death.

512
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:57,350
He match them all two. They're all matched on kind of healthy lifestyles.

513
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:04,570
And what he was able to show is, you know, looking at these neurocognitive test and actually look at the brain.

514
00:54:04,590 --> 00:54:10,049
So this is an example where you've got age is on the x axis and many mental status exam.

515
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:14,330
So this kind of general cognitive deficits y axis, you can see there's a line that goes down.

516
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:17,550
So as you get older, your performance on this test declines.

517
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:24,270
This is one example. So this woman here, Sister Mary, so she lived to be over 100 years old.

518
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:27,930
And despite being that old, she had almost no father.

519
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:34,140
So you might say that Mary's brain probably had nothing going on in it, and that's not true at all.

520
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:44,579
So Sister Mary's value, so she had 57 neurofibrillary tangles in her hippocampus.

521
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:47,730
Everything else is a major part of your brain associated with memory.

522
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:53,069
What was expected for her, based on what we expected to see, how many tangles we tried to see,

523
00:54:53,070 --> 00:54:57,030
based on how well she did on this test at the point of her death was only 22.

524
00:54:57,450 --> 00:55:00,510
So she had a much higher burden of tangles.

525
00:55:00,570 --> 00:55:03,840
She had a much higher burden of plaques in her brain.

526
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:11,410
She had 179. We predicted her to only early Snowden predicted her to only have 55 based on how good she was performing on this test.

527
00:55:11,450 --> 00:55:15,870
We got her brain had a lot of pathology, but she was not expressing that.

528
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:27,209
And so the. Yes, so here so the argument as to like what what made Sister Mary like why was she essentially able to overcome the

529
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:32,460
pathology that was clearly present in her brain and that it did not affect her cognition in her day to day life?

530
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:39,240
And this idea that we have I'll talk to you about this in a second is the idea of cognitive reserve hypothesis,

531
00:55:39,330 --> 00:55:48,150
but that I'll tell you more about that a second. In general, our risk and protective factors for Alzheimer's are we have some, but not that many.

532
00:55:48,690 --> 00:55:55,229
And very few of these are modifiable. Mild cognitive impairment is essentially thought to be kind of even the about this

533
00:55:55,230 --> 00:56:01,379
is like pre almost like pre dementia here so it's it's not quite a risk factor.

534
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:11,400
It's also it's almost certainly part of partly a prodromal period before the diagnosis that the three protective factors that

535
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:18,990
we have good evidence for both from observational data and in some cases clinical trial data are being physically active,

536
00:56:18,990 --> 00:56:23,250
being socially active and having high education.

537
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:27,360
So all of you, by just sitting here, are protecting yourselves from Alzheimer's disease.

538
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:33,530
So but then it's sort of like raises the question like, well, why the [INAUDIBLE] with something that you're almost certainly going to be it.

539
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:37,920
Most people are done with your formal education, age 25, so don't really school past that age.

540
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:45,000
So why would educational attainment protect against a condition like Alzheimer's that doesn't begin to even show symptoms until,

541
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:47,100
you know, people in their sixties or seventies?

542
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:56,380
And this this question has of form the the sort of underlying idea of what's called the cognitive reserve hypothesis.

543
00:56:57,190 --> 00:57:06,159
So the idea here is that while we have cases like Sister Mary, where it's clear that the brain has a lot of pathology,

544
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:10,660
that her brain was smaller than what was predicted based on her cognitive scores,

545
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:16,420
she had a lot more tangles and plaques than would have been predicted based on her cognitive score.

546
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:22,330
Like, if you just saw Mary's brain, you would have never predicted that she was performing well on cognitive tests.

547
00:57:22,630 --> 00:57:27,460
And similarly, if you just saw Mary's cognitive test, you would have never predicted that her brain looked the way it did.

548
00:57:28,330 --> 00:57:33,159
So so the main idea of the cognitive reserve hypothesis is that the brain is plastic

549
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:37,900
and it can essentially accommodate or become resilient against insults and biology.

550
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:40,000
So what does it have to do with education?

551
00:57:40,030 --> 00:57:47,030
Well, we think that education is a proxy or surrogate marker of brain plasticity or kind of accommodation potential.

552
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:52,780
You know, in order to continue to gain in education, you have to learn how to do new things.

553
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:56,530
And those things over time are kind of protecting our brain.

554
00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:04,410
Now, the the thing that how this relates to kind of broader health and health disparities is that we need

555
00:58:04,410 --> 00:58:09,240
to understand that people who are age 65 today completed their education in the 1960s and seventies.

556
00:58:10,410 --> 00:58:20,070
So what I've indicated here is when this is when Brown v Board of Education is passed, which is the Supreme Court decision that desegregate school.

557
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:26,909
But of course, we still have, even though we do not have de jure segregation in U.S. schools,

558
00:58:26,910 --> 00:58:31,950
we still very much have de facto segregation in U.S. schools. And the.

559
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:38,260
Oops. Sorry. Where's this other term of where the 1979 was?

560
00:58:39,450 --> 00:58:43,730
I'm sorry. I've forgotten all about this. I'll double check this line here.

561
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:50,160
So what that means is that we are both.

562
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:54,540
Both as the U.S. is becoming more educated.

563
00:58:55,080 --> 00:59:00,390
This may help protect against that wave of Alzheimer's that we're expecting to see just based on population aging.

564
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:06,450
But then second is that this protection is not being experienced equally in the US population.

565
00:59:07,770 --> 00:59:13,040
And in fact, there is some evidence that on average, as U.S. educational attainment has increased,

566
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:16,400
that the prevalence of dementia has begun to decline.

567
00:59:16,710 --> 00:59:23,520
It's declined relative to where we predicted it would be not decline relative to where it was before.

568
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:28,760
Oh, sorry. So this is our county board of Education is 54.

569
00:59:30,270 --> 00:59:35,330
I just told you this that we're still listing residential defacto.

570
00:59:35,390 --> 00:59:40,820
It's not visual arts. Okay. So.

571
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:49,360
So let me pause here for questions. So again, this is Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of neurocognitive disorder.

572
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:59,280
And that part of this. Women and racial minorities have and those less education have greater risk of 80.

573
01:00:00,030 --> 01:00:03,870
What will be interesting to see us as that broader access to education,

574
01:00:03,990 --> 01:00:11,040
both in terms of broader educated access to higher education for women and broader and racial minorities has changed over time.

575
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:17,040
Whether these additional whether hopefully we can potentially see some of these disparities begin to shrink.

576
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:22,980
Any questions here?

577
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:35,140
I'm going to do that at times. So let me close by.

578
01:00:36,390 --> 01:00:40,550
Telling you about. I'm going to tell you a little bit about the.

579
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:48,000
Oh, yes, yes, yes. Are there any. I saw that there are like two types of jeans that were noted on the postures.

580
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:52,360
Are there any, like concrete genetic predispositions, like for breast cancer?

581
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:55,800
And there's like a problem, which means like. Yeah, that's a great question.

582
01:00:55,810 --> 01:01:01,440
So these rare genes are that are as good as proper, essentially, if not better, actually.

583
01:01:01,450 --> 01:01:10,590
So what's interesting. Thank you for bringing this up. So. So apoe e4 is this APR e think that that's what this is.

584
01:01:10,890 --> 01:01:13,260
Epsilon four is the variant of this gene.

585
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:21,840
So for a long time the hypothesis was that being homozygous as having two copies of this is associated with higher risk of Alzheimer's.

586
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:27,180
And that is true but not as bad. It's actually not true for any other racial ethnic group.

587
01:01:27,630 --> 01:01:30,810
But now we have enough people, now we have enough large enough samples.

588
01:01:30,810 --> 01:01:36,720
And so we actually don't understand the genetic underpinnings of Alzheimer's disease for nonwhite populations in the U.S. at least.

589
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:42,029
At least these are autosomal these are like Mendelian traits.

590
01:01:42,030 --> 01:01:49,080
So very rare in Alzheimer's disease. If it if it's if you have this variant, it's usually autism.

591
01:01:49,770 --> 01:01:55,040
So it's like it's quite common. And so because it's like that study, they're like Sister Mary,

592
01:01:55,050 --> 01:02:01,170
are they looking for like other potential physiological reasons as to why people have Alzheimer's?

593
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:07,109
It's like between those it things like like maybe not not the thing that's causing the problem.

594
01:02:07,110 --> 01:02:10,200
Yes. So so yeah.

595
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:16,800
So that is a great so it's this is it's almost like there's a there's a.

596
01:02:18,210 --> 01:02:19,950
So to answer your question a very roundabout way.

597
01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:30,120
So I think what's helpful to understand is like and this is in the sense of like this is only available to us upon hindsight.

598
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:36,030
So you all are at the cusp of, I think, a really new time just thinking about what causes Alzheimer's disease,

599
01:02:36,030 --> 01:02:41,580
how should we think about how to help, what what types of interventions are needed, etc.?

600
01:02:42,750 --> 01:02:49,380
So again, some of the earliest findings was that the brains of people who die by Alzheimer's look different than the brains of people who don't.

601
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:55,680
Right. And so the way they look different is that they have these plaques and tangles more off more, but versus people who don't.

602
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:58,770
But then we learn that like actually a lot of most people have some fracture tangles.

603
01:02:58,770 --> 01:03:04,110
So maybe it's about how many or where they are, or maybe there's something else that's that's going on,

604
01:03:04,110 --> 01:03:08,670
that's explaining why in the presence of all this, you know, why these things are happening.

605
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:10,979
Right. And so some people are not going to be able to answer that question.

606
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:14,940
But for example, there are some people who think it has to do with the immune system and inflammation.

607
01:03:14,940 --> 01:03:19,290
Right. And actually, it's not the brain cells, it's the glial cells which are all these immune cells that are in your brain,

608
01:03:19,290 --> 01:03:22,679
too, that kind of also are a little funky for people who have Alzheimer's disease.

609
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:31,110
Right. So and again, I can't answer that today, but what I want to tell you is that this finding of the plaques and tangles in brains of people who

610
01:03:31,110 --> 01:03:37,220
eventually die from Alzheimer's disease is literally led to billions of dollars in investment.

611
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:42,990
So you can see all of these clinical trials were again, over 100 drugs have been tested,

612
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:47,580
including 200 that have been made it all the way to phase two or three trials.

613
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:53,850
And almost all of these were informed by either the beta amyloid or the tangle hypothesis.

614
01:03:53,850 --> 01:03:59,729
And this this figure of hyperlinks out, I believe, to a or at least two words in the notes of today's lecture onto a really wonderful

615
01:03:59,730 --> 01:04:04,610
article that was published in Nature just last year about sort of the idea that like,

616
01:04:05,310 --> 01:04:07,530
what are we we have trials in search of a target.

617
01:04:07,530 --> 01:04:11,280
That is, we're spending a lot of money trying to figure out what's going on without knowing what's going on.

618
01:04:12,210 --> 01:04:19,110
And today, only the problem is, is that because of all of these failed trials,

619
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:25,190
only 5% of drugs that are in development by major pharmaceutical companies today have anything to do with 80.

620
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:28,860
So because drug companies have been burned by this,

621
01:04:28,860 --> 01:04:32,840
they're not investing in it because they don't really even though there's there's a huge market right there,

622
01:04:32,850 --> 01:04:36,740
ten or 6 billion people today that would buy this drug.

623
01:04:36,990 --> 01:04:40,470
They're going to be ten or 2014 billion in 20 years.

624
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:50,150
Right. So just to kind of, again, give you a sense of like major, maybe like when I say pulling back, I mean, seriously.

625
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:57,520
So like in February 2018, Pfizer, it was simply just ending this research and development on Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.

626
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:02,100
It's like Pfizer is not do spending money on finding drugs for these.

627
01:05:03,910 --> 01:05:09,670
Now last year in June, there was a huge lot of debate and maybe not debate,

628
01:05:09,670 --> 01:05:13,840
but a controversy that Biogen, which is a different pharmaceutical company,

629
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:21,999
received accelerated FDA approval for this drug, which is the first, we call it, a disease modifying treatment.

630
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:31,030
That is what it does, is it appears to reduce the amount of amyloid in people who took it.

631
01:05:31,450 --> 01:05:33,669
Okay. So the amyloid in people's brains, that, again,

632
01:05:33,670 --> 01:05:42,070
those are just some examples of the types of data they provided to the FDA that we see a decline in the amount of amyloid in people's brains.

633
01:05:42,490 --> 01:05:49,000
What's very important is that in none of the trials and none of the data that this that Biogen provided to the FDA,

634
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:57,760
does they show any improvement in cognition? That is, no one in the Biogen trials was able to have better executive function.

635
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:01,210
They did not have better executive functioning. They did not have better memory, nothing.

636
01:06:01,510 --> 01:06:05,500
But they had fewer amyloid. They had less amyloid in their brain.

637
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:11,859
And so, again, the hope is that somehow by just letting this drug out into the world,

638
01:06:11,860 --> 01:06:17,710
which now it is out into the world, we'll figure out if it can prevent Alzheimer's.

639
01:06:18,190 --> 01:06:29,830
But we actually don't know. And and Medicare, you know, this drug, I think, costs something over $100,000 for which I retired.

640
01:06:30,430 --> 01:06:39,650
So I. Oh, sorry.

641
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:44,180
I want to say a couple of things, and then I'm going to let you go. Sorry to keep you too much to talk about.

642
01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:52,339
So. So part of it. And so in addition to the fact that it's possible that we've been looking under the lamp post because that's where the light is,

643
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:56,300
but that's actually not where the solution to Alzheimer's is,

644
01:06:56,720 --> 01:07:04,100
is that most of our trials of Alzheimer's disease require somebody to have mild cognitive impairment before they even get into the trial.

645
01:07:04,370 --> 01:07:10,219
Well, if mild cognitive impairment is actually just the beginning of Alzheimer's and I'm not preventing Alzheimer's,

646
01:07:10,220 --> 01:07:13,970
you've just got early Alzheimer's. That's like saying I'm going to enroll people in a depression treatment trial

647
01:07:13,970 --> 01:07:17,330
after they've already got four of nine symptoms instead of five of nine symptoms.

648
01:07:17,330 --> 01:07:20,930
Right. They've got mild depression rather than a major depression.

649
01:07:21,890 --> 01:07:28,430
So so that's the first thing. The second is that of all the trials that have been conducted,

650
01:07:29,180 --> 01:07:34,820
not just in the United States by globally, 95% of those participants have been conducted through 2019.

651
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:40,240
So we have massive. And who gets Alzheimer's disease?

652
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:44,840
It's I mean, everybody is eligible, but it's more common among people who are nonwhite.

653
01:07:45,290 --> 01:07:51,889
And so what this means is that we and this is this underrepresented underrepresentation of minorities is true in most research.

654
01:07:51,890 --> 01:08:02,060
But it is grotesque when it when it comes to 80 trials, I can't think of another condition that has this lopsided of of enrollment.

655
01:08:04,730 --> 01:08:10,250
Again. The other reason this is difficult is that you've we we, we you have to follow people for literally decades.

656
01:08:10,250 --> 01:08:18,620
So you're asking a drug company to essentially make an investment in 2022 that might pay off in 2025 or our 2045 or 2050.

657
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:27,860
I'm not going to be able to talk about the placebo response, but we will talk about this. We're talking about brain body interaction in a few weeks,

658
01:08:27,860 --> 01:08:32,390
which because this is just kind of the fascinating, fascinating things are we can tell you about that.

659
01:08:33,620 --> 01:08:39,679
I will say like and then I know, you know, I'm infamous for ending these lectures on high notes is that I will say,

660
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:43,729
like people recognize this like they recognize it's not like this is in everything I just told you about.

661
01:08:43,730 --> 01:08:48,080
People don't recognize this is a problem. And so this is just from December of last year.

There's a new prevention trial that is looking for people who have a family history of these genetics for Alzheimer's disease.

663
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:57,400
And the idea is like, you know,

664
01:08:57,740 --> 01:09:06,440
in the idea that we can enroll them in their twenties and thirties and actually trying to prevent or at least delay onset of this condition,

665
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:12,620
although actually can't ever be just positive. What are they testing for?

666
01:09:12,620 --> 01:09:18,230
Testing another amyloid agent. So. Okay, so I will stop there.
