1
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:05,980
It was like a little glamor in my face.

2
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:18,900
Yeah. You know, like, I felt like I was like, oh, my God.

3
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:47,970
Yeah. It's like, yeah. It almost feels like I mentioned to you last night, and then I was like, I don't like so, like, you know, I really don't know.

4
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:56,490
I that's. It's. It's always been camping world.

5
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:04,080
Yeah, it's a job. But it was like we talk all the time.

6
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:13,440
That's especially like what is happening over there.

7
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,240
Yeah, cause it's literally, like, taking so long.

8
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:22,620
It's like going to a time where you think. Welcome to Patricia's counseling.

9
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,770
I feel like I've had a lot of people, but still not all of you.

10
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:30,660
So I'm happy that we're not letting you graduate until you are required to sit through one of my classes.

11
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,709
So I'm Kendra outside of L. I'm an assistant professors department.

12
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:42,090
Hopefully you most of you remember that. I'll talk a little bit about me and why I teach this course, but before I do that,

13
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:46,770
I just wanted to give you a little preview about the plan for today.

14
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,890
So we're you will not be here for 3 hours. I understand 3 hours is like a tricky amount of time to be in a classroom.

15
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,900
And explain a little bit when I go through the syllabus why we have a three hour chunk.

16
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:06,390
When we get to the part of the course where we're doing role plays and counseling, we need that kind of protected time to be able to do real plays.

17
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,760
Most of the time they'll be out of class stuff that will take up a chunk of the course time.

18
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,860
So if we are approaching a class time, we're likely will be here for 3 hours.

19
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,800
I will let you know. But today that's not the plan.

20
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:27,030
The plan is to tell you about the class, the expectations, how it's going to be structured for the next 13 weeks,

21
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,660
and then do a little bit of an introduction to patient centered care,

22
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:39,240
which is for me, a guiding framework as to how I think about counseling and how we can honor our patients in that work.

23
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,270
And then we'll break for two weeks. All right.

24
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:51,990
We don't have class next Monday, so I'll give you a fair amount of stuff to work on between now and two weeks, but it'll be sort of a short ish class.

25
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:57,510
And then we will hit the ground running two weeks afterwards, as I'm talking.

26
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:06,200
And folks who have taken my class know the assignments, the assignment is hotdog, not hamburger.

27
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:09,390
This is your first quiz for this.

28
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:13,260
Like a hot dog. Write your name faces that I can see your name again.

29
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:18,419
I know most of you, but the cognitive burden that it takes sometimes to recall names in real time.

30
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,460
I'm trying to decrease that for myself as I age through middle ages.

31
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:31,770
So please put your name on here. I'm going to have you record an intro video between now and next time where you will share names,

32
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:36,570
preferred nicknames, pronouns that you would like me to use so you can.

33
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,370
You're welcome to put them on here, but I will have them elsewhere if you choose to share them.

34
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:46,650
If you don't choose to share them. I have no need to use pronouns ever to describe people, so I will avoid using them.

35
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,520
So just know that you have the option to do that, but you don't need to do that.

36
00:03:51,390 --> 00:04:00,150
And please wait till one of these pens come around. It's just easier for me to see again if my middle aged eyes, if it's in it in dark lunch.

37
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:07,590
All right. And pick your favorite color. Yeah. So welcome.

38
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,880
This is me. There's also going to be two graders in this class.

39
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:16,830
Both are graduates from this program who you may or may not have.

40
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:21,870
You won't have overlap with Ash. You'll get to know Ash quite a lot at the end of the semester because one of the final

41
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:29,010
assignments in this class is a clinical role play where she will be the model patient.

42
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:37,020
So you will have to counsel her so you'll have more interaction with her as a greater than you might otherwise.

43
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:42,030
But otherwise, behind the scenes, they'll be sort of doing some checking of things.

44
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:51,780
So why do I teach this class? I have taught this class since 2015, the year I joined the faculty.

45
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:59,560
Here are 2014 and 2015. I took on this class and I've had ever since and I am really happy that I get to.

46
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:07,470
Be your introduction, or maybe you've all been doing counseling, just not so much of an introduction, but to formally teach you about counseling.

47
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,500
In my work as a dietitian before I came here, I always worked in a counseling setting.

48
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:23,760
My first position was in a outpatient clinic at Boston Children's Hospital, where I worked with adolescents and young adults.

49
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,870
I had predominantly eating disorder counseling.

50
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,250
So you're going to hear a bit about eating disorder work throughout the course because I can't help myself.

51
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:39,180
But that is a practice setting where counseling is at the core of your role as a dietitian.

52
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:49,440
And when I transitioned from full time outpatient dietitian to part time outpatient dietitian and part time doctoral student,

53
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,320
I continued to work in the counseling space from a research standpoint.

54
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:58,710
So one of my dissertation projects was a motivational interviewing study with young kids,

55
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:03,840
and since coming to Michigan, I've also worked on a couple of motivational interviewing research projects.

56
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,140
So my research is based in behavior change.

57
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:17,160
I'm particularly interested in how we can help promote health and help sort of encourage people to sort of

58
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:24,070
make behavior changes that align with them in a way that doesn't cause harm as the goal here in this class.

59
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:24,659
Because, again,

60
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:33,000
I can't help myself about the potential harm when we do nutrition counseling in a way that's not patient centered in the harms that I think about.

61
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:41,340
For my own research, I think about weight bias. I also think about how the way that we counsel can really drive inequities,

62
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:46,020
particularly when our identities don't align with the patients that we work with.

63
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:52,709
It is a barrier to a patient client, dietician, client relationship.

64
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:59,790
And so if you are someone who inhabits a lot of privilege identities, your work is much greater in doing meaningful counseling work.

65
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:03,570
So that is the area that I like to research.

66
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:09,000
It's exciting to get to teach while and this class is, like I said, a fun one.

67
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,229
But I know it's requires that some folks are here like this is not always your favorite place to be,

68
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:19,230
particularly when we get to the role playing part of this class and you have to just put yourself out there and practice.

69
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:25,590
It's like humbling and it's also great to do it here with people who are kind,

70
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,879
hopefully, and are going through the same thing that you all are going through.

71
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:34,800
It's much better to practice it here before you take your counseling skills out into the real world.

72
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:39,719
Any questions on me now that you have questions on me?

73
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:45,120
But anything so far as we're all passing the first hot dog, that hamburger test.

74
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,540
So thank you for that. Yeah. He gets a stack of. Yeah.

75
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:55,290
Where did that I guess for folks who played an important role you got me hot dog.

76
00:07:55,410 --> 00:08:04,800
Not here. But he's critical because he doesn't have either whoever or we've gone rogue.

77
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:17,060
All right. So the technical course description, just as a reminder of what we're trying to do in this class.

78
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:24,560
My job is to help you become more familiar with counseling strategies that can be used for you.

79
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:32,600
Track the behavior change. You want to use a lot of motivational interviewing or will teach a lot of motivational interviewing skills.

80
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:37,899
And that's a skill that will practice quite a lot in the context of these behavior change conversations,

81
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,370
just given the evidence for its effectiveness.

82
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:48,650
As I mentioned, begrudgingly or not, you will participate in counseling activities and role play to practice these skills.

83
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:58,280
This course has a strong emphasis on client patient centered counseling and culture of humility is a critical part of who you are as a counselor,

84
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:04,220
as being humble and sort of recognizing who you are and what you bring into the dynamic with your patients.

85
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:08,330
And we will emphasize both the art and the science of nutrition counseling.

86
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:13,460
This is in a class that you that there's always like one right answer, one way, way to proceed.

87
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:21,170
And we'll honor that in how we talk about counseling scenarios and what you might ask

88
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:25,460
or what you might avoid when you're having counseling interactions with patients.

89
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:32,600
So this is what we're going to talk about in the order that we're going to talk about it.

90
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:36,499
So we'll start at patient centered care in two weeks.

91
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:41,240
When we reconvene, we'll talk about nutrition, education and health literacy.

92
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:48,350
The following week will focus on culture, humility following followed by a week of weight bias.

93
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:55,040
That, to me feels like the foundational part of being a human who's going to participate in counseling.

94
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:59,870
Once we do that foundational stuff. Then we go on to actual counseling skills.

95
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:03,020
So the course to some extent is divided in half in that way.

96
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:09,290
So the second half of the course is when we talk about actually interviewing skills, communication skills,

97
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:15,200
we'll spend several weeks on motivational interviewing, the different skills involved in mind.

98
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:24,379
We'll have one session about counseling, documentation, and we'll end the course with advanced topics and counseling and ethical issues and practice.

99
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:32,420
And this relates to our our job perhaps as mandated reporters or what we do if we need to

100
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:38,590
de-escalate a patient or we suspect that your patient is hard to themselves or others,

101
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:44,930
these types of things, that when you work in an outpatient setting come up and we have to be prepared to think about those.

102
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:53,530
I'm going to pull up the syllabus, which is on the canvas side at the top.

103
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:59,850
The first thing that you can come to or that you can click on is is the syllabus.

104
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:07,320
The canvas site is sort of designed obviously to follow along with the syllabus, but if you want to just look at it all in one place, I have it here.

105
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:14,340
And as I mentioned, the course is sort of kind of that sort of divide it in half, right?

106
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:18,209
The first few weeks, you'll will never be in this class for 3 hours.

107
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:24,360
You'll have a lot of outside of class tasks, including readings, quizzes and videos.

108
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:34,430
And then at week six, then we'll start spending more time in class and you'll notice a lot less in the way of preparation.

109
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,610
The videos that I show here are like three minute videos, like really, really light preparation.

110
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,940
You'll come here ready to practice and role play.

111
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,680
Questions on anything before I keep going.

112
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:04,370
I will read these. This class is required for people who are becoming dietitians.

113
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,590
You all know this. That is why you're sitting here.

114
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:19,070
But this relates to requirements or expectations in the scope of knowledge, patient centered care, and effective communication.

115
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,770
So how will you get a grade in this class? So these are the course requirements.

116
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:30,780
They sum to 100% for simplicity of canvas math.

117
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:36,150
The course is worth 100 points, so every point is equal to 1% of your grade.

118
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:40,890
In the next two weeks, I'm going to ask you to record an intro video.

119
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:45,360
People taking the class with me in the past know what this is like. Hostage video.

120
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,140
You tell me some things about yourself. I'll ask you specifically about what I want to know.

121
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:56,100
But I do want to get to know you. I want to really specifically hear about your experiences in nutrition, education and counseling settings.

122
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:01,950
This class is better when we all learn from each other, and I'm not the only one talking,

123
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:07,530
so it's actually really useful for me to know who has worked in a student run clinic

124
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,840
or what your MPH internships taught you about working with patients or communities.

125
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:17,760
So that's something I'm going to ask you to tell me about in the intro video. It is.

126
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:24,930
If you do it, it is free. Free points of 3% during three weeks of the class.

127
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:29,550
I'm going to have you take four question quizzes outside of class time.

128
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:36,450
I call them mini quizzes only because they're taken straight from the reading.

129
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:45,089
They're super and honestly super easy because extract information from readings is not always as easy as we wish it could be.

130
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:49,770
But if you have the reading open, you will likely get to 100% when you take these quizzes.

131
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:54,599
But it's important to me that you're doing the work outside of class, and so I don't want to call these attention checks,

132
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,660
but they are to some extent, like, please just do the readings, watch the videos.

133
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:03,120
So we all have the same information. We can start at the same place during class.

134
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,260
So that's there are four questions each. That's 12% of your grade.

135
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:13,980
During five of the class sessions, we're going to be doing something in class that will earn you five points.

136
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:19,320
And what that will look like is providing feedback, written feedback to someone in your group.

137
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:25,320
Often it's going to be something related to some kind of written feedback or some kind of in class reflection.

138
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:30,750
Again, you have to be here to do it. So if you're not here, we can talk about attendance stuff in a second.

139
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,680
There's usually going to be an opportunity to have a make up activity.

140
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:39,659
But these are essentially what I'm thinking of as your participation points,

141
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:46,260
like doing the stuff in class that will, if you are here and you submit it, you should be able to get those points.

142
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:54,250
There's two reflections in this class. One is do in three weeks, four weeks.

143
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,760
I have the week off. Sort of confuses my numbers. In a few weeks.

144
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:01,690
I would have you take an implicit association test.

145
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:08,620
You maybe have done this in other courses, but you'll take the test and write a reflection based on that experience.

146
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:14,950
Taking the implicit association test and some of the other content from the class that is related to culture humility.

147
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:24,700
So that reflection is worth 10%. I'm going to make you all listen to a podcast so that you can critique someone else's interviewing skills.

148
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:29,379
As you learn about interviewing skills, it's actually really interesting to turn them on someone else.

149
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:33,010
Like you might listen to podcasts and think, Oh, that person does a really nice interview.

150
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:39,700
And the goal of this exercise is for you to know why. Like, why are certain people really fun to listen to when they interview?

151
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,150
It probably is because they're using patient centered counseling skills.

152
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,950
And so this reflection is this is an opportunity for you to pick whatever podcasts on earth you like,

153
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:53,800
where there's an interview portion and to hear what the interviewer is doing to make their guest feel comfortable,

154
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:59,860
to elicit information, to make the person who have to feel sort of safe and willing to open up.

155
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:09,309
And then your two big assignments in this class, one is do a week, five or six and what is due, I think week 12.

156
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:11,440
So sort of the first half in the second half.

157
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:18,490
The first one is you're making a a handout, a patient education material that utilizes principles of plain language,

158
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:24,519
which are designed to help reduce the health literacy load of educational materials.

159
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,400
How can you make an education material that's going to be understood by most?

160
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:32,890
And then the second bigger assignment in this class is a self-evaluation.

161
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:37,420
I mentioned you're going to be doing a counseling role play with my grader Ash.

162
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:44,380
We will record that calcium role play. You will have to watch city council and role play.

163
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:49,750
I'm giving you 12 weeks to mentally prepare for yourself, having to watch yourself to council.

164
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:53,770
We've all done it. It's unpleasant, but it's really, really useful for our learning.

165
00:16:54,100 --> 00:17:01,480
So you're going to watch your role play and critique yourself and do a really honest reflection of how you did and motivational interviewing.

166
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:05,110
You are graded not on the quality of your motivational interviewing.

167
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:09,520
No one is going to leave this class. Expert am I counselors?

168
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:14,259
You are graded on the quality of your reflection. What did you notice about what went well?

169
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:20,200
What you might have done differently? Where you missed opportunities for complex reflections, where you ask close ended questions,

170
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:27,840
where an open ended question or reflection might have been more useful. So it's the activity of doing the role play washing and reflecting it.

171
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:33,860
That's the other sort of large assignment in this class. Questions on this stuff.

172
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:44,500
This class to me feels a lot like a lot of one session units on topics and the ends, like a four session unit on I.

173
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:49,900
So there's not a lot of working ahead you can do in this class because it sort of comes on a weekly basis.

174
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:56,499
So don't worry too much about what's happening down here. You don't have the content to actually even work ahead on these assignments.

175
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,280
Just think about what is the task for. For my next week.

176
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:10,580
So the expectations that I have to do the readings and to watch the videos again so we can all

177
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:15,410
be sort of coming from the or starting from the same place at the start of each class session.

178
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:23,120
Again, those mini quizzes are designed to help add extra motivation for doing those readings and videos.

179
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:29,680
I would like you here in this room because this is a hands on class.

180
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:32,269
This is a practice, this is a skills based class.

181
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:42,140
So it just works better if you are here, if you are ill or physically fit in, this room is not compatible with your health or safety.

182
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:51,469
Do not be here. We'll figure out a plan B. I don't want you on icy roads or symptomatic with infectious things in this classroom.

183
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:56,120
And so if you can't be here, we'll figure it out. I want you to try really hard, but if it's not going to work, it's not going to work.

184
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:00,500
So be here when you can.

185
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:08,719
There is participation obviously built into those in-class activities, but also participation just makes this class a whole lot better.

186
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,780
Right? I have the clinical scenarios that I'll share.

187
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,480
I am happy to be talking a lot, but it's better when I'm not doing all the talking.

188
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:20,030
So I really want you guys engaged and taking responsibility for the quality of the

189
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:24,889
discussant discussion to challenge yourself during in-class activities and role plays.

190
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:29,719
What? I break you up into groups. You can hang out and not do the activity, but then you are not learning, am I?

191
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:37,520
You're not learning recall skills, so really hold yourself and each other accountable to really practice even if it's super uncomfortable.

192
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:46,130
I promise you you'll be happy to have done it here before you go to your buddies or other practice places.

193
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:51,620
In terms of the course format, I alluded to this a little bit, but the structure of the class,

194
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:55,940
there isn't one like you may have noticed in some of the other classes.

195
00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:00,020
If you take a mammoth, I lecture for the first half and then we do an activity for the second half.

196
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:04,280
It is different every single time because the contents of this class differ so much.

197
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:08,720
So as I mentioned, sometimes it'll be a short class with lots of outside stuff.

198
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:12,979
Sometimes it'll be a session where we're just working on something that I'll give

199
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:16,940
you some advance notice about what the following session is going to look like.

200
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:26,150
If we are going to be doing something that is more than an hour and a half, I will certainly build in a break.

201
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:30,530
If a break is not coming the time you need it. We do what you need to do.

202
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:35,870
I don't you do not have to have my permission to to exit and take time if you need.

203
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:41,510
I am recording the class sessions.

204
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:50,090
So if anyone goes into Panopto after this class session, you can see how much all of the things in this classroom are specifically recording you.

205
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:55,670
I fear that you guys are really unsure if last Wednesday's class was any indication.

206
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:01,489
So I'm using Panopto that has a webcast option. I'm not using Zoom, which I've done in the past.

207
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:06,350
So this is sort of an experiment because it's pretty tricky to engage with folks on Zoom.

208
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:12,919
So I'm just using the Panopto. If you can't be here but can participate or can listen live, you can be listening from home.

209
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:18,469
You just can't engage with what's happening. If there's anything you miss, you have to leave early.

210
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:23,960
You can always go back and watch the full recording on Panopto on that tab on the website.

211
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:29,990
If you, for example, cannot be here in class because you're feeling ill, for example,

212
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:33,980
but you want to participate in a in class activity because you don't miss those points.

213
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:37,370
Let me know in advance and I will see what I can do.

214
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:43,459
Often I can take your phone number and have your group call you and have you participate.

215
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:49,610
That way, if you're feeling not well enough to participate again, I will come up with an alternative.

216
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:53,990
I don't want you missing out on points or your grade being compromised because you're not feeling well.

217
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:58,879
But it's much easier if I know in advance because if I have, for example, two or three people are not going to be here,

218
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:05,660
I can create a virtual group and it's a lot easier for me to do that if I have the information as far advanced as possible.

219
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:13,670
Although with illness and whether it's not always possible, I understand questions on expectations.

220
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,570
I have a lot of astrup sitting here. Everything's on canvas.

221
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,059
If you can't find what you need, your readings are on canvas.

222
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:29,380
Your due date, your assignment descriptions, those that have rubrics, those should be in there.

223
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:39,280
Anything. There's no books for this class. So again, any reading you should need to consult will be posted somewhere in campus.

224
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:44,960
Okay. That's the end of logistics.

225
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:49,590
Have I left anything out or folks wondering, what's this class about?

226
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:53,970
How do I get a good grade? What am I going to learn if we cover those things?

227
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:01,520
Right. All right, let's learn some new stuff.

228
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:07,400
So the next new stuff still is kind of in the spirit of introducing the course, right?

229
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:13,070
Like, what do I feel like is in the purview of this class? What am I trying to cover here as class?

230
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:17,360
I actually can't remember the technical title. I don't think education is technically in the title this class.

231
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:24,530
It's really a counseling course, but we'll cover a better future for education because nutrition education is a part of counseling.

232
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:32,750
They both collectively fall within a certain part of the attraction, care process and model.

233
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:37,340
Folks are familiar with this picture. You have seen this more times than you care to admit.

234
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:43,429
The nutrition care process. So what we're going to talk about in this class generally falls here, right.

235
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:48,470
Falls in the nutrition intervention bucket, if you will, of the nutrition care process.

236
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:50,420
So within nutrition intervention,

237
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:58,280
it's actions designed to change nutrition related behavior or try to improve a diagnosis or improve a nutrition problem.

238
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:02,280
Right. So counseling and education generally falls in that area.

239
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:06,559
And nutrition care process speaks about nutrition,

240
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:13,220
education and nutrition counseling as one of a handful of things that dietitians can do as an intervention.

241
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:16,940
And again, they often go in tandem, but they sort of think about them differently.

242
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:21,320
Your church education is a formal process to instruct or train.

243
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:26,390
We are imparting knowledge when we are doing nutrition education.

244
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,850
Knowledge is necessary but not sufficient for behavior change.

245
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:36,080
You will hear about that in your readings for our next class.

246
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:40,850
Probably remember that statement when you are taking your quiz for next class.

247
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:44,900
To knowledge is necessary but not sufficient for behavior change.

248
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:55,270
So the other part of the intervention that we're going to cover a lot in this class is the counseling process.

249
00:24:55,270 --> 00:25:01,220
So counseling has a lot more to it than just telling people facts or telling people information.

250
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:08,570
If you're to counseling is a supportive process. It is collaborative, involves a counselor and a client, a relationship between those two.

251
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:16,940
And the goal is to establish priorities, goals, action plans, again, related to nutrition related behavior change.

252
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:24,440
So we'll do a little bit of both. We'll start soon in this class for that nutrition educational handout assignment,

253
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:29,360
talking about how do we just dispense information, like how do we decide what's the key information?

254
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:37,549
And then we'll move into a more kind of higher level skills related to the collaborative counselor

255
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:42,710
client relationship and how you get information from patients and how you dispense information.

256
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:55,860
So in terms of kind of the competencies or the skills that I think are really critical to being a good counselor, these are the three that I think of.

257
00:25:56,730 --> 00:26:00,420
You will see these interwoven throughout this class.

258
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:08,900
So that I think this is sort of sort of how every content or topic of discussion really hangs together is that we focus on communication,

259
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:14,760
critical thinking and ethics. I'm sure there's other kind of backbones or other sort of critical skills,

260
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:19,200
but that's sort of what I really try to emphasize in this class is that we are learning to be good communicators,

261
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:24,150
to think critically about the information we receive, think critically about the information that we give,

262
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:32,970
and to have our patients, our ethics, their priorities at the heart of what we prioritize in our counseling interactions.

263
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:45,020
So I a bit further and this is where what we do with this class is not limited just to that nutrition intervention

264
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:53,749
slice of nutrition care process pie because nutrition communication matters for the whole year just in care process.

265
00:26:53,750 --> 00:27:04,110
Process, right. It's important in relationship building, in interviewing and assessment, obviously, counseling and education and coordination of care.

266
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:07,970
Right. We're talking to other health care providers that are working with our patients.

267
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:11,990
And so communication skills really travel throughout that nutrition care process.

268
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:20,059
Communication skills may differ in our practice setting, but we have to think about what is the right type of communication,

269
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:23,780
what's the right approach, given the constraints of my practice settings.

270
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,130
So the way that you might have a conversation with a patient in an institutional setting,

271
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:35,810
really different than a patient conversation that you have in an outpatient setting in a private practice.

272
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:43,700
So I also I should have mentioned I had a private practice in Boston for like 12 years for a lot of years.

273
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:50,540
So I was working an outpatient one on one setting within a hospital where I have

274
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:54,919
a lot of constraints about how much time I'm allowed to spend with my patients,

275
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:59,230
the ways that I have to document. And then also, I worked in a private practice setting, right?

276
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:05,840
A lot more flexibility about the activities that I do with my patients, who is involved in the sessions, how much time I spend,

277
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:13,129
whether or not we stay in the physical room or we might go to a grocery store or I might go to going to walk while we're having our sessions so we can

278
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:17,600
think about how your practice setting in that way might really influence how

279
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,680
you communicate if you're working in a worksite versus a community setting.

280
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:26,180
Again, our communication skills, we really have to adapt to what makes sense for that environment,

281
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,250
and that's how they will try to think about throughout this course.

282
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:43,239
Committee critical thinking is that other core counseling competency that is really integral to our planning application,

283
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:47,770
implementation of nutrition interventions, we can't prioritize everything.

284
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,040
We can't tell our patients everything. Right.

285
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:58,630
We have to take all the stuff that you have learned in the last two years, put it in your brain and spit out two or 3 billion points.

286
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:07,420
That's how we talk to patients and find bullet points. But in key messages in I like to think medicine proper types of information.

287
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:13,129
Right. We want to hit people over the head with it. We don't want to drown them with it. We want to give them information in bite sized pieces.

288
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:18,160
And that requires a lot of critical thinking of what are the goals of my patients and what is.

289
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:23,500
From a health standpoint, the most important thing. What do I think is salient to my patient?

290
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:28,990
And we have to make some decisions in real time accordingly.

291
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:36,360
Those goals, what we prioritize when we initiate one intervention over another,

292
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:43,629
how we might get one thing over an alternative plan, trying to think about How often should I see this person?

293
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:44,920
When am I allowed to see this person?

294
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:51,670
There's like a lot of decisions that you're making in real time in a counseling scenario that requires a lot of critical thinking.

295
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:54,670
Some of that comes with clinical acumen from just doing it.

296
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:00,850
But when you first start, you have to be kind of considering a lot of choices all at the same time when you're working with patients.

297
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,780
And finally,

298
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:16,290
ethical values should underpin all the things we do in our in our practice to ensure that we are adhering to the Academy's code of ethics,

299
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:24,630
public health standards and all sorts of other ethical standards that you might personally adhere to.

300
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:31,680
What this might look like in the context of nutrition counseling is that you're providing information that is accurate,

301
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:40,170
that you are upholding the expectations related to confidentiality,

302
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:46,560
that you're respecting the autonomy of your patients, that they have the right to decide for themselves without coercion.

303
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:55,500
We should inhabit the ethical principle of non maleficent's,

304
00:30:55,500 --> 00:31:02,760
which is the first do no harm principle that we should avoid interventions that exploit patients emotionally,

305
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:08,670
financially or medically, and that patients are receiving care that is equitable according to their needs,

306
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:13,500
and that we're doing so with respect for the patient's rights and dignity and differences,

307
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:18,600
that they may choose a different course of action that we might ourselves choose or that we might recommend.

308
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:30,540
Questions. All right.

309
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:34,240
We're at 130 now. I think we're actually probably on track for an hour class session.

310
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,660
So I'll just continue to to go if that seems okay for folks.

311
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:45,580
Okay. So I alluded to Patient-centered care being kind of the orienting framework for this class, right?

312
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:52,520
We're always thinking about what our patients bring to the interactions, what the patients want, what aligns with their needs and their values.

313
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,839
And so that's why I think it's critical to orient you to this concept,

314
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:04,220
to do the introduction to patient centered care today and that everything this class will stem to some extent from this concept.

315
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:09,350
So to start by introducing what we might think of as like old school training,

316
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:14,810
traditional training, training, you might get in a medical model or an acute care setting.

317
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:19,010
And what this looks like is follow the instructions and you will get better.

318
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:23,959
Do as I say, all I'm telling you, you'll be successful.

319
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:27,350
I don't need any feedback or input. Here's the advice.

320
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:32,570
Thoughts on the benefits of an approach like this.

321
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:42,740
Why might this be appealing? Even it's perceived as easy.

322
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:46,479
So over time, it's perceived as easy. It's easy, right? This is really fast.

323
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,870
If I could just say, like, here's the advice. Good. I have.

324
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:58,149
I've got you covered. It could be really straightforward. I guess some people might really want it to be, like, very straightforward.

325
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:02,590
And that's how they take direction. So this may align with some patient preferences.

326
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:06,130
Some patient patients don't actually want to be asked what they think.

327
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:13,810
There are some generational issues or generational differences where clinicians are held in a particular esteem,

328
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:18,340
where the perspective of the clinician is held at a really high regard.

329
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,719
And so having someone tell you this is a thing you need to do is actually what people want,

330
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,240
or at least they think they want what's at that level of life.

331
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:31,270
You don't have to make any kind of personal connections with your patients, which may be challenging for some people.

332
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:37,149
Yeah, low emotional burden. I don't have to know people or like people or learn a thing about them.

333
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:44,500
I could just say, here's the information. So I think from a pride perspective of like I know best and I want to help you, but I know how to do it.

334
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:53,620
Yeah. So this is a great point of, of sort of feeling like I know the right way.

335
00:33:53,620 --> 00:34:00,639
I have done a ton of training. I have worked with this a lot, and therefore I'm the expert in the room.

336
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,420
You can imagine why you would want to feel this way.

337
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:11,350
As a dietitian, it feels nice. Like my two year degree at the University of Michigan was worth the money because I am in fact, the expert.

338
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:17,860
Right. And so there is sort of a pride component of I should be the expert, therefore I am the expert.

339
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:22,780
And so people should just like, let me talk and I will tell them what to do and they'll listen and it will go great.

340
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:27,650
Yeah. You really to like when people are coming to you for help, it's because they don't know what to do.

341
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:37,360
Yeah. So it's like okay sometimes to just like give them like instructions and then, but then also ask like, okay, does this would this work for you?

342
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:40,120
Yes. Yeah. So it's an abstract. So I appreciate that abstracts.

343
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:49,750
But I'll, I'll start with those sort of first point of your comment, which is which is an important one, is that people are seeking help from you.

344
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,249
They've schedule an appointment.

345
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:57,819
It depends on the practice setting and whether or not people are like dying to work with you or coming to your office begrudgingly.

346
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:01,930
You'll see a big range of how much people actually want to talk to you.

347
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:07,510
But if people are coming to see you as the nutrition expert, you would imagine they want your expertise.

348
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:11,319
So you might feel like I should tell them exactly what I think is the best approach.

349
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,580
That's what they're paying me for.

350
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:24,269
So folks have sprinkled in a little bit like this is might why he might do this but what do you think is like the down here I'm looking

351
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:34,980
for our downfall negatives cons what is not so great about this get back like a one size fits all but one size fits all fits no one.

352
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:44,250
Yeah, yeah. You don't get by in as much depth you can tell by you haven't made the connection.

353
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:52,979
People may sort of see your fancy degrees and you may have out of the office that says you're the expert, but there hasn't been that engagement.

354
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:59,820
People haven't had to think through options and decide the one that they feel like is most right for them.

355
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:02,790
People are most moved by that which they think themselves.

356
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,410
And so if you allow people to actually sort of think through options, you're going to get a bit more buy in.

357
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,970
It really emphasizes personal responsibility for your health.

358
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:16,800
Yeah, it suggests that if you have the right information, then you should be able to do it,

359
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:25,770
which is a really problematic perspective when you are someone that has, at the very least, a ton of educational privilege.

360
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:33,059
Right. We all have sort of different amounts of privilege, but in most scenarios we have much more educational privilege.

361
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:36,270
And the patients we work with, not always, but that is often true.

362
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:40,830
And then layer on that a few extra privileges that might relate to socioeconomic status,

363
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:46,130
other privileges related to our racial, ethnic identities, our gender identities.

364
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:53,550
And if you say, well, this is the thing that you should do, trust me, I know a patient might say you have a thousand privileges that I don't have.

365
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:59,790
You have no idea what it would actually look like to do this thing. And in that way, you can invoke a lot of reactance, right?

366
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:09,599
If someone who for whom things are less complicated for gives you a piece of advice, it's easy to be like, that could work for you.

367
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,040
That can't work for me. I don't have the stuff that you have. Yeah.

368
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:19,840
Professor, aren't they? Are things they're not always right.

369
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:28,840
Yeah. Uh, from what we have learned or are told to do so by saying this gives us no room yet for that kind of flexibility.

370
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,759
Yeah, and nutrition.

371
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:42,250
There is very rarely an absolute piece of nutritional advice if you have a food allergy for which you will go into anaphylaxis if you have that food.

372
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:47,139
I would argue there's probably some absolutes there. I definitely don't have this thing.

373
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:51,540
The outcome will be grave. Those are the exception, not the rule in nutrition.

374
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:59,410
And in that case, there are options that may align with people's priorities or values.

375
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:04,330
And so for us to say this is the only approach, it doesn't honor that.

376
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:14,760
And. So this is sort of the issue with traditional trading.

377
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:20,040
It puts us the health care providers in charge. We decide how the patients should manage disease.

378
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,670
We assume that the patient will change this by having the right information that

379
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:28,560
suggests that knowledge is is all that is necessary for a behavior change.

380
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:33,630
And so when a patient doesn't do exactly what we say, we see them as noncompliance, not an accurate.

381
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:39,760
Before I get to say that perhaps we provided the wrong intervention to the wrong person at the wrong time.

382
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:45,280
We put all the blame, all the power goes on us, the blame goes on the patient when we use this type of approach.

383
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:50,220
The patient may feel that health care provider is taking over again.

384
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:56,410
Some people prefer a bit more of an authoritative, facilitative position within interactions in clinical settings,

385
00:38:56,410 --> 00:39:00,160
but in general, people don't want to feel like they are powerless.

386
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:05,290
They don't feel like someone has completely taken over and has provided them no autonomy.

387
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:10,450
And this type of approach has limited effectiveness with patients with a chronic disease.

388
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:16,960
So in traditional training, if we think about like an E.R. setting, so take it out of a nutrition example.

389
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:23,860
If you have like a broken limb and someone says, don't put any weight on this limb for the next 24 hours,

390
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:29,229
you can do that right by letting super hurts, this doctor says don't put any weight on it.

391
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:34,000
You might affect your healing in a really profound way.

392
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:41,500
Just don't do it. You can do it right for 24 hours under these sort of acute type duress situations.

393
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:46,840
Sure, traditional training do this thing or else can have effectiveness.

394
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:52,390
It is totally ineffective for chronic disease, the type of stuff that people need to do forever.

395
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:56,380
This type of stuff falls super flat with chronic disease type management.

396
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:07,480
So again, in the situation with like a severe food allergy because the situation is so specific and the consequence so grave,

397
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:11,620
you can see yourself using a bit more of this sort of traditional model with something like that.

398
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:15,309
And yet because it it becomes a chronic condition and we have to think about how

399
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:20,890
do we help people manage something like this for not just 24 hours for forever?

400
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:32,330
So Patient-centered care is the alternative paradigm to traditional training or the acute care model in patient centered care.

401
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:36,489
Health care providers work with patients to figure out what the patient wants to change.

402
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:40,300
And again, in the context of nutrition, there's usually more than just one thing.

403
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:43,570
It's not like there's only one change, one alternative.

404
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:46,340
You better do that thing or else, right. We've got a lot of choices in nutrition.

405
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:53,140
The patient makes decisions about what to do, the provider avoids making threats or trying to persuade.

406
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:58,180
And the plan fits with the patient's values, needs, priorities, goals and resources.

407
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:03,510
We can think we know the absolute best thing to do, but if it does not align with the patient's values,

408
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,670
needs, priorities, goals and resources, it's not going to work.

409
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:13,390
And then the patient will be successful. We may view the patient as non if you're not compliant and we have helped no one.

410
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:16,899
Our job satisfaction is way bad when we're doing that right.

411
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:20,200
If we're telling people what to do, they don't listen. They feel defeated.

412
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:24,190
That is a recipe for disaster in a counseling setting, right?

413
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:29,170
You want to feel like you've connected, you're working with patients that they feel good and that they can be successful.

414
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:35,680
And so that's why patient centered care, we're really prioritizing what is the patient, what to do, what can they do?

415
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:43,459
So comparison of approaches. I've been using some terms interchangeably.

416
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:49,510
I think about the traditional model, medical model or acute care model, always the same or as provider directed.

417
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:53,030
We're talking, we're telling, we're persuading or threatening.

418
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:57,049
If you don't do this or else type stuff, we'll be doing this.

419
00:41:57,050 --> 00:42:03,440
Class is thinking about patient centered approaches, approaches that are more aligned with chronic disease management,

420
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:09,979
which is essentially what we're working with in the context of nutrition interactions are patient directed.

421
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:14,990
We prioritize listening, asking questions or reflecting rather than just telling.

422
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:21,690
And we're emphasizing personal choice. Questions?

423
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:32,800
Well, I think a letter. And I find that listening is very powerful so that people feel they're not hurt.

424
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:37,570
Most people not at all willing to listen. They are willing to share.

425
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:44,650
Yes. And it takes time to listen. Right. And if you're in a busy clinical setting, you can feel like, oh, I don't time for it.

426
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:49,080
But you don't have time not to do it. Right. Because that connection is so important.

427
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:55,299
If you just stop. And listen and use non-verbal communication.

428
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:59,530
Like I actually want to know you get much higher quality information.

429
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:07,150
And again, the sessions are more high quality and the outcomes are better.

430
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:11,620
And I think the point of most people don't feel like they're listened to.

431
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:18,140
I think this is so particularly true in the context of clinician are actions that are discordant in any way.

432
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:22,000
So if you are again, if someone who inhabits privilege identities,

433
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:26,740
you have to work so much harder to make sure that your patient understands that you're there to listen,

434
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:31,750
that you are setting the signal that there is time, capacity, interest in hearing from your patients.

435
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:40,820
They will spend lots of time thinking about. How the send signals related to our interest in learning.

436
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:45,510
And that again is through verbal and nonverbal communication, through our use of reflections,

437
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:50,820
through our avoidance of particular types of questions which tell us, I don't actually want to know.

438
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:54,840
I want a quick answer always. If to think about the way that we talk, our patients are really signaled.

439
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:56,910
I'm interested in hearing more from you.

440
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:11,780
So again, patient centered care is the practice of caring for patients and their families in ways that are meaningful and valuable for the patient.

441
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:17,490
We are treating patients not only from a clinical perspective, but we're treating the whole patient.

442
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:21,190
We're thinking about who they are emotionally, mentally, spiritually, socially, financially.

443
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:30,500
We need to know about our patients to feel connected to them and to be able to engage in meaningful conversations, meaningful goal settings.

444
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:38,420
A patient's specific health needs and desired health outcomes are the driving force behind all health care decisions and quality measurements.

445
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:42,919
If the metric is not what matters, the patients, you have not served your patient, right?

446
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:50,720
A hospital might say we're trying to reduce our length of stay at the hospital with the patients like I left before I knew what I was doing.

447
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:58,790
Then the hospital's goal and the patient's goal are totally not aligned with a patient's feeling discharged and clueless and not sufficiently treated.

448
00:44:59,450 --> 00:45:02,810
And so that is what patient centered care requires, is that we sort of get out,

449
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:08,510
we all get on the same page is what the clinicians and the systems within which the clinicians work.

450
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:19,160
Those goals align with what the patients need and want. So yeah, you look at all patients situation.

451
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:26,300
Yeah, but what about those people who are hospitalized and you are the dietitian who is in charge of making the meal plans.

452
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:32,900
Do you go around? Do you take your time to talk to them other than you a visiting time?

453
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:33,290
Yeah.

454
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:41,479
So so it really depends again on the specific practice setting, the constraints of the institution, the ability for your patients to communicate.

455
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:45,980
If you're in ICU and you're intubated, patients are not doing that again.

456
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:52,430
I'm always going to default to a an eating disorder example because that's where I worked.

457
00:45:53,840 --> 00:46:03,250
I would sit with a patient who is inpatient and help them build their menus together because that was therapeutic, right?

458
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,299
That was part of what was necessary for that patient.

459
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:11,180
And their recovery is to hear what they were comfortable with, why they were making particular food choices.

460
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:21,110
If you're working on a like I'm thinking like a cardiac rehab floor, you tend to have a lot more patients because the level of acuity is pretty low.

461
00:46:21,830 --> 00:46:25,580
And so you don't have the capacity to talk to 20 patients in a day.

462
00:46:26,330 --> 00:46:33,290
And so you prioritize your time of who is going to be here the longest, who is going to discharge today,

463
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:38,510
who seems to have a few supports and is going to need some extra support.

464
00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:44,180
So there's decisions related to kind of equity concerns and time constraints and expectations of your institution.

465
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:50,120
And when I when I talk about patient centered care, I recognize that some of this stuff takes a lot of time.

466
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:55,010
Some things feel like they're going to take a lot of time listening to your patients,

467
00:46:55,010 --> 00:46:59,959
but you actually they end up being more efficient than you imagined because you get

468
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:04,010
good information and you don't sort of spend time asking unnecessary questions,

469
00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:10,160
but sometimes doing patient centered care right requires a lot of time and you need institutional support to do that.

470
00:47:10,490 --> 00:47:16,550
And there are certainly some institutional settings that are not allowing you to have private conversations with everyone, your patients.

471
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:21,050
Okay. Thank you for the answers to your journal.

472
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:24,750
What you. Do with them.

473
00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:29,440
Yeah. Or just on the hospital chart. I want to understand this because we're going on the Internet.

474
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:33,600
And do people really type everything or do you have a personal journal?

475
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:38,790
Yeah, it's a great question. So let's talk about counseling, documentation at the end of the class.

476
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:49,290
So I'll give an answer now. We'll circle back to at the end and then we can make sure that you sort of understand sort of the range of approaches.

477
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:56,820
To some extent, how you document may be dictated by your institution.

478
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:06,690
So if you work at a michigan medicine, for example, they would not allow you to keep like a shadow file on a patient for HIPA constraints, right?

479
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:14,690
If you have a notebook that has any amount of patient identified information that you left on a bus drive to the grocery store,

480
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:18,030
that would be a profound violation.

481
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:31,470
Patient confidentiality. In times before patient portals, you could put some extraneous information in your notes because your patient never saw it.

482
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:35,129
Right? So you might add that of the essential clinical information,

483
00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:43,320
but some extra stuff that you use to sort of think through kind of what you did, what you talked about, what you didn't talk about.

484
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:51,750
But now that the patient can often see your full clinical notes, some information related to your thought process doesn't feel appropriate for that.

485
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:57,180
So it's really about understanding within your clinical setting what is allowable.

486
00:48:57,870 --> 00:49:01,890
In my practice setting at Boston Children's Hospital, I worked in an outpatient setting.

487
00:49:02,130 --> 00:49:11,070
We could have a a paper file for all of our patients that was kept in a locked filing cabinet in a locked office.

488
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:19,200
So when I worked with a patient, I could jot down notes, I could draw pictures, I could reflect afterwards.

489
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,230
I would keep that in their folder that would be in this locked office.

490
00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:26,879
I would dictate the notes. So what I wanted in the medical record would be sort of a formal record,

491
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:34,410
but I could have that shadow file that's also allowable in the context of a private practice setting,

492
00:49:34,410 --> 00:49:38,880
assuming again, that is key that you're able to keep it locked and not sort of on your person.

493
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:42,870
But again, that's going to differ a lot by practicing. Thank you. Yeah.

494
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:48,960
Especially, I mean, if you're someone who has seen if you're working outpatient full time,

495
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:53,760
some outpatient settings will allow you to have an hour visit with new patients.

496
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:58,320
Some will let you have a 30 minute session with new patients or a 30 minute with follow up patients.

497
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:07,290
If you're seeing 12 people a day times five days a week, it isn't possible to hold the nuance of people's situations in your head,

498
00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:16,769
particularly if you're working in a practice setting that sees like one or two particular diagnoses because patients can blend together, right?

499
00:50:16,770 --> 00:50:22,709
You can be the best active listener, but it's a lot to hold or use, a lot for human brain to hold.

500
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:28,800
So having some sort of shorthand so that you're not starting from square one every single time you see a patients will be useful.

501
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:29,700
But again,

502
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:36,959
it's it's really dependent on the institution's rules related to documentation about what you can jot down and what you have to really work on.

503
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:42,670
Hold it in your head, you. All right.

504
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:46,180
So moving forward on patient centered care, I've already alluded to this,

505
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:52,060
but we are actively collaborating and engaging in our shared decision making with our patients.

506
00:50:54,130 --> 00:50:58,570
And it it requires requires a lot of humility on the part of the clinician to acknowledge that

507
00:50:58,570 --> 00:51:04,450
we don't know what matters most to the patients regarding their ability to get and stay well.

508
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:09,729
We may have the most nutrition information in the room. Sure, that is often the case.

509
00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:12,040
I worked in, as I said, eating disorders.

510
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:18,910
So often I had not the most nutrition information held in my brain in the room, but often we have a lot more expertise in nutrition.

511
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:24,700
But the expertise that the patients bring is the expertise of what matters to them, what's going to work for them?

512
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:33,230
So there's a fair amount of data that supports the use of patient centered care.

513
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:41,640
It's not just that it feels intuitively right is that it is better beneficial on a range of outcomes.

514
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:47,210
Patient and clinician satisfaction. Right. It feels nicer to the patient and the clinician.

515
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:55,790
If you are using a patient centric approach, the relationship between the clinicians and patients is stronger increase,

516
00:51:55,800 --> 00:52:03,060
it decreases and patient's quality of life as seen in institutions that are using patient centered care improvements in clinical outcomes,

517
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:06,750
health care effectiveness, reduce length of stay and decrease health care costs.

518
00:52:07,410 --> 00:52:13,170
So if it feels like it takes too much time and it would just be easier to do this thing in the long run,

519
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:18,270
the outcome is better and it feels better if we are using patient centered approaches.

520
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:26,910
So what does that look like within dietetics specifically?

521
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:30,149
Again, we are establishing a positive relationship.

522
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:35,760
We're using our effective communication skills, which we are going to be practicing like crazy in this class.

523
00:52:36,510 --> 00:52:41,970
We are individual, individualizing and adapting the care. We don't have a preconceived idea of what this patient's going to need.

524
00:52:42,210 --> 00:52:46,440
We are flexible. We are doing what the patient is going to respond to in the moments.

525
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,949
And we are redistributing power to the patients. Right.

526
00:52:49,950 --> 00:52:55,799
We are really taking an active step to think about how can I be less of an authority human in this room?

527
00:52:55,800 --> 00:53:02,070
Right. How can I really meet the patient where they are and redistribute that power that is inherent in a dietician,

528
00:53:02,070 --> 00:53:05,490
patient or clinician client relationship?

529
00:53:06,810 --> 00:53:10,350
I should know I use the word patient and client in this class interchangeably.

530
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:15,860
Often if someone works in a hospital setting, institutionalized setting,

531
00:53:15,870 --> 00:53:23,009
if a patient is the term that's often used within private practice settings or a workplace wellness settings,

532
00:53:23,010 --> 00:53:27,419
you may use the word client with a personal training context.

533
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:30,749
You might use the word client. I think of them no differently.

534
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:36,629
So if you wonder why I'm using one or the other, it's because my my brain decided that one in that exact moment.

535
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:48,980
But I'm thinking about them in the exact same way. So the last topic I want to introduce before we break for today is trauma informed care.

536
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:55,730
Is this a term folks have heard before? Is this a term you have learned about in your time here?

537
00:53:56,670 --> 00:54:02,899
Well, I ask what classes you hear about it. Well, my brain learned it before.

538
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:04,910
I'm not here in school. Public health. Okay.

539
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:10,910
I want to make sure that no one is leaving this dietetics program, not knowing about trauma informed care.

540
00:54:10,970 --> 00:54:17,720
I'm going to introduce it here and we'll circle back to it in some ways as we march through the course.

541
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:29,210
So trauma informed care is an approach that is born in the practice of social work that other health care disciplines are utilizing.

542
00:54:29,930 --> 00:54:35,450
And so I want to make sure that we sort of know what it is and can think about how our patient centered care can be.

543
00:54:35,450 --> 00:54:39,950
More trauma informed. Trauma informed care. I just wanted a variety of patient centered care.

544
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,040
It strives to understand the whole of an individual who is seeking services.

545
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:50,119
So precisely what I just talked about in the context of patient centered care, but as unique about it,

546
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:54,499
is that it specifically recognizes the presence of trauma symptoms and acknowledges

547
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:58,040
the role that trauma may play in an individual's life and health behaviors.

548
00:54:58,370 --> 00:55:04,669
So it's patient centered care with really an eye for experiences of trauma and

549
00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:08,990
preventing unnecessary additional harm and people who have a history of trauma.

550
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:19,250
When you are practicing from a trauma informed lens, you assume an individual is more likely than not to have a history of trauma.

551
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:27,020
Right. So we're not just when a patient has disclosed a history of trauma to you or you see it in their medical record,

552
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:31,970
it's not then that you click into or let me be extra patient center to this person.

553
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:38,390
We are always assuming that there is a risk of practice in a way that could be retraumatizing at all.

554
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:42,920
To find that term and a couple of slides that could be retraumatizing to our patients.

555
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:47,450
So we're always thinking about the practice in a way that would prevent such a harm.

556
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:57,440
When I think about trauma, I think about most classically aces, which you for sure have heard about.

557
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:58,700
Yes, that's close to public health.

558
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:09,220
Classically, we think about ACES as experiences in childhood that are adverse, but obviously adverse experiences aren't only limited to childhood.

559
00:56:09,230 --> 00:56:16,549
There is a particular long lasting consequence for some of these experiences that happen during developmental critical periods.

560
00:56:16,550 --> 00:56:23,120
But any of these experiences can happen generally throughout the life course.

561
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:32,150
So these relate to the mental health of parents, the structure of the family relationship, things like divorce or death of a parent.

562
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:39,680
Cases can include physical or emotional neglect, various types of abuse, violence in the home,

563
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:46,489
homelessness, food insecurity, and then the concept of adverse childhood experiences.

564
00:56:46,490 --> 00:56:50,690
That has also been expanded to include adverse commuting environments where folks

565
00:56:50,690 --> 00:56:56,420
live in areas where they are experiencing adversity related to their community.

566
00:56:56,750 --> 00:57:06,799
And this can relate to poverty, to community discrimination, housing, quality violence, lack of opportunities given those experiences.

567
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:12,200
So these are kind of what we think about as potentially traumatic cases.

568
00:57:13,010 --> 00:57:15,950
This is not inclusive of all types of adversity.

569
00:57:15,950 --> 00:57:22,790
Certainly people face kind of a range of adversities and marginalization because of a whole lot of identities

570
00:57:22,790 --> 00:57:30,200
that are not explicitly captured here and many of those that are sort of baked in to our systems.

571
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:36,079
But we can be thinking about when we think about traumas or aces more generally than maybe it sort of makes sense.

572
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:39,980
Like this is actually the norm, not the exception for many people.

573
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:48,560
Some data on Aces. About a third of children have experienced at least one ace in their lifetime.

574
00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:57,300
40% experienced more than two. And by adulthood, more than 60% of individuals have experienced at least one ace.

575
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:05,720
So, again, this is not a unique scenario. Over half of the patients we're likely to encounter have experience and ace.

576
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:15,559
These experiences are disproportionately distributed in our society, not surprisingly, such that people of lower education or income,

577
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:25,640
those with marginalized, racial, ethnic identities and sexual gender, minority identities are on average more likely to experience experience aces.

578
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:34,290
So you may be having a thought. Your head of I am a dietitian. I am not treating trauma.

579
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:38,820
Correct. Right. We have to and we'll talk about this a lot in the class of what is our scope of practice.

580
00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:45,510
We are not we are not trained to intervene on trauma specifically,

581
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:56,730
but we should be acting in a way that is trauma informed to help provide the best possible care for our patients who have experienced trauma.

582
00:58:57,870 --> 00:59:05,640
And we should be doing this across all encounters that what this looks like. There's a lot of acronyms in in trauma informed care.

583
00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:10,970
One of them is the 4 hours. And so what that what that looks like is real.

584
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:16,850
So what I just covered is realizing we realize that trauma is common.

585
00:59:16,890 --> 00:59:20,270
We have to always have this in the back of your mind. Trauma is not a niche issue.

586
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:23,550
It is a sort of a common experience.

587
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:29,190
So we have to realize that this is something that maybe our patients may be experiencing.

588
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:36,780
We should be recognizing that right now people are talking about changes in their eating habits.

589
00:59:37,350 --> 00:59:47,579
We might be asking questions related to the food insecurity, to houseless ness, to disruption in particular services.

590
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:52,170
We have to sort of have this on a radar screen, not that we're going to treat again the trauma,

591
00:59:52,170 --> 01:00:00,300
but we may be able to adapt our interventions accordingly or connect people to services.

592
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:09,120
And that's what the respond is, is right. If we have somebody who is experiencing profound food insecurity and we provide them

593
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:16,770
a nutrition plan that is filled with extensive foods that require refrigeration,

594
01:00:16,770 --> 01:00:20,820
that sort of spoil easily. So we're like a higher risk for folks who are on a limited budget.

595
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:27,080
We are so unresponsive. Right. The goal is to realize this is what my patient is working with.

596
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:30,659
Here are some resources potentially I can connect them with and here is how I can adapt my

597
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:37,650
nutrition plan so that it is responsive to their lived experience for their current experience.

598
01:00:38,490 --> 01:00:42,540
I'm in the final hour is resist re traumatization.

599
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:53,700
And so what that means is is to be mindful of how our work to potentially be distressing to patients who have a trauma history.

600
01:00:54,150 --> 01:01:01,560
So re trauma re traumatization is any situation or environment that resembles an individual's trauma either literally or symbolically,

601
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:05,910
which then triggers difficult feelings and reactions associated with the original trauma.

602
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:14,010
So if someone's original trauma involves not being seen or heard, if we are not listening,

603
01:01:14,010 --> 01:01:17,010
if we're doing the traditional model that is retraumatizing, right?

604
01:01:17,010 --> 01:01:24,839
They have a history of not feeling seen, not feeling heard. We don't do a whole lot in the way of invasive procedures ourselves as dieticians,

605
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:28,710
but you can imagine that this is something that comes up a lot within medical settings.

606
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:38,370
If we're recommending procedures where people feel like their their bodily autonomy is not being honored,

607
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:44,790
that could be retraumatizing if folks have not been given a have been situations, they're not given a choice.

608
01:01:44,790 --> 01:01:50,730
If we, again, are not sort of I'm asking people what they want or what makes sense for them, that could be retraumatizing.

609
01:01:51,030 --> 01:01:54,030
And again, the use of oppressive language can be retraumatizing.

610
01:01:54,570 --> 01:02:00,990
We're going to talk a lot about language related to weight and bodies.

611
01:02:01,470 --> 01:02:05,850
A lot of our patients, particularly if you're working in a setting, read a lot of highway patients, a lot of them,

612
01:02:05,910 --> 01:02:11,700
a lot of trauma related to weight related teasing, bullying and medical gatekeeping because of their body size.

613
01:02:12,090 --> 01:02:16,350
And so we need to be really careful about the language we use again to avoid this risk

614
01:02:16,350 --> 01:02:21,120
of re traumatization because of weight bias at the hands of health care providers.

615
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:28,390
Questions on this section. All right.

616
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:35,800
I think I have one slide if you guys are starting to burn out. I have picked up on that while this is a lot for a monday.

617
01:02:37,030 --> 01:02:43,089
So in terms of how we practice trauma informed care, a lot of this is going to be baked into what we work on in the next few weeks

618
01:02:43,090 --> 01:02:46,630
in this class that skills that we build within motivational interviewing.

619
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:50,920
But it's not like there's a checklist and not, like I said, the thing I did a trauma informed thing.

620
01:02:51,610 --> 01:02:56,260
It's sort of a way of being at something that requires constant attention, awareness and assessment.

621
01:02:56,680 --> 01:03:01,780
There are these six guiding principles that are recommended and sort of checking in on these things.

622
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:10,990
And this can sort of allow you to evaluate the extent to which your practice in your work setting is trauma informed.

623
01:03:11,770 --> 01:03:21,570
We are evaluating safety the extent to which physical and emotional safety is not guaranteed but is is protected.

624
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:28,090
And this can be related to conversations about confidentiality, about who is going to get what is in information.

625
01:03:28,150 --> 01:03:31,150
It can be related to how we document trustworthy.

626
01:03:31,150 --> 01:03:34,300
Transparency is that we tell people how we're making decisions.

627
01:03:35,030 --> 01:03:41,499
Peer support is an important part of trauma informed care. We are allowing people to tell their stories, share their stories,

628
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:46,870
try to connect people with similar experiences because that component of support is

629
01:03:46,870 --> 01:03:54,640
so critical to two to to thriving in a situation where you have a history of trauma.

630
01:03:55,510 --> 01:04:00,060
Everyone has a role to play in the healing process. So again, we are collaborating with our patients.

631
01:04:00,370 --> 01:04:05,349
We are allowing our patients to use their voices for recognizing their strengths.

632
01:04:05,350 --> 01:04:09,970
We're commenting on their strengths, and we are sort of working that into our interventions.

633
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:14,349
And we are constantly aware of how cultural,

634
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:28,809
historical and gender issues have been part of the trauma and sort of uphold some of the kind of unhealthy narratives related to trauma.

635
01:04:28,810 --> 01:04:37,960
And so we are reflecting on our own implicit biases, stereotypes, kind of challenging inequities in services with our institutions.

636
01:04:38,290 --> 01:04:43,240
And we're going to spend a lot of time on this stuff over the next couple of weeks when we talk about culture, humility and weight bias.

637
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:48,910
But this is something we constantly need to be reflecting on because so many of people's ACS relate to systems,

638
01:04:48,910 --> 01:04:53,710
not just individual acts, but systems that uphold in equitable treatment.

639
01:04:56,740 --> 01:05:05,899
Questions. With trauma informed care.

640
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:14,320
Is it ever necessary or appropriate to recommend additional services outside of the scope of nutrition care?

641
01:05:15,110 --> 01:05:20,180
So is it ever appropriate to recommend additional services?

642
01:05:20,210 --> 01:05:28,300
I would say almost always, yes. There may be some practice settings where that is looked down upon.

643
01:05:28,310 --> 01:05:31,310
I can't think of like I think about like a workplace wellness setting.

644
01:05:31,310 --> 01:05:38,330
If you're like a dietitian is coming to workplace wellness setting, the employer might say like don't be recommending individualized stuff.

645
01:05:38,330 --> 01:05:43,850
Like I might be something like that. But if you are working within a private practice or working with an institution

646
01:05:44,180 --> 01:05:48,919
and you recognize what the patient needs is outside of your scope of practice,

647
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:54,290
I think ethically you absolutely must make those types of recommendations.

648
01:05:55,100 --> 01:05:57,679
When I worked with patients with eating disorders,

649
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:06,560
that was a requirement or an expectation for my private practice patients is that if you don't have a mental health provider and a medical provider,

650
01:06:07,490 --> 01:06:12,140
I can't see you. Right. I don't think I can do this work safely and my job is to keep you safe.

651
01:06:12,860 --> 01:06:16,219
And there's also, obviously, some liability issues that are sort of underlying that.

652
01:06:16,220 --> 01:06:22,790
But if you feel like the work that actually needs to be done and is an impediment to your work is sort of outside your scope of practice.

653
01:06:22,790 --> 01:06:28,609
Absolutely. Recommend. You know, I think classically mental health interventions is what we've been recommending a lot,

654
01:06:28,610 --> 01:06:33,620
but also kind of nutrition programs or other types of things.

655
01:06:33,620 --> 01:06:40,449
Absolutely. We would be recommending them. And the more you work in a particular area and the eating disorder example,

656
01:06:40,450 --> 01:06:47,350
I might have really specific recommendations that I think you need a counselor who specializes in DVT or in family based treatment.

657
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:51,310
So if you're working in the area and you have seen what has worked for patients,

658
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:55,480
that is absolutely appropriate to be recommending specific types of services.

659
01:06:56,410 --> 01:07:05,410
Professor, when doing the counseling that you learned that there was something going on in the family and a lot of time in my experience,

660
01:07:05,410 --> 01:07:08,830
that results in eating disorder.

661
01:07:08,860 --> 01:07:13,120
Yeah. So do you document what they disclose to like?

662
01:07:13,330 --> 01:07:18,159
It could be a coach, could be a father. It could be a brother. Do, do, do do.

663
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:21,610
Write it down in your two days. Yeah. So.

664
01:07:25,170 --> 01:07:31,980
So I think there's like a lot of examples of things that people just close to you, if it's something.

665
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:38,320
I think like when I would or when I would it again,

666
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:44,140
if it's you work with a young person and they can access their medical records or their parents can access their medical records,

667
01:07:44,530 --> 01:07:47,649
then I would be really careful about what I document.

668
01:07:47,650 --> 01:07:57,490
So for example, I work with a young person who has bulimia nervosa, for example, and they we've talked about confidentiality.

669
01:07:57,490 --> 01:08:02,260
Where are the bounds of my confidentiality that certain things can be kept private, other things.

670
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:07,090
If I'm worried about your health and safety, here's who I would tell and here's why.

671
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:13,420
If there if I learned something in a clinical visit that falls within the bounds of confidentiality,

672
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:20,050
something I promised I didn't need to share because it doesn't actually affect specific health and safety concerns.

673
01:08:20,290 --> 01:08:25,809
I probably wouldn't put it in the medical record because it could get back to the the parents,

674
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:30,040
and that would be a breach of confidentiality based on the agreement I made with that patient.

675
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:37,179
Certainly, if I'm working with someone who is telling me that this teacher did this thing or this coach did this thing,

676
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:43,330
if I'm a mandated reporter and it's related to inappropriate actions I would documented, I would report it.

677
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:47,530
So it's somewhere in between, either I absolutely wouldn't or definitely would.

678
01:08:47,530 --> 01:08:58,839
It depends on sort of the nature of the disclosure and how important it is to me that this is because a medical record becomes a legal document.

679
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:11,499
And so if there's information that feels critical to the patient's care or relates to something that I don't know,

680
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:18,940
that could sort of affect a sort of a prosecution of that type of thing, then perhaps I might document it, but it's like so individualized.

681
01:09:19,750 --> 01:09:25,059
Just say, like this person tease me, that person tease me. If it doesn't really feel relevant, I might not include it.

682
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:33,640
But if it's going to be important to the doctor, the therapist that I would. Well, the question is that when you have a young client, isn't that true,

683
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:40,420
that if they're under 17 or 18, someone else had to be there when you do consultations?

684
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:50,890
So it depends on the state and it depends on the procedure that's going to be done at a visit.

685
01:09:53,110 --> 01:09:59,649
So for a primary care visit with a medical doctor, if there's going to be a particular intervention,

686
01:09:59,650 --> 01:10:04,100
parents need to agree to it like a vaccine is going to be administered, a pelvic exam is going to be administered up here.

687
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:07,330
It have to agree it with nutrition counseling.

688
01:10:08,020 --> 01:10:14,770
That may not be true. Again, I practice mostly in the state of Massachusetts and often patients would be with their

689
01:10:14,770 --> 01:10:19,390
parents in the weight room because they were driven to appointments with a parent, never had to physically come into the office.

690
01:10:19,690 --> 01:10:24,040
So they were there if they needed consent but didn't actually have to participate in the counseling setting.

691
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:31,480
Thank you. So but the parents can see our conversation or my reporting or like it depends on your institution.

692
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:32,700
Okay. Right.

693
01:10:32,740 --> 01:10:39,760
So some institutions and it's getting more and more tricky with innovations within patient portals and a lot of electronic medical records.

694
01:10:40,090 --> 01:10:42,670
Often if you work in an adolescent clinic, for example,

695
01:10:42,970 --> 01:10:49,210
your electronic notes will be structured a way of this is what's going to go into the patient portal.

696
01:10:49,540 --> 01:10:53,740
Here is a field for confidential information that will never show up in the patient portal.

697
01:10:55,630 --> 01:10:58,810
And so they're they're sort of innovative in that way to recognize,

698
01:10:58,810 --> 01:11:06,459
like sometimes there's information with adolescent surge testing and pregnancy testing and and sort of stuff that we just don't want parents to know,

699
01:11:06,460 --> 01:11:11,890
but we need to document that. We did it in a context of adolescent care, not nutrition, specifically about adolescent care,

700
01:11:12,910 --> 01:11:16,360
but places that have really outdated electronic medical records.

701
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:20,260
You have one field, you put your stuff in and people can or cannot see it.

702
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:24,819
And so, again, it's it's really institutional institution dependent.

703
01:11:24,820 --> 01:11:30,820
And if you think that there is a risk of a breach of confidentiality of over disclosing to a parents that I would under document.

704
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:38,470
Thank you. But this is where technology just makes our job so much harder.

705
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:42,220
Right. But imagine technology would make charting easier.

706
01:11:42,610 --> 01:11:51,719
But when you work in sensitive areas. You have to think about what numbers will show up where this also becomes an issue with weights, right?

707
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:57,629
So a lot of patients need blinded weights for a variety of reasons that all fall under the space.

708
01:11:57,630 --> 01:12:01,260
Every traumatization folks don't want to see their numbers.

709
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:04,469
It is not compatible with their health and recovery to see what's happening with their weight.

710
01:12:04,470 --> 01:12:08,220
And we can use unblinded or blinded weights and medical visits.

711
01:12:08,220 --> 01:12:14,459
We cannot talk about it. But then if someone goes and accesses their medical record and it's there or if it's printed on the after visit.

712
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:23,310
Summary We have done the the worst possible thing is that we have not presented that information in an environment that's therapeutic.

713
01:12:23,310 --> 01:12:30,270
We've given them the information at a time where they're just out the door at the piece of paper and no one there to really process it with.

714
01:12:30,660 --> 01:12:39,210
And so we have to think about sort of the paper trail and electronic trail of all of our interactions and the risk there of re traumatization.

715
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:47,420
All right. So you are coming back here in two weeks. Lots of stuff to do between now and then.

716
01:12:48,230 --> 01:12:55,220
So the first thing is to record your intro video, which I already mentioned, but let me pull it up here.

717
01:12:56,540 --> 01:13:03,500
Recorded video. It can be under it should be under 5 minutes. I would say those folks there under a minute and 30 seconds.

718
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:07,250
But if you do a lot of clinical or counseling experience, it might be longer.

719
01:13:07,580 --> 01:13:13,820
What I would like you to do is share your name. If you have a preferred nickname that you always want me to call you, just tell me what that is.

720
01:13:14,180 --> 01:13:17,150
If you're comfortable sharing your pronouns, please add those to your videos.

721
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:21,530
Tell me what, if any, experience you have with nutrition, education and or counseling?

722
01:13:22,670 --> 01:13:27,320
What topic you were looking forward to learning about and something interesting about yourself.

723
01:13:27,890 --> 01:13:34,790
I told people are taking my weight by his class at this feels a little bit like first day of camp but I used to work at a camp and so I can't help it.

724
01:13:35,210 --> 01:13:39,110
So give me an interesting fact about yourself. It does actually help me remember you in a different way.

725
01:13:39,350 --> 01:13:42,650
If you're taking two classes means this semester I want to see different facts.

726
01:13:43,130 --> 01:13:47,180
You can be interesting in more than one domain. So record this video.

727
01:13:47,180 --> 01:13:50,930
You can record on your phone if you can use that for technology people. But phone is fine.

728
01:13:52,610 --> 01:14:00,350
It can be a real pedantic talk. I don't actually care. But after you recorded, put it on the discussion board.

729
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:03,469
So this assignment is linked to discussion.

730
01:14:03,470 --> 01:14:08,090
It's a great discussion. Again, if you do it and you respond to the problems, I will give you the three points.

731
01:14:08,450 --> 01:14:13,489
Please embed your video. Don't attach your video if you have to.

732
01:14:13,490 --> 01:14:17,899
If you attach your video again, focus away bias. I'm sorry you've heard this twice, but if you attach it,

733
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:24,170
it means anyone that watches it has to download your video to their computer and so your face will live on their computer in perpetuity.

734
01:14:24,170 --> 01:14:29,450
Don't do that to anyone's desktops or laptops, so please embed it so we can just click it,

735
01:14:29,450 --> 01:14:33,200
watch it, and it doesn't live in our computers for forever in order to do that.

736
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:38,480
This is the the way that that gets done. If you have any issues embedded in the video, just let me know.

737
01:14:39,830 --> 01:14:45,290
Questions on the intro video. I'd like you to do that before.

738
01:14:46,940 --> 01:14:51,889
Our next class session. I put a due date of 120 because it gives me the weekend to sort of catch up

739
01:14:51,890 --> 01:14:55,640
and make sure I watch all the videos if you don't get to the till the 23rd.

740
01:14:55,970 --> 01:14:59,660
This is not sort of a catastrophically firm deadline.

741
01:14:59,660 --> 01:15:02,720
There are times well, for deadlines when I need done. This is not one of those times.

742
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:08,680
In preparation for the next class, there are two readings and one video.

743
01:15:08,780 --> 01:15:14,270
Again, this is the time of the class where there's more out of class prep and less time in class.

744
01:15:14,750 --> 01:15:20,120
So you have these two readings related to nutrition intervention and health literacy.

745
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:26,900
And then one video, which is about writing patient centered educational materials in plain language with Rudy Volk,

746
01:15:27,290 --> 01:15:31,819
where he's a guest lecturer in this class every year.

747
01:15:31,820 --> 01:15:37,610
And then she made the horrible decision to retire. And so this is the first year that she is not going to be here live.

748
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:49,760
But I recorded her session a year ago, literally today, because she is an expert in in plain language and concepts of health literacy.

749
01:15:50,510 --> 01:15:56,209
And before she retired, she was the person at Michigan Medicine who approved educational materials.

750
01:15:56,210 --> 01:16:01,760
So if you've ever worked at a job where you had to draft education materials and get them torn apart by someone at Michigan Medicine,

751
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:07,820
she was the person that did that. So she's is an expert in how to make educational materials good.

752
01:16:07,850 --> 01:16:11,389
And by good, I don't mean pretty and flowery and fun to look at.

753
01:16:11,390 --> 01:16:14,570
I mean good meaning that patients understand what to do when they pick them up.

754
01:16:15,710 --> 01:16:22,550
So watch the video. There's a couple of times where the sound is like some percent funky because I'm walking around passing out papers.

755
01:16:22,550 --> 01:16:27,890
So you hear me passing out papers? And she's a couple clips where there's like a little bit of a sound delay.

756
01:16:27,890 --> 01:16:31,340
But I watched it and it's like not it's still much better than I would do.

757
01:16:31,340 --> 01:16:34,549
So I'm going to have you watch that in advance of next session.

758
01:16:34,550 --> 01:16:37,550
And that's a pretty long video.

759
01:16:37,550 --> 01:16:43,970
I think it's like an hour and a half. So just make sure you budget that in your time over the next two weeks.

760
01:16:44,390 --> 01:16:50,690
So a video, two readings are intro video, Rudi's recorded lecture and two readings.

761
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:54,590
And then the final task is to take this mini quiz.

762
01:16:54,590 --> 01:16:57,700
And as I mentioned, this is designed to be straightforward.

763
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:04,309
There are four questions that come pretty very directly from those two readings.

764
01:17:04,310 --> 01:17:09,230
So if you've read those readings that have them open on your computer, you should be just fine on those four questions.

765
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:22,640
That quiz will be released today at four. So anytime between today at 4:00 and 1:00 on the 23rd, at the start of next class, you can do the quiz.

766
01:17:23,660 --> 01:17:27,139
It is a timed quiz, meaning that you have 30 minutes to finish.

767
01:17:27,140 --> 01:17:34,100
Four questions. That is, most folks don't need or want that full amount of time.

768
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:39,950
But you do have that amount of time. Once you open the quiz, you'll see all four questions and the timer starts.

769
01:17:39,950 --> 01:17:46,849
You can't click out and come back in. So make sure you have 30 minutes to take the quiz in the event that you want

770
01:17:46,850 --> 01:17:54,350
the full time if you have accommodations for extra time on tests and quizzes,

771
01:17:54,350 --> 01:17:59,479
I have added that within campus, so that should show that you have an extra 15 minutes.

772
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:06,050
If you have that accommodation and don't see that reflected in your canvas stuff, let me know.

773
01:18:06,380 --> 01:18:09,470
But just know that that's something that I can do behind the scenes.

774
01:18:09,470 --> 01:18:14,860
You should have 45 minutes if that is an accommodation that you have. Yeah.

775
01:18:15,660 --> 01:18:29,220
Multiple choice, straight answer. But to true and false for this one and two multiple choice for auto grade, you should be.

776
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:33,660
You can tell me next time if they're not straightforward. But this is the vision is to be straightforward.

777
01:18:36,190 --> 01:18:38,139
Question setting this up, it's sort of a lot like I said,

778
01:18:38,140 --> 01:18:44,830
this is the part of the class where there's just like a lot of stuff to do outside but should all be hopefully pretty clear within campus.

779
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:54,160
If you look at the session for for next time, the two readings, the video, the quiz, and then again the intro video.

780
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:58,390
I have that under today's session because let's do a little bit of advance of the next class.

781
01:19:02,890 --> 01:19:06,790
I did mention this is auto recording.

782
01:19:07,060 --> 01:19:13,900
I think this is actually going to auto record until for no matter what because I feel like pre forever set it up.

783
01:19:13,900 --> 01:19:18,610
So if you stay in this room after I leave and are chatting, it is recorded.

784
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:26,649
If you have questions for me during the break, over the course of the semester work, I could write your class.

785
01:19:26,650 --> 01:19:33,910
You wanted to like rush up real quick and ask me. Just know that they're going to be recorded and I will probably just flag say, shall we step away?

786
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:41,880
But just sort of know that this is from 1 to 4. The owl is watching and listening is going to be keeping.

787
01:19:41,890 --> 01:19:45,430
These are valuable collect name tags anyway. Oh, you're upset after you turned it around.

788
01:19:45,430 --> 01:19:48,580
It's like, yeah, that hot dog and not upside down.

789
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:55,359
I will collect that each time. It is a way just to make sure you guys are here and I don't need to, like, hunt you down and worry about you.

790
01:19:55,360 --> 01:20:09,040
So I'm there. I will come and get them. And I think that's cool and too easy to look past children on this issue.

791
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:18,070
And I just I'm like, oh, oh, really?

792
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:36,760
Wow. What was I thinking? Yeah, I think you're so lucky that you're gonna tell us right now, and it just doesn't exist.

793
01:20:37,710 --> 01:20:49,670
I always say, Oh, my friend, I can't figure it out.

794
01:20:49,670 --> 01:21:00,780
And I know, well, I want to get somewhere like, you know what it's like.

795
01:21:00,950 --> 01:21:11,380
Oh, just like that. Yeah, I guess I want to get real out of one paragraph like that.

796
01:21:12,730 --> 01:21:17,570
Yeah. Why not just try it?

797
01:21:18,310 --> 01:21:24,370
I mean, there's, you know, my girl tonight is here.

798
01:21:25,470 --> 01:21:46,570
You know what? I want to find something that is, you know, like and then I'm going to download it and I have actually just entered that script.

799
01:21:46,890 --> 01:21:57,600
Yeah, that's, that's, that's how that, you know, you just do not have patience, you know, that's what I'm going to take.

800
01:21:57,730 --> 01:22:01,970
So unless someone comes at you, I submitted for 2 hours.

801
01:22:02,110 --> 01:22:05,679
I didn't hear anything like that. Yeah.

802
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:22,340
I really don't consider, you know, I don't like I mean yet I would be about it that way that I just I have to have this pain for sure,

803
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:26,630
because that's because I don't know.

804
01:22:27,020 --> 01:22:31,450
I think that's actually a good average.

805
01:22:31,450 --> 01:22:45,159
So I can tell you from I mean that's a very to hot dog was really clever using hot dogs I think I just need a bit like this one I can't succumb.

806
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:55,569
So I learned early years of the Jewish community that you call the pigs they can't it okay when I say that you remember.

807
01:22:55,570 --> 01:22:58,930
Yeah. Like I told you, she. Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

808
01:22:59,260 --> 01:23:05,290
Do something. Shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo.

809
01:23:05,290 --> 01:23:10,300
They called to say this is going to be on the owl video.

810
01:23:11,740 --> 01:23:17,770
Oh, no, it's a class video. I mean, I don't think anyone is going to stay on and watch this video until 4:00.

811
01:23:20,350 --> 01:23:26,490
Why do you think you're talking to the press is over? Yeah, I guess over webcast, you're like, I'm just going to keep listening.

812
01:23:26,510 --> 01:23:31,180
Let's see what comes up tonight.

813
01:23:31,180 --> 01:23:35,290
About only the other part for me, I guess. Listening recorded this morning.

814
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:40,720
Class is over. So you they also have a license to the website?

815
01:23:42,010 --> 01:23:46,719
Yes, several things get things. I do. I'm glad I did that because I was like, oh, I know what I maybe didn't.

816
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:50,049
I think, great. Yeah. I think that should be pretty straightforward practically.

817
01:23:50,050 --> 01:24:01,750
Society member if I can be, if it's in the morning, you can meet, but because you do the work at night, I know that this semester Wednesdays I can't.

818
01:24:04,190 --> 01:24:09,650
Because I work from 7 to 1 and then I have therapy from 2 to 3.

819
01:24:10,070 --> 01:24:13,940
So, I mean, unless after that and then on Mondays, I work from 7 to 12.

820
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:17,720
Okay. What is this work for you? Oh, got it.

821
01:24:18,860 --> 01:24:22,030
I finished.

822
01:24:22,680 --> 01:24:30,110
So, like, if we if we were to do before Sue's class on Tuesdays, maybe if that works with her.

823
01:24:30,830 --> 01:24:36,020
So Liz had mentioned that she we were waiting a little bit longer to like let everybody catch up

824
01:24:36,020 --> 01:24:42,560
on emails from break so you can probably go into it for you because I just don't I don't know,

825
01:24:42,860 --> 01:24:50,360
I really like I know it's not a huge inconvenience, but like it is just I don't feel motivated to do anything.

826
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:57,620
I think it's fair because it takes twice as much time and effort to do literally anything.

827
01:24:57,860 --> 01:25:01,540
And this is the most irritating thing on the planet. I'd be timid.

828
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:05,780
Yeah. I can't come close. I literally did not leave my house.

829
01:25:05,780 --> 01:25:09,350
Like this morning was the first time I left my house. It's Friday. I love that for you.

830
01:25:09,980 --> 01:25:13,380
I just exhausted that.

831
01:25:13,550 --> 01:25:17,300
And it took me. It took me over an hour to hang up all of my clothes.

832
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:25,130
From my dream, which was something of that dream. It was done. Look, I feel like I am getting.

833
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:30,840
I could do more things. Now know that this is a more secured past.

834
01:25:31,130 --> 01:25:40,560
Yeah, my wrist isn't like flopping all over the place, but I finish the rough draft of the constitution.

835
01:25:40,620 --> 01:25:46,350
Okay. For it. And then I made a document for a position statement.

836
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:49,770
However, I don't know what else to commit, so it's currently blank.

837
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:56,370
It says we as inclusive subcommittee believe that.

838
01:25:57,550 --> 01:26:05,540
Or hold it below to be true or something. And I got an email back from the Spectrum Center today.

839
01:26:05,630 --> 01:26:10,930
So we're actually doing lots of things. Yeah, I still have the email from the guy slightly.

840
01:26:10,940 --> 01:26:16,300
Yeah, we used to set up a meeting so we really need to meet, so.

841
01:26:16,310 --> 01:26:20,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I will fill it out.

842
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:24,920
Okay. Can you do it in the next hour? Yeah.

843
01:26:26,130 --> 01:26:29,780
I would do it right now if we don't do it right now. I'm not going to.

844
01:26:29,970 --> 01:26:32,950
Did you send an e-mail? Was it just it.

845
01:26:33,660 --> 01:26:42,030
And then I would challenge Liz and figure something out and hopefully we can meet this week and the end this nonsense because I need

846
01:26:42,550 --> 01:26:47,430
if either of you has free time and you want to go in and read the Constitution and make sure that that [INAUDIBLE] makes sense.

847
01:26:47,820 --> 01:26:52,580
I'm like, sorry. That's okay.

848
01:26:53,640 --> 01:27:01,110
We know you're there. We know you're being creepy. So I really hope it out.

849
01:27:01,530 --> 01:27:05,400
Yeah, I really hope someone does, just like I. My God, go watch that.

850
01:27:05,730 --> 01:27:08,879
Isn't it? So here. We should go out in the hallway, though.

851
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:13,210
She's in Eden City, girl. I you're hearing.

852
01:27:13,470 --> 01:27:17,520
So what's the falling out? The middle class? Stupid earrings. They're like, I'm going to cheat.

853
01:27:18,690 --> 01:27:30,170
I was, like, trying not to be super organized. I was like, I have to do that, but that's about me.

854
01:27:33,890 --> 01:27:34,250
That's.
