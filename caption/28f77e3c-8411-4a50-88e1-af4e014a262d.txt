1
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:06,300
Oh, no. Right.

2
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:12,910
All right. Welcome, everybody. Just a couple of announcements here.

3
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:19,710
So here we are today on the 15th. Reminder your HHC critiques are due on Thursday.

4
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:30,120
I started the assignment as a file upload open until 11:59 p.m. on Thursday, so make sure to keep that in.

5
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:35,810
And well, I believe the quiz scores have been posted for years of access links.

6
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,070
Okay. We can talk about that more on Thursday if you'd like.

7
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:48,600
But today we do have a guest lecturer who you already know because he talked once in this class already.

8
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:54,059
So I wanted to bring in Professor Lavarch again because he is an expert in air pollution.

9
00:00:54,060 --> 00:01:01,650
So he talked with you earlier in the semester about regulations and guidelines on the environmental side,

10
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:05,040
as puts occupational now is going to get into a little bit more of the technical detail about

11
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:11,430
how you go about estimating and measuring exposure to some of the chemicals in ambient air.

12
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:17,490
So as he goes through, may try and think about the similarities and differences between some of these

13
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:21,870
approaches and what we talked about in the occupational setting as far as,

14
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:30,299
you know, equipment and methods and things like that. So I have to go give a presentation at the school faculty meeting.

15
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,600
So I'm going to leave a little early. But you're in good hands here.

16
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:38,490
So, Professor, to lunch. Thank you so much, Dr. Meeker.

17
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:47,970
So, yeah, it's great to be back with you all today. And as John mentioned, we'll talk with a focus on, you know, chemicals in the air,

18
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:54,060
but a little bit of a contrast rate to what maybe you've already been talking about a bit within workplace settings.

19
00:01:54,120 --> 00:02:01,350
This is aimed a bit more at, you know, out in our kind of everyday life in more community or environmental settings.

20
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:10,470
And, you know, in terms of like the order will, we'll get to it, you know, how do we actually do due monitoring for this?

21
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:17,670
So we'll look at kind of actually brought in some things and did some show and tell my bad but I have a few few photos that we'll look at.

22
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:25,170
But I want to be able to hit on some some key things that that you don't have to deal with.

23
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:30,810
For the most part, within a workplace, they are things like meteorology and topography.

24
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,239
Then they're being playing a huge role in kind of the environmental intensity or the

25
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:42,000
magnitude of pollution that can actually form and that we can potentially be exposed to.

26
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,999
And then talk about as an overview.

27
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:56,010
You know, here, start with if you asked me what are the what are the biggest air pollution problems that we face globally?

28
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:01,020
This is the list I would give you urban smog, which is actually where we're going to focus today.

29
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:06,720
These two pollutants pretty much drive that global burden of disease,

30
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:13,290
morbidity and mortality from exposure to pollution with actually PPM being the biggest one.

31
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,720
Atmospheric deposition, right.

32
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:24,479
So not so much from an inhalation perspective, but things like mercury and persistent organic pollutants can get into our ecosystems.

33
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:33,420
Perhaps the bioaccumulation, maybe we're exposed to other drugs like ingestion, but ultimately it originates as an air pollution problem.

34
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,860
Stratospheric ozone, right. This is the important distinction.

35
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:44,700
We're talking about ozone in urban smog that references in the troposphere the lowest level of the atmosphere,

36
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,239
like down near the surface of the earth where we are. We don't want it there.

37
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:54,569
We don't want to be exposed to it. We do actually want ozone to exist in the next layer up, in the atmosphere,

38
00:03:54,570 --> 00:04:07,260
in the stratosphere there provides protection to us by filtering out UV rays that would otherwise be harmful to us and our environment.

39
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:12,690
Climate change is an easy one. Again, kind of from a origination perspective.

40
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:20,519
Much of it is an air pollution problem in the form of greenhouse gas emissions, and then we won't really touch on it at all.

41
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:26,759
Today, again, mostly focusing on urban smog and outdoor pollution, but indoor air pollution.

42
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:32,010
I know you talk again a lot in this class, a lot about, you know, within a workplace, much of it being indoor.

43
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:41,520
But when you just shift gears slightly too household, huge issue across the globe, especially in low and middle income countries, right.

44
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:46,680
Where fossil fuels are used for cooking and heating inside.

45
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:51,140
All right. So, yeah, I already kind of referenced this one.

46
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:56,040
Is is that global burden of disease slide where we have our ambient particulate matter

47
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,710
or PPM not very down the part on the list right here it's like blood pressure.

48
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:02,960
Are here smoking. This is deaths per year.

49
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:10,800
So we're looking at, you know, four ish million premature deaths per year from exposure to ambient particulate matter.

50
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:15,390
We're not talking about it today, but here is that. Household air pollution is also a big one.

51
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:22,230
Ozone on a relative scale ends up being much, much smaller percentage in terms of deaths.

52
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:30,060
It ranks a little bit higher in terms of morbidity, you know, asthma attacks and things like that.

53
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:36,150
If you look at E.R. visits and whatnot, but these would be the two big ones, PPM and ozone.

54
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,600
They generally are the issues in urban areas.

55
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,040
And that's kind of what we'll focus on both of them. Actually, that was a point I wanted to make.

56
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:49,470
Most of the attribution here, like if we're looking at particulate matter,

57
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:57,060
is due to mortality attributed to respiratory disease or cardiovascular disease.

58
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,950
Very well studied.

59
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:09,960
I'm going to say thousands of publications studies associating exposure to PPM with these types of outcomes within respiratory and cardiovascular.

60
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,639
We continue to learn with each passing day, month,

61
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:23,190
year about all of the other types of outcomes that the air pollution and particulate matter are tied to a pall.

62
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:27,480
These are just some random ones, really. Headlines over the last year or so.

63
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:37,800
Air Pollution Pollution linked to permanent vision loss. In this particular study, this was kind of at the height of of the COVID pandemic.

64
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:47,219
And this particular article was focused in Asia and Vietnam and talking about air pollution being a bigger threat and COVID 19.

65
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:51,000
But that's actually a nice one that I like to to put into perspective.

66
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:57,870
If you go back to this, uh, you know, if we say and again, there's some uncertainty around this number,

67
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:03,030
but the estimate is about 4 million premature deaths per year from ambient PM.

68
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:09,300
Anybody have like a rough running total of deaths attributed to COVID so far?

69
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:14,690
And or if you want to try to translate that into an annual rate.

70
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:27,100
I think last I heard, it's it's, you know, the pandemic goes on and we kind of shift into like more normal activity is less of a headline.

71
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:33,969
I'm pretty sure we cleared 6 million, but this is at about a two and a half year time period.

72
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:40,720
Right. So, you know, certainly with all due attention, it's really important, you know,

73
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:47,559
because the COVID 19 pandemic has been terrible, lots of loss of life and folks have responded.

74
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,650
I think there's an answer according to Google at 6.6 million.

75
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:56,380
6.6 million. Okay. So then the divide that by about two and a half years to annualize it.

76
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:05,320
Yeah, it's been terrible. We've lost a lot of lives. But if you just from a reference point, if we compare it to that rate of death,

77
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:10,690
premature death due to exposure to PM alone, just particulate matter in the air, it's greater.

78
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:16,420
Right, and it's not just been in the last two and a half years, we have had four easily 50 years,

79
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,830
uh, basically an air pollution pandemic or particulate matter.

80
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,440
And so whatever, just to give it a little bit of context,

81
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:29,620
we all hear about big numbers and big numbers are big, but how do they compare and how do they relate?

82
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:35,799
Uh, skip over that one. Uh, this one, yeah.

83
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,670
Air pollution linked to increased mental health outpatient visits.

84
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:47,860
Uh, so as much as we feel kind of confident as a, as a research community about the hazards,

85
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:55,300
the risks and the adverse impact on health from air pollution, we acknowledge there's still a lot that we don't understand.

86
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:03,520
Right? Even like mechanistically what's going on, what's what's related to these new and kind of emerging outcomes.

87
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,840
And then a message that I want to just lay out there right from the bat.

88
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:13,330
And this is sort of straddling the kind of the policy line of things.

89
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:19,240
But just to kind of keep in the context is, you know, we tend to think of air pollution.

90
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,370
And in this lecture, I'll do it. I'll point that fossil fuel. FRAKER There is a guy with the punch line.

91
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:27,550
Fossil fuels are like the cause of like all of these air pollution problems.

92
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,170
You already knew that. And all the bad things, right?

93
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:39,219
Those evil power plants that burn coal. Right. And all the waste incinerators that burn trash and, you know,

94
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:49,900
those diesel trucks that are driving around blowing soot out the exhaust pipes, the pollution is worse, generally speaking, in urban areas.

95
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:58,450
And that's bad because that's where most people live, right? So kind of a bad overly high pollution with lots of people there to be readily exposed.

96
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:07,640
Not not a good recipe, but the reason that pollution is there in the first place is because of us, right?

97
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:11,920
I mean, as a society, it's our demand for energy, electricity, right.

98
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:17,530
My phone going to recharge or better be an outlet nearby for transportation, right.

99
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:22,450
I mean, you know, cars, trucks, so forth, the waste that we accumulate.

100
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:25,989
And then that has to go somewhere and something needs to be done with it.

101
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:33,700
So are just a little bit of context. I will come across and point fingers at these evil industries,

102
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:40,720
but I just want you to know that I think you recognize that we're, you know, individually kind of contributors to the ugliness.

103
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:49,150
All right. So we're focusing on two, uh, ozone, which is straight up economical.

104
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:56,530
Oh three no questions about it. Not completely exists as a gas, uh, in the atmosphere.

105
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:07,900
Interestingly, uh, no ozone comes out of any of these things, doesn't come out of an automobile tailpipe, it doesn't come out of a smokestack.

106
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:16,120
It's actually formed in the atmosphere, uh, through chemical reactions, actually photochemical reactions,

107
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:25,150
uh, due to sunlight, uh, from gases that are emitted as precursor emissions.

108
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:37,840
So nitrogen oxides and a whole suite of volatile organic compounds that react in the presence of sunlight to then form ozone in the atmosphere.

109
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,919
So for that reason,

110
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:46,660
it's considered a secondary pollutant in the atmosphere versus a primary pollutant that would actually be admitted directly from a tailpipe.

111
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:55,450
Over here on this side, particulate or particulate matter, I think I might have even touched on this last time I visited.

112
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:59,889
Uh, we could consider it a physical hazard, right?

113
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:04,000
It's a particle. We inhale it. It physically interacts with our.

114
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,480
With our lung, our airways. Uh, but we can also consider it a chemical hazard as well.

115
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:16,120
Uh, because certainly in last week in class. So again, it came up with no kidding.

116
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:19,839
Okay, cool. Yeah. It's made up of something. Right.

117
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:26,180
And we do know enough about it that in many cases it's made up of stuff that we know to be toxic or harmful, you know,

118
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:33,190
on its own individual metals and different organic and so forth that are part of the composition of the particulate.

119
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:41,380
And then in terms of the way that I just characterized ozone as a secondary pollutant, PPM is a little bit of a hybrid.

120
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:48,850
It is emitted directly from smokestacks, does come out of tailpipes, especially diesel combustion,

121
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:59,499
but it can also be formed secondarily in the atmosphere again through these reactions kind of down downwind from other precursor gas emissions.

122
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:04,480
And we'll eventually step through each of these and just a little bit more detail.

123
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:13,719
But before we do that, I do want to talk a little bit about the combination of meteorology and topography and hope

124
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,860
that you have a little bit of an appreciation for the important role that it can play.

125
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:29,580
Right? So when we talk about, uh, exposure, we're worried about, uh, magnitude rate, we're worried about duration so that there's factors that can,

126
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:38,320
that can influence this and the resulting concentrations of pollution in the atmosphere with constant emissions.

127
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,060
We're not changing the emissions. People are commuting every day and factories are running every day.

128
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,600
Electricity is being produced every day. No change in emissions.

129
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:54,730
But we can have drastic changes in the concentration of air pollution just from meteorology from one day to the next.

130
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,860
All right, so some important terms here and we won't go into a whole lot of detail,

131
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:02,860
but I just want to make sure that conceptually you have an appreciation for this.

132
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:12,159
Who's heard of a temperature inversion, uh, being used to describe something related to the outdoor air if,

133
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:17,350
you know, anybody care to try to explain it? No.

134
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:23,800
Okay. Totally fair. Totally fair. Yeah, it's a little bit of a strange concept.

135
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:27,400
Uh, so let's see some. Some examples.

136
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:30,670
Uh, it's almost the holidays. Maybe some of you will be fine.

137
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:37,450
I've already heard the pre class contention for wanting to go home early next week before the Thanksgiving break.

138
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:42,940
Uh, when you're flying in the airplane, and if you're really bored like me, you're reading like that,

139
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:50,799
that your flight information or whatever, and it's giving you all those, like random variables about what's going on outside that list.

140
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:57,340
The temperature, right? Anybody ever seen that? What what's like an example of the temperature when you're at 30,000 feet in an airplane?

141
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:04,249
Any way you recall -24 something usually.

142
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:08,470
Really? Yes, some really, really low number. And you're looking at it like, is that right?

143
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,230
Oh, my gosh, that's crazy. Maybe a little bit more tangible.

144
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:16,049
Anybody like to, like, hike with like altitude, mountains or whatever?

145
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:20,180
Yeah, right. It gets cooler, generally speaking, the further off you go.

146
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,220
So this is kind of like the normal profile of the atmosphere.

147
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:33,440
Is that so your temperature on this axis, altitude on this aspect as we go further up in height, uh, the temperature cools, right?

148
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:42,950
Okay. It's all good. Uh, there's some other kind of like basic concepts that you've definitely heard about but maybe haven't put into this context.

149
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:47,870
You've heard the, maybe the phrase of the saying that warm air rises, right?

150
00:15:48,170 --> 00:16:01,310
It absolutely does that. As it rises, it cools, uh, it expands its ability to hold water as a vapor reduces,

151
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:06,380
uh, so water within that parcel of air begins to condense forms, clouds.

152
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:11,150
If there's enough water vapor there in the first place, it condenses enough to actually form precipitation.

153
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:15,350
Okay. So a little bit of background trying to connect the dots here.

154
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:21,540
There are cases where and this is more typical on uh,

155
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:28,880
during the summertime when we have maybe a string of some really sunny days without a whole lot of wind.

156
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,070
So like stagnant conditions,

157
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:41,930
when you watch or watch a video about a weather forecasting or looking at the surface map of the of the region or the country,

158
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:45,890
and they say, oh, we have high pressure in place over here and low pressure in place over here.

159
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:54,920
There are some clear distinctions between what that means. High pressure aloft means, uh, sinking air or subsiding air.

160
00:16:55,130 --> 00:17:02,120
Pushing down this basically inhibits that movement of right warm air rising and forming clouds.

161
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:08,020
So we have high pressure in place. We have a lot of those blue sky sunny days.

162
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:14,710
Right? Uh, the extreme opposite example of that, of a low pressure is like a hurricane, right?

163
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:20,480
That's a low pressure center. You have air mass rising at a massive rate.

164
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,609
And again, if it's over water,

165
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:31,400
you have a huge source of moisture rising so fast it's condensing and it's producing an immense amount of precipitation.

166
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:39,110
Okay. So back to that high pressure scenario, subsiding air that's inhibiting clouds to form over transportation.

167
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:43,249
It also results in kind of stagnant, uh, horizontal wind.

168
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:54,770
So not a whole lot of wind at the surface. Another fun fact that many of you probably know is that the sun on a sunny day doesn't

169
00:17:54,770 --> 00:18:00,710
actually warm the air like the sun's rays are not warming the molecules in the air.

170
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:10,100
The sun's rays get absorbed by the surface of the earth, and then that energy gets is given off as infrared heat.

171
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:17,479
So the earth actually warms from the surface. And this kind of makes sense too, with that whole, like, airplane example, right?

172
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:24,410
The further you go above the surface, even though you get closer to the sun, the air temperature is going down with ice.

173
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:29,180
So on that sunny day, we have the surface of the earth heating.

174
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:33,709
It's giving off that infrared radiation, it's warming the air.

175
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:37,220
And those parcels of air are rising. Right. And they rise.

176
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:44,570
And they rise and they rise. But they only rise to the point where the air above the parcel is cooler.

177
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:50,210
If it ever hits a point where the air above it is warmer, that parcel will stop rising.

178
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:59,540
So how would we ever get a scenario like that? Okay, so on those sunny days back to this temperature inversion thing, uh,

179
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:08,270
it's giving that it's absorbed so much sun's energy all day long that it continues to give it off even after the sun goes down.

180
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:12,200
So maybe you can think of a summer day,

181
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:19,830
and it's that the sun's gone down and you're out over like an asphalt parking lot or something, and it's still given up, right?

182
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:24,020
Like you can you can feel the heat versus being around like a grass or natural surface.

183
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:32,780
It can continue to give that off during the night. So you still have warm air rising during the night and it reaches a point before

184
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:38,630
sunrise where now you have warmer air aloft and no more energy to give off below.

185
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:45,500
So in this case, when we have air pollution being emitted right somewhere down here at the surface,

186
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:49,910
as long as we have this decrease in temperature with altitude,

187
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:56,030
it's going to have the opportunity to rise and dilute into a relatively large volume of air.

188
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:59,620
Right. So this would result in a lower concentration. Of air pollution.

189
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:03,340
That's that's good. I mean, it's bad and it's being emitted in the first place.

190
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:11,500
But if we can diluted, that's great. If we have some wind affecting it horizontally to move it out of the populated area, that's also good.

191
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:17,320
But when we get this profile where the temperature is decreasing, decreasing, decreasing,

192
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:22,270
but then all of a sudden we have some of that residual heat from maybe the previous day.

193
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:26,200
It's just sitting here a lot. It's not being affected by the wind.

194
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:33,190
Now that pollution this emitted can only rise so far and there's basically an effective cap in place.

195
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:43,630
So now that volume of air that that same emission rate the pollution can dilute into is much smaller and it can result in much greater concentrations.

196
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:51,490
Okay. Is that that making sense? I know it's really slow and almost remedial sounding explanation, but I want to make sure you get it.

197
00:20:52,750 --> 00:21:00,390
Okay. So let's start to combine some things. So these are really basic images here.

198
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:08,549
I'm not even sure we're supposed to be showing the residential maybe businesses or where people live, some sort of polluting factories.

199
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:15,120
Right. The same icons on both side. They also are located in the valley.

200
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:23,910
Okay. Lots of the Earth's population lives in valleys.

201
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:28,410
Know, they're kind of like fun fact. Why would that be the case?

202
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:37,460
The water will tend to collect and values any kind of pretext from whether to a certain extent.

203
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:40,940
Absolutely. I'm going to go with the first one is the only needed explanation.

204
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:45,950
Right. Source of water. So we've got, you know, rivers, water, bodies cutting through.

205
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:52,070
Probably have formed the valleys, right geologically, uh, topographically over time.

206
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:57,170
So a lot of us live in valleys for good reason.

207
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:01,460
Originally, that's where people began to gather.

208
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:06,650
Now there's some functional aspects of it. Maybe like, you know, whatever these factories are,

209
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:13,160
they might be receiving raw materials to the the waterway might be serve as a way to transport materials.

210
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:17,930
Uh, it might be a way to cool off that. There's a high temperature process.

211
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:24,350
You have already a source of water to cool the factory's innards of some sort,

212
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:30,730
and then maybe you're producing something, and now you can put it on a vessel and send it further downstream.

213
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:41,870
So anyway, that's a good reason to be in a valley. Not a good, uh, overlay when it comes to being concerned about exposure to air pollution outdoors.

214
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:45,370
So following that same sort of, uh,

215
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:54,350
inversion and the one here on the left is going to be during the daytime when we have lots of vertical mixing and it's,

216
00:22:54,350 --> 00:23:02,120
uh, vaguely showing that this pollution, you know, based on these arrows, can go up quite a ways and begin to be limited, right?

217
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:12,470
In this case, we have that temperature inversion in place and it's trapping that pollution at a lower level because it's residing within a valley.

218
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,460
It's also being trapped right from the side.

219
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:20,780
So there's no way for it to escape. It's all trapped within the valley.

220
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:26,270
The combination of the topography and then kind of an inherent vertical cap, uh,

221
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:32,700
from the thermal inversion that's in place, can again result in some really high concentrations.

222
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,680
Here's a photographic, uh, representation of this.

223
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:40,580
This particular one is Salt Lake City, Utah.

224
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:49,370
There's a hundred cities across the globe where you could I could have chosen to show a picture and illustrate the same point.

225
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:54,109
So the you know, the vantage point of the photographer is on one side of the valley,

226
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:59,450
up on the mountain, looking across, you can see, uh, the mountains on the other side of the valley.

227
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:03,380
Down below is the valley in the city of Salt Lake.

228
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:08,960
But you can't see it, right? And in this case, we have a thermal inversion in place.

229
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:16,069
Everything that's being emitted within the city is not making it high enough to clear the peaks on each

230
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:23,030
side because there's a thermal inversion in place allowing pollution to accumulate to high levels,

231
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:29,750
which is not good for the folks that are residing. Okay. Huge contrast in like esthetics here.

232
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:33,260
Now, let's look at this picture, which is totally appropriate.

233
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:41,990
It's like miserable outside. It's like snowing again. Let's just look at this for a few minutes and imagine and wish that we were there.

234
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:46,970
I definitely would be. Uh, who's ever been to a beach?

235
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:53,600
Many of you. Most of you. Okay, uh, indulge me here a little bit.

236
00:24:54,500 --> 00:25:01,100
And maybe this is like a nice escape from, like, the cinder blocks and the snow that, you know, just going outside, if it helps even close your eyes.

237
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:06,889
Think about when you've been at a beach and it's very warm, right?

238
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:12,800
Like maybe a summertime day at the beach just from your senses.

239
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,250
What you see, what you smell, what you feel.

240
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:24,520
What do you observe? It's breezy.

241
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,500
It's breezy. Okay. So you can kind of like feel the breeze when you see the breeze.

242
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:36,580
If there's like, you know, these palm trees are swaying. Is the breeze coming from any particular direction?

243
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,069
Water from the water? Yeah, I think that's quite common.

244
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:48,230
Right. So it's coming off the water, onto the land.

245
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:57,410
Good. What else? And smell the ocean.

246
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:01,850
You can smell the ocean. Yeah. And maybe that's another indicator which way the wind blowing.

247
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:06,499
Right. Is, is that it's kind of coming on to the land, unless, of course, you're out in the water.

248
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:11,030
And so. What else? Humidity.

249
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:19,010
Humid. Yeah, absolutely. So we have this huge source of water with water evaporating.

250
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:22,820
So it generally is moist air.

251
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,109
Sure. Serious is probably.

252
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:31,190
Really? Yeah, for sure. In the sand can be really hard.

253
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:37,370
This is not a good image. I mean, it's very pretty. This is either sunrise or sunset, right?

254
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:43,040
The incident angle is pretty low, so the sun is probably not very hot and it's actually wet.

255
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:48,440
Right. But yeah, I can remember times where, you know, I'm going to walk from here to there.

256
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:52,280
It's not that far. And I get halfway and my feet are on fire.

257
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:59,660
Right? And I'm like running just to get to some sort of refuge, actually, other than getting to my beach line here, what's another refuge?

258
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:05,450
Water. The water itself. Yeah, the water is generally much cooler, right.

259
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:09,680
And refreshing, in fact, on a hot day. All right.

260
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:13,850
You guys are doing a great job. I think you've hit on most of them with this is kind of fun.

261
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:17,690
Anything else that comes to mind for your observations?

262
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:30,750
All right. Now, you totally hang on more than we need to to make some basic point here.

263
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:38,750
So similar to there being a lot of people across the globe that live in the valleys,

264
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:46,909
there are also a lot of people that live in close proximity to coastal areas, coastal regions.

265
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:51,110
Right. And again, for kind of similar logistical reasons, transportation.

266
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:58,750
Right. Ports and water for like for more modern uses, water for cooling.

267
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:05,780
Right. So there are a lot of industries that are located specifically along the coast for access to that water.

268
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:14,870
And then a lot of people. So a lot of population. So there is this concept of sea breeze very simply named,

269
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:21,290
but kind of getting into a little bit of the local meteorology to understand why that's actually the case.

270
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:28,100
So here we have a land, over here we have the water.

271
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:38,030
And in that, you know, that same or that similar type of example we had of our of our thermal inversion where we have like a warm,

272
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:45,440
sunny day and it's the Earth's surface that's absorbing that ultraviolet energy, giving it back up in the form of heat.

273
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:53,390
The land along the coast is doing the same. It's absorbing all of that energy, giving it back office heat.

274
00:28:53,840 --> 00:29:05,420
And you have rising parcels of air and that the local, in this case atmosphere is constantly trying to equilibrium.

275
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:10,340
Right. So as a parcel of air rises, it needs to replace it with something.

276
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:15,560
So it's basically pulling the source of cooler air over the water onto the land.

277
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:23,000
Same kind of thing. This air is kind of evacuating at the surface and it's looking to pull air down from aloft.

278
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:30,740
And you can basically get this circulation that forms within a relatively localized area in a coastal region.

279
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:36,020
Okay. So what does that mean with regards to air pollution exposures?

280
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:46,580
It can often not be so great. You can be standing and again, this is like in a in a urban or some high urban area,

281
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:52,660
you can be standing, you know, out right in the water looking out to sea.

282
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:57,140
You can't see anything. Right. And there's probably nothing for literally thousands of miles.

283
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:01,190
And you think you're you're breathing the purest air ever.

284
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:06,020
Right. Oftentimes, that's not the case because of the sea breeze circulation.

285
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:11,660
So over the land, right where all the people live or all of our industry is we're driving cars, right?

286
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:17,900
We're emitting pollutants from factories, power plants and so forth to get caught up in this sea breeze.

287
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:24,500
So they are pulled aloft, pulled out to sea, pulled back down,

288
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:30,950
and then come in and are hitting you as you're standing there gazing out over the water.

289
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:39,920
So a couple of things here. You can see how this cycle can basically accumulate pollution, right.

290
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:46,340
This isn't the case here. We have wind that can just kind of be evacuated right from east to west and take it out of the urban area.

291
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:52,490
It basically allows a containment system to allow it to just keep being emitted and keep building.

292
00:30:52,940 --> 00:31:03,710
So the sea breeze as a as a meteorological feature, can really make pollution in urban areas a challenge.

293
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:09,559
And actually, all three can combine. We can bring topography into this and make it even worse.

294
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:12,740
Right. So like Southern California is a really good example of this.

295
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:22,360
You have the sea, which is so by definition that sea level amount of land and then not too far inland, you have some mountains, right?

296
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:28,850
So this just further exacerbates the raising air and setting up this circulation.

297
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:34,100
Okay. One quick exercise.

298
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:42,890
So based on what we just learned, not knowing anything about where this is or what this is, but just some some visual cues here.

299
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:53,170
What do you think might be going on? Looks at the condition of being trapped.

300
00:31:54,670 --> 00:32:03,760
What? What about the picture? I would tell you that just the white smoke, the pollution seems like pretty good indicator.

301
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,150
And it's peaking at the very thin level. Okay.

302
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:13,110
Yeah, exactly. Now. Great description. So we've got it. You know, I really don't know what this is being emitted.

303
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:18,189
Some sort of smoke. It hits a certain height. Right. It's no longer rising now.

304
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:21,520
It's just kind of being distributed horizontally.

305
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,280
So it seems like, you know, there might be something capping it. Right.

306
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,770
Perhaps there's an inversion in place.

307
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:34,870
Is there anything else in this image that would support our our proposal of there being an inverted thermal inversion in place?

308
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:40,470
Well, yeah. So we have such a poverty going on here.

309
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:47,180
Here's the mountain we can't actually see, you know, off the image.

310
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:54,329
The left here. This looks like maybe some sort of tidal basin.

311
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:57,330
Right. That's that the tide is out at the moment.

312
00:32:57,570 --> 00:33:06,000
But this might be a waterway, so perhaps it is kind of a valley and there is topography on the other side that definitely would support it.

313
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:19,730
What else? Yes, absolutely.

314
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,970
That was the last one I was looking for. Yeah. Clear blue skies, right.

315
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:31,130
So this would tell us that there's high pressure regionally centered over this area, which is subsiding air.

316
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:39,529
We have a spirit that is sinking towards the ground, inhibiting clouds being formed, and it's resulting in a relatively stagnant condition.

317
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:48,050
Right. So there's no wind whipping through this valley, taking this pollution and taking it far away from whoever might be there to be exposed.

318
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:51,770
Okay. Great job, though. Now we understand a little bit about these important features,

319
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:57,800
meteorology and topography that can kind of conspire to result in high pollution levels,

320
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:02,540
particularly where where many of us live, right within urban areas.

321
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:14,959
Okay. So getting back to our ozone and our particulate matter, uh, I'm not going to focus upon on the chemistry, but I wanted to have a slide on it.

322
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,750
Right? We talked about how ozone is a secondary pollutant.

323
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:27,140
It's formed by reactions in the atmosphere to sunlight, specifically at wavelengths of less than 420 millimeters.

324
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:37,610
So that sunlight, combined with both, not just one of the other nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds,

325
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:49,010
can help us to form those answers converting oxygen in the air to ozone, gas and lots of different sources.

326
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:53,330
I won't go into a ton of detail, but just to acknowledge.

327
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:59,930
Right, so you're pointing the finger at the bad guys. Here's our transportation sources, our electricity production and so forth.

328
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:06,860
There are actually quite a bit of natural sources of both of these trees.

329
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,610
Uh, omit a lot of volatile organic compounds.

330
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:17,209
So in regions where there's forested areas, right, kind of upwind of an urban area,

331
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:25,070
then you combine those VOCs with the nitrogen oxides emitted from, say, cars, you're setting the stage for ozone production.

332
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:28,430
So it's not just, uh, anthropogenic sources.

333
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:36,559
There's quite a bit of natural sources that contribute to this ozone information, which is another, uh, [INAUDIBLE] in the,

334
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:43,850
in the solution approach to solving that right is if there are natural sources, that makes things much more complicated.

335
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:48,050
How are we doing from an exposure perspective?

336
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:56,360
Uh, ozone has been regulated as one of the national, uh, as part of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards.

337
00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:06,679
One of the criteria pollutants going back to about 1980 or so, it's come down an average, but it's been a very slow, gentle slope.

338
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:11,690
Right. We've actually done quite a bit in this country to curb pollution.

339
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:17,030
And over the course of 40 years, it's gone down about 35% significant.

340
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:20,390
Right. But perhaps not not completely impressive.

341
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:34,050
Looking at a map of the country in areas that basically anything that's colored on the map is not meeting the ozone standard.

342
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:42,870
Right. So it's the levels of ozone are above the air quality standard that's in place for the most part.

343
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:53,180
If you're good at U.S. geography, which I'm not, you can pretty much just pull up the cities right out of all of these colored areas.

344
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:58,200
So over here in the northeast, we have basically Washington, D.C. to Boston, right.

345
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:03,720
That whole kind of megalopolis all exceeding the standard on the other side.

346
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:07,770
And then we have much of kind of southern California, again, the valley,

347
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:12,420
as well as the Seabreeze playing a big role in addition to all of the emissions.

348
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:18,590
But in between those two coastal setups, it's pretty much individual urban areas.

349
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:22,770
So here's Houston. Here's Atlanta.

350
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:31,800
Uh, Dallas coming up here, southeast Michigan, Chicago, Saint Louis, up into Phenix.

351
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:41,709
So you might look at this map of the U.S. and say, well, hey, you know, 90 some percent is below the air quality standard for ozone.

352
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:47,430
That's that's pretty good, right? But if you look at as a percent of population exposure, right.

353
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:53,760
Unfortunately, we're in all the cases where ozone levels are high is where most of us are living.

354
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:00,280
All right. Shifting gears here to particulate matter, I pretty much already said this.

355
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:09,070
We characterize it both as a primary emission and primary pollutant, meaning that it can be directly emitted from a source.

356
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:20,710
It can also form secondarily, for example, from sulfur dioxide that's emitted from coal fired power plants that can form sulfate particles.

357
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:28,210
So the in this coal example, of course, made out of the Earth, no one's adding sulfur to the process.

358
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:33,490
It's naturally enriched geologically. The coal has sulfur in it.

359
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,520
In itself it's not harmful.

360
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:43,120
But when it's burned at a high temperature combustion to generate electricity, it liberates that sulfur in the form of gas.

361
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:47,470
And that's where it can cause some grief. From an air pollution perspective.

362
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:54,490
So that so that has to conform sulfate particles similarly ammonia.

363
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:59,410
So nitrogen oxides and form particulates.

364
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:07,420
Those volatile organic compounds are actually now some of them are classified as being semi volatile.

365
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:17,590
So even based on the temperature, the ambient temperature of the environment can dictate whether a particle exists as a solid or as a as a gas.

366
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:22,420
So warmer temperatures. Right. There are some organics that would just as a vapor.

367
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:26,290
And then as the temperature cools, they will actually condense.

368
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:30,100
And now they are classified as a particulate.

369
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:37,390
And then here's where it gets really complicated, is that many particles are actually mixtures.

370
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:39,940
Right. So there's kind of like an internal core.

371
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:49,629
And then like in the case of these organics that are semi volatile, they can get condensed onto an existing particulate.

372
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:53,800
I think I have some really basic yeah. Really basic illustrations of this.

373
00:39:54,250 --> 00:40:02,500
So we might have a particle that exists from even like a natural sort of mineral dust,

374
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:10,450
but then it can have basically a coating added to it from some of this atmospheric chemistry that takes place.

375
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:15,220
So we can have coated particles. We can also even have aggregate particles.

376
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:24,070
They're they're blowing around in the wind. Right. And just by simple statistical chance, they're going to collide and knock into each other.

377
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:27,669
Changes the aerodynamics greatly of the particle. Right.

378
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:34,270
And might have been smaller and spherical. And now as they aggregate, it's kind of irregularly shaped and aerodynamically.

379
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:47,280
It's of a larger size. And then getting back to, you know, the chemical nature of it, uh, we can look at the morphology of the particle in this case,

380
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:54,389
using like a scanning electron microscope to tunnel down and look at cases where we have,

381
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:59,730
you know, a core particle here and then aggregates of much smaller particles that added to it.

382
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:04,110
And we can do chemical analysis of those particles as well.

383
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:09,580
Right. And know what chemicals they're composed of for PM.

384
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:20,630
Looking at a similar trend. Although just to point out that that ozone trend started in 1980, this PM 2.5 trend starts the year 2000.

385
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:24,090
That was when the PM 2.5 standard was added and went into effect.

386
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:30,960
So that's why the record only goes back to 2000, a little bit more impressive breakthrough over about 20 years or so.

387
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:40,590
It's gone down by about 43%. Much of that is because part of the PPM is of a primary emission.

388
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:46,620
Right. So if we can stop it from being emitted in the first place, we can make some big headway.

389
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:52,410
But because it's also a secondary pollutant, it makes it a bit more of a challenge to regulate.

390
00:41:55,300 --> 00:42:00,160
Similar map, just to kind of put it up there in terms of meeting the standards,

391
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:08,260
the country is doing relatively well aside from, you know, big swaths of of Southern California.

392
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:16,300
There aren't a whole lot of areas that aren't meeting the air quality standard for PM 2.5 specifically.

393
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:21,370
That's the good news. The less than good news is there are many, many,

394
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:27,880
many studies that show that there's basically no threshold effect for 4 p.m.

395
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:34,930
And so there are documented adverse effects levels well below those standards.

396
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:47,030
And then I want to hit on this. And again, it's kind of going back to that straddling that kind of sign as the policy line right now.

397
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:51,770
We will use that tool.

398
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:57,650
Right now, we regulate peer based on mass.

399
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:00,620
So it's basically regulated as a physical hazard.

400
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:09,680
Even though all of those exposure and health studies are likely having associations that are due to the chemical nature of the particle,

401
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:19,730
because it's so it's so difficult to to regulate chemicals within particles because they they vary so greatly, spatially and temporally.

402
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,790
They're just regulated based on that.

403
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:30,560
Going back 40, 50 years ago, they were regulated based on just total suspended particles, any particles in the air.

404
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:39,440
As research informed how they impact our health, we learned that it was only particles at ten microns or less in diameter.

405
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:44,510
They were they were respirable that we could actually inhale and they could impact our airways.

406
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:54,830
Because of that, the standard was changed from TSP to Pinion ten with another 20 years or so of exposure in health research,

407
00:43:55,790 --> 00:44:04,159
PM 2.5 standard was and so now we actually have both 2.5 standard and a PM10 standard because the

408
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:10,880
scientific literature showed that there were independent effects from these small sized particles.

409
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:21,650
All right. So what's next in terms of improving our health, reducing our exposures and having informed policy and regulation?

410
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,050
We've talked about the chemical composition of the PPM.

411
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:30,470
Uh, this is something that's definitely worth looking into a lot of studies that show associations.

412
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:37,730
But again, because of the emission profiles, those differences in demography, those differences in meteorology,

413
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:44,720
there are so many variables at play that it's really hard for a federal government to just establish a single standard,

414
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:55,549
specific to specific chemicals of the particular. The question of what's more important of particle bulk composition or surface composition, right?

415
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:59,540
So if we go back to this kind of basic slide,

416
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:07,820
if I breathe in this particle from a physical interaction perspective or maybe even a chemical interaction perspective,

417
00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:14,569
most of what's coming into contact with my airway is whatever out here on the surface of the particle.

418
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:21,010
Right. And, you know, perhaps what's inside is not so important, although I know that there's other thing we know.

419
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:29,600
A macrophages take over as part of immune response or inflammation response and the particle might actually be getting digested.

420
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:37,430
But it's a legitimate question. Should we be concerned about, you know, the bulk composition or just what's on the surface of the particle?

421
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:42,440
Uh, what about particle number? So, yeah, this is where I was mean draw.

422
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:49,490
Please don't grade me on my art. Or is there some magic thing to start it?

423
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,740
Uh. Darn it.

424
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:59,690
All right. How many is the whiteboard? Sorry. To the people on the recording.

425
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:06,540
So, really quickly, here's a big part of all there's.

426
00:46:08,330 --> 00:46:20,680
Even if there's not. Ten particles that make up equivalent mass to this one part.

427
00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:25,750
Which one would you be most concerned about from a health effects perspective?

428
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:32,240
He was the one on the right. The one on the right? Why? What would be your reasoning?

429
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:41,130
Say. Smaller, right? So we have ten much smaller particles that can get deeper into our airways or surface.

430
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:43,519
More surface area absolutely separates.

431
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:49,520
Stretch this out another line and stretch all of these out in a line, you know, much, much greater surface area.

432
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:57,890
Yeah. So these are legitimate questions, right? Even within a PM or a PM 2.5, should we be worried about just the max?

433
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:05,330
Maybe we should be worried about, you know, how many particles because a lot of little particles of equal or equivalent

434
00:47:05,330 --> 00:47:10,580
mass might be much worse or more indicative of the adverse impact on health.

435
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:22,730
All right. So in terms of these air pollution problems and yeah, I already gave away the punch line.

436
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:28,159
Right. We're focusing mostly here today on urban smog, talking about PM.

437
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:31,400
It's chemical compounds, ozone, gas.

438
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:39,890
Uh, if we're looking at, you know, effective policy to reduce pollution levels and reduce exposure,

439
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:47,540
there's a lot of potential co-benefits if we can somehow magically cut down, I think what a genius idea, right?

440
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:51,979
What we think of as before, reduce fossil fuel emissions.

441
00:47:51,980 --> 00:48:00,740
Not only can we probably make a big dent and improve urban smog where most of us live with regards to things like plateaus,

442
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:07,760
we can solve a lot of the atmospheric deposition problems related to mercury versus organics.

443
00:48:08,390 --> 00:48:17,570
We can certainly make a huge dent in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and subsequent impact on climate.

444
00:48:18,170 --> 00:48:24,860
And then again, where fossil fuels are being used for cooking and heating indoors within households.

445
00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:31,540
Uh, in terms of total energy supply.

446
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:36,839
And this, this is kind of an old slide, but it illustrates a legitimate point, is that even with,

447
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:43,710
you know, lots of efforts and lots of development, lots of subsidies, um, even some yeah.

448
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:49,920
Some kind of legislation, uh, hoping to tip the balance for the foreseeable future.

449
00:48:50,460 --> 00:49:00,960
We're still very heavily weighted globally, uh, reliance on, on fossil fuels as our primary source of energy.

450
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:09,180
Yes, we, we have renewables and more sustainable approaches that are coming online, but it's a very slow rate.

451
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:14,820
Right. And so, again, on a global scale. So this includes, you know, low middle income countries.

452
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:22,649
And in addition to high income nations, uh, we're still on a path where we're heavily dependent on energy.

453
00:49:22,650 --> 00:49:26,760
And there are some, you know, very relatively acute geopolitics.

454
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:33,470
That's, that's pushing that timeline even further. Right? This war that's going on is absolutely focused on energy is awful.

455
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:39,900
Um, but it's really slowing down, you know, kind of progress, right?

456
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:43,049
That was plans that were previously in place.

457
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:44,910
I mean, there's been some changes.

458
00:49:44,910 --> 00:49:54,360
Even though this fossil fuel bubble, uh, hasn't really changed over the last few decades, there's been some transitions, like some in terms.

459
00:49:54,570 --> 00:50:01,310
So there has been a pretty big shift from coal to natural gas from a carbon emission perspective.

460
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:09,820
It's that's, you know, not, not a huge improvement, um, but from a toxics perspective, it is an improvement cause much dirtier.

461
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,430
Right. Those toxic metals,

462
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:20,309
a lot of those really awful organic compounds are in much higher concentrations as a result of coal combustion compared to natural gas.

463
00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:25,410
So in that sense, it was a little bit cleaner, but it's certainly not a long term solution at best.

464
00:50:25,410 --> 00:50:29,730
It's kind of an interim measure, uh, until more of these renewables can come online.

465
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:37,019
So anyways, the point of this is not completely depressing, although you would be justified if you're a little discouraged by it.

466
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:44,459
But you know, as public health folks and environmental health folks and knowing that these are problems that are not going to go away anytime soon,

467
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:48,270
they're going with this for a while. All right.

468
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:52,750
And I will I'll finish up with just a little bit of show and tell.

469
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:59,170
And yeah, I'm really kicking myself for not bringing down any little sampler gadgets from the lab to pass around.

470
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:06,820
Uh, so this would be so you've heard of area monitoring versus personal monitoring.

471
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:12,040
And when I talk about those ambient air quality standards, this is in the community settings.

472
00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:21,280
They are all of these pollutants are measured using something called a federal reference method.

473
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:29,350
So it's something that the US EPA, who's the agency who is issuing these air quality standards,

474
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:34,600
and then the way that the enforcement is structured, it is handled at the local level.

475
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:42,480
So individual states are the ones that are kind of responsible for actually implementing the monitoring to enforce or

476
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:48,850
to ensure that air quality standards are in compliance or levels of air quality are in compliance with the standard.

477
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:57,340
And EPA designates technology specific instruments as those that serve as kind of the federal reference method.

478
00:51:57,850 --> 00:52:01,690
A company could come along and say, Hey, we've got a great new way to do it.

479
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:06,130
It's cheaper, it's it requires less resources.

480
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:13,060
And they can actually demonstrate to the government that it's an equivalent method and it gets done designated as a federal method.

481
00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:21,519
But this this is kind of like your generic air monitoring site that you might see that's run by a local government, the state,

482
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:30,100
maybe county in the case of large cities where it's sited not near tall structures or

483
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:34,990
it's not in an urban canyon where you have all kinds of building leak effects going on,

484
00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:38,080
it's relatively secure.

485
00:52:38,110 --> 00:52:47,360
I mean, just so that people don't know that they're going to, like, have much of an impact on the on the air pollution measurements themselves.

486
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:55,149
But from a safety perspective, right. Some of it is located up top here, a lot of it being inlets and filter cartridges.

487
00:52:55,150 --> 00:52:58,150
And then there's quite a bit down inside here.

488
00:52:58,150 --> 00:53:05,590
I mean, it's all temperature and humidity controlled and electricity provided and pretty a big scale, but none of it's very impressive.

489
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:14,530
Right. This is like what several reference methods look for for various gas analyzers and particle analyzers.

490
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:20,980
This one over here actually rarely see any of it. I'm wondering if you wind up in one here.

491
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:30,750
One of these would be providing perhaps this one providing like a PM 2.5 or a PM10 sized cut, right.

492
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:35,050
Based on the aerodynamics in the Airstream comes down.

493
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:41,959
So only particles less than three, two and a half are coming down inside and going into this unit here.

494
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:45,830
This is the tail. It's one of the federal reference methods.

495
00:53:45,830 --> 00:53:53,930
Or maybe I've got one that I can't remember, but it can legally be used to assess compliance and enforcement for palm oil.

496
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:58,940
Palm stands for tapered element or oscillating micro balance,

497
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:08,180
so there is a little filter that gets plugged in and it's being vibrated and it just is bouncing back and forth like this.

498
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:16,520
And the Airstream is coming down from outside at a known flow rate and the particles are depositing onto this filter.

499
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:22,460
And as the mass accumulates, the frequency of the vibration slows down.

500
00:54:23,330 --> 00:54:30,290
So the instrument is actually calibrated to how much mass does it take to slow down the vibration by a certain amount?

501
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:36,710
So it's kind of a real time reading of PPM levels again based on mass.

502
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:41,390
There's no information about chemical composition in that case,

503
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:48,890
but that would be an example of one of these reference methods or equivalent methods for measuring particles.

504
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:55,010
There's much more manual approaches if you are interested in more than just particle math.

505
00:54:55,970 --> 00:54:58,910
Traditional methods require collection of a filter.

506
00:54:59,450 --> 00:55:08,990
So this, in this case, the operator would have, uh, filters that have been weighed pre weighed in a laboratory.

507
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:14,090
They're taken out into the field, they're loaded into a sampler.

508
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:20,179
It could be as simple as the person turning it on and turning it off and measuring what the flow is.

509
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:28,430
Or perhaps there's some sort of mass flow, uh, calibrator inside, um, or some sort of volumetric measurement of flow,

510
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:36,740
or it can be automated where you puts it in and press goes and it's all computerized and it's shuffling one filter,

511
00:55:36,770 --> 00:55:43,309
you know, each, whatever the time increment is for particles, it would be, uh, 24 hours.

512
00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:49,220
That's the shortest window for air quality standards for particles is the 24 hour time period.

513
00:55:49,610 --> 00:55:54,620
So each day when you filters, collected filters go back to the laboratory or wait again.

514
00:55:55,190 --> 00:56:00,350
And it's just simple stuff. You subtract the pre weight of the filter from the post weight, right?

515
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:09,440
And the difference is the amount of mass that's been collected that the volume has been measured, the volume of air samples has been measured.

516
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:15,689
So in that way we can calculate what's the mass of particles per volume of air sample.

517
00:56:15,690 --> 00:56:19,270
Okay. So conceptually not all that different than what you're doing in the workplace, right?

518
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:30,850
With either an area monitor or a personal monitor. And then some yeah, some some more pictures shifting from that area monitor to personal monitoring.

519
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:40,660
So, I mean, just to make a clear distinction, all of the air quality standards from a regulatory perspective are evaluated with air area monitors,

520
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:45,280
only those stationary reference methods and equivalent methods.

521
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:49,930
There is a ton of work that's done for personal exposure monitors.

522
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:57,640
Much of it is from a research perspective. I mean, there aren't like like OSHA,

523
00:56:58,390 --> 00:57:08,470
there aren't racing gates or whoever it is rated setting the worst place workplace standards for for air pollution exposure within a workplace.

524
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:15,700
There aren't equivalent methods, reference methods or even standards for personal exposure.

525
00:57:16,270 --> 00:57:25,870
It's mostly from a research perspective, but there's any number of different types out there that can measure different size fractions.

526
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:35,650
So several filter stacks together and one that just kind of limits the size rate to perhaps either two and a half or ten and very,

527
00:57:35,650 --> 00:57:43,780
very similar to what might be done in a workplace in terms of like a four way race, two liters a minute, perhaps up to ten liters per minute.

528
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:50,390
These would be considered active samplers, meaning, right,

529
00:57:50,410 --> 00:58:00,010
that there is that there's air being pulled through them by some sort of pump that most of the gaseous measurements are easier.

530
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:03,210
I think there are some examples eventually coming up for particles.

531
00:58:03,270 --> 00:58:10,030
It's much more of a challenge and most of them are active samplers because of the size cut that needs to be attained.

532
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:17,680
So we need to limit. We can't just let all particles in. We know that those big ones don't really impact us so much from an adverse health impact.

533
00:58:18,190 --> 00:58:23,260
It's only the smallest one. So how do we achieve that? Here's an example of a couple of different ones.

534
00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:29,170
This is an impassioned plea. So we've got they're being pulled right somewhere downstream of the pump,

535
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:34,920
pulling air from the environment or from the personal monitor down into the sampler.

536
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,900
It's traveling at a very specified flow rate,

537
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:47,020
and only particles that are small enough can actually make this bend and continue down to like where our sample filter might be.

538
00:58:47,530 --> 00:58:53,440
Particles that are big enough at that flow rate are too much momentum and they go back and they impact on to this point.

539
00:58:53,470 --> 00:59:00,190
So this is a way to limit rate and have only the particles of a size or less that we're interested in measuring.

540
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:09,820
Another approach to that is a cyclone sampler where this one, the airflow, is actually going in the opposite direction in this example.

541
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:15,160
So it's being pulled into an inlet, into the cyclone and then going up.

542
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:19,810
And here is our filter that would be collecting the particles that enters this cyclone.

543
00:59:19,810 --> 00:59:24,969
And it's kind of like spinning around in only particles of a certain size.

544
00:59:24,970 --> 00:59:31,030
And buoyancy can actually make the turn and be pulled up to the filter and be collected the ones

545
00:59:31,030 --> 00:59:37,180
that are too heavy to basically gravitationally settle out here to the bottom of the sampler.

546
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:42,610
There's lots out there for direct reading, right?

547
00:59:42,610 --> 00:59:49,990
So some of those examples I given still in the way of filter and filter and be in the lab and come out of the lab.

548
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:56,379
These are ones that we can just walk up to a person and generally speaking,

549
00:59:56,380 --> 01:00:03,310
they're they're active samplers but can give us some direct reading instrumentation for the PM.

550
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:06,910
Similarly, we can imagine for gases.

551
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:12,900
Uh, yeah, I already kind of talked about active sampling.

552
01:00:13,350 --> 01:00:18,929
As you all know, within the workplace. With it being active, you know, generally.

553
01:00:18,930 --> 01:00:23,190
Usually, though, when, when you have a company like a battery, right.

554
01:00:23,850 --> 01:00:30,780
And it starts to get kind of bulky and heavy. If things are too bulky or too heavy, you know, it might be geared more towards area sampling,

555
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:35,819
same type of thing outside of the workplace, especially in indoor environments.

556
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:40,290
It would be great if we can make personal exposure measurements of folks within their households.

557
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:43,480
But again, sometimes, and especially if we look at, uh,

558
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:51,030
this is a little bit of a tangent but important one most vulnerable populations with regards to air pollution,

559
01:00:51,030 --> 01:00:57,240
exposure, small children, women of childbearing age, elderly folks.

560
01:00:57,390 --> 01:01:05,670
Right. These are the ones that are going to be least able to bear the burden of crawling around of a heavy sample.

561
01:01:05,850 --> 01:01:11,879
Right. So this is also, uh, um, when this is done with in a lot of homes, you know,

562
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:19,550
we often will fall back to area sampling in order to accommodate, you know, that exposure assessment just because it all just ticks and.

563
01:01:22,390 --> 01:01:26,860
Uh. Yeah, so. Okay, we can get rid of that. Come and do some passive sampling.

564
01:01:26,860 --> 01:01:29,860
I'm sure you've talked about it a little bit. In this class.

565
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:37,059
There are any number of opportunities not so conducive to particles, but certainly her gases, right?

566
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:45,190
Where we can rely on diffusion to capture particular gases and using this absorption and the

567
01:01:45,190 --> 01:01:51,700
concentration gradient and tell us what people are being exposed to and personal level.

568
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:57,640
And then oh yeah, I'm doing great on time. Um, this is actually my last slide.

569
01:01:58,180 --> 01:02:03,399
Uh, it's, it's finishing up with a little bit of my own, uh, an example of a woman, my own research.

570
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:12,430
This is a new project. Well, a little over a year, but it's a five year, uh, grant from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.

571
01:02:13,390 --> 01:02:24,100
And again, going back to, uh, to my own interests, I've been doing kind of air pollution, exposure and health research for a long time, my gray hair.

572
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:34,270
So, you know, I have been doing it for, um, and even to this day we're still limited by the technology that we have right.

573
01:02:34,270 --> 01:02:40,450
There is, there's uncertainty, there's biases in the instrumentation that we have available to us.

574
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:45,370
And to have that logistical burden right when we do an air pollution study,

575
01:02:45,370 --> 01:02:52,300
we're most concerned about those vulnerable populations, the children, the women of childbearing age, the elderly.

576
01:02:53,170 --> 01:03:02,980
And so this project is focusing on developing a micro scale, easily wearable sensor technology for PM.

577
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:07,720
So it's actually an active sampler but really, really small.

578
01:03:08,540 --> 01:03:15,340
I won't go through in detail, but our, our conceptual plan here is to develop this as a prototype.

579
01:03:16,060 --> 01:03:27,820
We have air coming in, we can start with the PM10 size coat actually goes into a liquid solution and we're able to say segregated into three or four,

580
01:03:27,910 --> 01:03:34,090
actually the first five right here, but more realistically three or four different size bands and then have the ability

581
01:03:34,090 --> 01:03:39,940
to classify chemically what the components of the particles are all on a micro scale,

582
01:03:39,940 --> 01:03:48,519
easily wearable device. It is not a burden to these most vulnerable folks that we are most interested in characterizing.

583
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:52,030
And again, it's giving off this information in real time.

584
01:03:52,930 --> 01:03:58,989
And I think I can go ahead and stop and you guys be super happy because you

585
01:03:58,990 --> 01:04:03,280
can get like 15 minutes of your life because I'm a little bit hard schedule,

586
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:11,860
but I'm happy to answer any questions or comments more or go into more detail about any of the topics that we discussed today.

587
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:20,050
And again, you know, the goal was to to give some examples of how we assess exposure, right, where we stand.

588
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:28,300
What are some of the challenging issues with regards to the primary pollutants within urban areas that both PPM and ozone.

589
01:04:34,420 --> 01:04:41,440
Oh, good. All right. Well, hey, if you do think of questions, don't hesitate to reach out to me and to me an email.

590
01:04:41,830 --> 01:04:45,030
I'd be happy to meet with anyone to chat or otherwise.

591
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:50,710
Have a great afternoon and good luck convincing Dr. Meeker to have the remote access.

592
01:04:54,560 --> 01:05:02,090
All that worries.
