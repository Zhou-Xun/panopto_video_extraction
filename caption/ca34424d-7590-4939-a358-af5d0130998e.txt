1
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:47,740
Oh. Hello.

2
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,600
Hello. Hi. How are you? Good.

3
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,920
How are you? Good. I'm just in the car for class today.

4
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:06,210
I will be here. Okay. And I'll give you co-host permission to control your screen.

5
00:01:06,990 --> 00:03:25,980
All right. Thank you. You can get majestic couples like this if more people can join.

6
00:03:26,900 --> 00:04:48,059
Right. No problem. All right.

7
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,570
We'll go ahead and get started, everyone. And welcome to class today.

8
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:58,020
Apologies. I'm in my car right now, but I will be there and I'll be available to chat if anything.

9
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,300
Just one thing before we get started. I hope you all saw the announcement I made.

10
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:25,900
Assignment six is hosted. And Brian is traveling today, so I hope we will call beyond that.

11
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:33,180
I will hand it over. If you'd like to give a quick introduction to the class, then you can go ahead, get started.

12
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:53,090
All right. Good day, everyone.

13
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:58,220
My name is Tim Tooley. Truly, I'm from South Africa.

14
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,450
I am based at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa.

15
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:07,310
Currently, I am a visiting scholar at the University of Michigan.

16
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:12,590
I'm through the University of Michigan African Presidential Scholars Program.

17
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:18,050
And during my stay at Michigan, I have been hosted in the School of Public Health.

18
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:24,720
So today I will give a lecture on mental health in South Africa and I will also

19
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,330
share some of my research about mental health in the South African population.

20
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:39,240
And when the lecture is done, then there will be time for us to have a question and answer session.

21
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,280
So please,

22
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:51,780
can you note indications you'd like to give to me and we will do them after I have completed the lecture and the presentation about my research.

23
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:08,580
Okay. This first image is just showing you the African continent with all the different countries in Africa.

24
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:16,830
So you can locate the country of South Africa, which is located here, the southernmost tip of the African continent.

25
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:26,010
Also in South Africa, within the South African borders, there are two independent countries which are Minnesota and Eswatini.

26
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:37,389
Before I start my presentation, I'd like to firstly explain how race is conceptualized in the South African

27
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:41,740
context because it's a bit different when compared to other places in the world.

28
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:45,670
So in South Africa there are four main race groupings.

29
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:49,420
That is the white Indian, colored and African.

30
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:54,430
So the white race group is the people who are said to be of European descent.

31
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:04,690
The Indian race group, Indian laborers, indentured laborers were brought to South Africa to work in the sugarcane plantations.

32
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:16,200
Then we have the colored race group. And I understand that this is not a term that is used in the United States as it has very negative connotations.

33
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:25,740
But in the South African context, the colored race group came about due to people having mixed children.

34
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:35,100
So the colored race group are people who have or are mixed with a white parent and an African parent.

35
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:42,620
Now the government in South Africa wanted to ensure that all race groups were separated in South Africa.

36
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:48,830
So they had a challenged with mixed race people because they were neither white and they were neither African.

37
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:57,680
Then they made for them a whole new category of race, which is the colored so-called colored race group in South Africa.

38
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:04,520
So when I referred to the colored race group, this is what I'm referring to in terms of South Africa.

39
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:10,010
And for us in South Africa, this is just a normal term that is used every day.

40
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:16,400
Then lastly, we have the African Race Group and these are people of African descent.

41
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:21,500
On the left hand, right hand side, we can see the picture here,

42
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:28,360
the black and whites of the hands with two placards which has the whites and non-whites.

43
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:37,190
So the main two separation of races in South Africa was between whites and non-whites.

44
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:41,950
So this is why the challenge of using the word black in South Africa,

45
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:47,980
because during apartheid the word black referred to all the people who are nonwhite.

46
00:09:48,550 --> 00:10:00,209
So that is why now it is more commonly. Used more commonly used the word African now to differentiate between these

47
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:05,250
nonwhite race groups and African for the people who are of African descent.

48
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:14,290
So now to I'm going to give you a brief history about the apartheid era in South Africa.

49
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:20,270
It is important for a person to know about the apartheid era in South Africa.

50
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:22,540
When you are studying anything about Africa,

51
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:31,930
because what happened during the apartheid era had a very lasting effect on South Africa and how it is shaped today.

52
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:38,770
So we see the various and the various photo signs that were up during the time.

53
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:47,320
In the top left corner, we have the picture of two African gentlemen where there's a sign of being caution.

54
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:57,310
Beware of natives. You also have a sign on the top right hand corner, which is indicating that this part of the beach is a white area.

55
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:02,800
Then there's also an example of how facilities, public facilities, were separated.

56
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:13,480
In the bottom left hand corner, where you see two sets of stairs where we have the Europeans would only be using one set of

57
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:18,760
stairs and non-Europeans could not use the same stairs they had their own stairs to use.

58
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:35,030
So apartheid or partners is a system of legislation that came into effect in South Africa in 1948 when the National Party gained power.

59
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:41,630
So this National Party believed in the ideology that great groups needed to be separated,

60
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:46,730
and so they put in place policies to ensure that that happened.

61
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:53,640
They separated people according to different living areas.

62
00:11:54,090 --> 00:12:01,290
So there were white areas of residence and nonwhite areas of residence or the nonwhite areas of residence.

63
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:08,940
They created these sort of independent areas which they called homelands or Bantustans.

64
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:18,320
In this image we can see. The different Bantustans which were created in South Africa.

65
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:22,030
There was ten of them and the Bantustans as well.

66
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:31,930
It was mainly the people of African descent who lived in the Manchu stands who are also separated according to the tribal groupings,

67
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:41,350
which also helped the National Party to control the nonwhite population, which was actually the majority compared to the white population,

68
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:49,209
by separating them so that they could believe that they could only have power within their own tribal

69
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:57,430
grouping and they could not come together as the whole African race group to overthrow the white government.

70
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:05,800
As I say that the picture that was in a few slides before this,

71
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:16,090
there were separate public facilities to use for the different race groups and they also implemented a system of separate education.

72
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:25,290
And for the African Race Group, there was a specific education which was called Bantu education, and this education was very quick.

73
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:33,190
It was also given to the African Race Group in the Afrikaans language, which is another country that they do not understand.

74
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:41,150
And this was justified in the sense that people of African descent were only meant for labor.

75
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:48,910
So the government argued that they did not need education anyway because other occupations were not for them.

76
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:56,660
So in 1991, most of the legislation that provided the basis for apartheid was repealed.

77
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:02,000
And in 1994, South Africa had their first democratic election.

78
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:13,340
So apartheid lasted almost 50 years and the policies of apartheid have had a great effect on the

79
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:20,660
country and continue to have an effect on how the different race groups are in the country.

80
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:27,600
So now in post-apartheid South Africa, as I said,

81
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:34,140
apartheid has been abolished and every citizen in the country, regardless of race group, is said to be free.

82
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:39,540
But as I said, that the effects of apartheid are long lasting.

83
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:47,310
We can see on the right hand side with see the media population estimates of the South African population.

84
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:52,710
You can see here that the African race group is the majority of the estimated

85
00:14:53,040 --> 00:15:02,640
49 million and the colored race group is the smallest in and about 330,000.

86
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:09,480
But if we look to the left, we can see that in terms of poverty,

87
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,480
the African race group has the highest percentage of the population group who are living in poverty.

88
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:25,050
So this places a great strain on the government because the African race group is the largest race group in the country and they are the most poor.

89
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:34,079
So government needs to provide a great number of services for this population as compared to the other population,

90
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:39,780
such as the white Indian and colored, who may be able to afford other things for themselves.

91
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:48,559
So this is just a map of South Africa today where there are no more bantustans.

92
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,850
We just have the nine provinces in the country.

93
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:05,650
In terms of health care in South Africa, as I mentioned, that the poor majority is the one that is catered for by the government.

94
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:12,070
South Africa's health care is divided into two sectors. It is the private healthcare sector and the public.

95
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:18,880
The public healthcare sector caters for 80% of the 84% of the population.

96
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:24,040
While the private sector only caters for 16% of the population.

97
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:29,890
Access to the private sector. Is.

98
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:36,630
The barrier for accessing the private sector. Health care is financial constraints.

99
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:44,490
In South Africa, people join medical aids. Which I think is medical insurance in the United States.

100
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:52,500
Medical aid is very expensive. So if you cannot pay cash at the private institution and you do not have medical aid,

101
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:56,550
you will need to use the private I mean, the public healthcare sector.

102
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:02,460
And in this picture, you can see that the public healthcare sector is a very crowded.

103
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:14,510
In terms of mental health care in South Africa, mental health care has historically been neglected in the country.

104
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:18,950
And this is for all the risk groups, not only for the African race group.

105
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:26,000
Less than 5% of the national health budget is allocated for mental health in South Africa.

106
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:39,020
But in terms of the ratio from health care provider to patient, the is approximately one psychiatrist per 300,000 people in South Africa,

107
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:45,890
which is different as in the U.S. there's approximately ten psychiatrists per 100,000 people.

108
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:51,530
In terms of psychologist, there's about one psychologist per 100,000 people.

109
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:58,130
And the U.S. is said to have approximately 29 psychologists, 400,000 people.

110
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:06,560
And in South Africa, only one in ten South Africans with a mental health disorder has access to treatment.

111
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:18,550
So here we have some results from the Global Burden of Disease study from 2019.

112
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:27,160
I just included a chance for you to see that South Africa does have a high burden of disease from mental disorders,

113
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:31,030
which you can see in the bottom left hand corner.

114
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:37,270
We have depression, schizophrenia and other mental health disorders.

115
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:45,910
Bipolar disorder, conduct disorder, anxiety and mental health disorders are the third leading cause of disability in South Africa.

116
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:53,860
But I'd also like you to take note of the communicable diseases which are prevalent in South Africa.

117
00:18:54,430 --> 00:19:02,800
So we have here HIV. I'm sure many of you are aware that South Africa has a high prevalence of HIV.

118
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:08,200
And this is a challenge when we are also looking at mental health disorders,

119
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:16,360
because most people who have mental health disorders have other co-morbidities which need to be considered as well.

120
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:27,470
So in terms of mental health care in South Africa, the mental health care is divided into three levels.

121
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:37,670
The primary level is the first point of contact in the health care system for a South African citizen or a person who is in South Africa.

122
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:41,750
So these would be primary health care clinics.

123
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:48,230
So a person would attend the closest primary health care clinic according to where they live.

124
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:55,850
And there they will be assessed by mainly nursing staff and general medical practitioners.

125
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:03,520
But they are also primary health care facilities which do not have any doctor there.

126
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:11,330
Then if a person the problem that the people see in the primary health care facility seems severe,

127
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:20,210
the person will then be referred to the secondary or tertiary level care where they will have accurate diagnosis made.

128
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:27,290
And in the secondary and tertiary level, acute management is given to patients.

129
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:41,120
Then once a person has gone to if they are if they are referred to a secondary or tertiary level care after the diagnosis or condition is managed,

130
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:47,210
they will then be returned to primary level for the management of the condition.

131
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:55,660
So in the primary health care facility, they will go there to be monitored and to collect the medication,

132
00:20:56,210 --> 00:21:06,750
depending if they fetch at weekly or monthly. This is an image of a primary health care facility in South Africa.

133
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:09,930
This is an image of an average primary health care facility.

134
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:19,110
And this is an everyday occurrence, these large queues of people who need to access primary health care facilities.

135
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:27,430
So given the large numbers who attend like this every day, this increases the risk of people defaulting.

136
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:34,810
As I've said that a person who has a mental health disorder, who perhaps has been to secondary or tertiary level care,

137
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:40,090
is then referred back to primary health care for the management of their condition.

138
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:47,319
And people may default from their treatment because when they are faced with these kind of queues,

139
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:56,530
when they get to the primary health care facility, most people do not want to wait 12 hours in order to get their medication.

140
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:04,000
So this is also a problem in terms of getting better mental health outcomes in South Africa.

141
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:16,450
In the second level of health care bill here we find some specialist doctors who can attend to patients.

142
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:22,900
And at this level of care, we can have inpatient and outpatient services.

143
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:33,850
So by law, this is where people should be admitted for as long as they need to be if they are having a severe mental health condition.

144
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:43,719
But the truth is, these health care facilities are under resourced and most of the time only 72 hour

145
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:48,910
care is provided to people suffering from different mental health disorders.

146
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:56,060
So this is also another challenge in terms of trying to improve the mental health outcomes in South Africa.

147
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:06,569
At the tertiary level. This is where severe cases are referred and these are specialized facilities where we

148
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:13,260
have specialists who are on hand to care for people as these are specialized facilities.

149
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:14,910
There are very few of them.

150
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:25,140
And with the increasing need of mental health services in South Africa, there's not enough facilities to service the South African population.

151
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:36,530
And as I mentioned, the challenges with a patient going back to primary health care and the long queues that I showed you in that image.

152
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:43,310
Patients are frequently readmitted after they receive care at the primary level.

153
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:52,730
So this once again is emphasizing the point that I'm saying that South Africans are poorly serviced in terms of mental health

154
00:23:52,760 --> 00:24:02,810
care and lots of people actually do not receive the treatment which will help them to either be cured or manage the condition.

155
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:13,020
Another important point that we need to consider when you look at South Africa is the role of traditional medicine.

156
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:17,370
Lots of South Africans consult traditional healers.

157
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:22,320
Most of the people who consult traditional healers are of the African Race Group.

158
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:32,760
But as time has gone on, other race groups in South Africa also consult traditional healers and African traditional health.

159
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,730
Good health includes both mental health.

160
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:42,300
Both includes mental, physical, spiritual and emotional equilibrium.

161
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:48,600
So mental health is not a foreign concept under African traditional health,

162
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:59,400
as African health believes that a person needs to have this equilibrium in the whole body.

163
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:06,270
And when a person has poor health, this is a sign that there is an imbalance in that person.

164
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:12,360
So the different rituals that are performed under traditional medicine are said

165
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:20,190
to aid in ensuring that the person gets the balance that they need once again.

166
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:31,000
And then they are said to be in good health. There is a challenge in trying to integrate traditional medicine and Western medicine

167
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:39,220
because unfortunately practitioners of Western medicine looked down on traditional medicine.

168
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:48,490
And this is a challenge because now people do not admit to consulting traditional healers when they do consult Western medicine.

169
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:57,010
And so people might be having medication that has been given to them by traditional healer,

170
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:02,830
which they take alongside other prescribed with wisdom and medication.

171
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,950
And this can have some fatal outcomes.

172
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:15,280
There is a move now to try to integrate traditional medicine and Western medicine so that it can work alongside each other.

173
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:20,020
But this is still, still an infancy in South Africa.

174
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:27,460
And so these are still the continued challenge of people consulting both traditional and Western medicine,

175
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:31,600
but hiding it from both sides of the medicine.

176
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,200
And also Amy looked at traditional medicine in South Africa.

177
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:44,500
We must also consider the traditional beliefs that people may have in South Africa.

178
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:53,200
And this is quite significant when we look at one of the mental disorders such as schizophrenia.

179
00:26:53,830 --> 00:27:02,590
So schizophrenia is a serious and chronic mental illness which impairs a person's thoughts behavior.

180
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:07,690
And if it is left untreated, it can include psychosis.

181
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:17,080
One of the most common symptoms of schizophrenia is that a person will have hallucinations and report that they are hearing voices.

182
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:32,340
Now in South Africa. Hearing voices for many African traditional groupings is part of ancestral calling.

183
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:37,979
So to become a traditional healer. You need to have a calling.

184
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:43,800
You do not choose to just become a traditional healer. Such as choosing to study medicine or western medicine.

185
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:53,370
In the African traditional tradition, you receive an ancestral calling which calls you into being a traditional healer.

186
00:27:54,920 --> 00:28:00,770
And when you receive this country's ancestral calling, it is said that your ancestors talked to you.

187
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:09,020
So this is a challenge when people present at health care facilities, Western health care facilities,

188
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:13,950
because they may be diagnosed with having schizophrenia in that facility.

189
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:21,860
But if they are in their traditional home and the family takes them to a traditional healer,

190
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:27,349
the traditional healer would diagnose that person as having an ancestral

191
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:33,350
calling of which the treatment there is to go into a period of apprenticeship,

192
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:42,830
which is to say this is the word that I have. This this is an apprenticeship that a person enters and an experienced traditional healer.

193
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:57,050
So these are one of the challenges we have in addressing different mental health disorders, as we cannot say here which diagnosis is correct.

194
00:28:57,410 --> 00:29:06,050
Is it the Western diagnosis of schizophrenia or the traditional diagnosis of an ancestral calling?

195
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:15,320
So one of the barriers in health care in South Africa is language.

196
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:25,940
South Africa has 11 official languages, but the African languages are largely overlooked.

197
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:32,390
And within the health care system, the health care system is largely monolingual.

198
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:43,850
And English is the language that is most used because most of the health care practitioners who work in the South African population speak English.

199
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:48,320
And this is a challenge with any health can condition.

200
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:55,399
But I would argue that it's more so challenging in terms of mental health because people have

201
00:29:55,400 --> 00:30:01,790
great difficulty explaining symptoms of any mental health challenges that they may have.

202
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:07,970
And if your practitioner that you're talking to does not speak the language that you speak.

203
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:17,569
This becomes even more difficult. So this situation means that the autonomy of the patient is compromised because

204
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:22,280
the patient cannot communicate directly with the health care providers.

205
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:27,110
In this case, interpreters are used,

206
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:37,010
and I use the term interpreter loosely here because there is actually not a system of professional interpreters who work in health care facilities.

207
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:43,700
An interpreter could be a nurse who is working within the facility,

208
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,910
a cleaner who is working within the facility, a security guard who's working within the facility.

209
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:56,660
So it would just be any person that they can get at that moment who speaks the language that the patient speaks,

210
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:00,260
who comes in to interpret for the patient.

211
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:07,460
So here we have the challenge of the interpreters, command of the English language themselves.

212
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:17,420
And because these interpreters would most likely be when we look at an African patient of African descent themselves,

213
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:23,930
there's also a bias that comes into their because the interpreter themselves has certain beliefs,

214
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:28,940
as I stated about the traditional beliefs about mental health that they.

215
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:37,980
Then influence how they interpret what the patient is saying to the health care provider.

216
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:46,969
So just to end this lecture about mental health in South Africa,

217
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:54,200
I would like to tell you about one of the tragedies that have happened in South Africa very recently.

218
00:31:55,070 --> 00:32:01,190
And this tragedy highlighted how mental health care is overlooked in South Africa and

219
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:10,010
how sufferers of mental health are treated as second class citizens within the country.

220
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:18,200
So as I mentioned, the challenges with providing services, especially inpatient services,

221
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:27,080
to mental health patients in South Africa, the halting provincial government accounting is a province in South Africa,

222
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:29,660
which has been like a state in the United States,

223
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:39,620
had a private public partnership with Life Esidimeni The Life Health Care Group is a private health trade group.

224
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:47,540
So in this agreement, patients who are under the care of the public, provincial government,

225
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:55,670
mental health care patients were sent to life equity, many to get inpatient care.

226
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:03,170
So these are people who have severe mental health conditions who are no longer able to take care of themselves.

227
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:09,590
So they were sent to life esidimeni and they were housed there and given care.

228
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:26,659
But from late October 2015 to about March 2016, a 101,711 mentally ill patients, including about 200 youth, were moved out of life.

229
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:31,580
Esidimeni. In the current court cases that are going on,

230
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:41,960
the halting provincial government has not provided a good reason as to why these patients were moved out of the life esidimeni facility.

231
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:47,600
The patients were moved into facilities which were not suitable for their care.

232
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:52,820
Most of these facilities were non-governmental organizations,

233
00:33:53,600 --> 00:34:04,310
and some of these non-governmental organizations were organizations which normally housed children and adults.

234
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:07,940
Mentally ill patients were sent to these facilities,

235
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:16,969
and we had adult patients who were forced to be sleeping in cots in these NGOs that they were sent to,

236
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:21,620
because these NGOs were not designed to cater for these patients.

237
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:29,350
So patients and families, human rights were violated during this period.

238
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:35,349
Patients did not have a say whether they were moved out of life.

239
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:44,410
Esidimeni and the families of the patients, if they tried to query this, they were also not given any answers.

240
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:50,800
And many families did not know where the family members had been moved to.

241
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:58,210
So the problems that we encountered was that the mentally ill patients were sent to places which had overcrowding,

242
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:02,770
poor hygiene, low quality or insufficient food.

243
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:09,730
There was lack of qualified staff to nurse the mentally ill patients,

244
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:17,140
and they even had a lack of access to the medicines that they required to manage their mental health disorders.

245
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:25,130
So the tragedy of life esidimeni is that 144 patients.

246
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:32,200
These are mentally ill patients died. And to date, the government cannot account for 44 patients.

247
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:37,750
So there are many families who do not know where their loved ones ended up.

248
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:46,150
And even with regards to the deaths. Many families spent months looking for their loved ones,

249
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:54,160
only to find out that they had actually passed away in these non suitable facilities that they had been put into by the.

250
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:15,709
He said that this life esidimeni tragedy is this is a harrowing account of the death,

251
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:25,490
torture and disappearance of utterly vulnerable mental health care users in the care of an admittedly delinquent provincial government.

252
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:37,780
So now I will share. A brief presentation on research that I am conducting.

253
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:44,450
So my research is focused on depression and my research.

254
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:50,620
The title here is Depression Literacy in a Zulu Speaking Population of South Africa.

255
00:36:55,650 --> 00:37:05,250
So one in three in South Africans are asked to develop a mental disorder in their lifetime.

256
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:15,750
And in terms of depression, it is estimated that 20% of South Africans will develop a depressive disorder at least once in their lifetime.

257
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:20,729
And research has shown that persons of the African race group have a higher

258
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:26,190
probability of developing depression as compared to other race groups in South Africa.

259
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:31,850
Depression is associated with significant morbidity,

260
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:37,860
as depression is a severe mood disorder where sufferers may experience periods

261
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:43,020
of sadness and loneliness and may lose interest in their daily activities,

262
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:52,530
which hinders their quality of life and poor mental health outcomes are further compounded by poverty and mental health services.

263
00:37:52,950 --> 00:38:01,710
As I explained in the lecture about mental health in South Africa, I'm sure you have an idea of the challenges that are present in South Africa.

264
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:08,460
So there is a large group and a large gap between those individuals who require treatment

265
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:13,830
and those individuals who actually seek treatment for depression in South Africa.

266
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:25,520
So one of the barriers to better mental health outcomes is said to be poor mental health literacy.

267
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:33,629
So when we look at the relationship between literacy and health outcomes, we see that in the literature.

268
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:42,900
It is well documented that those individuals who are literate have better health outcomes when compared to individuals who are illiterate.

269
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:52,360
In this table, I am giving you the some results on literacy in South Africa.

270
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:05,550
And I want to highlight again that the African Race Group, even looking at this, as I said, that had poor educational outcomes in terms of literacy.

271
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,710
The African Race Group has the highest share of the population who are illiterate,

272
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:17,790
which further challenges them in obtaining good mental health literacy.

273
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:27,230
So the interest in the relationship between health and literacy led to the development of the concept of health literacy,

274
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:35,300
which is the ability to obtain and translate knowledge for the improvement of health and from the domain of health literacy.

275
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:45,500
The concept of mental health literacy was developed because it was said that mental health was a neglected health condition.

276
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:48,950
So mental health literacy is the beliefs, knowledge,

277
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:58,000
beliefs and knowledge that facilitate recognition management or prevention of mental disorders or psychological distress.

278
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:02,500
And health literacy and mental health literacy.

279
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:10,810
It is also said that people have a right to access information in a language that they understand.

280
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:20,079
So this is why I too have chosen to focus on the isizulu speaking population of South Africa because of the diversity of the South

281
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:28,780
African population that we need to investigate the different language groups because many people in South Africa do not speak English.

282
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:37,090
Therefore, in health information which is given in English, is not useful for them because they cannot understand that information.

283
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:48,710
So the objective of this study is to investigate the level of depression literacy in a rural, isizulu speaking population within South Africa.

284
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:57,900
The methods that were used in the study. 24 semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted.

285
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:03,570
The inclusion criteria for the respondents for the study were that they had to be.

286
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:11,520
If he is going to speaking South Africans in the African race group, there had to be a resident of the municipality,

287
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:19,080
which was my study area, and they could be male and females 18 years and above.

288
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:27,510
And the sample was taken from the general population. The sampling method that was used was opportunistic and noble sampling.

289
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:43,710
The sample for the study is very small and this study is being used to prompt further investigation and research into this topic.

290
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:54,380
So the study area is under the municipality data is one of the rural areas in South Africa.

291
00:41:55,410 --> 00:42:00,330
It has a very it doesn't have a large population estimated at about 140,000.

292
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:06,690
This area has high rates of poverty. As you can see here, there's a high unemployment rate.

293
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:16,350
And in terms of schooling, we can see that a lot of people actually do not receive schooling, higher education.

294
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:27,270
So they may have some primary education and other facilities or services such as water and electricity.

295
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:37,530
A large part of this population in actually do not have access to such services, which are considered to be basic needs.

296
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:49,430
In this study, a vignette style interview was conducted, and a vignette is a short story about a hypothetical person.

297
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:53,660
The vignette, this one was two vignettes that we used in the study.

298
00:42:54,020 --> 00:43:02,030
These conformed to the diagnosis of depression as given in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders.

299
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:05,120
Version five on the screen here.

300
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:10,760
This is the first vignette which is depicting mild depression.

301
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:19,250
And so this very vignette reads that everything is getting on top of Max, who feels like escaping from it all.

302
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:24,110
They seem to be many problems study, work, relationships and family.

303
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:28,760
Max is desperate to do well, but can't concentrate on anything anymore.

304
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:35,930
Max lays awake at night worrying about things and when morning comes, feels unable to face the day.

305
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:41,620
The second vignette is for severe depression.

306
00:43:42,310 --> 00:43:47,799
And so under this vignette, it reads, everything seems hopeless and bad goes constant.

307
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:51,010
Evil makes us mind and slows things down.

308
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:55,990
Even things that used to make Max happy don't anymore.

309
00:43:56,830 --> 00:44:03,130
Max is scared because sometimes things feel so bad that life seems not worth living.

310
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:11,620
So after respondent is read this vignette, they are then asked if they were Max.

311
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:15,760
What would they think, if anything at all is wrong with is wrong with them?

312
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:27,510
I will now share your findings from the study and the identification of depression from the vignette.

313
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:34,830
There was a very poor identification of depression from the vignettes as they were presented to the respondents.

314
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,149
For the mild depression vignette,

315
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:47,540
10% of the male respondents and 10% of the female respondents identified depression and the severe depression vignette.

316
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:57,890
None of the male respondents identified depression and 10% of the female respondents identified depression from the story in the vignette.

317
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:05,810
So there was a lot of missed recognition of the problem depicted in the vignette.

318
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:13,520
The majority of the respondents stated that the person in the vignette was suffering from stress.

319
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:21,170
They felt that the person was experiencing a temporary period of stress which would soon pass.

320
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:27,200
The respondents felt that the person in the vignette was not suffering from an illness

321
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:32,450
because they felt that an illness is something that you see physically in a person's body,

322
00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:40,850
so that this was just a period in a person's life whether we are experiencing some difficulty or stress.

323
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:44,329
But it was not something that would last a long time,

324
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:52,550
as most respondents felt that this period of stress that the person was suffering from could last a maximum of two weeks.

325
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:59,510
Under the knowledge of risk factors and causes,

326
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:07,579
the respondents felt that the primary cause of what I stated were depression or the primary cause of the

327
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:14,750
problem that was depicted in the vignette was that the person in the vignette was not sharing their problems.

328
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:21,170
They felt that people who do not share their problems become more isolated from

329
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:26,810
their friends and family and that they end up spending lots of time alone,

330
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:33,100
whether it be in their room, at home or even outside in public.

331
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:42,470
They do not mix with people. So they felt that if persons spoke about their problems, then they would not experience the problem,

332
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:46,880
such as the one that was being experienced by the person in the vignette.

333
00:46:50,270 --> 00:46:53,600
Continuing on the knowledge of risk factors and causes.

334
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:55,819
The Participant Well,

335
00:46:55,820 --> 00:47:04,220
most of the respondents felt that there was equal risk for males and females to experience what the person in the vignette was experiencing.

336
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:14,240
Female respondents said that it was most likely to be a female who experienced the problem as the problem as the person in the vignette,

337
00:47:14,570 --> 00:47:25,550
because they felt that females were overemotional and they were the ones who are most likely to not speak about their problems.

338
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:31,970
The male respondents felt that it was more likely to be males to exploit who experienced the problem.

339
00:47:32,690 --> 00:47:40,550
Same problem as the person in the vignette because they felt that men had pressure to not show their emotions.

340
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:49,040
And some of the male respondents themselves stated that they felt pressure about being an ideal man in society.

341
00:47:49,370 --> 00:47:56,690
And an ideal man, they said, was a man who was always strong and a man who did not show any weakness.

342
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:04,710
And the knowledge of help seeking options and treatments available.

343
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:14,370
Many respondents indicated that they had a trust in formal sources of help, which would be a psychologist or a therapist.

344
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:19,620
So the respondents mentioned these words in English psychologist and therapist,

345
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:25,350
but they did not have a clear understanding of what exactly a psychologist was or a therapist was,

346
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:34,860
and what type of service these healthcare providers gave to a person who went for help.

347
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:39,870
In those in those formal sources of help.

348
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:46,440
There was also a challenge about the lack of knowledge of how to access formal help.

349
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:56,100
And this was very significant for the people in the rural area because many stated that they did not know any place within where they reside,

350
00:48:56,310 --> 00:49:01,680
where they can go to get help or where they can go to get more information.

351
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:06,720
And many of them stated that they felt that government needed to do more,

352
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:15,780
as they felt it was the responsibility of government to ensure that all citizens had access to information that they need to improve their lives.

353
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:24,070
And the skills to support others affected by mental health problems.

354
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:31,299
All the respondents stated that they were willing to be a friend or a neighbor to a person who was having

355
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:38,950
the same type of problem as the person in the vignette and they place a high value in social support.

356
00:49:39,490 --> 00:49:45,700
The respondent stated that if they saw a friend and they thought that the friend was having some sort of difficulty,

357
00:49:46,210 --> 00:49:54,310
they would ask the friend about that problem and offer any help in terms of neighbors.

358
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:59,950
The respondents did not have a problem living next door to a person who might be having thoughts and challenges.

359
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:04,840
But in terms of a neighbor, they said that they would not approach the neighbor first.

360
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:12,940
Rather, they would wait until a neighbor asked help from them and then they will be willing to step in.

361
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:19,240
So this is important in considering stigma that surrounds mental illness.

362
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:22,990
But the study was focused on depression,

363
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:28,840
and most studies have indicated that most people there's not a high level of stigma

364
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:34,120
for depression when compared to other mental disorders such as schizophrenia.

365
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:49,750
So to conclude, the main findings from the study was that most of the respondents conceptualized the problem as being stress related.

366
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:53,960
Therefore, they look conceptualized it as being psychosocial.

367
00:50:54,960 --> 00:51:01,690
But most of the respondents stated that a solution to these problems would be talking.

368
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:11,050
They felt that if people talked about their problems, then they would avoid running into the challenges as depicted in the vignette.

369
00:51:12,010 --> 00:51:16,030
And the findings of the study indicate that there is substantial room for

370
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:21,790
improvement in the area of depression literacy in the South African population.

371
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:32,590
And for future study. The two points that I have identified at this present moment that require further study

372
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:40,960
is to do a further in-depth study as to why the identification of depression was so low.

373
00:51:41,710 --> 00:51:47,740
And this may help us to understand whether the tool, the tools such as the one are used,

374
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:56,650
are appropriate for talking about depression for these different groupings in the South African population.

375
00:51:58,050 --> 00:52:05,550
The second point of future study is to look further into the gender difference in the perceived risk of depression.

376
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:16,240
Health research has said that males are more likely to not consult health care if they are experiencing a problem.

377
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:27,730
But some of the responses from the male respondents in my study seem to be coming to a point where males are more open to sharing their difficulties.

378
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:34,510
So it would be good to do some further study on this point so that we can see if we can develop

379
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:41,410
as a more suitable strategies to tackle mental health disorders in the South African population.

380
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:48,930
Thank you very much. That is all. In my presentation.

381
00:52:49,830 --> 00:52:53,490
I will now open up time for any questions that.

382
00:52:54,760 --> 00:53:00,320
Individuals may have. Awesome.

383
00:53:00,330 --> 00:53:04,230
Thank you for the presentation. It was really wonderful seeing a research.

384
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:10,140
I'll kick it off with a question, but it's still free to think about questions that you have them.

385
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:14,370
And I hope they're all right, my honor. It's a little bit spotty,

386
00:53:14,370 --> 00:53:22,550
but did you see any evidence and like the research that you were doing for your own research project

387
00:53:22,650 --> 00:53:30,510
of these gender differences and perceived mental health in other contexts outside of South Africa?

388
00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:40,230
So I found it interesting that you said both men and women thought that depression was more common among their oldest gender group.

389
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:44,520
But they also had some different opinions of like, what does it look like?

390
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:48,150
And why do men have problems talking about their feelings?

391
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:52,350
And you see evidence of that taking place in other countries for contacts.

392
00:53:55,140 --> 00:54:01,570
Then you. Is it best to just answer the questions as they come?

393
00:54:02,350 --> 00:54:08,820
That'd be best. Okay. So for this question, no.

394
00:54:08,830 --> 00:54:16,000
In other research, I have not seen that coming out a lot.

395
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:24,910
I must mention as well that this might be challenged in the way that maybe they presented the vignettes,

396
00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:29,950
because in the Isizulu language, there's actually no word for he or she.

397
00:54:31,270 --> 00:54:41,050
Everyone, when you're speaking, it's vague. So when I translated the vignettes into Isizulu, I also used a unisex name.

398
00:54:42,610 --> 00:54:50,590
So that's the participants. So it's not clear. When I presented the vignette whether the person in the beginning it was a male or female.

399
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:56,050
So that is just one point that I had wanted to look at. I have not seen it in other places.

400
00:54:56,350 --> 00:55:05,350
So that might also be limited by. The name of the person in other places, like dead people.

401
00:55:05,350 --> 00:55:09,640
My English speaking people might assume that mix is male.

402
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:18,220
So yeah, I thought it would be a very interesting point to investigate in my study.

403
00:55:19,270 --> 00:55:21,910
But yeah, I have not seen it elsewhere,

404
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:33,070
but I would be interested for other people to maybe try the same technique that I used in other contexts to see what responses they will get.

405
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:42,690
I don't know if I can see all the participants. Any questions?

406
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:57,450
I don't know. Can you see anyone? I can't see all the participants.

407
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:19,440
I'm not seeing any race scams, but. Okay. I last one.

408
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:24,759
But people are thinking I was thinking about how you had mentioned at the very beginning of

409
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:29,350
your thought how the the use of the word colored in South Africa at the race descriptor,

410
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:31,990
which might not be used in other contexts.

411
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:39,460
If you're looking at comparisons with other countries, does that impact your ability to analyze data at all?

412
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:44,290
Like, if you were to look at data from the United States, for example, it would it would say black,

413
00:56:44,290 --> 00:56:49,780
but it wouldn't necessarily distinguish between African or mixed race.

414
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:56,260
Does that present challenges for your research when different countries use different racial descriptors?

415
00:56:59,630 --> 00:57:01,640
From the research that I have,

416
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:15,980
I have seen I do not think so because the different race groups are highlighted and it is at work needs to be explained and in terms of.

417
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:21,920
Comparisons. This would bring about challenges.

418
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:31,640
And as you're saying, that the colored race group in South Africa is very separate and we do not have it in other in other places.

419
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:37,070
But in studies, I think that I have not done a comparative study myself,

420
00:57:37,730 --> 00:57:45,379
but I have seen studies where they have just used all the different race groups and

421
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:50,540
just highlighted that there are some differences between the two areas of study.

422
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:14,410
Any other questions from my boss? We'll get to them.

423
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:24,980
Join in the chat. Yeah. Okay. Do providers use the DSM five as their guidelines, or are there another set of diagnostic guidelines?

424
00:58:27,050 --> 00:58:34,100
Yes, in South Africa, the DSM five is used, but there has been some research.

425
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:46,130
It's still been used at the moment, but some research has been coming out that the DSM five A may not be the most suitable to use

426
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:52,310
in the various South African populations in terms of diagnosing mental health disorders.

427
00:58:52,940 --> 00:59:02,000
But at the moment, it's currently being used, but there is an argument that it is is actually not effective for some groupings in the country.

428
00:59:10,110 --> 00:59:19,370
And anyone else. All right.

429
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:24,040
I do know a number of people are in their cars today, have been looking for the break.

430
00:59:24,050 --> 00:59:31,080
So that might make it a little bit harder to find your friends. I'll hang around for just a minute if you'd like to as well, Ali.

431
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:36,260
And that you can all probably give the time today, get out a little bit earlier.

432
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:41,190
And I hope you all do great things for the. Okay.

433
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:45,680
Some. There's more in the chat. Okay. Okay.

434
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:49,880
Thank you very much, everyone. A great opportunity to present.

435
00:59:53,310 --> 00:59:56,550
Thank you. It was very informative. We really appreciate you coming in today.

436
00:59:57,990 --> 01:00:07,700
Thank you. All right.

437
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:11,550
And ruined like that? Yeah.

438
01:00:11,990 --> 01:00:15,440
Done that, literally. Okay.

439
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:19,400
Thank you so much for coming to us today. Well, thanks for having me.

440
01:00:19,790 --> 01:00:24,570
Thanks. I'll have a nice break.

441
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:30,400
And you, too. Thank you. Thank you.

442
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:31,450
Bye bye.
