00:00:10,179 --> 00:00:12,597
Hi, this is Matt Zawistowski.

2
00:00:12,597 --> 00:00:17,596
In this lecture we're going to extend
the ideas from linear mixed effect models

3
00:00:17,596 --> 00:00:22,593
to additional types of data in which the
outcome might not be a continuous normal

4
00:00:22,593 --> 00:00:24,920
random variable.

5
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,596
To this point, we've always assumed
that the repeated measure outcomes

6
00:00:28,596 --> 00:00:32,936
collected during the longitudinal study
were approximately normally distributed.

7
00:00:32,936 --> 00:00:37,764
There are many other data types that
exist, and longitudinal studies routinely

8
00:00:37,764 --> 00:00:43,070
collect repeated outcomes that
might be count data or binary.

9
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:47,493
Imagine a study designed to compare
the effectiveness of various treatments to

10
00:00:47,493 --> 00:00:49,850
reduce epileptic seizures.

11
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:54,509
This study might randomize epileptic
patients to different treatment arms and

12
00:00:54,509 --> 00:00:59,520
record the number of seizures each
patient has per week for several weeks.

13
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,000
Here the outcome is number of seizures
per week, which is a count variable.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,273
And when we consider
variability between subjects,

15
00:01:08,273 --> 00:01:13,085
some patients will likely just have more
or less weekly seizures than others.

16
00:01:13,085 --> 00:01:17,306
Meaning that the number of seizures within
a subject are positively correlated

17
00:01:17,306 --> 00:01:18,920
measurements.

18
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,984
So how can we model correlated data
when the outcome is count data,

19
00:01:22,984 --> 00:01:25,680
like number of seizures?

20
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,702
Generalized linear models or
GLMs provide a robust framework for

21
00:01:29,702 --> 00:01:34,810
regression modeling of various
different types of outcome variables.

22
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:39,174
Normally distributed outcomes are handled
by standard linear regression.

23
00:01:39,174 --> 00:01:42,684
But other common models
are the logistic and Poisson models,

24
00:01:42,684 --> 00:01:47,120
designed for binary and
count data respectively.

25
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:51,593
A GLM contains a link function on the left
side of the equation that connects

26
00:01:51,593 --> 00:01:56,990
the expected value of the outcome to
the linear regression on the right side.

27
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:01,880
GLMs assume that the outcomes
are independent, which would no longer be

28
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,380
the case for repeated measure data,
that should sound familiar.

29
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:09,800
To account for correlation among outcomes,

30
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:16,160
GLMs have been extended to generalized
linear mixed models or GLMMs.

31
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,137
Starting with the existing form
of the GLM, the GLMM adds random

32
00:02:21,137 --> 00:02:25,939
effect terms to model
subject-specific regression lines.

33
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:29,764
And we make similar assumptions regarding
the distributions of the random

34
00:02:29,764 --> 00:02:31,960
effect terms.

35
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,236
For normally distributed outcomes,

36
00:02:34,236 --> 00:02:38,514
the GLMM is just the same mixed model
we have already been dealing with.

37
00:02:38,514 --> 00:02:41,296
It specifies a population
regression line and

38
00:02:41,296 --> 00:02:46,930
subjects specific regression lines
that can vary in intercept and slope.

39
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:50,600
Let's think about how random effect
terms would affect the popular logistic

40
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,670
regression model.

41
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:56,730
Recall that logistic regression is
used when the outcome is binary.

42
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:00,890
In a longitudinal study,
this might indicate the presence or

43
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:04,330
absence of an event or
specific symptom overtime.

44
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:07,287
The link function for
logistic regression is the logit,

45
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:11,440
which is the log of the odds for
the outcome of interest.

46
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,887
The fitted logistic regression model can
be used to compute a probability curve for

47
00:03:15,887 --> 00:03:19,330
the outcome based on the covariance.

48
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:24,057
To model repeated measure binary data,
we would add random effect terms to

49
00:03:24,057 --> 00:03:30,760
the standard logistic model to arrive
at the logistic mixed effect model.

50
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:35,662
The fixed effect terms define
a population probability curve, and

51
00:03:35,662 --> 00:03:41,003
the random effect terms define
subject-specific probability curves.

52
00:03:41,003 --> 00:03:45,041
This is analogous to the subject-specific
regression lines we have viewed for

53
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:49,450
mixed models with normally
distributed outcomes.

54
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:53,877
The interpretation of the beta parameters
is still the change in log odds for

55
00:03:53,877 --> 00:03:58,859
a one unit increase in the corresponding
covariate, holding all other parameters,

56
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:02,790
including the random effect terms fixed.

57
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:06,604
Inference on individual parameters
can be performed using hypothesis

58
00:04:06,604 --> 00:04:10,330
testing techniques we've discussed.

59
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:15,015
Extending the concept of mixed models
to generalized mixed models opens up

60
00:04:15,015 --> 00:04:18,287
an enormous field of
longitudinal study designs and

61
00:04:18,287 --> 00:04:22,400
outcomes that can now be
effectively analyzed.

62
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,311
We basically just combine the ideas
of repeated measure analysis

63
00:04:26,311 --> 00:04:31,016
with the theory of generalized regression
models for non-normal outcomes.

64
00:04:31,016 --> 00:04:34,119
The mixed models we've discussed
in this course are but

65
00:04:34,119 --> 00:04:39,232
one type of generalized
linear mixed model.
