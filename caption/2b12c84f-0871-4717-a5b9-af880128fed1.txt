1
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:08,910
This show.

2
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:33,480
All right, let's talk glasses. So I close the whole line with this one is the next topic.

3
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:41,430
Any questions people always got? All right.

4
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,680
So let's review what we talk about on Tuesday.

5
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:52,190
So until the day I learned a very important theorem, that is the factorization theorem.

6
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:58,010
So this zero is very useful for finding a sufficient statistic.

7
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,780
So let's look at the theorem. So.

8
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:16,070
So this theory is very useful in that it not not always help it to check to prove whether a statistic is sufficient or not.

9
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:21,050
Is it also help you to propose a sufficient statistic?

10
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:28,280
So the trick is that you need to look at the joint distribution of your entire sample.

11
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:40,250
So once you have your sample, you will have your model. Do you write down the your distribution and then you try to separate the X from your fantasy?

12
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:49,460
And at the end, so you try to centralize the distribution into two parts.

13
00:01:49,910 --> 00:02:00,620
The functions of each function. Each function in a function as they perform all the components to follow the evolving facts into this each function.

14
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:06,530
And for the other part, if you have a go and see that they can no longer be separated.

15
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,330
Now you need to put that into the G function and then you will notice that the G function.

16
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:22,470
So is it related to X throughout function x and this x in the also it could be that you cannot separate you add something up,

17
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:26,250
but in that case X would be assumed.

18
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:36,720
It can be a constant. So. So as long as you have far less natural phosphorylation and then you can conclude that t is sufficient.

19
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:51,170
And this is the most useful direction for us. And so, of course, if you have a statistic that you already know is sufficient, if at all,

20
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:57,770
you also know that in your life, your affects into such a formula and the disease,

21
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:12,980
the function if the function H as with these cells is also helping to check whether of code the system is sufficient or not.

22
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:27,890
So let's look at some examples. And so for on this example, it's feasible for the normal distribution.

23
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:32,140
So we know that actually the sufficient statistics are not unique.

24
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:37,370
But so for like for the same model, the same data, there could be different sufficient statistics.

25
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:46,580
And even for the same statistic, it could be that the different way is to factor the joint distribution.

26
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:53,330
So it's not unique. So for example, here, if you have no distribution, this a joint distribution of a normal.

27
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:56,570
So you work with this and you try from separate.

28
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,810
You can actually find the prime of the you and here.

29
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:06,169
So we see that this so the joint distribution camera are this and this part or depending on acts you know you

30
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:15,110
need of course these are the each function and this part depends on new dependent on the new and the x bar.

31
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:26,320
So an X cannot be separate from the. So you put that into the D function and you see that here the this function in relation to X through this X file.

32
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:32,360
So you know that you have you find the field X and the x the bottom and then you get a sufficient statistic.

33
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:38,040
And if you do not read X file, you stop it to x, then it is not going to excite.

34
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:43,700
So, you know, that's so subito. X is also sufficient statistic here.

35
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:48,169
So we show the different way and this way and a we showed the summation.

36
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:56,210
So here we find that h the G function as a function of the summit of X and also by the activation zero.

37
00:04:56,450 --> 00:05:03,890
So we know that it is sufficient. And also, we learned that that is quite a uniform distribution.

38
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,720
And we see that the maximum is the sufficient statistic here.

39
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:17,630
And I think that as in this example of a user using the function, so it is this is a very useful and convenient notation.

40
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:29,660
So, so always if I want to do operations, if the obvious are PDF or PMF, and if there are different scenarios, then it's easier to use this.

41
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:43,020
So that's the end of class.

42
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,040
We talked about another example that is a normal distribution.

43
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,720
In this example, we assume that both you and Steve must go.

44
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:53,540
No. So your pregnancy heart in two dimensional is increased?

45
00:05:53,540 --> 00:06:00,320
Both. You are a Sigma Square and we try to use the Federation zero to find this diffusion of statistic for theta.

46
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:08,390
And you our solution. We will see that all a sufficient statistic is also true dimension of income is equal to two part t one.

47
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:13,400
And he took that together. That's the fusion of you and sigma squared together.

48
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:20,210
So let's look at this example again. So what we did is we looked at joint distribution.

49
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:28,310
So this is your distribution. And so in this George is involved X Adamu and I use a trick.

50
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:38,870
So a minus X plus Xbox and the expand the split at all times, times this time and this time.

51
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:46,310
So as in fact this time we only related to a second Sigma split, and this time we are already related to New Sigma spin.

52
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:50,030
I can also put X for the Prime anymore. So I know that.

53
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,590
So I should put on both the for this part of this plot fold into the t function.

54
00:06:54,970 --> 00:07:01,370
And so what I did is I call this X bar as many events I causes component.

55
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:08,000
So this whole thing and the summation of squares, the whole thing as equal as if I defined up.

56
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:14,390
So this the two are equal, right? And then I just find that if I had a to the assumption.

57
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:20,510
So that is a constant bar and the t function is a function of 22 you and Sigma Square.

58
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:30,050
And this is how I would write. He wants me to. So then the confusion is that he is a two dimensional statistic.

59
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:36,380
This is a statistic, and together it is the fusion of full view and the sigma split.

60
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,960
Now, usually I get closer to this.

61
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:47,780
So some student of your ask me, does this mean the X bar is sufficient for you?

62
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:52,010
And the second component, he who is the fusion of Six Sigma is good.

63
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,900
And this means that it is correct statement.

64
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:11,320
So actually, from this example, all I can say is that he wanted to together there will be some fusion of four theta together.

65
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:15,920
Actually, I cannot conclude x bar is sufficient for me.

66
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,469
And the second component is sufficient for the sequence,

67
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:29,570
which is action happens in this example that well I define the equivalent because causes the crew as we actually show that if Sigma SCO is no action,

68
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:40,340
x bar is sufficient for me. And so suppose I saw the emu is the arm is null constant and then the not it who party is sufficient force.

69
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:48,650
It must be a it just happened this way. And actually here you cannot say that he is sufficient for me.

70
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:56,630
He who is the fusion of force, is it to get it, and thus the fusion of forcing the actually if I change the notation for example.

71
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:02,420
So if I instead add causes and my P tool.

72
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:14,240
So you start if I call this that my key tool and I call this as my t one and then so so then my, my conclusion would be so.

73
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:28,240
So these. And this is sufficient for you.

74
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:35,650
A sigma is good. And this actually is also correct statement, because together they would be sufficient for all of us once again.

75
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:39,640
And now I can see that, obviously. So this part.

76
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:45,640
So the first component is not sufficient for me because you know that this actually cannot tell you any information about me.

77
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:50,140
And the second the parts that expire, I say not sufficient. The Four Sigma script.

78
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,150
Because if you are, you know,

79
00:09:52,480 --> 00:10:02,620
the average tells you not nothing about the appearance that this is the correct statement together that will be sufficient for to see that together.

80
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:11,700
So here I'm just trying to say what I'm trying to say is you cannot say that each component is so fusion of for the,

81
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:17,500
for, for the, for the components data. So we can only live in together as a whole.

82
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:26,590
And so you just via I define this the transistor the T2 just because I know that's the expert and give me information about you.

83
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:32,500
And as this product give me you may have lost the last bit. So that's why you buy this additive and this altitude.

84
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:38,830
If you do that, other than if you call the second key to the first part, as you ask, that is also correct.

85
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:49,700
Questions. So let's continue.

86
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:54,920
So see, in my example so far.

87
00:10:55,430 --> 00:11:01,250
So even a prime goal in one dimension of my statistical one dimensional remember for example,

88
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:07,820
but primarily the p that is one dimensional and the sufficient statistically proposed information.

89
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:14,360
XA That is one dimensional. I think in this example you see that my friend, a two dimensional you have me,

90
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:23,060
you are a Sigma Square and my sufficient statistic and also two dimensional we have given neutral but this but

91
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:29,000
this does not mean the dimension of your sufficient statistics has to be equal to the dimension of your practice,

92
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:32,810
and it can be different. So let's look at this example.

93
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:39,640
So in this example. So in actually that means one president.

94
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:47,360
So the dimension of the to is one, but we need to our sufficient statistic has to be two dimensional.

95
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:56,540
So let's look at this example. So here we have data I.D. for uniform distribution fever and see the password.

96
00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:05,870
And if we try to find a sufficient statistical system now, I think it's very important to think about this intuitively.

97
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:09,470
Before you do the derivations, let's look at this.

98
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:14,570
So if you have data uniform from 0 to 0 plus one, what does this mean?

99
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:22,760
So this means that your sample, you observe the sample, the realization of the X should be between see the and I see that possible.

100
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:30,000
Right. So you have x, your x cannot be greater than C the plus about that and you x cannot be smaller than zero.

101
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:39,550
So which means that this tells you that. So even the smallest number, smallest x cannot be smaller than c.

102
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:45,380
This tell you the minimum number, the minimal value actually provides you with a positive.

103
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:49,760
And also, you know, even the maximum cannot be quoted as plus about that.

104
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:58,309
So this means if you have if you observe the maximum phase of the maximum, you cannot rule out some possibilities.

105
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:06,320
We'll see. So it'll tell you to know the minimum and the maximum can give you the information about C that becomes a positive in the minimum,

106
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,420
and maximum can at least give you a read to foresee the fact.

107
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:14,390
So before you do any derivations as well, that is what your intuition tells you.

108
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:20,360
Bananas check to find to see whether it makes sense or not.

109
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:31,430
So you'll also find sufficient statistic here by trying to use the facts which see urine and null, and it will work with the joint distribution.

110
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:36,020
And he will write down the joint distribution and if you know the laws of distribution.

111
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:47,450
Now this is a modern distribution. So if you have a uniform distribution, so this means that if your X in between C than zero plus by then the PDF,

112
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:53,410
if you go back, if you X is not within the range, that is not possible.

113
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:58,460
So the CDF is zero. So this is the usual way you write PDF.

114
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:04,520
But we said that because we we need to do operation on the PDF.

115
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:07,880
So if I write this is not mathematically convenient.

116
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:14,330
So now we know that a more convenient way to use indicate about it the pdf here.

117
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:20,960
So the tool statement here can be written in this one statement about when I use any kind of function.

118
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:25,610
So, so let's move this together.

119
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:35,420
So. So I know that I need to write down the joint distribution.

120
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:49,460
So this is the product I have from end to end.

121
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:56,630
He needs to function and that's why we designed this.

122
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:06,440
So this is a product to indicate a function. And on Tuesday, we talk about some properties for you to get a function, right?

123
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:11,329
Because in order for these to be what you order for, the product will be like this.

124
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:14,780
It means that all the component heads will be out. Right? So.

125
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:22,040
So we know that the product unique in the function can be written as a single unit, a function, and as a single unit and a function.

126
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:28,970
So if this is white, so this means all the X must be between C, you cannot see the plasma.

127
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:38,030
So this means that x one has to be here besides tooth and to be.

128
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:59,470
And I'm also XM. So now we try to find a good summary that you has because summarize the statement.

129
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:05,050
So this doesn't mean all of the facts. Guy has to be going to see that necesita plasma.

130
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:10,059
And you said I'll go to separate X for that as much as possible before.

131
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:14,260
This is all you can do, actually. Now, you already have a sufficient statistic.

132
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:18,700
So this is all I can simplify. I can not simplify this anymore.

133
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:22,230
I can make a statement about a sufficient sense of what it is.

134
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:27,700
Sufficient. At this point.

135
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:32,020
The statement you have is so right here.

136
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:43,959
So the statement that you have is an xx1x2x.

137
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:51,100
And so they say the t the key and dimension these in sufficient statistic for.

138
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:59,550
So of course, this is the correct statement and that's a useful statement, right?

139
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:03,560
Because he said your rigidity is sufficient as this is in the statement.

140
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:11,870
See that if you cannot simplify your distribution, the because you get a sufficient statistic that's not useful.

141
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:18,110
So, so here you have something that is not useful as it is a correct statement.

142
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:23,810
So if you do this actually, you know that you are g t, then this is your t function.

143
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:28,520
So the whole thing in the added function you are t in this n dimensional function.

144
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:38,720
And so it is truly a function. Of course, we don't want to stop here because we want to find some useful statistics.

145
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:46,160
So. So now. So we just need to, we just want to rewrite the indicator function in a different way.

146
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:54,910
So you all the X has big wait to see what are the equivalently just means that yeah.

147
00:17:54,950 --> 00:18:03,710
The minimum has to be greater than C. So. So even a minimum in the greater than C that would cause all the x must be quite something.

148
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,650
And then what is the second part of it?

149
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:21,350
So if all the x that had to be less than zero, another what bothers me is that so the maximum has to be less than the signal actually as simplified.

150
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:29,920
Now we should have your distribution, right? So and so now I'm down here actually.

151
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:34,520
But you can also read this in a slightly different way. So it is the same thing as that.

152
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:41,570
So these is less the minimum. And you can write this as a pointer to you to get the function.

153
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:48,740
So it does have.

154
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,600
So if I do this, then I need to be far on my h function.

155
00:18:53,630 --> 00:19:00,920
What is your h function? So I can't be Phi Phi Phi.

156
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:17,150
She has. He was a man and he truth the t man is the minimum and he truly is, Alexis.

157
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:24,210
So these are much more details here.

158
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:32,430
So this t is a T of X, so it's a function of X.

159
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:37,080
And the fourth component equal to the minimum second component, you go to the maximum,

160
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:54,239
the then the gt1 he to see her in equal to indicate her that's the t one indicate her t to let's see

161
00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:04,020
the plus one and a defined h function of your trivial constant function if you define this way.

162
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:21,480
And then so so these are the, this whole thing is equal to h time g.

163
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:38,610
He won x, t to X and C, and now you have the conclusion that so from here.

164
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:55,780
So we know that he. So the minimum and maximum is sufficient.

165
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:06,640
The testing or you'll see you'll see that in one dimensional statistical measures.

166
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:11,290
So now I have a double notation.

167
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:19,030
So actually they not it are not matter much whether here you the lower case or kept the case calculator

168
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:27,940
because all we care in what is a function t but because then it's better to use calculator here.

169
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:31,510
Statistic by definition is a function of the random variable.

170
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:36,720
So you make this conclusion here, they can use a calculator if they use all.

171
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:40,960
That is also okay because I know you understand the question.

172
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:47,740
But here, when you write at your distribution, this means that you wanted to use a Jordan commission in evaluating that.

173
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:52,350
And we are at 18 X. So this part is lowercase, right?

174
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:58,780
So which means that here you should also write this and use a lowercase and write up a song.

175
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:05,120
So some people are not so rigorous in terms of notation and not yet established as yet.

176
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:10,840
But if you want to use a rigorous notation, especially if you publish a paper in statistical journal.

177
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:15,640
So a substitute, you know, they're very rigorous. So you need to use the right notation.

178
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:24,850
So here so as I said, so if you don't know if you write lowercase, I mean, I think this is okay is bad as you have an idea here.

179
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:33,460
So this is a sufficient statistic for. I was born here.

180
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:37,150
So the point here is that the dimension of your statistic.

181
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:41,200
It may be different from the dimension of the crime to.

182
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:55,379
So you see here. So once we write a John division this way, actually we, we find this official statistic and this official statistic,

183
00:22:55,380 --> 00:23:04,110
the minimum order statistic and the maximum order statistic. This is a better sufficient statistic that the reason of how he.

184
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:08,790
Because here although that statement used correctly is not useful. It's not use what you call it.

185
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,820
You do not lose the information. It is sufficient.

186
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:17,820
But you didn't do a good job in terms of achieving the first goal, because we said we want it to be simple.

187
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:22,980
But now you see that for the same problem. There are many, many sufficient statistics.

188
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:26,490
And today they going to talk about what is a good sufficient statistic.

189
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:31,330
So obviously a sufficient statistic must be similar.

190
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:37,300
And we want to find the simplest sufficient statistic. That is what we are going to talk about next.

191
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,900
All right. So let's move on. Another example.

192
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:50,330
So in my example here we see that here I have a uniform distribution and I have a normal distribution.

193
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:58,240
You talk about baloney distribution, right? So you all of these models, as we call this parametric model, parametric model means it.

194
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:05,600
So the functional form so that the PDF will out the functional form is not fixed.

195
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:14,120
But the only I know is a parameter the primes in a finite dimension of the here the problem that you divide dimensional in a normal case,

196
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,750
the parameter in two dimensional. That's the assigned model.

197
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:22,790
We so you probably have a number of metrics that the amount per method actually

198
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:28,220
so model is very very big is could be and it could be any distribution.

199
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:33,590
So, so that is also a model. So in that in that case, based on the here,

200
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:40,160
here alone and so my data is Roseanne distribution the Islam prime can see that I do not give you the pragmatic.

201
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:46,740
Well I do not. I do not give you the form of the PDF.

202
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:53,300
So this is a much bigger model. I just say that the distribution, it may involve some premiere.

203
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:59,990
Sometimes you may even not realize this here. So just so my prime, the space is a function of space as.

204
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:04,939
But you don't have to understand this exactly.

205
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:08,960
But just know that's not the difference in my mother. So.

206
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:17,300
So you may saw a specific distribution or you may want to be flexible so the distribution could be any distribution as it is the distribution.

207
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:23,240
So here so I want to be flexible. So I just as soon as I have you want some distribution.

208
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:28,940
Now the in this case kind of still find a sufficient statistic that is simpler than the original data.

209
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:37,489
You see that I do not give you much information but and let's here we see that is

210
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:44,810
still possible for us to find a simple or a simpler summary for the for the data.

211
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:48,770
So here. So let's look at the your distribution.

212
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,490
So the joint distribution is a product of the matter distribution.

213
00:25:54,080 --> 00:26:04,710
And so the statement I'm trying to make is the order statistic is always also fusion of statistic for setup.

214
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:09,250
Regardless of the underlying model, you will have a noticeable shift.

215
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:19,190
It could have a uniform distribution or expenditure distribution as all the statistic is always sufficient and know what conditions, what conditions?

216
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:26,960
The order statistic is sufficient. You know this that you you already know this.

217
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,330
If I give you a data to do something paralyzes, right?

218
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:34,370
So I may have the occasion. ID You will have the sample I.D. if I use.

219
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:38,389
Okay, if we can produce it, it does not matter. As end user gets the same result.

220
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:42,200
It would not affect your analysis, but you all know this intuitively.

221
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:47,270
That is defined the one condition the data is IP that.

222
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:57,440
So if I have a longitudinal analysis, for example, if I measure people's blood pressure at day one day to day three.

223
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:06,650
So these kind of longitudinal data. So one thing like this is not ID because the so that is different.

224
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:11,120
So the blood pressure before you take treatment after treatment.

225
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:14,840
So you this kind of data is not I mean, how do you know that?

226
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:18,470
All the statistic is that if you just keep the order, you change the order.

227
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:21,349
Actually, you lose the information. Right. And you go to it.

228
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:26,810
You know, this that in the in that case, actually, you can the order statistic is no longer sufficient.

229
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:30,380
If you only if you change the order, you may change the information.

230
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:34,190
So here, when I say it all, the statistic is always the information.

231
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:38,990
It is under one condition. The data is the order does not matter.

232
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:47,950
The in this case, it's okay for you to do a publication of the data and you cannot enter your analysis without.

233
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:55,690
So let's look at this. So I think you have done order statistical in six or let's say the order statistic just

234
00:27:55,700 --> 00:28:02,839
are so after the minimum and maximum size order on the patient with the X and now so

235
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:15,649
Mickey of x is a vector so it has unknown component that he ran up to him and I want to

236
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:25,490
show it is sufficient so so for the program to that I just use the fluctuation serum.

237
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:32,689
So in fact, there is no theorem and he's look at the job distribution now, John.

238
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:37,880
Distribution is a product of the volume of his.

239
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:48,239
Okay. This is what I have the honor of.

240
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:54,510
Next. I you simplify this.

241
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:01,220
You don't even know the F. You don't know. You don't even know the function of all of that.

242
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:05,880
See, there's not much you can do. But you can still do something.

243
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:18,150
You know, if you have x, y, pons x two times x three is the same thing as x two times x seven times x is the same thing as x.

244
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:21,780
Three times x, two times x y. So the order of matter.

245
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:35,309
So this means that. So the product is the same as the product of this and that it is the same.

246
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:40,140
But if it doesn't, the product of this and host and this is the part of this.

247
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:49,840
But now all this and the order of the imagine the first, the minimum first and then the second the limit of the maximum, the last equal.

248
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:53,640
So long as I can do this, you have a factorization.

249
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:10,460
So here. I can't define what is an h x.

250
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:19,150
The Aztecs is a fact that you will be astonished to hear it over the weekend from Seattle.

251
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:39,440
So you take a true assumption and then D he acts as a so you find key of people back here and this is end dimensional the already defined here.

252
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:51,620
So these is equal to. So if you do this so, you know,

253
00:30:51,830 --> 00:31:20,510
that's that your distribution is equal to age function and the t function they are equal factorization zero so t of x and that is the order statistic.

254
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:36,830
It is sufficient and this tell you if you do the I.D., the order statistic is sufficient so you can upload the information.

255
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:43,430
If I just tell you the application of your original sample, not keep the original.

256
00:31:48,760 --> 00:32:00,400
So previously we said, if you have a statistic, if you define a statistic, you actually ify a partition of the original sample space.

257
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:08,410
But if you go to your original sample space equal all possible realization of your data and allows you to find a partition,

258
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:13,780
some elements double together into a subclass that's here.

259
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:16,510
You'll see that if I have no root, a data is n dimensional.

260
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:23,980
If you have the order statistic, it is also indicated that this mean the order statistic is not simpler than the original data.

261
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:31,350
What do you mean we achieved this reduction here? Or do you think yes or no?

262
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:38,220
How many? How many you think it's achieved in a reduction? No.

263
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:46,890
The thing in a nutshell, these are backchannels. So now let's go back to this example.

264
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:51,870
So it's often easier if you can see the a more concrete example.

265
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:01,740
So here. So you see that if I just tell it.

266
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:09,830
So here I have three data point. In the original sample space, there are eight elements that are eight possibilities.

267
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:18,250
But now you see that if I just tell an older statistic, if the other statistic is 001.

268
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:26,060
So if the audacity is here you are. What is the real money?

269
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:33,540
The realization? What is your sample? As I'm going to be 001, I can also be 010.

270
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:37,350
Right? I can also be 100. This is it.

271
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:41,850
And if I tell you in all the say in 011.

272
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:50,620
It's actually all of these three elements can be I give you the same horror statistic.

273
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:56,830
You see that in this binary example, the order statistic gave you the same information as a summation.

274
00:33:57,310 --> 00:34:01,840
Then of course, in either reduction you see that.

275
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:11,350
So even though so in this example, actually the summation and also the order statistic.

276
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:18,160
So in this particular case, sometimes we actually like they give you the same information in the most efficient it does,

277
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:33,370
the actual form may be different. So actually order statistic achieve the reduction it doesn't see that because in fact so in our

278
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:38,739
reason sample that these possibilities even now if I tell you the order statistic so so you

279
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:44,630
do not know exactly what is are some that could be a more to a sample related because I can

280
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:52,600
give you the same or the statistic that is can give you a causal partition of the sample size.

281
00:34:55,540 --> 00:35:05,340
So actually a for the same and also so so the point I try to make is the actual form of the order, the actual form of the statistic.

282
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:12,070
It may not be that important. Actually, more or more important is one partition, if you why I say that,

283
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:17,080
because here you see that for the normal distribution when a unit of the distribution,

284
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:23,290
if I tell you the summation or if I tell you the average are without sufficient and

285
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:27,729
actually they gave you almost exactly the same information once you know that summation,

286
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:34,810
you know the area you want, you know the error, you know the summation plus the actual statistics are different by summation by average.

287
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:40,380
But why I say that equivalent, because I give you the same partition, you see that?

288
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:46,630
So what's more important is not the actual form full the statistic, but more important is the partition.

289
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:50,350
How many element, what kind of elements are grouped together into one subclass?

290
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:58,230
So let's continue.

291
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:10,970
Okay. I think we finished on this note. A memo to the.

292
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:32,700
Okay. So now we want to move on to topic.

293
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:37,530
So actually I already mentioned the idea.

294
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:47,100
So you see that for the same model, the sufficient statistics are not unique, but because you know what a statistic is sufficient.

295
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:52,050
You also know the original data is sufficient in that although it is not very useful.

296
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:59,640
And also the mean and the summation of a case all for you, for all of the give you the same information.

297
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:07,740
So a sufficient statistic that you need an album of the song that I do is the not asking only, well,

298
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:16,830
what kind of because it is a matter of course you have before the sufficient statistics as that is simple.

299
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:22,350
If I can find the simplest sufficient statistic that is the best of it.

300
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:30,270
And that here. So the. So this concept is what we call the minimum sufficient statistic.

301
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:36,180
The minimum sufficient statistic. So, so this just summarize what I just said.

302
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,650
So sufficient statistic are not unique to said.

303
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:43,830
So if you define here X as x, so this you may give your original sample.

304
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:50,880
And of course, the sample that after all the information that and by definition is attributes of using the statistic.

305
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:57,210
And also we already show of your data in the I.D. then the order statistic is always sufficient.

306
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:05,460
And the also, if for any sufficient statistic, it's a 1 to 1 function is also sufficient.

307
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:10,900
So this what is the function? So.

308
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:26,760
So if I. So if you. So you have to pee in equal to teeth.

309
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:32,170
Is this about malfunction? This is not about about.

310
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:43,020
Right. Not one tool, but because you've you know, Putin equals 1at going to be around the neck vernacular rap.

311
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:52,430
So it's but if I say cute, he is equal to t three and then it is a lot of options here.

312
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:57,930
So y of a y is a if he is a feat, at least one more factor is also sufficient.

313
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:03,450
You know the basic give you the to say you committed the one where it was functional all in existence.

314
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:07,260
So knowing he will you know t knowing him you know.

315
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:15,240
So they give you that the the saying a monkey. So that's why is about one function is always is also sufficient statistic.

316
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:22,470
You can also prove this you talk about this later. Now I just know that intuitively this is sufficient and well,

317
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:32,459
the reason because you when you know how you know the other part so and so so because are many sufficient

318
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:37,380
statistic you go to find as the piece has statistic that achieved the maximum data reduction.

319
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:48,210
So that is the goal. So the how we can define this form, how because you find a minimal minimum sufficient statistical mathematically.

320
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:50,220
So here the definition of this.

321
00:39:50,640 --> 00:40:00,770
So a sufficient statistic, a0x is called a minimum sufficient a statistic if for any less sufficient statistic a t quite.

322
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:06,930
He is a functional p prime. So this is very abstract.

323
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:15,780
So we will see why this can give us a minimum sufficient statistic.

324
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:20,460
So first of all is a need to be sufficient.

325
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,570
So this is a condition to be a minimum sufficient statistic.

326
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:30,870
First of all, you need to make sure it is sufficient, given that if we are not sufficient, statistic of quality is not a minimum.

327
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:38,940
So that is one thing. And a sufficient citizen that not me that is achieve the maximum data reduction.

328
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:45,450
Right. So I want to find is not sufficient statistic such that is achieved maximum data reduction.

329
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:54,780
But here I how can I so how can I make sure it is and achieve the maximum reduction?

330
00:40:54,990 --> 00:41:03,030
So the idea is like this if you give me a sufficient statistic, if you find any sufficient statistic to t the t program,

331
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:14,250
any sufficient statistics, and if I can show you that my statistic t is as simple as I use that it is, it achieves a great idea reduction.

332
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:18,440
So this is the idea. So how can I make sure my statistic is simple to use?

333
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:23,980
How can I make sure t achieve a greater data reduction?

334
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,060
Now your t prime and this is by this.

335
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:36,540
If the t is a function of t prime as in to achieved greater data reduction.

336
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:42,270
So let's let's understand this.

337
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:48,570
And in order to understand this. So first of all, we need to understand what is the function.

338
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:55,040
So if he is a function of t prime and he must be simpler than these are.

339
00:41:58,170 --> 00:42:09,080
So what is the function? So what is it?

340
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:14,490
So. So say de is a function.

341
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:19,710
And so he is a function for the space.

342
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:24,530
R He wants to he too.

343
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:31,170
So in I think you learned this other your calculus class or you in the lab is in class.

344
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:37,859
So you know that if this. So there are many that could be my view from one space to another space.

345
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:43,950
But a not all matters of function function has to have such important property.

346
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:57,570
So if this is so, it is the function is for the x was equal to x to within the original space.

347
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:03,209
Then T of x on has would be equal to.

348
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:07,590
Geo. X to. And so that g g.

349
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:15,240
Excellent. Excellent, excellent. Must be. Belong to the space of people who matter from one space to another space.

350
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,710
So if x y is equal to x to the image, it has to be the same.

351
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:34,240
However, if they give you a set value, this does not mean that the bond has to be equal to X to that degree.

352
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:37,970
So suppose that if my g is x agree. Right?

353
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:45,100
And if you x minus equal to x two. Now, of course, x seven square has to be equal to x squared.

354
00:43:45,610 --> 00:43:50,980
However, if I tell you that.

355
00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:55,060
So if they give you the same value.

356
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:57,160
So if I tell you a taxpayer equal who left.

357
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:06,350
But so as you extend your neck to us all, this means that, wow, a neck to want to eliminate in a regional space,

358
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:15,410
the magnet into one element, another space that is even more the element map in tool line animate in a new space.

359
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:22,670
This means the new space has similar number of elements that you achieve greater data reduction.

360
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:33,470
And so how I can help understand this field before remember we talk about a statistic is a function of the original sample and the

361
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:44,660
statistic and ship data reduction because it's partitioning the original sample spaces into several sub spaces by grouping Simon together.

362
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:51,340
And so obviously once if you find a function of the original someone's space, your teams,

363
00:44:51,350 --> 00:45:00,110
they do it right so so when I say these without I don't mean is super well as simple as that because if I if

364
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:05,740
I define with who about it so you have X equals X of course it does not achieve a greater reduction in it.

365
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,900
So when I say achieve the introduction, I mean it's the simple as simple as the original.

366
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:19,399
So, so here you see that by the definition, the function so more any method can be marked into a single item.

367
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:27,890
And of course it's achieved greater detail. And so this just means that if you can show t of x is function t prime.

368
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:36,470
So this means that in the main element in the T private space there have equal element in the base, of course is T.

369
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:43,220
So I'm going to show a figure who has done this.

370
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:47,420
So, so let's look at this statement first.

371
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:54,469
So this just means so the sample space consist of any possible realization recipe.

372
00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:58,850
All right, talk about this. So your original sample space is all possible realization.

373
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:02,450
And whilst your creator statistics say P prime,

374
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:12,599
he prime must be a function of x and therefore is achievement the data reduction because if I so what's the p?

375
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:17,160
If this is a minimum sufficient to do that just mean is a t the finest occasionally.

376
00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:36,080
And so that's that's, you know.

377
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:39,770
So they say this is a reasonable date in some respects.

378
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:46,890
Should I use a supreme text to denote some space?

379
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:54,770
And so here each element is a possible localization example.

380
00:46:55,580 --> 00:47:00,040
So this element could be so this element could be 000.

381
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:03,540
And this element could be 010.

382
00:47:03,710 --> 00:47:09,530
So in so, you know, simple example, actually the someone said only conceive only equal to eight elements.

383
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:17,090
I will complicate the situation. You can you can imagine that many, many simple point.

384
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:24,130
So here this is a oh so so we say the sum of could actually give us the finest position.

385
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:38,810
So this is a the find is partitioned in a sense that each party includes a single element, a single a single realization of the data.

386
00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:44,340
And now so we have to do the key plot in a sufficient statistic, right?

387
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:50,420
So in my definition, so we assume the Tea Party, the sufficient statistic, what is the sufficient statistic?

388
00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:56,990
So if you have the two, the first is is a statistic that a citizen wants to be a function of the original sample state.

389
00:47:57,270 --> 00:48:06,919
So that means you, me and the so I partition so so I rule some of them together that so far.

390
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:12,740
So far so say. So all these elements are grouped together into one partition.

391
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:20,780
So. So pairs upon here have t one prime t2 one is really prime.

392
00:48:25,830 --> 00:48:35,760
So here. So I'll say so this is a P what is it, 82.

393
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:47,950
I mean, yeah, I think it's we may go back to our recent example, but not for the glory.

394
00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:55,060
For example, to talk to our people about understand what I mean here so that they have a faith element,

395
00:48:55,390 --> 00:49:02,430
some element that moves into AC or some other group have, but some moving on to.

396
00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:03,880
So yeah.

397
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:13,000
So here itself this is just a mean once you find that he prob actually saw the element of the group into one part so it can give you a partition,

398
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:21,670
right. And this partition this partition in coarser.

399
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,140
Then the original sunglasses,

400
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:43,969
because I realized what's amazing is each subset has seen a single element and now some of the elements are grouped together.

401
00:49:43,970 --> 00:49:51,560
So if you recall the partition and now what has been the definition, it says the key is a function of a T prime.

402
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:57,560
Now this means that I can also use our function here t the functionality.

403
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:05,780
What are this mean? So this means that. So some of it is ending in this example now for the who together set.

404
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:11,450
So. So these will give me say he wants me to and he is three.

405
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:23,820
So you see all these elements element into P1, this element in t two and these m into t three so that you see that this will be me.

406
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:32,930
The. The closest quotation.

407
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:42,650
Sample space. So based on this figure, they just said.

408
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:47,780
So the transit route, so that it does correspond to the pace of travel is up to you.

409
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:51,170
So for the group that all of these together, let's see that.

410
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:56,090
So of course a here is quite a course of that. So that's added in here.

411
00:50:56,360 --> 00:51:05,960
So. And so if my t is is a course of the annual that he plot of course give you the grade is a data reduction that.

412
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:14,600
And of course it's the. So it's the simplest but simply does not mean it is a minimal sufficient statistic that

413
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:22,190
because I'm not if I say humans equal to lack a constant is of course the simplest addition.

414
00:51:22,630 --> 00:51:26,060
That however is not made Muslim patients but in the way that.

415
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:35,390
So if I group all element together it regardless of what element is by sufficient by statistic involved.

416
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:47,000
So it means that I moved all that element together into a very close, the closest position who could achieve the greatest data reduction.

417
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:52,490
But you have to make sure it is high to be sufficient in the beginning.

418
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:59,600
So this means that among all the sufficient the statistic is giving you the course is condition that.

419
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:06,590
And if this is true, then you is a minimum sufficient. So you have to make sure it is sufficient for beginners.

420
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:12,590
And Omar, all the sufficient statistics will want to find the one that give you the greatest reduction.

421
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:24,277
So let me stop here. They come back at time to teach us.

422
00:52:26,555 --> 00:52:36,115
Like, let's continue the class. So you just talk about what is the minimum sufficient statistic.

423
00:52:36,625 --> 00:52:43,045
So there are two things we need to consider. First of all, the interest being a sufficient statistic.

424
00:52:43,315 --> 00:52:49,015
So. So the first is must be sufficient enough, a lot for sufficient statistics.

425
00:52:49,285 --> 00:52:59,125
I want to find at the bottom of give me the maximum data reduction, which means it's giving me the greatest summary because the simplest of all.

426
00:52:59,695 --> 00:53:08,875
So. So here are what I explain here is how to understand achieve greater detail, which is what I mean by it is the simplest of it.

427
00:53:09,295 --> 00:53:14,755
So basically. So for instance, this you need to understand what is the function.

428
00:53:15,355 --> 00:53:19,525
So the here has established a key poverty law function.

429
00:53:19,795 --> 00:53:25,255
So a factor is a bad king for one space without a space is a multi key prime

430
00:53:25,255 --> 00:53:32,575
is are knocking this space to another space and not all money is a function.

431
00:53:32,815 --> 00:53:43,615
So so is most of the element can be a map here and the here only correspond to what element of space then a gain of function.

432
00:53:44,215 --> 00:53:48,535
So by this definition, you will see that once you have defined.

433
00:53:48,565 --> 00:53:56,695
On the function. So this means the new space here now has less elements of the original space.

434
00:53:56,695 --> 00:53:59,845
But so here is a similar so.

435
00:54:00,055 --> 00:54:06,535
So because the modes were elements, they can be grouped together and give you the same images in a new space.

436
00:54:06,865 --> 00:54:12,295
So this is what I mean. It is that you need a reduction.

437
00:54:12,535 --> 00:54:21,185
So if you can see the original sample space. So we say that it is a fondest addition in the sense that every element is of classical.

438
00:54:21,655 --> 00:54:22,554
Any class can see.

439
00:54:22,555 --> 00:54:32,065
This can include a single element, an element that is a possible realization of your data and now lets you define a function that is in the partition.

440
00:54:32,065 --> 00:54:37,705
It give you a course of partition on the original sample because multiple realizations,

441
00:54:38,005 --> 00:54:41,665
multiple elements, they can be grouped together into one class.

442
00:54:42,595 --> 00:54:45,905
So now so t prime achieved data reduction.

443
00:54:46,055 --> 00:54:54,775
The original sample and also polity prior is sufficient and he is the piece if I can show the t is a formal is t prime.

444
00:54:54,775 --> 00:54:59,935
What does this mean? So this means that the t prime achieved for the data reduction.

445
00:55:00,115 --> 00:55:06,835
Now the t prime because the element in this space, the group together give you the final space here.

446
00:55:07,045 --> 00:55:13,255
So which means more element in which the space networks get the give you the same image T1, T2.

447
00:55:14,245 --> 00:55:23,724
So if you have a sufficient statistic let's give you the court is partition somehow all partition from sufficient statistics,

448
00:55:23,725 --> 00:55:29,725
then it is the minimum sufficient statistic. So that is how to understand the definition.

449
00:55:32,005 --> 00:55:39,885
So, so now so going back to the statement here, so maximum data reduction is achieved.

450
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:44,185
Let me say that the card inanity of the space T in the minimum.

451
00:55:44,305 --> 00:55:48,445
So this this grouping, the study actually is in the space here.

452
00:55:49,165 --> 00:55:57,085
So I call this the original space, some space in the script X and this some of space I call this is a space T prime

453
00:55:57,415 --> 00:56:03,645
and this space is swooped t so the cardinality just means the size of this.

454
00:56:03,835 --> 00:56:10,105
You are space. It was this is the minimum that you achieved the maximum data reduction.

455
00:56:10,675 --> 00:56:22,495
So if you do not understand the case, that is all if you if you just understand this that this picture is good enough.

456
00:56:24,305 --> 00:56:30,835
So this so this is how we define the minimum sufficient statistic for money.

457
00:56:31,975 --> 00:56:42,384
So however this definition or not until today is mixed sense is not very useful by that because

458
00:56:42,385 --> 00:56:46,795
if you want to use a definition to check whether something has to be the minimum or not,

459
00:56:47,935 --> 00:56:49,045
basically what do you need to do?

460
00:56:49,585 --> 00:56:58,075
You need to list all possible sufficient statistic and they show that you are sufficient statistic is a factor of all those sufficient statistics.

461
00:56:58,735 --> 00:57:13,635
So it is not possible in practice. So, so outside because here we have a situation, it helps us to check whether something is available,

462
00:57:13,645 --> 00:57:17,335
sufficient statistic without using the definition.

463
00:57:17,815 --> 00:57:29,214
So this is the zero 6 to 13 and this is a zero for funding or showing solid statistic.

464
00:57:29,215 --> 00:57:34,585
Is the minimum sufficient the statistic? So again.

465
00:57:35,065 --> 00:57:39,355
So first, we need to work with the joint distribution of the entire summit.

466
00:57:39,845 --> 00:57:43,705
This is your digital tie assemblies. Yeah, you invoke that idea.

467
00:57:44,695 --> 00:57:51,375
And so how do I do that? So?

468
00:57:51,895 --> 00:58:01,225
So suppose that exist a function of x such that for every to some important x on the wall.

469
00:58:02,785 --> 00:58:09,235
What an x on the bottom x out. How far is the sample point your original sample space.

470
00:58:10,185 --> 00:58:14,005
So. So for example, in a Billy example.

471
00:58:14,395 --> 00:58:26,415
Well I have a mass that is three. Right. So your x could it be for example, 000 in the vector your y would be 010.

472
00:58:26,425 --> 00:58:30,205
So just a sum applied in your original sample space.

473
00:58:30,685 --> 00:58:41,065
So if we some employed x and Y, even the ratio of pollution is a constant and a functional set up.

474
00:58:41,365 --> 00:58:48,445
If and only if x equals what he was then t in the minimum sufficient statistics here.

475
00:58:49,915 --> 00:58:56,155
Now this zero I found are students.

476
00:58:56,845 --> 00:58:59,905
How do I study this? So let's look at this.

477
00:59:00,625 --> 00:59:06,325
Look closely. So this theorist says this is the ratio in constant.

478
00:59:06,415 --> 00:59:12,205
So it doesn't mean even the ratio does not depend on see the imply p of x equal to

479
00:59:12,205 --> 00:59:19,795
divide and also in x equal to two you are imply the ratio does not depend on them.

480
00:59:20,125 --> 00:59:27,865
Then he is a medium sufficient. Sufficient then actually, although this is a one statement, it actually is has two conditions you need to check.

481
00:59:28,285 --> 00:59:40,525
So the first thing you need to check is that if t of x, so if t of acts equal to one, then this ratio must be a constant and a popular C.

482
00:59:41,605 --> 00:59:48,505
And the also, if this ratio is constant as a fantasy, have this must implied of x between people.

483
00:59:48,775 --> 00:59:54,295
You need to check two conditions. So. So here we need to check two conditions.

484
00:59:55,165 --> 01:00:09,745
And if tool conditions always hold, then you can claim perhaps it made him a sufficient and y this is the case.

485
01:00:10,555 --> 01:00:17,065
And then also sometimes people ask me if I applied this even when it was checked him x is sufficient or not.

486
01:00:18,295 --> 01:00:21,325
I don't think so.

487
01:00:21,485 --> 01:00:31,465
So. So you need to first have to access the feature and then apply this zero to check and between two and actually not necessary.

488
01:00:31,855 --> 01:00:36,995
So here we are in because so the first condition actually already issue are sufficient.

489
01:00:37,975 --> 01:00:41,175
So so this condition.

490
01:00:44,005 --> 01:00:49,105
So this condition ensure sufficiency.

491
01:00:49,465 --> 01:00:54,885
So you don't have to additionally check sufficiency because once you check the condition,

492
01:00:55,945 --> 01:01:08,574
find the sufficiency are already satisfied because this statement issue of sufficiency and I will show this later and that the second the

493
01:01:08,575 --> 01:01:19,555
condition here actually to ensure minimum so this second a condition here so this condition in function and this condition ensure greatest.

494
01:01:27,985 --> 01:01:35,665
Reduction. Therefore it is the minimum sufficient.

495
01:01:38,445 --> 01:01:43,605
So basically it doesn't mean if you want to use a zero to show that you're the minimize the official statistic,

496
01:01:43,905 --> 01:01:53,415
you need to check for conditions and you can have an conditions condition by actually telling you that a statistic that he is

497
01:01:53,535 --> 01:02:03,255
sufficient statistic and a condition to tell you that this statistic achieves some great having a reduction level together.

498
01:02:05,085 --> 01:02:09,705
After checking his two conditions. You can see all your facts in a minute with sufficient statistics.

499
01:02:13,075 --> 01:02:28,215
So let's. So yeah, actually not going to approve of this because it's very abstract food.

500
01:02:28,675 --> 01:02:35,485
So so not enough to apply to get this class. Let's talk about how to use it and also how to understand this intuitively.

501
01:02:35,935 --> 01:02:39,745
So. So how to understand the serum.

502
01:02:39,955 --> 01:02:47,845
So basically, remember we said as the minimum sufficient statistic give you the coarsest partition of the sum of space.

503
01:02:48,325 --> 01:02:50,095
COPD are not fluid inflammation.

504
01:02:51,925 --> 01:03:02,115
So and so this year in just says if you have find the partition like this or you can make it mean that you can define a function of x axis.

505
01:03:02,455 --> 01:03:05,315
And if you define that these are partition and the same,

506
01:03:05,725 --> 01:03:10,225
the current statistic corresponding to this population in the middle was in the minimum sufficient.

507
01:03:10,735 --> 01:03:16,705
So how do I define such a partition? So in your original sample space, there are many, many elements.

508
01:03:17,215 --> 01:03:24,595
Now, what I would do in at least I will put to some a point into the saying class.

509
01:03:28,075 --> 01:03:35,735
So this also means the statistic has the same function functionally that if and only if the ratio does not depend on them.

510
01:03:35,815 --> 01:03:39,325
So I get to some point X and Y and then check the ratio.

511
01:03:39,595 --> 01:03:44,125
And if the ratio of the two are disputed, then at the end of zero that adds more than together.

512
01:03:44,755 --> 01:03:51,585
I must put them together. And also if the ratio that not if the ratio of dependency,

513
01:03:52,035 --> 01:03:58,195
then I do not support to it if you do such procedure as and that you will arrive at partition.

514
01:03:58,335 --> 01:04:04,375
But we can say that these partition statistics can give you the same partition at least.

515
01:04:04,675 --> 01:04:10,505
This is a minimum sufficient statistic. Still, this sounds abstract.

516
01:04:10,835 --> 01:04:14,915
So that's why I said, let's look at this example to make it more concrete.

517
01:04:15,335 --> 01:04:20,885
So this is the example we have talked about many times. So here I have data from the distribution.

518
01:04:21,155 --> 01:04:27,365
The samples are in three. So here we know that in the original sample space, the eight element.

519
01:04:27,965 --> 01:04:32,675
So each element in its own class. And now I try to create a partition.

520
01:04:32,975 --> 01:04:41,565
And this partition it created like this. So I check every possible pair in the original sample space X on the block.

521
01:04:41,995 --> 01:04:46,805
And if the ratio is undisputed that our dependency held everything together.

522
01:04:47,195 --> 01:04:51,785
And only when this happens again. So.

523
01:04:52,785 --> 01:05:00,125
So here the question in the here you see is my first study in the of this it is a two dimensional statistic.

524
01:05:00,485 --> 01:05:07,295
The first dimension is X plus x two. And in the second the matter in x two, it is this is a sufficient statistic.

525
01:05:08,285 --> 01:05:12,635
And also another question in the summation made was sufficient to statistic.

526
01:05:13,325 --> 01:05:20,135
And the is the four is the two dimensional statistic of M.S. so isn't going to answer these questions.

527
01:05:21,515 --> 01:05:24,905
So let's look at this.

528
01:05:25,715 --> 01:05:30,035
So we think it is sufficient on that. What do you think?

529
01:05:31,175 --> 01:05:34,995
And this sufficient or not important?

530
01:05:36,365 --> 01:05:42,485
If I tell you the value of X one plus x two and I also tell you about x three, it is sufficient.

531
01:05:42,695 --> 01:05:55,005
You know the information about P. Because you already know x the one plus x two and plus x three is sufficient for that information.

532
01:05:55,545 --> 01:06:01,545
But here you see that if I give you this information, of course you can calculate x amount plus x21 actually.

533
01:06:01,545 --> 01:06:06,525
Right. So this means that this actually give you more information than a summation of x x.

534
01:06:06,525 --> 01:06:11,085
But even as I'm making X is already some reason, of course, is this give you more information.

535
01:06:11,115 --> 01:06:15,525
This must be sufficient until 2 p.m. so let's check that.

536
01:06:16,995 --> 01:06:20,475
So here, how does your listeners know? Official statistic.

537
01:06:20,835 --> 01:06:23,985
I look at so I use saturation zero.

538
01:06:24,765 --> 01:06:28,715
So I look at the job distribution. So this is the job distribution then?

539
01:06:30,765 --> 01:06:35,085
So so the job is which I try to fact try this it's on this mission.

540
01:06:35,355 --> 01:06:45,935
So what I did here is I define agent X and Y and I define on these as my t y function is a table.

541
01:06:46,635 --> 01:07:05,125
Is that equal to p1x and I define this admitted to this that you want to t let me use a different location

542
01:07:06,225 --> 01:07:16,275
prime because he defined are this component and that causes the material component and then you see that.

543
01:07:16,695 --> 01:07:22,105
So the joint distribution can be written as the G function and its H function.

544
01:07:22,155 --> 01:07:25,965
But so therefore this is a sufficient statistic.

545
01:07:26,145 --> 01:07:37,035
But. I think this is good for us and this is a straightforward abdication of the fact we see what's and this is sufficient.

546
01:07:37,335 --> 01:07:43,994
And intellectually, you know, this must be sufficient because for all this information, if I give you this information, of course,

547
01:07:43,995 --> 01:07:51,015
you can know what the summation of X plus x two plus x three that and therefore I'd be calling, you know, the summation of the patient.

548
01:07:51,015 --> 01:07:54,735
So therefore this must be sufficient information about people.

549
01:07:56,055 --> 01:07:59,205
So now in this matter, meeting the future statistics,

550
01:08:00,675 --> 01:08:09,645
if you look for the you also know is this is not meaningless official statistic because you cannot find a similar sufficient statistic.

551
01:08:10,185 --> 01:08:16,305
Previously we showed the summation of X II is sufficient therefore is cannot remain sufficient because this is

552
01:08:19,545 --> 01:08:28,275
so this is a a simple statistic is other them so here in this omit is this the minimum sufficient statistic?

553
01:08:31,525 --> 01:08:37,635
And of course, at this point we only have the year. So you want to show something?

554
01:08:37,645 --> 01:08:46,345
Is the minimum a sufficient statistic? I want to check that and even look at the ratio of the job distribution and to see

555
01:08:46,495 --> 01:08:51,575
when this ratio of you depend on P and whether this ratio does not depend on that.

556
01:08:52,115 --> 01:08:55,225
So I need to check two conditions. Let's do that.

557
01:08:56,845 --> 01:08:59,995
The privacy we already showed it is a sufficient statistic.

558
01:09:00,265 --> 01:09:07,195
Now I'm just trying to show it in the minimum sufficient statistic. So I'm trying to use the zero 6 to 13.

559
01:09:07,615 --> 01:09:12,974
So what I need to do is to look at the ratio that your distribution evaluated as one possible,

560
01:09:12,975 --> 01:09:16,645
as I'm employed and another possible output X on the back.

561
01:09:17,625 --> 01:09:22,765
So, so this is the job distribution. So the numerator in that you are distribution.

562
01:09:23,005 --> 01:09:31,525
Imagine if you add X and the denominator in a job distribution evaluated at y, i have these ratio.

563
01:09:32,125 --> 01:09:37,315
Now look at this situation. So I said I need to check two conditions.

564
01:09:41,765 --> 01:09:44,165
Now for his condition. Another check is.

565
01:09:44,905 --> 01:09:53,345
So let's go back now for condition know check is if he had asked people to queue up in the ratio that now dependency.

566
01:09:53,705 --> 01:10:01,174
So these are the conditions are in check. It is true that if he of x equals 40 by the ratio that not dependency.

567
01:10:01,175 --> 01:10:02,195
Yes, it is true.

568
01:10:02,675 --> 01:10:15,665
And here you see that if TMX sat here and he had x equals heart rate of x and that he by that you could do some actual that implies x equals y.

569
01:10:16,025 --> 01:10:25,745
So this view becomes p while minus p part of zero x and it becomes that.

570
01:10:26,165 --> 01:10:32,635
And of course, when he went when he he had this statistic, I call this T2.

571
01:10:32,915 --> 01:10:39,485
So when he went to see X equals look, he was then the ratio that I depend on.

572
01:10:39,875 --> 01:10:43,345
So this condition mine holds back.

573
01:10:43,415 --> 01:10:48,695
So I already check conditional. Right. And also that's August.

574
01:10:48,695 --> 01:10:49,595
Look at the condition.

575
01:10:50,225 --> 01:10:59,635
So another condition you check is that if the ratio in constant and the functions keep see us, then he of x has to equal to heal.

576
01:10:59,645 --> 01:11:02,705
But I want to check whether this condition holds or not.

577
01:11:03,335 --> 01:11:14,255
And as some countries now see that this ratio is the P like all of our minus P power of something like this.

578
01:11:14,525 --> 01:11:24,445
So of course quantity function depend that unless this part in the know we.

579
01:11:24,785 --> 01:11:36,814
So this means only once the sum all of this is zero zero only only one summit of x even or something.

580
01:11:36,815 --> 01:11:41,935
So what then then the ratio of it the head of Trump's.

581
01:11:42,365 --> 01:11:51,575
So therefore condition two also holds. Therefore using this zero, I know the some major x is a minimum sufficient statistic.

582
01:11:55,665 --> 01:12:01,144
Now so this is an application of the theorem.

583
01:12:01,145 --> 01:12:07,445
We just learn. And then. Now let's go back here. Now is the first statistic I proposed earlier.

584
01:12:07,445 --> 01:12:11,765
A minimum sufficient statistic you showed. It is sufficient is this minimum.

585
01:12:12,365 --> 01:12:15,605
And the telling me, you know, it cannot be a minimum.

586
01:12:16,385 --> 01:12:22,985
Right. Because that is another statistic that is most important is this cannot be a minimum sufficient statistic.

587
01:12:23,645 --> 01:12:27,365
Then can we use, as you and for sure is not a minimum sufficient statistic.

588
01:12:29,075 --> 01:12:33,725
So let's move. So why is enough? Minimum is already sufficient.

589
01:12:34,325 --> 01:12:38,835
So actually you can share capital round holes. I can do to arm holes.

590
01:12:38,895 --> 01:12:45,214
So. So because I said the condition after issue of sufficiency so that I can be I hope that can be done through that.

591
01:12:45,215 --> 01:12:48,725
I hope so.

592
01:12:49,895 --> 01:12:57,145
So let's look at the ratio that your distribution to these in the ratio is your distribution divide between an X and Y and not.

593
01:12:58,565 --> 01:13:04,205
So I call the force component as one and I call the segment component as to.

594
01:13:04,595 --> 01:13:11,225
So you see that so is no.

595
01:13:14,195 --> 01:13:18,305
So here he is.

596
01:13:19,685 --> 01:13:29,205
He he wants x equal to ty5.

597
01:13:30,935 --> 01:13:35,015
So what about that ratio? The reason actually.

598
01:13:35,315 --> 01:13:36,845
So good to see.

599
01:13:37,175 --> 01:13:48,015
So then if to exclude Q one by so this means and so these total equal to the subtracts equal to a s along by and as to ask you to do x to.

600
01:13:48,395 --> 01:13:51,545
So this becomes the this pie becomes your right.

601
01:13:51,785 --> 01:13:59,804
And then the ratio that now depend on. You pan.

602
01:13:59,805 --> 01:14:13,605
All right. So so this maze and condition while holes and these are one of an arbitrary sufficiency is true.

603
01:14:14,085 --> 01:14:21,225
And if you already check this he was in fact written zoo so probably not about efficiency now probably in about a minute efficiency.

604
01:14:21,555 --> 01:14:33,225
So if they will minimize the efficient so these are that means that the ratio they not depend on P has to imply you are that you could hold

605
01:14:33,585 --> 01:14:47,775
up as this actually is not a not whole so the really because I always I don't need x Y plus x tool you might add x equal to as y y as to us,

606
01:14:48,255 --> 01:14:51,945
but I don't need x y and that's equal to s moment.

607
01:14:52,965 --> 01:15:01,845
You see that. So it just means of equal to be that x one plus x two is not equal to a y lamppost by two.

608
01:15:02,295 --> 01:15:03,215
And that's amazing.

609
01:15:03,215 --> 01:15:13,815
It is along the summation of the three and as always the summation of the x x x 12 x three other than the ratio of we are not dependent.

610
01:15:14,235 --> 01:15:22,365
So this means in the ratio that now depends on p that not imply that he want x equal to keep

611
01:15:22,365 --> 01:15:32,895
our so so therefore condition two does not hold now for it had not minimum so for example.

612
01:15:36,075 --> 01:15:47,525
So if you have an element 001 and.

613
01:15:51,245 --> 01:15:56,915
And 100. So I see that in this case.

614
01:15:56,945 --> 01:16:01,595
If so, if I call this an X, and if I call these and my wife.

615
01:16:01,925 --> 01:16:09,095
So you see that if you evaluate the ratio of the distribution as this particular act and this particular what,

616
01:16:09,425 --> 01:16:12,635
the ratio actually is a constant and not a penalty.

617
01:16:12,955 --> 01:16:19,265
However, in this particular case, x, y plus x two is now equal to Y one plus.

618
01:16:19,775 --> 01:16:23,045
But there's a provision to that is not.

619
01:16:32,015 --> 01:16:35,915
Okay. So so this is. So this actually is a true example.

620
01:16:36,215 --> 01:16:41,165
It's a simple example of I have this example here is actually you can see the partition.

621
01:16:41,585 --> 01:16:44,975
So why? Because you just it's a very simple example.

622
01:16:45,335 --> 01:16:50,495
So let's look at this. So you'll see that this is my original sample space.

623
01:16:51,185 --> 01:16:52,775
So in these simple examples,

624
01:16:52,805 --> 01:17:00,425
the reasons I'm a space contaminate element is that eight possible realization of the data that each end of it is own class.

625
01:17:00,665 --> 01:17:14,794
Therefore if give you the final partition now Kiran so this is a statistic and we should all be is sufficient that so I assume

626
01:17:14,795 --> 01:17:22,325
you find a statistic accurate in partition of the original sample space into some sense so it moves that element together.

627
01:17:22,565 --> 01:17:32,585
So if this partition you see that the first class contains a single element and in a second a class contains this, this and this element.

628
01:17:32,975 --> 01:17:40,095
And now here we see that these two elements level together because these give you a10 class.

629
01:17:40,115 --> 01:17:46,955
I give you one as you say. So if I tell you that here in one zero, you may not know whether it has this element or this element.

630
01:17:47,315 --> 01:17:50,435
And also these two elements are now grouped together.

631
01:17:51,665 --> 01:17:56,525
So these actually achieve the data reduction they give you, of course, the partition.

632
01:17:58,535 --> 01:18:04,215
And the also it is sufficient is me that I believe these are sufficient statistics for Allah.

633
01:18:04,865 --> 01:18:06,865
It are not to give you the course this position.

634
01:18:06,875 --> 01:18:20,705
Now you see that if I be found statistically true here now key to actually is a map from this base to another space but so it is it's actually even

635
01:18:20,705 --> 01:18:39,305
closer than this here because now in a for the pooled are these three elements again so this means is also pooled is also put on these elements again.

636
01:18:44,545 --> 01:18:46,465
You also put these elements together.

637
01:18:46,765 --> 01:19:03,925
So now you see he is actually I found some Cuba because T tools act in equal to and equal to this component class of this component.

638
01:19:04,375 --> 01:19:14,705
So it is a function. The functions of p1s.

639
01:19:18,425 --> 01:19:22,355
So you might know. Traitor here I use x S1 as tools.

640
01:19:22,595 --> 01:19:28,865
So it is as vance x plus as tool x.

641
01:19:30,725 --> 01:19:37,985
So now you see that I created a close causal partitions on this partition and the recall is also sufficient that they must be minimal sufficient.

642
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:44,545
Now going back to my algorithm here, so here I said so if I want to create a minimal partition,

643
01:19:44,555 --> 01:19:52,705
what I need to do is and even put two elements into a same class if and only if the ratio electronics boot and are not dependency.

644
01:19:53,195 --> 01:19:57,005
So basically, what are you doing? So look at this eight element.

645
01:19:57,185 --> 01:20:02,555
So I look at the first elements, second element, a check, and the drug is the ratio joint division.

646
01:20:02,945 --> 01:20:06,635
And if the joint ratio, Johnny Boot and that all depend on a group of them together.

647
01:20:06,845 --> 01:20:12,605
Otherwise I do not authenticate. And then we see that if I consider the ratio the first element, a segment element.

648
01:20:13,745 --> 01:20:23,535
Now the measure depend on P. Now they're going to do an open up and really pack nation that the rate of

649
01:20:23,535 --> 01:20:28,445
dependency so between according to your algorithm you should not authenticate.

650
01:20:28,905 --> 01:20:33,545
So so see here. So the first element should not be connected to the second element.

651
01:20:34,385 --> 01:20:39,155
And now if you then say, if I trigger the second element, the third element,

652
01:20:39,275 --> 01:20:45,095
who had information with you on his vision you'll find that they are ratio's idea because it's gonna depend on people.

653
01:20:45,425 --> 01:20:52,605
So according to all evidence we'll find in the meeting with the fusion certificate, you should move the together you mask again.

654
01:20:52,925 --> 01:20:58,325
So you see that they're also here for this one is not a minimum sufficient statistic, you call it.

655
01:20:58,595 --> 01:21:01,325
So if you look at, I don't know, two, two, one, two, three,

656
01:21:01,595 --> 01:21:06,935
and then you check the ratio actually that now depend on people, so which means they should be grouped together.

657
01:21:07,135 --> 01:21:11,105
But there is this provision that they are not good together.

658
01:21:11,465 --> 01:21:15,725
So this mean is is actually does not give you the maximum distinction.

659
01:21:16,145 --> 01:21:23,915
Therefore, although it is sufficient, you're not minimum sufficient because you shoot a group with these elements together with this element.

660
01:21:24,305 --> 01:21:27,575
So basically you just said that you look at every possible pair,

661
01:21:27,905 --> 01:21:35,315
you are origin of someone's face to check the ratio on his vision even admitted that I depend on you.

662
01:21:35,615 --> 01:21:40,505
You have to go with. And even though the ratio we can depend on him.

663
01:21:40,925 --> 01:21:52,795
You must love. You cannot go since again. And if you do that by the veto, a sufficient citizen of a call, this is the same you do in your mind.

664
01:21:53,005 --> 01:21:58,765
You ought to understand. Understand that you can never do this in, but you solve a problem.

665
01:22:05,285 --> 01:22:12,874
So Silas said, So this is just this algorithm is something you think about this know how the

666
01:22:12,875 --> 01:22:18,665
maximum politician achieves that you will not do that in you solve a problem.

667
01:22:19,235 --> 01:22:24,245
Solve a problem. If I want to use the zero 6 to 13 to solve a problem, I do that.

668
01:22:25,055 --> 01:22:29,645
So here I give you some background. The knowledge will show you if and only if.

669
01:22:30,245 --> 01:22:38,165
So. Remember, if you look at this zero in your view, this is what you need to show that eve.

670
01:22:38,165 --> 01:22:44,824
An only evil statement is it doesn't mean you need to show two conditions that the whole part of that and of course you need to use

671
01:22:44,825 --> 01:22:55,745
all your mathematical techniques you learned to show this person here the same type of knowledge if you can use to solve problems.

672
01:22:58,355 --> 01:23:10,385
So so assume ABC be able to operate under that constant and now the first condition you can use.

673
01:23:10,835 --> 01:23:19,825
So all this knowledge you can just sides in that you need you don't need to absorb it so so eve a time see her mankind.

674
01:23:20,135 --> 01:23:23,155
You see that policy equals your enemies see?

675
01:23:23,185 --> 01:23:29,995
Huh? That is means that a must be you to be equal with you.

676
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:41,735
And this is the use of this statement equals zero eve, and only if you would be perceived as you so are by this in the case.

677
01:23:43,085 --> 01:23:56,435
So. So let's let's check that.

678
01:23:56,455 --> 01:24:04,675
I would not call them a statement here. That's a. I'm going to show some of them by the season.

679
01:24:05,035 --> 01:24:09,445
This is true. So. So the first statement.

680
01:24:12,425 --> 01:24:29,975
So think so because this place you has zero class B zero plus C info zero has to be true for any c so so a msa c equal to zero.

681
01:24:30,155 --> 01:24:36,165
If you don't even know what others mean then this doesn't mean a c even with you.

682
01:24:36,335 --> 01:24:42,935
Right. So if you plan plus if you plan B and C that you already are here, the C and this just means C has to be zero.

683
01:24:43,505 --> 01:24:51,695
And now you plug in the equal for violence on the C, equal to negative one.

684
01:24:52,145 --> 01:24:59,675
So if you see how it would do Y, you plug into that because a minus b c is already zero.

685
01:24:59,675 --> 01:25:02,975
So I all this has to be zero, right?

686
01:25:03,815 --> 01:25:11,615
And you can see that you go to negative one. It just means that is a plus minus be high to be zero.

687
01:25:11,975 --> 01:25:18,875
And you saw this equation that this means it has to be zero, B has to be.

688
01:25:20,045 --> 01:25:21,905
So this direction is easy to check.

689
01:25:22,175 --> 01:25:30,005
Now we check that it was this statement, if this equation is equal to zero and see that it doesn't mean that F has to be zero.

690
01:25:30,215 --> 01:25:34,205
He has to be zero zero. So you have to review the whole direction.

691
01:25:34,385 --> 01:25:37,865
Easy to show you for ABC equals zero of course. Is this.

692
01:25:39,375 --> 01:25:50,885
You can show that direction. So this doesn't mean that the statement in in sure if and only if ABC of you so so you don't have to show this anymore.

693
01:25:51,155 --> 01:25:59,045
And as directly and indirectly I apply the size of the the result here.

694
01:25:59,705 --> 01:26:05,645
So let's look at the second result we can use.

695
01:26:05,975 --> 01:26:10,355
So here I have a1a to think.

696
01:26:10,805 --> 01:26:15,305
So if a summation over a one click of a,

697
01:26:15,305 --> 01:26:28,235
I can see them equal C for any C that this means a has to all that constant here Avon A to make a C has to be zero.

698
01:26:29,915 --> 01:26:33,425
So so if these are zero,

699
01:26:33,425 --> 01:26:39,935
of course this whole so all the drugs so this direction of easy is b so you just in the other direction is a more complicated.

700
01:26:40,145 --> 01:26:57,685
So how do I show that? So. So so basically here you yeah.

701
01:26:57,785 --> 01:27:02,035
Have just so many equations because you can probably see how you go the Y here.

702
01:27:02,165 --> 01:27:09,925
So now you go to here, you get many, many equations and you saw the equator in the ocean and all these, all these are coefficient.

703
01:27:09,925 --> 01:27:14,245
How do you come with you. So I, then I'll show that this, that you have,

704
01:27:16,585 --> 01:27:24,775
you can do that on your own and in the third without we can use is and if a time

705
01:27:24,775 --> 01:27:33,625
see the one plus e times you will see 040 see the pool and the ABC has equal zero.

706
01:27:41,445 --> 01:27:45,315
Again. So how do we show that? So you just you plug in different numbers.

707
01:27:45,855 --> 01:27:51,525
So, for example, I, I. So if you have, you go to zero.

708
01:27:51,785 --> 01:27:56,625
So you have to equal to zero either. It just means C has to be zero.

709
01:27:57,255 --> 01:28:03,555
And then you. Yeah. So you solve a lot of equations to solve equations.

710
01:28:04,945 --> 01:28:09,125
So you get as many equations and you solve them as any of you show.

711
01:28:09,225 --> 01:28:17,165
ABC had to be zero. So. So this is a resource you can also use to solve a little problem.

712
01:28:17,745 --> 01:28:24,215
So. So this one. So here if we look at this ratio, if the ratio.

713
01:28:26,625 --> 01:28:29,895
History is a constant.

714
01:28:30,525 --> 01:28:36,554
If the ratio is a constant, then it just means a wire has to be.

715
01:28:36,555 --> 01:28:41,715
So cable has to be equal to a believer age who hasn't even been to the eight?

716
01:28:41,725 --> 01:28:46,415
I had two people who. And this only.

717
01:28:46,755 --> 01:28:52,925
And here you need to make sure that it included is consent by you.

718
01:28:53,045 --> 01:29:01,985
If you do not have a control here, then this is different because for example, if you have one,

719
01:29:02,525 --> 01:29:13,745
so you have to see the sphere and to see the full scene as you see that this will give you one over two.

720
01:29:13,985 --> 01:29:23,525
So this is also a constant dependency, but this does not mean the coefficient of here is even within the scope, even in fact and if you go to tool.

721
01:29:23,705 --> 01:29:26,165
So this only closed when you have the line here.

722
01:29:33,145 --> 01:29:38,905
Here, if you have an indicator found in the ratio that indicate a function and for this indicator function in the console function, see.

723
01:29:39,415 --> 01:29:42,795
So if this ratio does not depend on zero this caused.

724
01:29:42,805 --> 01:29:47,755
So this whole if and only if any proceed really from deep.

725
01:29:49,225 --> 01:29:59,845
Now you can check that. And finally, if I see the property in console fantasy, now this means that T has to be equal to zero.

726
01:30:00,295 --> 01:30:04,795
We already knew this, the result of that because. So if he is equal to zero.

727
01:30:04,945 --> 01:30:09,355
So if t that can zero the seat untroubled he does equal to.

728
01:30:09,805 --> 01:30:15,565
And of course it is a console function. And also so all about it in the function you'll see that.

729
01:30:15,745 --> 01:30:17,395
So but he is any other number.

730
01:30:17,425 --> 01:30:26,905
So for example, if T is equal to one and this is see the zero because if you had the opposite effect and if you go to a tool, then this is the square.

731
01:30:27,085 --> 01:30:32,124
And of course, you see the square is a function of zero. So it's only our constant functions.

732
01:30:32,125 --> 01:30:35,655
Here is only one. But he is equal. You.

733
01:30:38,335 --> 01:30:44,305
No, of course. So what I said here is not the main focus of this class.

734
01:30:44,335 --> 01:30:52,375
These are just some mathematical fact that we need to use in order to apply this year of return to assure minimum sufficiency.

735
01:30:52,405 --> 01:30:57,625
So that's what I need to do, this background audit here and actually to solve a particular problem.

736
01:30:57,775 --> 01:31:05,245
You may be you may need to combine all of them together or you may need to come up with other conditions of yourself.

737
01:31:10,645 --> 01:31:14,155
So let's so let's look at the answer example.

738
01:31:15,085 --> 01:31:18,235
So here I have data from uniform distribution.

739
01:31:19,675 --> 01:31:21,745
And I want to find a minimum sufficient statistic.

740
01:31:22,255 --> 01:31:28,915
So so far, if you only have one tool for sure, you minimize efficiency because you cannot use that definition.

741
01:31:29,395 --> 01:31:35,065
So to do that, I need to look at a job distribution. So this is a small distribution for uniform distribution.

742
01:31:35,635 --> 01:31:44,075
And then so what I need to do is I need to look at the ratio of the job distribution.

743
01:31:44,095 --> 01:31:47,125
If I give you that at a to a point.

744
01:31:47,335 --> 01:31:57,915
Next up, the Y axis. Indicator.

745
01:32:11,255 --> 01:32:14,705
So this so in the numerator and denominator.

746
01:32:14,915 --> 01:32:21,725
So this is a product to indicate a function. We already said the product to indicate the function can be written as.

747
01:32:21,965 --> 01:32:25,445
So these statement acts. Let's see.

748
01:32:25,445 --> 01:32:29,434
The first one we see that has to be true or false.

749
01:32:29,435 --> 01:32:43,595
And the. And the denominator is why I'm sensing the process by which I see her full and the fact that we are happy already.

750
01:32:43,865 --> 01:32:48,965
So we also we know that if all the X has a B between zero zero plus one.

751
01:32:49,205 --> 01:32:57,514
So this just means that the minimum must be greater, Nancy.

752
01:32:57,515 --> 01:33:00,755
That right. I think by this time you already know this.

753
01:33:01,265 --> 01:33:05,695
And also, this means that the maximum has to be less than zero plus one.

754
01:33:06,365 --> 01:33:10,625
So this in the numerator and denominator is.

755
01:33:22,825 --> 01:33:25,884
And then it hit the same.

756
01:33:25,885 --> 01:33:29,875
And then you wrote her is so sweet, huh?

757
01:33:29,905 --> 01:33:33,144
Must be growing less than the minimum. A C.

758
01:33:33,145 --> 01:33:40,035
That must be less than the minimum. So for this part, we know that C that must be greater than the maximum x minus one left.

759
01:33:48,715 --> 01:33:56,755
And so this is the reason. So when the ratio is not a function of CRM, well then the ratio in the console function.

760
01:33:57,805 --> 01:34:03,115
Now we just apply the background knowledge we just learned. So this is the ratio in the function.

761
01:34:03,295 --> 01:34:13,425
So we know these the ratio typical would depend on theta. But it is we are now a dependency that if and only if a quasi eco.

762
01:34:15,145 --> 01:34:27,535
So so this is this ratio is not depend on C to eve and owner eve.

763
01:34:27,775 --> 01:34:34,494
So this date to me means Eve and only it is equal to five.

764
01:34:34,495 --> 01:34:39,055
Then an x one is equal to five.

765
01:34:40,255 --> 01:34:45,695
So this part has to be set x and minus y should be equal to light on my left.

766
01:34:45,725 --> 01:34:50,605
So this is the same thing as you balance and an x about equal to viva.

767
01:34:51,055 --> 01:34:56,755
So therefore what is the minimum sufficient statistic? So applying the result we just learn.

768
01:34:57,265 --> 01:35:09,685
So this means. So minimum maximum together is the minimum sufficient.

769
01:35:12,915 --> 01:35:24,755
So. I think by this time we already know how to handle uniform distribution.

770
01:35:34,225 --> 01:35:40,525
So we will look at another unit for distribution next time.

771
01:35:40,915 --> 01:35:47,245
But some say the same idea apply here as I told you.

772
01:35:47,275 --> 01:35:51,775
Tell me, what is the minimum sufficient for you here? So if I have a different uniform distribution.

773
01:35:52,195 --> 01:35:55,825
So here you'll see that I have a uniform distribution and see how it's possible.

774
01:35:56,075 --> 01:35:59,145
And here, both the minimum. The maximum. Forgive me for make up here.

775
01:35:59,485 --> 01:36:03,955
Now for minimum. Maximum together. That minimum sufficient. What about this one?

776
01:36:04,555 --> 01:36:10,645
If I have another uniform distribution for our next to see how to see how you thinking?

777
01:36:10,645 --> 01:36:13,645
The minimum. The maximum. Together they are sufficient.

778
01:36:15,055 --> 01:36:23,464
What do you think? The minimum. The maximum together sufficient? I think that in military you call the minimum the max.

779
01:36:23,465 --> 01:36:30,265
That must be between next year you will see that. Now, once you know that the minimum, the maximum, you have enough money you can make up,

780
01:36:30,265 --> 01:36:34,494
I'll see that as another question in the minimum makes them together.

781
01:36:34,495 --> 01:36:39,955
Minimum sufficiency is impossible. Maybe not.

782
01:36:40,435 --> 01:36:44,065
And you may further reduce the dimension.

783
01:36:44,545 --> 01:36:51,475
Maybe you don't have to know the minimum and maximum. Maybe you just need to know some summary of the minimum.

784
01:36:51,475 --> 01:36:57,745
The maximum. So I think it is good you try this example first before we talk about this.

785
01:36:57,745 --> 01:37:12,575
Next time I to thank you for.
