1
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,250
Can you guys make this publicly? Okay.

2
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,900
All right. All right. So a few things.

3
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:24,649
I'm not sure whether everybody was here on Monday.

4
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:30,920
Just going to say this again when you're presenting just presenting to the microphone so we can hear, you know,

5
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:34,759
via the recording and we will have the recording because we will be able to have a

6
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,889
record about the presentation and what's been done at the time of presentation.

7
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:40,520
And also,

8
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:47,690
we can track the changes you guys have made since the presentation report and there will be no penalty regarding the change that's been made.

9
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:53,149
And I think the we're going to base the final grading on the prior report.

10
00:00:53,150 --> 00:01:01,610
So the presentation is basically an opportunity for you guys to organize your efforts and then make this whole analysis into a solid,

11
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:11,210
consistent story. Um, number two, we have seven teams and we probably will run over time, I think 15 more minutes.

12
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,260
So if you have to go at 430, please feel free to do so.

13
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:21,350
But I know that the final team, which is the Swans, are likely going to be appreciative of your staying here.

14
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:27,320
But if you have to go, just don't feel any pressure and all the slides are in column end.

15
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:36,490
So if you can just click whenever your group is presenting, that'll be good and the presentation order is specified in column E.

16
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:40,880
I will be calling out the team names whenever it's making the transition between the teams.

17
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:44,390
But otherwise that that's that's a simple rule.

18
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:52,580
Any questions? Okay. So whenever the first team is ready, I believe it's the last, last name.

19
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:57,150
So we'll have the iPad. When they tie.

20
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:14,060
So you have these tires in place and you. All right.

21
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:14,550
All right. Great. So everybody.

22
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,490
Yeah. Good. So we are team guys.

23
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,890
Last name, as were our last names are the last last names.

24
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:39,440
So we're presenting a longitudinal study on age difference and depressive syndromes and 2014 to 2018 one in Japan.

25
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:49,639
So how do you do? So, so, so.

26
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:58,820
Subtle changes and inconveniences because of the COVID 19 pandemic have worsened the mental health of the general population.

27
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:02,890
I'm sorry. Yeah. Oh, actually, yeah.

28
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,960
Okay. Oh.

29
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:13,960
Yes. That's great. So sort of changes and conveniences because of the COVID 19.

30
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:21,930
That may have worsened the mental health of. And many studies on this topic.

31
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:29,430
That'll work. I'll give you that.

32
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:43,590
Okay. Just hold it. You can hold. That's good.

33
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:52,360
Okay. So, um. So many studies on this topic have pointed out that the mental health of younger patients

34
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:58,880
individuals might be particularly worse than that of middle age as individuals.

35
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:08,150
So here, as the figures showing the daily new cases of COVID 19 in Japan from February 2020 to November 2020.

36
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:17,209
So we can clearly see there's several peaks since December 2020, and the highest peak occurred around August 2020,

37
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:24,650
to which we suspect that was due to the left of the travel restriction and the occurrence of virus variants.

38
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,480
So. Um. Here.

39
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:32,360
So, yeah. So Art is how it came from a longitudinal survey.

40
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:39,940
It consists of three web based survey and here shows the number of confirmed COVID 19 cases and deaths.

41
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:51,330
And the survey here as in the present study. Our dataset containing demographic and economic informations.

42
00:05:52,290 --> 00:06:02,040
And the depression level. The survey had been taken in from July 2020, September 2020 until January 2021.

43
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:11,610
We should note that between the first two surveys in summer 2020, the COVID 19 cases and mitigation policies in Japan were overall stable.

44
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:23,850
And while there was a huge spike shortly before the third survey in January 2021 and the total number we could see that here,

45
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:36,780
the total number of participations were 2708 and there were only 1819 participants that taking place in all three surveys.

46
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:41,790
And we only include survey results from those 1819 participants.

47
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:48,540
The response variable is the the, the score,

48
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:55,410
the test score of the patient health questionnaire nine and it was used to assess the degrees of depressive symptoms symptoms.

49
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:04,469
Our primary focus or the main research question is that if there we are interesting if there is an age related difference

50
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:11,880
in mental status among participants in change in Japan and here we would categorize age into three subgroups,

51
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:23,220
namely early adulthood, which they were aged 19 to 39, and that accounts for 497 observations and or say,

52
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:31,680
participants and middle age, middle aged adulthood aging from 40 to 64 accounts for 833 participants.

53
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:40,200
And lastly, elderly people who are aging from 65 to 80 years old accounted for 489 observations.

54
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:47,900
To the right there is a to the writers a table. We present the descriptive analysis of covariates.

55
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:57,050
We could see that the covariates we are interested in are age sex, which is male and female, the residential area.

56
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:02,490
Are they out of mild lockdown or are they in mild lockdown?

57
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:12,780
And if the participants have any underlying diseases, their marital status, if they have child or not, and we also have income,

58
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:22,410
the household income levels, employment status, and if the participants is employed economically impacted during this survey period.

59
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:35,150
A note from the previous table that there are 351 participants accounts for about 19.3%.

60
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:42,560
They choose not to answer their disclose their household income, and we treat them as missing values.

61
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,389
Assuming missing.

62
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:52,280
I run them here and we use the Myers package to do the imputation using information of all three survey results and demographic information.

63
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:57,920
The following table shows the distribution of income before and after the imputation.

64
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:04,819
The the top row is the the imputed result.

65
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:10,340
And the column shows what the previous preferred not to answer imputed distribution.

66
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,360
So we made our flowchart to better illustrate what we have done.

67
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:27,300
So after imputing like the missing income data to our dataset.

68
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:33,780
So we want to know like how does the change in the me like kunai relate to our covariates?

69
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:41,430
So we first fitted Maarten all models by including all the covariates and interaction terms of age groups.

70
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:49,020
And then we like we choose like covariance structure using AC and then we use the potential.

71
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:59,190
Oh. Potential. We use the optimal covariance structure to select interaction terms is a process of selecting like statistically

72
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:07,920
significant interaction terms and is a process of selecting statistically significant interaction terms of age.

73
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:18,630
So L was used when performing arts surveys use our marginal model to obtain the random path of linear makes effect models.

74
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:23,550
Last but not least, we summarize results from both models.

75
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:36,310
And then like we compare like five different covariance structure and structured covariance structure and,

76
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:43,020
and construct covariance structure has the smallest AIC, so you can see from the right graph.

77
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:53,070
So and our full models include covariates, both time varying covariate and demographic covariance and all the interaction terms of is h.

78
00:10:53,160 --> 00:11:01,440
So L was used when performing our t test to compare reduce model to for models name effects.

79
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:08,630
Three interaction terms were tested to see the test equally significant and need to be included in our model.

80
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:16,530
So right graph like you can see like is a result of our ANOVA test about the interaction terms the null hypothesis

81
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:25,380
hypothesis we use the interaction term coefficients are zero and the alternative test is now it's not.

82
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:30,330
So we can say that P value is zero point like one nice eight.

83
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,670
So which is greater than 0.50.

84
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:41,370
So we reject h now and conclude that it is reasonable to include all the interaction terms between age group and survey time,

85
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:45,090
age group and income and age group and employment status.

86
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:52,710
Our final marginal models. Moving on to the max effects model.

87
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,500
So. Oh, okay.

88
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:07,630
So here we first compare a model with only random intercept in the model with a random intercept and randomly bearing slope for each category.

89
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:13,990
So we know we have three levels for each category and which resulting to more random slopes.

90
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:20,010
Since we do not know the syntactic distribute distribution of the or t statistic.

91
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:26,530
Under this circumstance we use P equals zero point p 0.1 as our cutoff.

92
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:30,100
We can see here the result result in p value is super small.

93
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:36,070
So we reject the null hypothesis which says the reduced model is sufficient.

94
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,700
The reduced model is the one with only very random intercept.

95
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:49,360
Moving on to the main effects we see here that a typical middle age individual's estimated Q nine score is 2.2 points.

96
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:53,700
2.2 points significantly higher when compared to a.

97
00:12:53,710 --> 00:13:01,230
This person is in early adulthood. Also, a typical elderly person is IQ.

98
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:10,570
Nine score is estimated to be 1.86 lower when compared to if this person in is in this is in early adulthood.

99
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:18,820
For the interaction terms. So for the interaction terms we see.

100
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:27,250
So for interaction terms, we only including interaction terms selected previously in the marginal model.

101
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:35,110
So we hear that, we see that here. We only include the interactions between middle age category and income level.

102
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:47,230
All the estimates were was negative, which means that higher income leads to additional decrease in IQ nine score for middle aged people.

103
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:55,509
For example, we see the first line a typical middle age individual with income level one has a significant additional

104
00:13:55,510 --> 00:14:02,650
3.15 points decrease in IQ nine score when compared to if this person is in income level zero.

105
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:07,300
So higher income level is associated with higher income.

106
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:14,590
And interestingly, we found that none of the interaction terms for elderly and income is significant.

107
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:26,620
Uh. So for a conclusion, in contrast to the the other literatures we saw in our study,

108
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:31,810
middle age participants turned out to have the worst depression level.

109
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:43,840
And overall these there was no statistically significant change of IQ nine scores for participants from the first survey to the second survey.

110
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:51,010
But we did see an increase of IQ nine score when it came to or when comparing the survey survey to the first survey.

111
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:56,810
The interaction terms between age and survey time, income and employment status.

112
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:01,680
And it is significant, in fact, in both models.

113
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:11,760
So for both middle age and elderly participants, if we are holding all other covariates consistent,

114
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:20,640
we the expected Q9 score seemed to increase a bit in a series of surveys are there is a typo here.

115
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:28,920
Also, yes, the middle age participants are significant the happier or with higher income,

116
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:34,890
while income levels of elder participants do not affect their depression level as much.

117
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:40,920
And also, when we were looking at the way we were looking at employment status, it was.

118
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:51,040
So people who were working at home and who are now working were significantly happier when compared to people who are working full time.

119
00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:02,080
So. So moving on to the discussion session.

120
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:07,750
So here are some of the criticism of this data set and we hope can be improved in future.

121
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:13,120
We found our response variability HQ nine score is extremely writes huge.

122
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:22,570
I'm asking you here with a high proportion of materials and we try to come of normalization methods like log transformation or power transformation,

123
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:28,900
but none of them ensures a roughly Gaussian distribution that could be embedded

124
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:35,150
characteristics of the mental status self-report survey result from general population.

125
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:43,890
But I believe both models we use are under normality assumption, and this is one of the flaws in our chosen dataset.

126
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:47,860
So that's just one could be appreciated. Um.

127
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:54,990
And last. So another problem, as we have talked about, is the missing data,

128
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:04,950
data about 19% of our spend that we prefer not to answer for their income level and then as well exceeding the recommended portion,

129
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:07,380
5 to 10% in some of the literatures.

130
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:15,180
Given the number of missing data in income, we couldn't simply chart the participants as it will cost like loss of information.

131
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,080
We did the imputation under the missing at random assumption,

132
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:27,360
but this problem could possibly be rectified with a more appropriate approach when conducting a survey,

133
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:33,870
for example, asking for our consent beforehand and having to prefer not to answer option in a survey.

134
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:43,410
But that's an issue we clearly think of regarding a regarding the ethical and moral guidelines, and that should be at the end of our presentation.

135
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:49,380
Thank you. Any questions or suggestions?

136
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:55,590
Some of the questions. I have.

137
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:01,730
So basically you showed us you are responsible.

138
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:13,880
Yeah. Yeah. So what's that? British. I know we use the continuous like as a continuous variable as we have a lot of

139
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:19,810
like 0 to 27 which is like pretty high comparing to like like a few levels.

140
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:23,580
So we decided to use our continuous variable. Yeah. Which is impressive.

141
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:28,220
You guys successfully use mine. Yeah.

142
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:38,190
That's a. I did have some kind of a terminology related question.

143
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:45,910
You go to the slide. Okay.

144
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,640
So it is not the far all of you. Well, basically, it is a g not it's not a.

145
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:59,060
Okay. So basically in general. Right?

146
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:03,740
Yes. Yeah. So that's confusing. Okay.

147
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:15,510
So this is actually. Yeah.

148
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:19,439
Yeah. Become more specifying like. And our results.

149
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,180
Our report. Yeah. Let's take a time out and we ask some more questions.

150
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,560
Yeah. So the third question is the.

151
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:35,900
We have two models, right? Yeah. Why it? It turns out you have this.

152
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:53,130
In the title of the. Or.

153
00:19:55,010 --> 00:20:05,480
So if that's all you really. Probably across.

154
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:14,570
Zero. So like the first survey, too? Yeah. So I think it's kind of.

155
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:30,760
But the question is. Yes.

156
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:34,820
So all these results are from. Yes.

157
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:38,600
So for the age of little one, 2.20 is not.

158
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:45,160
Only for you to break the. So.

159
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:53,400
That would be with that. Like not. Yes.

160
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,030
So we're just comparing it for the same income level.

161
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:06,180
This person, if it's in their early adulthood or in the middle with all of that from.

162
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:13,080
Why? Well, if we're studying the change.

163
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:22,660
Yeah. Yeah. So. So in the course of.

164
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:32,310
Oh, yes, yes, yes. We should be holding like the first income level as the baseline.

165
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:38,030
Yeah. Covered. Otherwise, I don't.

166
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:02,690
There's one for the third page. Previous one.

167
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:09,000
Just one knock. Yes.

168
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:38,210
Yeah. You saw. The original dataset containing for each observation of each participant.

169
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:45,700
They only have three different survey results, and the holding, like all the other registered information, are constant.

170
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:49,060
That's the. The original data. It. Yeah. That's the baseline.

171
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:53,450
Yeah. Also any suggestion for the normalization problem.

172
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:58,190
But we have some shout out. Okay. Okay.

173
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:01,970
Sorry. Sorry. Okay. Thank you.

174
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:20,880
You know that that in turn. So the way when you come up this period I set a time for.

175
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:28,130
So. You.

176
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:48,470
Hi. We are a team with our intents and our group members are our Nan, Rosita and Sachin and me.

177
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:56,000
Our project. Our topic is association between our seniors and the kill score in first year medical interns.

178
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:04,920
Throughout the pandemic, physicians were at twice the risk of warping out compared to the general population,

179
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:10,860
and about 40% of those surveyed reported a depression and a suicidal ideation.

180
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:21,900
And at the beginning of the pandemic, with approximately 60% to 75% of clinicians reporting symptoms of exhaustion,

181
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,680
depression, sleep disorders and the PTSD,

182
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:36,180
the post-traumatic stress disorder level stress is among the most important factors in the development of psychiatric disorders,

183
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,230
such as nervousness, depression and anxiety.

184
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:46,020
However, individuals very substantially in their response to stress.

185
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:53,780
Our study aim is identifying the effect of emotional burden on the total score of a patient,

186
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:58,169
a house equation measure for medical intense adjusting subjects.

187
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:01,980
Cycle rates, age, sex and ethnicity.

188
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:17,290
As we know, the bad emotional characteristics will negatively impact our physical health, such as the bad emotional characteristics.

189
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:20,910
Could it be numbers? Very much worry.

190
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:24,630
No. Relaxed, restless, irritable or afraid.

191
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:28,560
And they affect you. The physical health indicators.

192
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:32,780
Could it be the last of interest feeling down? Cerebral trouble.

193
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:36,870
Always tired. No appetite. They all feel like failure.

194
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:41,190
Harder to concentrate, slow activity or suicidal thought.

195
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:52,480
According to our study, we finally they pick the correct numbers and use as our primary interest and the total score as our study outcome.

196
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,340
The age as necessity sex will be our baseline variables.

197
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:06,870
If you see the parameter shaped diagram, you can see the t a picture kill total score the 0 to 4 points.

198
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:12,300
It means a normal or minimal depression or the 15 to 19 points.

199
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:17,110
That means moderately severe depression or the worst of a scenario.

200
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:22,870
If we get a 20 or above points, it means C, we are a depression.

201
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:32,649
So our final scientific question will be the association between the level of the numbers in used and the kill total score adjusting for the age,

202
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:50,010
sex and ethnicity. So as you notice, we have some introduction for the study self and the dataset that we use as intern health studies.

203
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:59,220
And I fund a longitudinal cohort study that assess stress and mood in medical interns at institution around the United States.

204
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:06,870
The study we do, data we use is ranging from 2012 to 2018,

205
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:16,920
which those year collected the A JD data and we have total sample size of 15,000 individuals.

206
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:28,720
So over five data collection time points starting from 0 to 4 zero starting in pre intern and then one correspond to the first quarter,

207
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:32,100
1 to 3 months, second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter.

208
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:42,780
So looking some of our study populations, we have an average age of 27.5 and then most of them are identify as white,

209
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,150
which consists of 60.4% and Asian 21.4%.

210
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:53,940
And about half of them are female and another half is male.

211
00:27:53,940 --> 00:28:02,430
And also before they come into our intern, they have about 46.5% of personal history of depression.

212
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:17,300
So look at some exploratory analysis. First, we look at the population level data about the G8 items.

213
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:26,280
As you see here, the most left plot is times zero and then all time one is the one next to it.

214
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:31,560
We can see a drastic increase of people saying that they get more nervous.

215
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:35,490
That's one of the reasons why we are interested in study that variable.

216
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:45,510
And on the table below, we can confirm that we starting at the average of about 50%, people are saying not at all and nervous.

217
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:53,050
And then turning to time, one, we see just the increase in people feeling more nervous.

218
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:56,340
They stated less than half the day they feel all nervous.

219
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:09,060
And we as the variable in the top, we can see a decrease in total number that we have, indicating there is a loss of follow up or a drop ball.

220
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:16,980
And the here we start as 2.7, which is more no no depression basically.

221
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:25,980
And then when we time go to the first quarter, it increased to our 5.7, which indicates a mild depression and then is relatively constant afterward.

222
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:38,040
And then moving on to the individual level on the top here we show the individual trajectory for the IQ score.

223
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:45,450
We see we don't see an obvious pattern here, but what we see here is going from 0 to 1.

224
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:50,940
We see some changes at that period, a month or individual.

225
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:57,090
And down here, we have the nervous trajectory for ten individuals.

226
00:29:57,090 --> 00:30:01,940
As we see, we don't really see a very obvious pattern here.

227
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:06,930
Some of them are relatively constant over time and some of them are going up and don't.

228
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:15,070
And then we turn to the missing pattern analysis.

229
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:22,210
So in this project, we are basically trying to use the mix effect model.

230
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:34,690
So before our modeling, we need to make sure we have at least the MKR or the pattern and we can use so that we can use our dataset.

231
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:39,590
And then we've got falling plots. And.

232
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:47,460
Of to the last week. God's baseline mission is in our baseline variables.

233
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:54,000
As you can see, there's no varying by time for age, sex and race.

234
00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:01,800
And even for the maximal proportion out of ten, which is age.

235
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:08,760
We it's only account for 3.6% of our participants, which is ignorable.

236
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:19,590
And for our survey, a variable which is nervous and THQ are our currently interest and choose.

237
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:30,140
Right. You can see that you're missing this pattern looks quite similar with each other and it looks like they're evenly varying by time.

238
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:37,800
So we basically assume in our pattern and ignore and did not do anything further then.

239
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:41,400
And we're moving and.

240
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:57,680
So in the next page here, it shows how do we choose our final model and we begin ways for model including and our outcome of interest.

241
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:11,540
Q are based on variable age, sex and ethnicity and our survey variable nervousness with the supply modeling based on our exploratory analysis.

242
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:16,790
As you can see in the plot, there is a nodes at time equals one.

243
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:20,670
So that's why we use this kind of model.

244
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:33,080
And then to avoid the convergence problem, we sentence our age and we recouped our ethnicity into three major races.

245
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:34,940
And in.

246
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:47,950
And in the next step, we remove we decided to remove all of our random slope because we found zero some warnings due to the singularity problems.

247
00:32:48,710 --> 00:33:01,220
So which means we need to simplify our models and we only want to keep our random intercept and zero four and.

248
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:15,660
And. Then to the left again, you can see two charts where we are doing the comparison between the supply and supply model.

249
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:23,490
First wasthe ways. We found the supply model is better.

250
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:36,480
So based on our supply for model with the square selection and found its turns now to the past to keep all of our variables.

251
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:42,450
And the follow the final model will be in the next slide.

252
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:46,440
So it's almost hard to expand further about it.

253
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:55,250
So the model present here is our final model.

254
00:33:55,260 --> 00:34:01,970
So for presentation purpose, we only choose to include those coefficient estimates that we're most interested in.

255
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:10,549
So from table we can see that the medical centers tend to feel more depressed when they first entered internship program,

256
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,770
adjusting for other confounders.

257
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:20,570
And then compared to the medical interns who do not feel nervous, interns who feel more nervous during their internship tend to be more depressed.

258
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:28,590
And just, by the way, all the coefficients are significant. And I hear a diagnosis of our final model for an acute Q plot,

259
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:34,230
the normality assumption of the residual Asmat in terms of the constant variance assumption.

260
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:38,750
It is quite problematic. As we can see from the plot, there's a diamond shape.

261
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:44,420
We're thinking that this might be due to the fact that it seems like much of the

262
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:50,209
score are clustered on the lower score scale in terms of multicolor linearity

263
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:54,710
which has they're using g f to the power of one over two times the degree of freedom

264
00:34:55,190 --> 00:35:00,319
to make gva f comparable across dimension and o values are less than three,

265
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:12,840
so we won't be too concerned about this issue. And lastly, we want to talk about some limitations of our project because we are using survey data.

266
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:18,210
There might be bias towards to either the extreme of a scout or the meta of the scale.

267
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:27,540
And also like when taking the survey, interest might give like answers that met the expectation of the society instead of their own feeling.

268
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:31,620
So these biases may result in unreliable analysis.

269
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:36,420
Another limitation comes from the way that we handle the missing data.

270
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:40,920
So for simplicity, we assume data are missing at random.

271
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:48,300
However, it is really hard to distinguish distinguish between whether it is missing at random or missing not at random.

272
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,470
So our assumption might lead to bias in our model analysis.

273
00:35:53,310 --> 00:36:02,080
For our model, we initially want to fit a spline model with our render intercept, and the random slope on the model does converge.

274
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:11,400
But it might be a false positive convergence due to the singular model fitting therefore to avoid like having poor power over the model,

275
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,060
we chose not to include a random well in our final model,

276
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:25,950
since that decision is not made by statistical testing, in my view, with a persuasive like why we chose the current model as our final model.

277
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:36,110
And then there might be other unobserved confounders that might potentially affect the association between nervousness and the Q total score.

278
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:46,790
As we mention in our diagnostic diagnostic part, our model violates the e covariance assumption.

279
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:51,500
Therefore we still need to work on it and hopefully we can find a workaround.

280
00:36:52,160 --> 00:37:00,170
Actually we have already based on transformation on the response variable, but that doesn't really solve our issue.

281
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:06,720
So we will still work on it. And lastly, we want to say that there is definitely room for improvement on our project.

282
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:10,300
For example, we could do like imputation on this in data.

283
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:13,540
Is that all like simply admitting the missing observations?

284
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:18,350
Yeah. Yeah. That's the end of our presentation. Thank you.

285
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:40,590
All right, we have one minute, 20 seconds. Oh, it is 2012 to 2018.

286
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:54,980
Versus a representative. Said.

287
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:34,950
Because all these verbal. Yeah.

288
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:48,270
We just ignore. One thing that I do is I don't really.

289
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:55,720
Was. It's impossible.

290
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:13,660
Yeah, definitely. I think that's. Thank you for the feedback.

291
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,400
Thank you. Thank you. Let's give a positive.

292
00:39:24,160 --> 00:41:02,170
It's called. Than. Hi.

293
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:05,870
Hi, everyone. This is goo goo.

294
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:14,449
From the help of our our crew members are rushing more into our work this year on the journey for our CO

295
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:23,700
Purchases Association between global suicide and GDP per capita among different countries along with children.

296
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:28,460
A study from 2006 to 2000.

297
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:34,670
15. Suicide is an important.

298
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:38,320
Problem with regard to public health.

299
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:54,520
Suicide injuries increased from 2000 to 2016 in the United States and become well for the ten leading causes of death in 2009 to 16.

300
00:41:55,240 --> 00:42:03,850
While suicide is impacted by reasons including psychological, social and environmental factors,

301
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:13,300
there are many previous research on causal relationship between economic and suicide rate.

302
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:23,530
Previous studies have confirmed a general relationship between the economic environment and the suicide rates.

303
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:31,630
Indicators such as employment, GDP and CPI have been used.

304
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:42,730
Conclusion in another report shows that suicide rates of females decreased when economic performance became better.

305
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:56,390
Our story is based on a desire to extract information by compelling data sources, including water back data shows suicide prevention days is hot.

306
00:42:57,830 --> 00:43:04,310
In this study, we selected GDP per capita as a measurement of economic condition,

307
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:14,780
and we are interested in selective exploring the change of suicide rates as economic growth.

308
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:25,740
We want to figure out whether there is a significant association between GDP per capita and the suicide rate as a country at our.

309
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:42,420
Okay. So in the data that the time range from year 2006 to 2015 and we first removed the data from people whose age

310
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:48,930
are less than 14 and because we find that a standard deviation of suicide rate among them are extremely high,

311
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:56,880
and after removing them that 8200 observations in total and 92 countries having

312
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:03,450
selected across five continents and most of the countries are from Europe and America.

313
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:10,640
And our outcome in Portugal is, is suicide rate and the total number of risk.

314
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:20,309
So the todos is an amber, right. Weighting them by 1000 and therefore the suicide rate of we to look transformation because from the plot you can

315
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:31,140
see that and it's extremely school before the transformation and our predictor of interest is the GDP per capita.

316
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:41,550
And the confounders in our analysis is the sex age scale population of the country and of school year.

317
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:52,850
And on. So on the left side of the slide, you can see this great pull out of the suicide.

318
00:44:53,690 --> 00:45:00,200
So that's number per 100,000 populations by year in in 20 countries.

319
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:07,430
And the final part we can find are several countries suicide rates actually for a local Mexican around 2008.

320
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:12,680
And we all know that in 2008, the economic crisis affected economies around the world.

321
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:19,640
So this may out that you could see an association between the GDP and the suicide rates.

322
00:45:20,270 --> 00:45:26,090
And we can see that the suicide rates in most countries have declined or whatever since since 2010.

323
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:35,390
And on the right side and tell us selective variables, including outcome with suicide rate and totals is a number a predictor of interest,

324
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:39,350
which is the GDP per capita and some confounders here.

325
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:44,120
And next, we will talk about mode of being part.

326
00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:57,350
Yeah. In order to figure out the influence of G-b GDP per capita on suicide rates.

327
00:45:57,770 --> 00:46:02,660
We first read the linear mix effect model with normal distributed outcome.

328
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:13,720
Now model one is our baseline model in which suicide rate is the specific specific suicide rate for country item j.

329
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:26,570
Another predictor is scale GDP. Our confounders are scale at year age, which is shown as categorical variable by generation, sex and scale population.

330
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:34,670
Then we add a random intercept in order to we add an interaction term between GDP and year.

331
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:39,380
In model three, we add a random slope of a year.

332
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:45,920
Then we compare model one versus model two and model two and three through values of AC.

333
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:58,400
And. We figure out that model three is much more better with the smallest AC 15,000 zero hundred and 43 and BSA 15,441.

334
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:03,230
In the next step, we use C to determine correlation structure,

335
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:10,220
comparing different covariance pattern models which have been listed out in the right table.

336
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:21,270
To sum up, we use we final pick the healer genius one model and then our my final model.

337
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:27,300
We include both intercept and random stop as well as the interaction term between GDP and a year.

338
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:40,790
To check out whether our model is defensible with the config to conduct the model diagnostics for model three.

339
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:49,140
We check the normality through cookie plots and histogram histogram that illustrate the distribution of residuals.

340
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:53,720
Then we conclude that the residuals follow the normal distribution.

341
00:47:54,900 --> 00:48:01,470
We use generalized variance inflation factor to check for medical reality among our various.

342
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:09,089
And we found we found that all the values of Vvf are Smothers and Q,

343
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:14,790
which indicates that there is no multi-colored charity among our covariates in the model.

344
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:27,679
This is the result of our linear mix effects model with normality distributed outcome containing

345
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:33,650
random slope and intercept also include the interaction terms between GDP and the year.

346
00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:38,420
The left summary table shows the results of our model.

347
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:46,070
We can see that the P values of GDP and the interaction term between time and GDP are both orders in 0.3.

348
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,920
Based on the results of our model,

349
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:59,330
we can conclude that there is no significant association between GDP per capita and the suicide rates at the significance level of 0.05.

350
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:08,059
Adjusting for other covariates. And also there is no significant association between interaction interaction in

351
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:13,040
terms of GDP per capita at and the suicide rates at the country level as well.

352
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:29,290
And now we consider to construct another model and we choose to use the suicide number at a foreign country.

353
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:38,049
I at at your j as our outcome variables and says this can be regarded as a count data.

354
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:41,200
So we try to use the persona mix effect model.

355
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:52,419
And however the SO is an AI. There are a large amount of suicide numbers to be zero, so we consider it to use this inflatable so it makes it models.

356
00:49:52,420 --> 00:50:00,489
And the model selection part is quite similar to the parts in the linear mix of that models.

357
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:06,280
We can we calculate the ICBC and look like look likelihood.

358
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:11,290
And. And compare them.

359
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:20,140
And we finally selected a model with random slope and interactions and then to be our final models.

360
00:50:20,410 --> 00:50:28,750
And as for the model diagnosis part, we construct the residual residual versus fitted value plots.

361
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:39,950
And from the plot we can see that the values are larger than zeros and the distribution of the residuals are close to zero,

362
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:45,910
are close to zeros, and does not have a specific patterns. And for the graph plots and.

363
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:57,299
The dry air of the ming effect cover of they that manufacturers are asked more than 3 a.m. are all smaller than three.

364
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:04,230
So we also there is no medical narrative issue and eight our models.

365
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:18,180
And then we after we obtain our final models, we apply a function Geo m eight MP in our and obtain the summary tables.

366
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:26,940
And we focused on the a p value of the interaction, a p values of the predictor of interest.

367
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:36,569
And we first look at the GDP and we see the p value is greater than zero credit in 0.5.05 and it

368
00:51:36,570 --> 00:51:45,479
means there's exist no significant effect of GDP on the global suicide number at the country levels.

369
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:51,390
And this results echoes the results we obtained from the linear mix effect model.

370
00:51:51,690 --> 00:51:58,290
And we also look at the p value of the interaction term and we find that there

371
00:51:58,290 --> 00:52:03,660
exists a kind of a association between the interaction and the suicide number.

372
00:52:04,050 --> 00:52:12,320
And this indicates that the suicide number would increase significantly in GDP, in effect per unit, increasing in year at the country levels.

373
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:21,030
And we also listed the results from the previous model in our mix effect model, which is the suicide.

374
00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:25,590
Our does not have a significant association with GDP interacting with.

375
00:52:27,870 --> 00:52:34,140
And finally, we listed some limitations and possible improvements to our work.

376
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:43,950
The first is that since there are also exists a large amount of zeros in our size in the transform suicide rate.

377
00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:52,380
So may we may apply the zero inflated linear mix effect models to for better estimations.

378
00:52:52,390 --> 00:52:57,240
And also there's a very limited confounders in our data.

379
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:04,830
So A and this may results in bias because the variables cannot completely explain the model.

380
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:11,820
And the certain issue is that the rescaling covariates may cause inaccuracy in model fitting,

381
00:53:11,830 --> 00:53:21,480
so we may use categorical variables instead of the risk only variables such as we categorize the population in the future to solve this problem.

382
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:28,050
And we could also consider other linear relationships between the manufacturers and the outcome variables.

383
00:53:28,350 --> 00:53:32,280
And that's all for our presentation and any questions.

384
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:47,320
Well, that's about it. But I still. I think that I of the.

385
00:53:48,370 --> 00:53:56,800
Can you go to the. Or the one where.

386
00:54:04,930 --> 00:54:09,730
Yeah. Okay. So the percentage numbers are really.

387
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:19,570
Oh, yeah. Because we thought we. It's just the data is very.

388
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:26,280
Oh, it's like an actor, for example.

389
00:54:26,410 --> 00:54:32,130
Like one of. For example, tell me what the.

390
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:37,070
1006. 40.

391
00:54:42,010 --> 00:54:51,580
Is that a serious. 20% of the total amount of the total amount of the operation.

392
00:54:55,310 --> 00:55:00,730
There's five age groups. Oh.

393
00:55:02,990 --> 00:55:09,940
The denominator is the number of the. Yeah.

394
00:55:09,950 --> 00:55:13,280
So now we have five age groups and just. That's fine.

395
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:18,430
Yeah. So with the selected data or.

396
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:22,520
Equally. Are equally.

397
00:55:30,890 --> 00:55:44,710
As he told observation. In the dataset. Oh, no, it's there in terms of 92 countries, but.

398
00:55:46,490 --> 00:55:50,130
There's other. There's other.

399
00:55:51,870 --> 00:56:04,730
Yeah. I think it means that you're. 1002 hands red dots in the data of your 92 country.

400
00:56:22,570 --> 00:56:26,980
You run out of time. You guys can for the.

401
00:56:35,390 --> 00:57:05,020
Oh, is that. In.

402
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:19,930
Let's see the closet. And that scene is called Survivor.

403
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,550
Just put on. You can also find.

404
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:05,880
On this show. I listen.

405
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:13,000
Yeah. Okay.

406
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:23,790
Like, oh, here, you. So to top it off, our project is about the effects of for recommendations on weight loss.

407
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:33,340
In other words, we would like to explore whether following the breakfast recommendations will help people lose their weight.

408
00:58:34,050 --> 00:58:38,910
And our team members are Georgian sites.

409
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:43,350
So I turn and I'm one, two, and that's this.

410
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:53,780
Introductions. Uh, we all know our waiting is a common risk factor for many terrible diseases.

411
00:58:54,200 --> 00:59:00,160
So, uh, it is very, uh, controversial for to, uh, whether to keep, um.

412
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:05,420
Each uh, bat first is associate with, uh, with uh and weight loss.

413
00:59:05,870 --> 00:59:15,970
Uh, we, uh, we try to find or we find is escaping breakfast may, uh, may reduce daily energy intake and the weight.

414
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:22,880
Other, uh, other researchers find that breakfast, uh, consumption habits might also add to weight loss.

415
00:59:26,850 --> 00:59:38,579
Uh, our objective is to determine, uh, if, um, uh, if following breakfast consumption, uh, we associate so many, uh,

416
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:48,239
related factors and we try to find a relationship between weight loss and breakfast recommendations and, and other important factors.

417
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:58,920
We, so we propose a longitudinal, uh, models to analyze those relationships and discuss, uh, possible, uh, possible reasons.

418
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:13,080
Uh, we, the data that we use is from January two and January ten and 2013 to January 2014.

419
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:22,140
I those researchers to, uh, try to try to and do a multiple size for three different,

420
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:28,260
um, parallel arms, uh, waste ran randomized trials and controlled trials.

421
01:00:28,710 --> 01:00:36,990
Uh, as you can see, those are the variables that we use and as code that we want to discuss.

422
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:42,420
Okay. Okay.

423
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:56,380
So, uh, as we previously mentioned, we are interested in the relationship between, uh, the breakfast recommendation and the weight loss over time.

424
01:00:57,790 --> 01:01:04,600
So we will use the breakfast recommendation people receive as our main predictor.

425
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:15,830
Of interest and for covariates we will put like sex or race and so on based on the current literature.

426
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:22,570
So basically we will use three different in your mix effect models.

427
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:31,810
We use or sell interaction so that we can find the best combinations of parameters for our research questions.

428
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:42,230
And after we built these three different models, uh, would choose the best model based on the AIC criteria.

429
01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:54,780
So here's our model. So for model one, we would use, uh,

430
01:01:55,290 --> 01:02:04,830
to include interaction term between the time and breakfast recommendation people received and also a random intercept.

431
01:02:05,550 --> 01:02:12,690
So for model two, there's no interaction turn, but there's still a random intercept.

432
01:02:13,290 --> 01:02:16,630
And for model number three. Mm.

433
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:25,750
There's no other, no interaction term. But we have a random intercepts and a random slope.

434
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:35,670
So here's the resource of, uh, uh, the aces for different models.

435
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:42,830
So. We can see from the chart that all three models are not two different I sees.

436
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:48,840
Uh. But the one with the lowest I see is the model to.

437
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:57,660
So we additionally conducted a likely ratio test for model three and Model three.

438
01:02:58,810 --> 01:03:04,290
Which is the, uh, which is the motto is, uh,

439
01:03:04,450 --> 01:03:14,680
only interest are in the intercept and model with sloping intercept and the p value off our t test is larger than 0.1,

440
01:03:15,010 --> 01:03:18,700
which means the mother of only random intercepts is defensible.

441
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:34,250
So here is the. Our summary of coefficients for the four model to the model which shows.

442
01:03:35,290 --> 01:03:40,510
Um. So here you can find lots. Um.

443
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:51,490
The time is now. There's no significant evidence that, uh, Tom is associated with the, uh.

444
01:03:51,490 --> 01:03:54,550
With the waste. We still waste those.

445
01:03:55,730 --> 01:04:01,379
And, uh. For the people who assigned to the recommendation.

446
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:04,500
Let's tell them to eat breakfast.

447
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:11,520
Uh, there is also a nonsignificant association between these and the weight loss.

448
01:04:12,090 --> 01:04:18,630
But, uh, for those people who are signs, you have a recommendation, told them to not eat breakfast.

449
01:04:19,820 --> 01:04:23,270
Uh, we find that, uh, these people.

450
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:29,940
Uh, these people are likely to gain weight over time.

451
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:38,190
So as for those covariates, uh, there's also no significant association between the.

452
01:04:39,110 --> 01:04:43,160
And we lost. And, uh, the previous breakfast.

453
01:04:44,210 --> 01:04:48,440
In a previous book first. Habits.

454
01:04:49,830 --> 01:04:54,030
If you just through those people. So next.

455
01:04:54,570 --> 01:04:57,930
No, no. We talk about the model diagnostics.

456
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:05,910
All right. So we we have come that sort of like model diagnosis for our model two.

457
01:05:06,690 --> 01:05:15,750
And the first one is residual plots, which we would like to see whether the residuals are randomly even distributed.

458
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:23,880
So as you can see if when a graph has the residuals, here's a pretty much evenly distributed.

459
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:32,340
I'm on the x axis and here we can see that like the linear assumptions for our model two, he's not violated.

460
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:42,650
And secondly, we also checked the multi colon eroded for other covariance that we had for our model two you.

461
01:05:46,690 --> 01:05:51,520
They we don't see it is they are significantly correlated with each other.

462
01:05:52,750 --> 01:06:02,620
And as you can see from the table here, the VFR values are mostly around 110 ish.

463
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:06,820
So which is significantly larger than PHI.

464
01:06:08,110 --> 01:06:15,549
Okay. All right. So that said, the third diagnostic we have done is rescission.

465
01:06:15,550 --> 01:06:24,550
And it is for the residuals, no normality. And we we plot the Q Hill plots for this.

466
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:27,299
For this diagnosis.

467
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:37,410
And we sit we saw that most points are aligning on the relatively straight lines and we concluded there's no violations on numerator to.

468
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:47,690
Lastly, we also checked the distance for all data points to see whether there is like high and

469
01:06:47,740 --> 01:06:58,780
influential points and the highest cotesting we have for our models who is less than 1.012.

470
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:02,740
So we conclude that order.

471
01:07:03,070 --> 01:07:07,450
There is no like highly influential points on our dataset.

472
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:16,810
So there are some advantages and disadvantages for all models.

473
01:07:19,780 --> 01:07:26,710
As we have as we saw from the diagnostic we've seen the performance of our Model two is quite promising,

474
01:07:27,250 --> 01:07:35,140
as is satisfy all the satisfy the assumption of linearity independent normality and sensitivities.

475
01:07:35,950 --> 01:07:43,390
So our model is less sensitive to small changes and able to estimate the coefficients more precisely.

476
01:07:45,030 --> 01:08:00,870
And can we can we also conclude that our our research questions can be explained by animal models and the disadvantages are we for our models?

477
01:08:01,290 --> 01:08:12,240
We didn't stratify sex into specific groups, which means that our model might not provide to specific implications about different sex.

478
01:08:14,370 --> 01:08:26,310
And so because we use AIC two to conduct the model solutions, our model might not be able to fit other datasets.

479
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:37,740
Well, when we ask if we are going to if we are going to do predictions and we have around 200 to 400 observations for our dataset.

480
01:08:37,770 --> 01:08:45,960
So the number of the observations might not be to add to add adequate for more accurately predictions.

481
01:08:47,180 --> 01:08:53,210
Okay. And I out that was.

482
01:08:53,370 --> 01:09:18,300
And any questions. The population.

483
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:28,370
That's. Oh, yeah.

484
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:34,180
Uh. I need a check.

485
01:09:34,510 --> 01:09:39,750
It's, uh. It's. Yeah.

486
01:09:39,780 --> 01:09:45,930
Yeah, sure, sure. Uh, we're definitely allowed in the proposal, but I didn't, uh.

487
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:49,360
I think I made a mistake at the end for the in the president's eyes. Yeah.

488
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:54,120
And I think that, you know, this is just the purpose of. This.

489
01:09:55,230 --> 01:10:00,430
So to force you to. Specify. Exactly. Yeah.

490
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:04,280
You go to the table with the. Okay. Is this.

491
01:10:07,050 --> 01:10:24,400
Clarify what the. I think it's.

492
01:10:25,870 --> 01:10:30,660
Yeah, I will. I, I saw that as. I was thinking of all the.

493
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:37,340
Second suggestion alliance. So if you look at all the models.

494
01:10:41,420 --> 01:10:47,850
I think you were studying that. Treatment effect or comparison of all the treatment plants.

495
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:51,540
For records. I think you'd want to know that.

496
01:10:52,510 --> 01:10:58,090
Have one example. Where we separated the conceptual and constitutional.

497
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:03,320
I think here is a couple. First.

498
01:11:04,970 --> 01:11:08,500
Who are they? Are these people? Or are these people?

499
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:16,790
If so, you may have. Yeah.

500
01:11:17,210 --> 01:11:22,670
Relate to how. So you can play a zero.

501
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:35,530
That kind of charm. That is probably.

502
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:47,010
Yes, you. You're just.

503
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:54,840
I think that. So I think that's a.

504
01:11:55,990 --> 01:12:00,370
I think. I'm not surprised by this, but.

505
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:05,350
Report, make, have. Sure. So what's it like?

506
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:32,190
Okay. Oh, yeah.

507
01:12:35,130 --> 01:12:41,780
Uh. Yeah.

508
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:54,310
Uh. AI is not binary is actually have uh, uh to uh recommendation of eat for breakfast and not eat breakfast and a regular recommendation.

509
01:12:54,760 --> 01:13:03,860
So there's three level. No.

510
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:12,170
No. Oh.

511
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:16,440
Yeah. What's that? Okay.

512
01:13:16,630 --> 01:13:19,750
About this question. Because of high interest.

513
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:24,120
Because. Anything nutritional science.

514
01:13:30,420 --> 01:13:33,660
I hope these comments now. Yeah. Okay.

515
01:13:33,670 --> 01:13:38,410
Thank you. All right, let's give them a plus to.

516
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:52,120
W Well, I guess the. So I have to say that a.

517
01:13:55,220 --> 01:14:01,490
Immensely. So it's always a pain in the butt.

518
01:14:02,790 --> 01:14:07,420
Well. So.

519
01:14:07,660 --> 01:14:17,400
I know. So one of our teammates is actually currently Corbett, so we have to let her go.

520
01:14:17,990 --> 01:14:35,990
Okay. Yeah.

521
01:14:37,360 --> 01:15:12,380
On behalf of. Hello, everyone.

522
01:15:12,410 --> 01:15:18,320
Our project is about the relationship between marital status and depression, a longitudinal study.

523
01:15:18,740 --> 01:15:22,880
Our team members are equally you and me.

524
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:27,480
Let me let me first introduce the.

525
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:31,740
The this disease and risk factors.

526
01:15:32,220 --> 01:15:41,880
Mental health, including emotional, psychological and social well-being, has been a significant public health issue.

527
01:15:43,020 --> 01:15:49,590
Mental health disorders manifest themselves in personality disorders, eating disorders,

528
01:15:49,740 --> 01:15:57,420
anxiety disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorders and mental health illness.

529
01:15:57,420 --> 01:16:06,479
Bringing people like that inactive induce emotion fluctuation, more mood fluctuations, and more severe.

530
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:11,100
It will it can cause violent violence, suicide and self-harm.

531
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:21,400
Depression is one of the most common mental illness, and it's related to socioeconomic status,

532
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:27,580
gender differences, social support, smoking, diabetes and so many risk factors.

533
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:38,950
So it's vital for us to investigate the possible factor, the association between possible factors and depression.

534
01:16:40,260 --> 01:16:54,600
Marital status is one of the risk factors of depression in launching the null studies, but it showed inconsistent effects in the previous papers.

535
01:16:54,780 --> 01:16:59,340
Always found that being married and maintaining a marriage improves mental wellness.

536
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:02,729
And a lot of people find the person who is separated,

537
01:17:02,730 --> 01:17:12,600
divorced and never married or widowed has relatively lower psychological well-being as compared to the married people.

538
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:25,710
But actually we also find in one paper amount working married woman there was a significant relationship between depressive symptoms in the household

539
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:37,020
suggests in the conflict and also the majority of long children study either indicated no gender differences or a slightly stronger effect for women.

540
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:47,820
However, we investigate that men are more negatively impacted by widowhood than women are by depression and other psychological well-being metrics.

541
01:17:48,180 --> 01:17:55,830
So it's necessary for us to provide more evidence on the effect of marital status on depression.

542
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:03,120
Our data comes from National Longitudinal, so way of use 1997,

543
01:18:03,630 --> 01:18:11,610
which is a longitudinal project that follows the lives of a sample of American use from between 1980 and 1984,

544
01:18:11,940 --> 01:18:18,720
around 9000 respondents or age 12 to 17, when first interviewed in 1997.

545
01:18:19,020 --> 01:18:28,560
So far, 19 rounds of interviews had been conducted. Our data set out the results of so we conducted the year 2000, a 2010, 2015 and the 2015.

546
01:18:29,010 --> 01:18:33,900
So anything. Yeah, 28 is considered as that baseline for the following analysis.

547
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:45,450
In total, we have 1568 participants and then no missing is exactly the variables which include the baseline age gross family income of previous year.

548
01:18:46,460 --> 01:18:53,120
Number of biological children and their rights thinking in the household of respondent weight of respondents

549
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:59,300
impact year from baseline of gender race highest degree received prior to this year's interview.

550
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:09,320
Marital status. So those are the variables we are going to including our data.

551
01:19:09,830 --> 01:19:14,150
And then among the variables, we have some categorical variables.

552
01:19:14,570 --> 01:19:18,740
And since this category, variables have a lot of levels, as you can see here,

553
01:19:19,550 --> 01:19:24,500
for depression time, which is our response variable, we have four levels in a marriage status.

554
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:34,550
We have ten levels in highest degree, we have seven levels, which means we have to like fit an estimated two more beta to four different levels.

555
01:19:34,970 --> 01:19:43,430
Therefore four. In order to have a more parsimonious model, we did decide to collapse some of the levels for those categorical variables.

556
01:19:43,700 --> 01:19:52,970
And then the depression time is also our response variable and the sense for our for the level of all of the time.

557
01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:58,070
Most of the time there are very few entries among our over 6000 data.

558
01:19:58,520 --> 01:20:05,989
We decide to collapse this variable into two levels, which is yes, like have some depression and null,

559
01:20:05,990 --> 01:20:11,260
which means the people would never none of the time have the depression.

560
01:20:11,270 --> 01:20:22,429
And then for marital status. Also we from some of the literature review are we decide to collapse the levels into three which are never married,

561
01:20:22,430 --> 01:20:29,089
married and separated and highest degree. We decide to collapse it into two high school in some or below.

562
01:20:29,090 --> 01:20:33,260
In some college or undergrad or graduate in race, we decide to collapse them into three.

563
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:37,280
And then for the other continuous variables are we send in a skilled them.

564
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:46,640
So as you can see here, since our response, everybody is binary which will drives us into a model of g with logit link.

565
01:20:48,620 --> 01:20:57,979
Again, just a reminder of our scientific question we're interested in if the effect of marital status on changes in

566
01:20:57,980 --> 01:21:05,330
the log odds of self-reported depression is significant again since we're interested in the population level,

567
01:21:05,330 --> 01:21:13,520
whereas fitting a g with binary link. So instead of deal ab and some advantage of our data, we have a very balanced data.

568
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:19,549
We have 1568 individuals every occasion.

569
01:21:19,550 --> 01:21:25,670
So in total we have over 6000 data, which is a quite large sample size,

570
01:21:25,820 --> 01:21:32,000
which means this is advantaging our data and we decide to fit a on structure

571
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:37,160
variance covariance matrix because we have pretty large sample scale sample size.

572
01:21:37,580 --> 01:21:43,490
And then on the right hand side, it's basically level of data, summary table.

573
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:56,030
And then so this is our model. So there's a model without interaction in the model with interactions and that interaction term as again,

574
01:21:56,030 --> 01:22:00,260
since our scientific question is the effect of marital status on the changes.

575
01:22:01,010 --> 01:22:06,500
So our interaction term is the time in marital status.

576
01:22:07,100 --> 01:22:15,919
And as you can see from this Claus, from on the left hand side, the lines are quite parallel with each other.

577
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:24,290
So we guess like before our fitting before fitting any model that this interaction term will be not significant.

578
01:22:25,010 --> 01:22:31,640
And as a result, the P value is quite large and we decide to not include this interaction term.

579
01:22:31,970 --> 01:22:40,850
And so the model without interaction is our final model as present in table two.

580
01:22:41,210 --> 01:22:46,190
This is the summary table for our final model for the sake of time.

581
01:22:46,220 --> 01:22:50,480
We are only discuss department of interest, which is the marital status.

582
01:22:50,810 --> 01:22:54,980
The odds ratio of depression is 1.376.

583
01:22:54,980 --> 01:23:05,150
We use 95% confidence interval 1.15 to 1.646 for people in our marriage to compare with people who married a controlling adult actress,

584
01:23:05,540 --> 01:23:11,510
the odds ratio for separated or divorce or widow or marriage group is 1.7 to 8.

585
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:16,880
This indicates marriage reduced risk of depression in some sense.

586
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:22,520
As mentioned before, we still see that the unstructured working association,

587
01:23:22,850 --> 01:23:29,300
since we only have four interviews in total and there is around a 1568 participants available,

588
01:23:29,510 --> 01:23:35,780
making us have enough power to do the parameter estimation show in table three.

589
01:23:36,110 --> 01:23:41,720
The log odds ratio is present here and they are all significant in some sense.

590
01:23:42,110 --> 01:23:51,370
The point estimation for the dispersion parameter is 0.985, which is around very close to one.

591
01:23:51,380 --> 01:23:57,980
So we don't consider we have very serious or what is approaching issue to detect any potential call

592
01:23:57,980 --> 01:24:05,959
in realities which is calculated and as present or these values are close to one less than three.

593
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:11,000
So we also don't consider cardinality us so we each of our model.

594
01:24:36,870 --> 01:24:42,150
Occasionally. I think she is speaking. She should be speaking, I think.

595
01:24:44,410 --> 01:24:49,810
Oh. Oh. Are.

596
01:24:56,480 --> 01:25:16,940
The speaker is not working. Oh, yes, it's.

597
01:25:51,180 --> 01:25:59,170
So this information to analyze the relationship between mental health and those six needs age in each of our cohort is negative.

598
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:04,780
People who first time from the survey were 24 to 28 years old now.

599
01:26:06,130 --> 01:26:11,050
So for social work, we want to test this meeting purpose, which I mentioned,

600
01:26:11,050 --> 01:26:15,910
and collect more data from older people to increase the representation of population.

601
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:23,050
Also, we could have more specific classes of promotion of such like first marriage if not certain marriage,

602
01:26:23,230 --> 01:26:27,280
emphysema and depression, such sometimes all food and most of the time.

603
01:26:27,970 --> 01:26:32,830
Also research starting in 2008 and after that compared to match people with

604
01:26:32,830 --> 01:26:42,190
older issue of depression has hit three degrees in full and married people.

605
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:50,770
That's mostly because Andrew studied it. People suffer from financial crisis and that could provide more support for each other.

606
01:26:50,950 --> 01:26:57,460
This positively affects financial house or building should become a piece of the presumption has got better.

607
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:01,900
Therefore we should also look at to the 30 years that you.

608
01:27:06,530 --> 01:27:11,380
All right. So.

609
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:20,470
It's better. So. I enjoyed the presentation and I think that.

610
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:27,950
It's a very positive message. So is marital status.

611
01:27:28,510 --> 01:27:32,200
Time for. I'm sorry.

612
01:27:33,100 --> 01:27:37,030
Marital status? Yes. Is it time? Yes.

613
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:47,260
And also in the final page, I saw it clarify the relationship.

614
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:52,900
The White House is in. So.

615
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:58,190
You mean supportive? Is that something you stand or support?

616
01:27:58,190 --> 01:28:03,020
Oh, yeah. Support the literature review. But it's not the same thing as.

617
01:28:04,090 --> 01:28:12,520
No. Questions.

618
01:28:15,510 --> 01:28:23,430
All right, let's take them again. All right.

619
01:28:23,430 --> 01:28:29,900
So. Next. Call it a career.

620
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:34,010
Really? That's an analogy.

621
01:28:38,580 --> 01:29:09,909
I work with. Hi, everyone.

622
01:29:09,910 --> 01:29:14,860
I'm Rachel. And this semester I worked with Josh and Joe to investigate the relationship between

623
01:29:14,860 --> 01:29:19,270
marital status and quality of life in Parkinson's disease patients over time.

624
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:25,630
So Parkinson's disease is a progressive disorder that causes the nervous system to deteriorate.

625
01:29:25,650 --> 01:29:30,900
So oftentimes the first symptom that patients experience is tremors, meaning shaky hands.

626
01:29:31,260 --> 01:29:34,919
But eventually the disease progresses to the point where they have to use wheelchairs.

627
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:38,610
They have a hard time moving around and they even have speech problems.

628
01:29:39,210 --> 01:29:46,170
So research shows that a few factors related to quality of life among Parkinson's patients include basic demographics such as age,

629
01:29:46,170 --> 01:29:52,470
sex, education level, also disease duration, meaning how long they've had the disease and disease severity.

630
01:29:53,250 --> 01:29:56,820
So one variable that could use some more research attention is marital status.

631
01:29:57,900 --> 01:30:04,229
A few researchers have found that marital status and quality of life in Parkinson's patients are not related.

632
01:30:04,230 --> 01:30:07,470
But few researchers have considered the role of stigma in that relationship.

633
01:30:07,950 --> 01:30:16,859
So stigma refers to other people's negative attitudes about a person with the specific characteristic that causes that person to feel anxiety,

634
01:30:16,860 --> 01:30:22,620
shame or embarrassment. So like I said, Parkinson's patients do often have to use wheelchairs and have speech problems.

635
01:30:22,620 --> 01:30:26,370
So for those reasons, they tend to experience higher levels of stigma.

636
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:32,819
Research shows that unmarried Parkinson's patients tend to experience higher levels of stigma and that

637
01:30:32,820 --> 01:30:37,930
higher levels of stigma are associated with lower levels of quality of life in Parkinson's patients.

638
01:30:37,940 --> 01:30:43,019
So for those reasons, we wanted to include stigma in our project, and that leads us to our research.

639
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:49,620
Question Is marital status related to quality of life among those with Parkinson's disease over time when adjusting for demographics,

640
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:52,440
disease, duration, disease, severity and stigma.

641
01:30:55,230 --> 01:31:00,450
So our data comes from a study called Emergence and Evolution of Social Self-Management of Parkinson's Disease.

642
01:31:00,450 --> 01:31:07,920
And the major aim of that study was to evaluate the ways that Parkinson's patients and their care partners manage the disease,

643
01:31:07,950 --> 01:31:10,470
specifically as it relates to their social lives.

644
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:17,300
So our patients were followed for three years post baseline and participated in both in-person and telephone assessments.

645
01:31:17,310 --> 01:31:24,210
But for our project we were only interested in their in-person assessments, and our sample size includes 86 Parkinson's patients.

646
01:31:24,810 --> 01:31:27,629
So our outcome variable was the quality of life,

647
01:31:27,630 --> 01:31:33,570
which was a continuous variable measured by the Parkinson's Disease questionnaire, also known as P Q 39.

648
01:31:33,900 --> 01:31:40,890
And one thing to note about this variable is that higher scores on the P 39 are associated with lower levels of quality of life.

649
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:48,090
Our main exposure of interest was marital status, which was measured by the baseline demographic questionnaire.

650
01:31:48,450 --> 01:31:50,759
And originally this variable had five levels.

651
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:56,640
But since there were few participants in some of those levels, we recoded it to only have two levels married or not married.

652
01:31:57,930 --> 01:32:03,720
Other variables include age, gender, education, level, income, disease, duration, all measured by the demographic questionnaire.

653
01:32:04,260 --> 01:32:09,990
Disease severity was measured by the unified Parkinson's disease rating scale, also known as the updrafts,

654
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:17,670
which has four four parts the non-motor experiences, motor experiences, motor exam and motor complications.

655
01:32:18,060 --> 01:32:21,900
And lastly, stigma was measured via the stigma scale for chronic illness.

656
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:29,290
So this plot on the left is just our spaghetti part of our quality of life

657
01:32:29,290 --> 01:32:33,070
outcomes for the first 20 patients in our dataset over the three year period.

658
01:32:34,210 --> 01:32:42,190
The table on the right is our table one of descriptive statistics. So one thing to note here is that we did only use baseline baseline.

659
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:50,709
Demographic variables. Since we were looking over a short period of time, only three years, we assumed that things like marital status,

660
01:32:50,710 --> 01:32:56,140
education level wouldn't change over that period of time for a continuous variable.

661
01:32:56,140 --> 01:33:01,030
So we did have data for all four time points baseline year one, year two, you and your three.

662
01:33:01,480 --> 01:33:04,900
And another thing again, just when looking at the quality of life variable,

663
01:33:04,900 --> 01:33:12,340
it's important to note that that variable is measured in the PD Q 39, in which higher scores are associated with worse quality of life.

664
01:33:16,660 --> 01:33:20,649
Well, it's not surprising that longitudinal study always have missing values.

665
01:33:20,650 --> 01:33:28,120
So as our data said, because we want to identify the type of business for our response, we firstly look at the pattern for our missing values.

666
01:33:29,590 --> 01:33:39,400
We found that the mRNAs in response and other continuous measures are Martelle and plotting the right hand side show that the bitterness

667
01:33:39,450 --> 01:33:49,690
in our outcome and other continuous measures appear at the same time that intuitively indicate that missing is not is not at random.

668
01:33:50,170 --> 01:33:57,340
So we further explore exploring it by looking at the differences in demographics for missing and now missing at each occasion.

669
01:33:58,330 --> 01:34:01,990
Well, but the statistical result is not significant.

670
01:34:02,440 --> 01:34:09,250
But when we, um, but when we look at the distribution, at the baseline we found there,

671
01:34:10,020 --> 01:34:21,640
there is an obvious shift to the right for the people who job the study in terms of precocity and eye stigma and all the for you PR as measures.

672
01:34:23,260 --> 01:34:30,460
So that means the people who drop the study well will tend to have a lower, lower quality of life,

673
01:34:31,330 --> 01:34:38,170
more experiencing stigma and a higher severity in disease so that provide evidence that

674
01:34:38,170 --> 01:34:43,990
our outcome is more likely to be non missing and random because of this missing part,

675
01:34:44,260 --> 01:34:49,059
because of this missing person and because we are going to use a linear mix model

676
01:34:49,060 --> 01:34:55,540
which can tolerant mRNAs in response and is corresponding missing in the covariates.

677
01:34:55,930 --> 01:35:04,780
So we're just filling the measures in income by using the highest of frequency category because it's just a two level categorical variable.

678
01:35:10,770 --> 01:35:22,560
You know, so because our on our design is on balance or we go directly into the beta mix model and we made a few assumptions before fitting the model.

679
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:31,680
So first, we assume that our residual follows Gaussian distribution and all the individuals have the same pattern in the random, in fact.

680
01:35:32,160 --> 01:35:37,770
And we also assume that our responds the PD. Q 39 score is linear in time.

681
01:35:38,190 --> 01:35:45,360
And we also assume and and in place of the we also assumed there's the FCC m assumption

682
01:35:45,540 --> 01:35:53,880
which means the unconditional excitation of YJ on only based on J's observation,

683
01:35:54,180 --> 01:36:00,059
which is X AJ on because our Y is right skewed.

684
01:36:00,060 --> 01:36:03,480
So we do the log transformation before feeding the model.

685
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:11,520
Our first model is the maximum meaning model which include all coeds on that we are interested in,

686
01:36:11,790 --> 01:36:20,850
including the year day marital status and the interaction between marital status and the year and other demographic and clinical data.

687
01:36:21,630 --> 01:36:26,370
And we also add the on the random intercept.

688
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:35,930
And don't be afraid to second model, which is a model too by removing the non-significant covariates.

689
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:45,680
We compared this two models by repeating this to models using l l l method and then conducted likelihood ratio test.

690
01:36:45,980 --> 01:36:53,420
The results from the tests suggest us to choose one or two and done to just a random effect pattern.

691
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:58,480
We fit the third model by adding a random slope and down.

692
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:06,500
We conducted the likelihood ratio test and then a result suggest us to choose two m2 as our final model,

693
01:37:06,680 --> 01:37:13,430
which include the year two marital status and their interaction between marital status year and

694
01:37:13,430 --> 01:37:21,860
then two part one and part two of our as and stigma on in the model espoused at random intercept.

695
01:37:26,660 --> 01:37:33,410
We provide we also provide diagnosis for our motos. So we track the way eye for each of we are for each of our moto.

696
01:37:34,130 --> 01:37:41,870
We just show the results for our fine motor here because the value are smaller and intense, so we don't have multiple Inarritu issues.

697
01:37:42,110 --> 01:37:45,260
The curriculum allowed us to show that our Gaussian assumption hold.

698
01:37:47,380 --> 01:37:56,770
So the plot out on the right, on the right hand side shows that moto or moto generally predict population trend.

699
01:37:56,770 --> 01:38:02,020
Those that those who are on that who are married will have better quality of life than those who are married.

700
01:38:02,650 --> 01:38:10,710
Well, unfortunately, because neither the neither the main fact our marital status status nor the interaction term are significant.

701
01:38:10,720 --> 01:38:13,870
So the prediction is not is not valid.

702
01:38:15,550 --> 01:38:22,629
Thus, the significant term in this moto is stigma your PDA as one and you PDR as to which may because the questionnaire

703
01:38:22,630 --> 01:38:29,410
is used to estimate those scores has some inter have some inter intersections with the particular 39.

704
01:38:32,240 --> 01:38:39,260
So over the marital status is now significantly related to the quality of life among Parkinson's disease patients over time.

705
01:38:39,590 --> 01:38:45,170
When adjusting for demographics, this duration and severity and stigma or stigma,

706
01:38:45,200 --> 01:38:53,120
multiple and non-motor experiences of dating of daily living are significant predictors of quality of life among Parkinson patients over time.

707
01:38:53,570 --> 01:38:58,160
The results, the result above, are consistent with previous funding findings in the literature.

708
01:39:00,140 --> 01:39:08,719
Definitely our study has some limitations. So the study population is smelling a Gaussian and we recode some category variables from multiple

709
01:39:08,720 --> 01:39:14,840
levels into two levels because some category has to fill data points with just one or two.

710
01:39:15,590 --> 01:39:17,840
So in this case, we may suggest,

711
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:24,860
if possible or we should expand the size of study to increase the risk diversity and the number of people in the real categories.

712
01:39:25,550 --> 01:39:30,830
And we also fail to utilize our types, types of assessments such as telephone assessment,

713
01:39:31,130 --> 01:39:36,530
because if we include the more type of assessment, the data also will be a little bit more messy.

714
01:39:37,070 --> 01:39:46,310
And some measures, some measures in between between the telephone assessment and the in-person assessment may not be consistent,

715
01:39:47,030 --> 01:39:51,050
but the telephone assessment may also provide some similar alternatives.

716
01:39:51,350 --> 01:39:58,250
So if time is enough, it's possible to integrate all the types of data to improve our statistical power.

717
01:39:59,090 --> 01:40:05,150
And lastly, the missing values are just impute imperial bias in both statistics.

718
01:40:05,690 --> 01:40:10,969
So when we also also try to use multiple imputation and apply Rubin's rule to polling

719
01:40:10,970 --> 01:40:16,280
results so we can have a more robust in quotation and the more robust inference.

720
01:40:17,860 --> 01:40:21,790
And here is the reference we use in this presentation.

721
01:40:22,780 --> 01:40:31,190
Thank you all. I find this?

722
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:37,580
I'm very happy. Terminologies that.

723
01:40:48,110 --> 01:40:52,130
We looked at data. So these are. Yes.

724
01:40:53,950 --> 01:40:57,680
So. Okay. That probably explains.

725
01:41:00,930 --> 01:41:08,190
So the conclusion is. It's not. Yeah.

726
01:41:08,940 --> 01:41:16,100
You said the. That was. So obviously there's a other. Not this.

727
01:41:18,150 --> 01:41:23,940
Some of the things. You go through that part of the population, right?

728
01:41:25,240 --> 01:41:28,300
Yes. Maria. So that's.

729
01:41:34,540 --> 01:41:58,970
Yeah. Well, it's a long story, probably because the last time in the office where we discussed this, they just discussed this.

730
01:42:00,170 --> 01:42:08,120
Well, you can see that this assumption is maybe similarly embedded in the mixed mode about maybe the same terminology or something,

731
01:42:08,510 --> 01:42:41,200
because last time we actually discussed that. So. Okay.

732
01:42:41,210 --> 01:42:44,390
Bounty hunter. I lost everybody.

733
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:54,340
Definitely. Last but not least, the team is called.

734
01:42:59,490 --> 01:43:05,410
This is what's. Okay?

735
01:43:05,560 --> 01:43:15,940
Yes. That's funny because I also work with people about 2020 as targets by a lot of sites.

736
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:23,460
What is. Her studies also.

737
01:43:24,150 --> 01:43:32,900
I. All right.

738
01:43:32,900 --> 01:43:39,030
So. Let's start. Okay.

739
01:43:39,030 --> 01:43:47,280
So our project is called Longitudinal Data for the logical analysis of spine bone mineral density in women and years since last menstrual period.

740
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:55,400
Sorry. So first off, our question for our analysis is,

741
01:43:55,670 --> 01:44:02,180
is there an association between years since last menstrual period and total spine bone mineral density BMD in women?

742
01:44:03,240 --> 01:44:10,020
Previous research has demonstrated that the rate of BMD loss increases significantly in the PERIMENOPAUSAL period,

743
01:44:10,170 --> 01:44:17,610
which is the period when a woman is transitioning into menopause and this perimenopausal rate of BMD loss continues.

744
01:44:17,640 --> 01:44:24,400
Postmenopausal. So our objective is to conduct a longitudinal analysis that properly predicts

745
01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:28,240
spine bone mineral density in women based on years since last menstrual period.

746
01:44:29,240 --> 01:44:33,740
And our hypothesis is that increasing number of years since last menstrual period

747
01:44:33,740 --> 01:44:37,220
will be associated with decreasing spine BMD based on our literature review.

748
01:44:40,590 --> 01:44:46,860
So now we're on to discuss our dataset, which is the study of women's health across the nation or this one series.

749
01:44:47,420 --> 01:44:52,350
Um, and this one series is a longitudinal study that examines U.S. women's health before,

750
01:44:52,350 --> 01:44:59,969
during and after transitioning through menopause by conducting roughly annual visits in 77 research sites around the country,

751
01:44:59,970 --> 01:45:04,020
including U of M to collect health related information on study participants.

752
01:45:04,850 --> 01:45:14,120
The 3302 women in the initial study wave were 42 to 52 years of age, were from five different racial ethnic groups.

753
01:45:14,360 --> 01:45:19,639
Groups, excuse me, had a uterus and at least one ovary had a menstrual period within the last three

754
01:45:19,640 --> 01:45:23,150
months and had not taken a hormone medication within the last three months.

755
01:45:23,540 --> 01:45:26,240
Each state chose to study women belonging to a single race.

756
01:45:27,120 --> 01:45:34,410
The first study occurred in 1997, and each subsequent visit has occurred roughly annually, including up until today.

757
01:45:35,130 --> 01:45:40,020
Our analysis only includes data collected from visits one through ten, so 1997 to 2008,

758
01:45:40,290 --> 01:45:43,080
because that's the only data that's available publicly at the moment.

759
01:45:44,010 --> 01:45:48,870
Participants were identified throughout the series of visits through an assigned number called the Swine ID.

760
01:45:55,010 --> 01:45:58,070
So the predictor we're using is the.

761
01:45:59,580 --> 01:46:05,040
Last menstrual period. Uh, which we practice from.

762
01:46:07,710 --> 01:46:12,780
Actually the the predictor we use is called the adjusted time.

763
01:46:12,780 --> 01:46:19,140
And we use this value. We calculate this value from the last manager period in this one data.

764
01:46:19,890 --> 01:46:30,360
Uh, the adjusted is a value that, uh, records the number of years since the last two menstrual period and the year.

765
01:46:30,360 --> 01:46:36,330
And at that, the year that the period ends will be adjusted to zero.

766
01:46:37,940 --> 01:46:42,530
Uh, the covariates included, uh, including the age.

767
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:47,710
Uh, at the last menstrual period and the race,

768
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:57,220
which is so categorical variable with four groups and these two variables are, uh, will not change over time.

769
01:46:57,670 --> 01:47:08,530
And we also have, uh, BMI and thyroid medical use age, which is a binary, uh, variable and also the cancer diagnosis since the last visit,

770
01:47:08,740 --> 01:47:14,410
which is also binary and also the quality of life, uh, which is a continuous.

771
01:47:17,510 --> 01:47:30,560
We and also the the outcome variable is the objective we want to discuss is the spine bone mineral density, the BMD.

772
01:47:32,720 --> 01:47:43,610
To clean that data. We firstly, uh, choose the participant who attend all ten visits using the unique swarm ID.

773
01:47:44,180 --> 01:47:52,400
So then there are 1764 participants, and some of them are excluded if they have.

774
01:47:52,970 --> 01:48:10,430
Um. Uh, hysterectomy or uh, it, uh, sulking go off or wrong for me or pregnant or breastfeeding during any time of these studies.

775
01:48:11,210 --> 01:48:16,540
So, uh, since there, there's no research size, choose to, uh, study the Hispanic.

776
01:48:16,750 --> 01:48:21,770
Captured the imagination. So all the Hispanic woman were excluded.

777
01:48:22,040 --> 01:48:25,820
We should reduce our risk group for 5 to 4.

778
01:48:26,270 --> 01:48:38,190
And we have. A black Chinese Japanese on why remains an effort to clean in their 1140 women's remains.

779
01:48:38,730 --> 01:48:46,350
And we also improve our predictor and covariates using the mice by predicted matching.

780
01:48:46,500 --> 01:48:51,420
And we are assuming that they are. Uh, it around it.

781
01:48:56,350 --> 01:48:59,590
And here we use the linear mix effect model.

782
01:49:01,300 --> 01:49:13,600
Um, we think this model, uh, based on our objective and from the spaghetti plot, we can see that there is a ton not at the time, zero.

783
01:49:14,020 --> 01:49:18,670
So we also fit a skyline. Uh, we.

784
01:49:19,940 --> 01:49:29,480
Also an interaction term between the race and the other just in time based on our literature review.

785
01:49:38,700 --> 01:49:43,400
Um, so the result of the first two tests is ah, ah significant.

786
01:49:43,410 --> 01:49:50,250
So we include and the supply and interaction term in our models and also the

787
01:49:50,250 --> 01:49:55,860
ROIC of model with and with renal slope a smaller than the one with outwards.

788
01:49:56,190 --> 01:50:01,200
So our final model is along with spleen interaction term and the random slope.

789
01:50:04,150 --> 01:50:12,280
Based on based on the estimation of our final model, we will to interpret the fixed effect related to the last material purity.

790
01:50:12,970 --> 01:50:20,320
So as you can see in the red line among black women, the mean bone density decreases.

791
01:50:20,830 --> 01:50:25,070
.008 grams per centimeter cubed per year.

792
01:50:25,090 --> 01:50:40,420
Before women enter the menopause and the main loss of bone density is .015 grams per centimeter cubed for a year after they enter the minus purse.

793
01:50:41,380 --> 01:50:50,260
So and for a Caucasian women, the main bone density decreases is not significantly different from the black women.

794
01:50:50,290 --> 01:50:55,209
So actually, you can see the purple eyes and the red line.

795
01:50:55,210 --> 01:50:57,130
They are almost parallel.

796
01:50:58,060 --> 01:51:08,230
And among the Chinese women and the Japanese women that they are the green line and the blue line, the mean bone density crisis.

797
01:51:09,580 --> 01:51:17,290
S .013 grams per centimeter kill per year before manifest and often manifest main bone

798
01:51:17,290 --> 01:51:27,520
density loss per year for Chinese women is .02 and for Japanese women is .01 for.

799
01:51:29,120 --> 01:51:40,309
So we can conclude that the last race jumps down to after menopause and this race out of all four races included

800
01:51:40,310 --> 01:51:48,530
in the analysis also support our hypothesis that as the number of years since last menstrual period increases,

801
01:51:49,940 --> 01:51:53,780
the spine, bone mineral density decreases.

802
01:51:58,460 --> 01:52:09,170
And here's add up for us that shows the club for first 15 women in each race group since we also want you to look at the individual trajectories.

803
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:23,760
Oh, sorry. Luke has a crucial part and various inflation factors for our model diagnostics, as they can see in the Google Cloud,

804
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:29,400
the thermal control measures this recall and how software deterioration there are the extremes.

805
01:52:29,850 --> 01:52:38,850
So as we have a large sample size, hopefully we can conclude that the third highest normally distributed as were the virus inflation factors.

806
01:52:39,180 --> 01:52:42,920
So these are all lower than for other variables.

807
01:52:42,930 --> 01:52:46,140
We can conclude that there are no political in there.

808
01:52:48,030 --> 01:52:51,360
And we believe we have the following limitations.

809
01:52:51,900 --> 01:52:59,879
First, you know where the cleaning process remains with values in the form,

810
01:52:59,880 --> 01:53:10,260
and those are the last year that is excluded of the total of 30,000, only 1000 and 114.

811
01:53:10,260 --> 01:53:17,610
Very. Or that I said and all the Hispanic participants was excluded because of the the measurements.

812
01:53:18,100 --> 01:53:25,470
There is also the unbalanced risk of the there are more of the voters or white women, the other groups.

813
01:53:26,130 --> 01:53:35,340
And we also think for the the assumption that both of our cohorts the residuals are not go

814
01:53:35,340 --> 01:53:44,040
that it should be all the others despite all the sample size of 1140 for future studies.

815
01:53:44,910 --> 01:53:48,000
First, I think workers will be included.

816
01:53:48,240 --> 01:53:51,959
They would like to consider rather hormone therapy for us.

817
01:53:51,960 --> 01:53:59,160
Her or her dressing can be used with us as the card.

818
01:53:59,550 --> 01:54:10,950
I would also like to consider that from more recent sponsors with us from 2009 to the present one since that our released to the public.

819
01:54:11,340 --> 01:54:14,670
Now only data from this one are available.

820
01:54:15,120 --> 01:54:22,200
And that's all for our presentation. Thank you. All right.

821
01:54:22,890 --> 01:54:29,270
Very good presentation. I first want to say that you guys presented the the question would be the subsidy.

822
01:54:29,840 --> 01:54:36,069
You know the process extremely well. It's basically tied up with their preferences.

823
01:54:36,070 --> 01:54:42,820
So. And I have a few questions.

824
01:54:43,090 --> 01:54:48,780
One is the, uh. You got to figure. Seems.

825
01:54:51,780 --> 01:54:58,040
Yes. So for the California slides, these are the predictions.

826
01:54:58,530 --> 01:55:04,480
So, you know, you I hate this idea.

827
01:55:05,510 --> 01:55:13,670
But they're not. So how that I get to. Not satisfied or not, but in the way that's what they all believe either.

828
01:55:13,760 --> 01:55:17,770
So, you know, Congressman. I'll be.

829
01:55:23,210 --> 01:55:27,870
Second question, do you go back to the previous time? Yes, this one.

830
01:55:28,350 --> 01:55:35,130
So. BMI is the. Oh.

831
01:55:37,450 --> 01:55:42,000
What's the definition of? Well, that's about my body weight.

832
01:55:52,150 --> 01:55:55,430
Was. Oh.

833
01:56:01,170 --> 01:56:08,950
So it's not surprising to see. Association, but I don't know how.

834
01:56:17,660 --> 01:56:31,860
We are wondering. I. There's one that.

835
01:56:33,220 --> 01:56:36,810
But as you as I have a.

836
01:56:42,330 --> 01:56:49,130
So it basically means that what I mean by. And there's nothing immediate.

837
01:56:49,160 --> 01:56:58,650
There's. For the age.

838
01:56:58,680 --> 01:57:01,930
I guess that's what they say. Yeah.

839
01:57:02,110 --> 01:57:10,470
Yeah. And so I want to say that a lot of.

840
01:57:13,650 --> 01:57:17,210
I think that is the one thing that I would. Your work is.

841
01:57:17,250 --> 01:57:43,870

Just like. All right, let's give them a thorough pause.

844
01:58:16,260 --> 01:58:22,520
Can we take all of the other. Is it a place you want to be?

845
01:58:23,640 --> 01:58:30,280
That. Yeah.

846
01:58:30,390 --> 01:58:33,540
Thanks, everybody, for so. Well.

847
01:58:35,900 --> 01:58:41,000
So what's the. What's the. Hold on? Let's see.

848
01:58:48,420 --> 01:58:50,090
What's your take?
