1
00:00:05,182 --> 00:00:07,560
So let's be honest.

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,920
Most of the time, we're all busy.

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,980
We're all just trying to get stuff done,

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:16,260
trying to get through the task in front
of us and move on to the next thing.

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,470
And in communication,
there is no difference, right?

6
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:24,100
We often as a result end up designing
our communications in whatever way

7
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,468
seems like it's the fastest possible way
to get it done and get it out the door.

8
00:00:28,468 --> 00:00:34,010
The problem is when we do that, we usually
end up forgetting about evaluation.

9
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:39,450
We forget about thinking along the way,
about how we're gonna know

10
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,180
whether we're succeeding or
not succeeding in our communication.

11
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:49,570
And if I may reference the old movie
Pretty Woman, big mistake, huge.

12
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:53,140
There's just no point in
doing a communication

13
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:56,890
without at least thinking about
how you're gonna evaluate it.

14
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,670
Thinking about evaluation does two things.

15
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,000
First, it helps you
design better messages.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,540
Because being precise
about defining success

17
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:13,030
forces you to design better so that you
have a better chance of succeeding.

18
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:18,970
Now second,
thinking about evaluation makes you

19
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:24,600
be honest with yourself about whether
the communication that you're doing works.

20
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,440
And we don't wanna waste money and

21
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:33,310
time on ineffective communications, things
that are not accomplishing our goals.

22
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:38,190
So ideally you should be thinking
about your design goals and

23
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:42,350
the evaluation process at the same time.

24
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:47,930
So let's take a second think, how do
we define success for a communication?

25
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:55,272
Not an intervention, not a whole program,
just that little bit of our communication.

26
00:01:55,272 --> 00:02:00,588
How do we define success
when we're thinking about

27
00:02:00,588 --> 00:02:05,543
words on a page, or
a TV spot, or an interview?

28
00:02:05,543 --> 00:02:10,366
Well, it helps to start by breaking
down what the end state is

29
00:02:10,366 --> 00:02:12,741
that we want to have, right?

30
00:02:12,741 --> 00:02:15,349
Do we wanna have a change in knowledge?

31
00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:17,901
Like, I want people to know more.

32
00:02:17,901 --> 00:02:19,912
Well, great.

33
00:02:19,912 --> 00:02:23,890
What specifically do we
want people to know more?

34
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:27,220
Do we want people to know
the risks of this procedure?

35
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:32,050
Do we want people to know that
a contaminant exists in their community?

36
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:37,052
Do we want people to know the populations
that are affected by a particular disease?

37
00:02:37,052 --> 00:02:41,973
What specific piece of knowledge does
not currently exist in this target

38
00:02:41,973 --> 00:02:47,039
audience that we want to convey to them?

39
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:49,310
Maybe it's not about knowledge though.

40
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,020
Maybe it's about beliefs.

41
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,290
I don't need them to know something,
I need them to feel something.

42
00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:00,090
I want them to perceive greater
efficacy of this therapy.

43
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:06,850
Or I want them to be concerned about this
procedure as having substantial risk.

44
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:10,870
What are the beliefs that
you want them to hold?

45
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:14,190
Again, being specific is the only way
we're gonna be able to define whether

46
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:18,480
somebody has that belief or
doesn't have that belief.

47
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,350
Third, maybe it's not about knowledge or
beliefs but it's about motivation.

48
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:27,830
Great, I want you to be motivated,
to do what exactly?

49
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:33,280
Is this to test your blood
sugar every time you eat,

50
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,060
or is this to go see your
doctor at a given situation?

51
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:42,730
Or is this to advocate for
greater resources for

52
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:46,750
this particular issue,
whatever it is that you're advocating for?

53
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:53,350
The more specific you are in defining not
just motivation but motivation to do what,

54
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:57,190
the more likely it is you can design
the communication to achieve that.

55
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:00,180
And then of course,

56
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,500
in the end we probably want more than
knowledge, beliefs, or motivation.

57
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,810
We probably want behavior,
at least sometimes.

58
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:12,804
But again,
what exactly is the behavior that we want?

59
00:04:12,804 --> 00:04:16,142
Eat healthier is not the same thing as,
reach for

60
00:04:16,142 --> 00:04:21,199
lower fat products when I'm in
the grocery store shopping for my family.

61
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:28,810
And that specificity helps us to then both
design the communication, but evaluate it.

62
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,990
Each of the things that I've talked
about here are measurable, but

63
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:34,560
they're only measurable if we're precise.

64
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,300
And therefore, considering evaluation
early in the process rather than later

65
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:43,900
helps you to be clearer
in your communication.

66
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:47,140
Now, I also want to be clear about this.

67
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,500
Too often I hear people say, well,

68
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,180
I just wanna communicate about this,
about this topic.

69
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,481
Diabetes education or
health insurance education, or

70
00:04:56,481 --> 00:05:02,990
I wanna teach people how
to design their model.

71
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,450
That's too vague.

72
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:07,560
It doesn't help you get specific
enough to be effective.

73
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,080
The more specific you are about your
goals, the more likely you are to

74
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,620
communicate clearly and
the better you are at measuring them so

75
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,784
that you know whether or
not you've actually succeeded.
