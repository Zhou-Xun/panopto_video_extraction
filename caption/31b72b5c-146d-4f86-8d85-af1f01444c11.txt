1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:08,040
Okay. Oh, yeah. Yeah. This is Lauren, my interview in Berlin.

2
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:14,910
Well, know, I think. Sure extracts. So why are you interested in this position?

3
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:25,170
Yeah, I'm interested in this position because this position is about modeling P and the environment for ego.

4
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:38,850
And yes, I have just completed a master's in public health where we've learned about toxicology and and taken some analytical classes.

5
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:46,980
And I want to combine important topics in public health and do it in a very practical way.

6
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:55,140
I think pufas, particularly as Michigan having the highest state of privacy in the country, it feels like a very pressing issue.

7
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:02,130
This past summer, I interned for the Department of Epidemiology at University of Michigan,

8
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:07,380
where we were taking an exposure assessment through survey and blood and saliva.

9
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:13,050
And you're talking to a lot of members in the community about what they find is the most pressing

10
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:20,940
issue and people brought up before us even this question of should I not three have for instance,

11
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:28,020
in the Lake Huron River, we have an advisory not to eat the fish coming out of it.

12
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:34,290
And I was asked from a person who used to fish, is it eating the fish?

13
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:39,600
Is that worse than the Styrofoam that I might eat from a takeout container, which up of the takeout container?

14
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:43,530
And I'm really interested in those very practical questions and how can we answer

15
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:48,960
them using data and and statistics and then communicating that to the public.

16
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,000
Yeah. So is information that weaknesses are.

17
00:01:54,090 --> 00:02:01,440
Yeah, I think my strengths as you might have just seen in the past question is I, I'd like to evaluate everything.

18
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:07,829
I like to have a comprehensive lens of what's going on. I think public health is is very broad.

19
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:16,950
It's looking at people in their daily life. And I think we need to be that broad and yeah, evaluate a lot of factors.

20
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:28,740
But in that, I think one of my weaknesses is that I can be indecisive and not get to the main point or make a decision on a project.

21
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:34,320
So I'm working on that by setting deadlines and also understanding that there's

22
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:40,680
a lot of value in continuing forward and getting into a decision or writing

23
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:47,339
a report that science is in progress unless you come to a final decision knowing

24
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,600
that there is still uncertainty and it sounds great doesn't really work.

25
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,830
Yeah. So why should we hire you or other applicants?

26
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:03,120
Yeah. I mean, I imagine there's a lot of capable applicants coming in because this is a fantastic job and fascinating.

27
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:12,509
And so I'm just one of many people in the field. I think uniquely I have worked two jobs that people have not worked before.

28
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:15,720
Coming into this, for instance, I worked security in a music hall.

29
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:21,330
I've been a dishwasher in a restaurant for a lot of jobs that typically people get overlooked.

30
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:28,769
And in that, I think I've seen, I've been able to develop communication skills where, you know,

31
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:33,570
for instance, in undergrad I worked for my college cafeteria, the dishwasher would break.

32
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,320
And then the students, especially the sustainability students,

33
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:45,899
were frustrated that we had paper plates or paper cups and we had to explain the cafeteria does not get enough money to fix the dishwasher.

34
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:52,380
And so I think working my work experience has allowed me to develop communication skills.

35
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:58,500
And additionally, I've just worked in different topics in different fields within science.

36
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,330
So currently I'm working in a epigenetic lab at the University of Michigan.

37
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:13,560
I've also done epidemiology research, so I feel like I've gotten touches of the broad spectrum of research and that process.

38
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:19,110
So yeah, well, thank you. Appreciate you taking the time to interview this person.

39
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:20,880
They really are the three of you.
