1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:12,850
I. Okay.

2
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:18,340
Good morning, everybody. Why don't you look at our schedule?

3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,760
Because I think I've got to figure out where we are.

4
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:29,780
So a couple of questions about the next exam. So we get through this week that you have for fall break.

5
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:33,160
You won't be here Tuesday. And we'll wrap up our guy on Thursday.

6
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:36,809
Then I thought I'd left this tentative, but I realized I'd put it in.

7
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,230
So the second exam will be Tuesday, October 25th.

8
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:47,040
When you come back from a break or the following week after the fall break,

9
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:57,120
I'm still waiting to hear back from my good friend who does a guest lecturing most years on IBS and a little fodmap diet.

10
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:05,939
That's not covered on the exam, obviously, but I haven't heard back on her availability, so we'll just keep it on the schedule as is.

11
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:15,240
If for some reason she can't present that day, we'll just move on and we'll plug her in or I'll give that lecture.

12
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:25,260
Just thought it might be nice to get a break for me. So this is the second exam date and it will be, of course, the same kind of thing at home.

13
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:30,360
You can access it any time that day. Is that work for people?

14
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:34,290
You were anticipating this. This has been on the schedule.

15
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:39,089
Okay. Let me know if there's issues there.

16
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:45,190
But that is our date for our exam later in November.

17
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:48,780
We can get more into that later this particular day.

18
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,139
I won't be here. I have to be in East Lansing that day.

19
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,180
So most likely this will be an asynchronous day.

20
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:03,149
I might record the lecture and you guys can do it on your own time or we'll do like a Zoom session.

21
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:09,780
I just can't physically be here that morning. I know that that's way up in the distance, but I just kind of want to prepare for that.

22
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:20,830
Okay. So if anything, we might shift some of these days, but it's not going to affect anything on the exam date or the content of the exam.

23
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:26,140
Any questions on any of that before we get started?

24
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:34,970
Okay. You go back.

25
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:40,150
Okay. So I did post your first case study.

26
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:51,580
They posted it on Sunday evening. This will be due two weeks from today.

27
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:56,019
The other ones, I'll get posted earlier if you want more time to spend on them.

28
00:02:56,020 --> 00:03:01,740
If you do need some flexibility with the due date, let me know because I know that's a lot.

29
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:07,450
It's like the same exam, which was not intentional, so that there's flexibility with that.

30
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:12,430
It'll just kind of delay when I can post the key depending on when people get it in.

31
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:21,850
But if if that's a little bit hectic with those two days being the same date, let me know and just turn it in when you have a chance.

32
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,090
Any questions on that? So take your time with that. But.

33
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:35,319
I mean, I always think, like, read the questions maybe even before Thursday's lecture,

34
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:42,820
because we will be talking about IBD just so you can kind of get get a sense of maybe questions that you might have as we go through the lecture,

35
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:51,700
but, you know, give yourself enough time to dedicate to working on that and hopefully it'll be good practice.

36
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,660
You can kind of work on some of the Yemen stuff, some of the NCP stuff.

37
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:01,960
So that'll give you kind of an idea of what these these case studies are all about.

38
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:16,770
Oh, right. All right.

39
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:23,920
So we're still kind of are the upper part of the GI tract focusing on the stomach today.

40
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:31,350
We'll talk a little bit about the motive for gastric surgery, a little bit of time on weight loss surgeries.

41
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:35,610
We saw some of that in the the recorded lectures.

42
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:41,370
And then we'll we'll also talk about Gastroparesis into like a small case study together today.

43
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,150
So today's focus is is on the stomach.

44
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:55,679
Okay. So in the recorded lecture, we talked a little bit about some reasons why some patients might undergo gastric surgery.

45
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,129
This is separate from like a bariatric procedure.

46
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:08,970
Like if there is a gastric tumor or sometimes there's different surgical procedures if there's significant reflux happening.

47
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,070
And then we talked about something called dumping syndrome, you know,

48
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:22,510
not the the loveliest name for a syndrome, but this happens often after extensive gastric surgery.

49
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:27,480
Can anybody explain what's happening during dumping syndrome if somebody is experiencing that?

50
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,210
Yes. Extreme.

51
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:45,559
Yeah. So the food contents and we'll talk about specific foods especially they kind of pass from the stomach into the

52
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:52,370
small bowel too quickly so they don't doesn't have a chance to break down as it normally would in the stomach.

53
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:02,430
And then it's going into the small bowel. Too fast, but also in a state that it normally isn't.

54
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:11,880
So it hasn't had a chance to have some of that digestive process occur so we can consider this kind of rapid gastric emptying.

55
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:18,060
And we're going to talk about the kind of antithesis to that when we talk about gastroparesis, which is delayed, gastric emptying.

56
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:25,319
So we have dumping syndrome occurs when food, especially sugar,

57
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:33,720
so hyper as molar types of solutes, which is generally more simple sugar type of things,

58
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:42,149
moves from the stomach into the small bowels, into the duodenum too quickly in patients without gastric surgery.

59
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:51,570
So somebody that has undergone gastric surgery, digestion is initiated in the stomach, in the transition to the duodenum occurs progressively.

60
00:06:52,110 --> 00:07:00,600
So we have acid and proteases. Initiate the breakdown of food, promoting smaller food particles to be digested into the duodenum.

61
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:07,650
This physiological process is weakened when there is a surgical manipulation of this pathway.

62
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:13,230
The pylori. So where the stomach meets the small bowel meets the duodenum.

63
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:19,859
So if the worse is bypassed or if there's an alteration in gastric innervation.

64
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,890
So we'll talk about the role of that vagus nerve.

65
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:29,670
It has different roles in terms of how it relates to stomach and empty.

66
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:36,180
So if there is alteration in the gastric innovation that could produce effects of decreased

67
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:42,480
stomach reserve or this rapid transit of hyper osmolarity food material into the duodenum.

68
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:49,980
And so in these hyper as smaller food particles that aren't as broken down as they should be, enter the duodenum.

69
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:56,850
That's when patients get these symptoms. And we'll talk about those in a little bit more detail.

70
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:08,000
In addition, the entire nervous system plays a major role in the regulation of gastric emptying, involving several gastrointestinal hormones.

71
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,750
So when that is interrupted, it is.

72
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:25,180
The innovation leading to the summit can affect gastric acid release, but also, if it's extensively manipulated, that it can impact gastric emptying.

73
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:30,850
Both ways. So some potential diagnoses.

74
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:38,950
And again, you may have many others, but if somebody has undergone gastric surgery and they're experiencing dumping syndrome,

75
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:42,850
they may have inadequate oral intake because they are having symptoms like

76
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:47,499
patients know when something's going on and they're experiencing these symptoms.

77
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,959
And we talked about this.

78
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:58,150
When we educate patients that have undergone gastric surgery, we do educate them on dumping syndrome in case they start to experience that.

79
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:06,729
So they know what, what two kind of identifies those symptoms, um, intakes of types of carbohydrate inconsistent with need.

80
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:10,780
So this would be like more simple or refined carbohydrates.

81
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:21,519
Those are the things that are going to. Empty quicker than like proteins or more complex carbohydrates that might be inadequate vitamin intake.

82
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:32,040
No. One, there could be a food and nutrition related knowledge deficit, some others like the impaired nutrient utilization or altered function.

83
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:35,260
Again, we tend to use those more as the etiology in my statement,

84
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:41,680
but those could all be potential diagnoses we would use in somebody experiencing dumping syndrome.

85
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:48,270
Yeah. The first. This one.

86
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:53,460
Yeah, this we use this a lot like if they're not just eating adequately.

87
00:09:53,640 --> 00:10:01,170
So if they have, um, if they're experiencing altered GI function or GI distress from their symptoms,

88
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:07,940
I felt less like you just have inadequate or they get symptoms or having.

89
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:13,469
When people feel or they have these symptoms of dumping syndrome,

90
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:20,190
they really don't want to eat because it's really uncomfortable and it's pretty immediate diarrhea and cramping for some people.

91
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,940
All right. So let's talk about the medical nutrition therapy.

92
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,860
So our goals for our patients after gastric surgery, we, of course,

93
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:37,100
want to promote optimal healing postoperatively, ensure adequate energy and protein intake.

94
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:43,880
They may need vitamin and mineral supplementation. Some may need nutrition support therapy as well.

95
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:49,610
If solid food. If progression to solid food does not proceed easily.

96
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:53,959
But we do for medical nutrition therapy and dumping syndrome.

97
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:58,220
We do. Like I said, educate them on this in case they do experience it.

98
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:02,450
So we want to prevent onset of early and late dumping syndromes.

99
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:08,390
So we have some very specific recommendations. So we want to avoid foods high in sugar.

100
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:13,870
And usually they'll say, look for no more than 12 grams of sugar per serving.

101
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:18,980
And I think you could look at 12 grams of added sugar, not total carbohydrate.

102
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:23,000
And again, that's because those are what we call.

103
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:35,160
Hypersonic. So those are the type of sounds that are going to move very quickly from a manipulated stomach into the small now.

104
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:40,080
And the small ball is not equipped to handle those kind of intact sugars.

105
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:47,990
Yes. So you say cigaret. I would look at more added sugar.

106
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:58,700
It's going to be more simple refined carbohydrates, fruits, potentially, but there's other nutrients and fiber in there that would slow that process.

107
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:04,709
Okay. Drink fluids 30 minutes before or after meals.

108
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:07,830
Not with meals. Why might we suggest this?

109
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:14,080
To keep our fluids separate. But it can be an added.

110
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,520
Yeah. It's just going to exacerbate that physiological process that's happening.

111
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:29,420
So we'll have to tell. I think even in the hospital, sometimes they deliver the fluids separately so they won't get them at the same time.

112
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:37,080
Yeah. What's the real reason of drinking 30 minutes prior to turning?

113
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:47,480
I wouldn't I don't think it would be to dilute the digestive juices.

114
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:54,000
It would just not be to promote more because liquids do empty faster than solid.

115
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:59,670
So if we're drinking with meals and there's rapid gastric emptying, that could make it worse.

116
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,740
So we like to separate them 5 to 6 small meals a day.

117
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:08,459
Kind of same idea of smaller meals.

118
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:11,760
Is it still going to have the rapid gastric emptying?

119
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:16,920
But the symptoms are not going to be as bad when it's broken up throughout the day

120
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,790
as opposed to like one large meal that people can get pretty symptomatic with that.

121
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:28,479
All right. Last week when we talked about reflux, we talked about do not lie down.

122
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:35,440
Right, right after eating. So again, why would we say maybe lie down right after your meals for 30 minutes?

123
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:45,180
Yeah. Yeah. So in this case, we're having fast emptying from the stomach into the small bowel.

124
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:52,500
So lying down is kind of using gravity to our advantage to not promote that that quicker.

125
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:59,910
And try foods high in soluble fiber. Why might this be a good recommendation?

126
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:06,240
Yeah. Fiber delays, gastric emptying.

127
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:16,950
So think about that. When we talk about the end of lecture with delayed gastric emptying, our recommendations for fiber will be different.

128
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:24,330
So soluble fiber especially will be important for dumping syndrome.

129
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,850
Okay. So what else we do, of course, want to prevent development of nutrient deficiencies.

130
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:37,680
Sometimes liquid multivitamin and mineral supplements should be initiated.

131
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:46,890
And just to meet the draft drive for all established nutrients, liquids can be a little bit easier absorbed when there is rapid emptying.

132
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:57,810
Sometimes a chewable would also be okay, B12 injections might be initiated or like sublingual B12.

133
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:04,889
We'll talk about B12 in a little bit more detail as well. Why that is important following gastric surgery,

134
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:12,480
especially now that any additional supplementation may be required to correct any suboptimal levels of micronutrients.

135
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:26,400
They patients may need pancreatic enzyme supplementation following a little procedure so that Whipple surgery is pretty extensive.

136
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:32,760
So there's part of the stomach removed, part of the small bowel removed, and part of the pancreas is removed.

137
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:38,040
So a lot of healing taking place postoperatively. Those patients do lose a lot of weight.

138
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:41,940
When you remove part of the head of the pancreas, you do lose some.

139
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:48,780
You know, some ability to secrete those pancreatic enzymes in for digestion.

140
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:52,410
So sometimes these patients have to take enzyme replacement with meals as well.

141
00:15:54,970 --> 00:16:00,280
And then will provide any nutrition education that will promote optimal nutritional

142
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:06,009
intake and minimize their symptoms of malabsorption and or mal digestion.

143
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:12,909
So remember, malabsorption is going to be impaired transport of nutrients from the intestines into

144
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:18,490
the blood and mal digestion is incomplete breakdown of nutrients in the GI tract,

145
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:25,490
usually due to a lack of digestive enzymes. And if they do have to take their pancreatic enzymes,

146
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:32,660
we have them take them just before their meals and snacks and we'll we'll talk later in the semester when we do cystic fibrosis.

147
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:37,999
How to actually dose those. It's different. It's it's probably a little bit different for CFS.

148
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,640
So we don't go into that specific specifics here, but we will talk about pancreatic cancer and replacement.

149
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:49,650
Later in the semester. Questions Yeah, I thought for sure,

150
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:57,110
and I thought they were like different types of surgeries where they like cut stomach and attach things to different places.

151
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:01,690
I was just wondering for the dumping syndrome, like does that only happen with certain surgeries?

152
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:06,980
Because I thought in other parts it was like that the early bowel was like past.

153
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:13,850
Yes. So dumping syndrome is specific to gastric surgery.

154
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:23,450
So any if any part of the stomach has been removed, which could be like a gastric bypass procedure or if somebody had a resection for a gastric tumor.

155
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:29,030
So any time part of the stomach is removed, there's a risk for dumping syndrome.

156
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:35,480
Now, some patients don't experience this. We really can't predict who's going to experience it and who isn't.

157
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:41,660
And maybe some people that have only had a small part of their stomach resected, they don't have as much of an issue.

158
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:51,770
Some of the newer bariatric surgery procedures, this doesn't happen as often because they've got like with the sleeve.

159
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,969
We'll talk about that.

160
00:17:52,970 --> 00:18:01,520
But this is dumping syndrome is specific to anybody that hasn't had part of their stomach removed, whether it's due to a weight loss surgery or not.

161
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:10,219
Yeah. There's a lot of like protein powders or things like that.

162
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:16,820
Too fast for them. Broken down for them to eat.

163
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:28,000
We want them to eat normally. So there's no real restrictions on like a dumping diet or gastric surgery diet.

164
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:38,960
We'll talk about gastric bypass. But aside from really watching the concentrated sugars, maybe boosting the fiber content,

165
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:49,340
so soluble mostly soluble fiber and promoting like protein rich foods first because it is a surgery that has to heal.

166
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:55,940
So it can be hard to get enough calories and proteins, protein and postoperatively, if you're not feeling well.

167
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:59,850
We do. Yeah.

168
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:09,729
Okay. Things we would monitor in these patients their weight change a Whipple procedure.

169
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:13,930
They will lose weight probably a significant amount during that healing process.

170
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:22,120
Vitamin and mineral profiles will go into this more extensively why they're at risk for different deficiencies and then look at their food intake.

171
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:29,820
How are they doing postoperatively? You could have playing more on there, but these are just things we would definitely probably want to include.

172
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:49,220
Just want to check to see are. Okay.

173
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:52,780
Do not post. And we don't have a jumping guy yet.

174
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:59,690
But. Any questions on dumping syndrome?

175
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:06,700
Just one last question. Yeah. Did you say that? Doesn't usually have to.

176
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,770
People have specific surgery.

177
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:17,730
I think it's less likely to happen in somebody that had like that gastric sleeve procedure because

178
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:25,050
of the anatomy that's left of the stomach as opposed to the part that is the bottom part has.

179
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:29,870
Usually they are able to preserve the appearance and then they take off.

180
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:35,490
And the shape is it's less capacity, but it's still a similar kind of process.

181
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:39,330
There still is possible dumping that can happen after that.

182
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:46,080
If you didn't watch the lecture on the path of physiology of dumping syndrome, make sure you remove that.

183
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:50,070
Okay. All right.

184
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:54,990
So I never know. Like, I've always covered some bariatric surgery in this class.

185
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:03,670
I think it's important just to touch on it, because we now we're starting to see or at least even when I was in the hospital,

186
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:13,240
patients that are like several years post-op from their bariatric surgery now the procedures have gotten less invasive and safer.

187
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:17,770
So the complications are fewer now.

188
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:26,559
But I have seen a number of patients that are ten, 15 years post-op that have now gone the complete opposite direction,

189
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:31,060
where they have significant nutrient deficiencies, they're malnourished.

190
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,730
So it's important to understand,

191
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:41,230
I think we're going to be seeing more of that now that people are now several years post-op when this was gotten more popular.

192
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,540
So I think it's important for Time's Up.

193
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:53,800
One of the other polls I posted on it is, okay, if you didn't read the suggested reading, but I want to talk about this a little bit.

194
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:57,250
So it says in there the length of the rule.

195
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:06,040
And if we're thinking about like a rule like gastric bypass surgery may vary from 50 to 150 centimeters, depending on the patient's BMI.

196
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:11,530
The longer the ruling, the greater will be the malabsorption.

197
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:27,360
Can anybody tell me why that is? So the ruling is the new section that's now attached to the gastric pouch that the food will now travel.

198
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:36,450
So if that new rule or elementary limits kind of interchangeable is longer, the longer it is, why will there be more malabsorption?

199
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:45,890
Yeah. Would there be less contact with enzymes to digest that for that.

200
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:53,870
Yes, exactly. So the longer that limb is, it's going to attach lower down to the genome.

201
00:22:54,200 --> 00:23:03,650
So there is going to be less contact with digestive juices like stomach acid, gallbladder secretions and even pancreatic cancer.

202
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,970
So there's going to be significant malabsorption happening.

203
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:13,550
This is a malabsorption procedure, but the longer that limb is, the lower down it connects to the genome,

204
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:20,480
the less contact it will have or the less opportunity it will have to to have nutrient absorption.

205
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:30,430
Okay. So let's look at some potential nutrition diagnoses for our bariatric surgery patients.

206
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:40,370
Now, if we just went through like looked at a, let's say, anthropometric data, we didn't know that they had bariatric surgery.

207
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:45,610
We saw the degree of weight loss and how they were eating. We probably think they would meet criteria for malnutrition.

208
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:49,030
These are elective weight loss procedures.

209
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:54,670
So especially immediately when we're expecting a certain degree of weight loss, we wouldn't use malnutrition.

210
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:58,840
We'd find we there's other diagnoses that may make more sense.

211
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:06,790
My patients that I see like 15 years postoperatively that are losing weight, they're deficient in micronutrients.

212
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:11,469
Yes. Those are going to be malnourished patients if they meet that criteria.

213
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:17,590
But immediately postoperatively or like even the first year or two, that weight loss is expected.

214
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:25,060
But there's other nutritional deficits that we need to highlight and recognize if those are occurring.

215
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:33,510
So one of the ones that we'll talk about in a little bit more detail will be increased nutrient needs for vitamin B12.

216
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,890
And this is related to impaired nutrient utilization,

217
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:44,590
as evidenced by resection of stomach in small bowel, including the area responsible for B12 absorption.

218
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:53,670
You can also add if you had a level that demonstrated and the May level if it demonstrated that they were deficient,

219
00:24:55,110 --> 00:25:00,810
but these patients will have increased nutrient needs for certain vitamins and minerals and B12 would be one of them.

220
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:15,070
Other diagnoses I probably wouldn't use would be like overweight or obesity, although that is being addressed by their surgery.

221
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:19,750
That's kind of like not something we're going to do a whole lot about.

222
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:27,400
So there's other more like acute things I would focus on. Yeah. For the B12 if we.

223
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:32,930
I'm just confused that we would give more B12 if that part of the stomach is still gone.

224
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:36,340
Is it just like can it be observed slightly in other areas? Get more?

225
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:48,910
Yes. So that's a good question. Like we like over supplements because the what they're they are able to break down and utilize some B12,

226
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:53,020
but they're high rates of deficiency because of the stomach resection.

227
00:25:53,350 --> 00:26:01,930
So it's almost like we give more than enough to, to kind of promote optimal absorption from a greater amount.

228
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:08,400
Yeah. Injections. Often it is through injection.

229
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:12,350
Sometimes we'll do like sublingual. So under the tongue that can be absorbed easier.

230
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:17,750
But just taking like oral B12 supplements is probably not optimal.

231
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:25,910
Yeah. So the humorous section. Just depending on how big the.

232
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:36,920
Um. The absorption or the microbes in that area should.

233
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:41,750
Does that make sense? Yes, i, i.

234
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:45,760
Let me see if I can answer your question. So it does her.

235
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:55,930
It does depend on the degree of the reception or what section of the stomach is removed and how much how many parietal cells are removed.

236
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,590
Our GI tract in general can adapt,

237
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:09,820
so other parts of the bowel can start to adapt and take on some absorptive capacity of resected parts of the bowel, especially the ilium.

238
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:15,520
If we're lots of things are absorbed in the duodenum, injured, you know, if we're bypassing a lot of that,

239
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:22,390
our ilium can eventually kind of transition to take on some of that role.

240
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:26,800
But that does take a lot of time, even years for that to happen.

241
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:31,200
Is that kind of what you're asking? Yes.

242
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:34,780
So our body is pretty good at adapting, but that will take time.

243
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:43,650
Let's see. What else might we have? Inadequate mineral intake.

244
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:50,250
A lot of patients will talk in. The MMT are supposed to be on vitamin and mineral supplements for quite a long time.

245
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:57,060
A lot of people, after maybe the first year, are not so compliant and that they can develop some deficiencies.

246
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:09,960
I've seen excessive energy intake used before that maybe that could be due to like lack of previous diet education.

247
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:16,170
And if you had evidence of that or the different types of foods that they're supposed to be avoiding.

248
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:22,230
So there's lots of potential for different diagnoses here.

249
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,330
Okay. So I'm not going to spend a ton of time on this.

250
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:36,690
But the the diet after bariatric surgery is based upon a staged approach with emphasis on nutritional needs at each stage of healing and weight loss.

251
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:42,600
And we give consideration to texture and volume of food that the patients can tolerate.

252
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:48,680
And it really depends on what type of surgery they had. Yes. Did you see this?

253
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:53,940
It was a small bowel syndrome with very.

254
00:28:55,950 --> 00:29:00,320
Smells like shortcuts. Yes. Yes.

255
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:08,670
Especially like those more invasive procedures, like the pancreatic below or the below pancreatic duodenal switch.

256
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:13,680
They don't do that as much anymore. Ruined. Why there?

257
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:18,540
Because it's an intentional surgery. They're not. That would be less likely.

258
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:26,730
The surgeon's not going to remove or bypass too much of the small bowel to where you at, like a shortcut syndrome type of situation.

259
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:36,479
That tends to happen more with surgeries, resections, where they have to take out maybe more disease bowel than they were expecting.

260
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,080
And now they're left with what we call like short bowel syndrome or shortcut.

261
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:47,280
So not likely to happen unless something would then go wrong and maybe they'd have to go back in and take out more bowel.

262
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:55,740
And again, the diet will be dictated by the weight loss surgery that was that had occurred.

263
00:29:55,770 --> 00:30:02,970
So where I'm kind of focusing on like the reason why, because that is a more conservative procedure, but we're seeing many more gastric sleeves.

264
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:09,780
The complications after those and the nutritional effects are less after a gastric sleeve.

265
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:16,290
I know this is kind of hard to see. We're not going to go through it.

266
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,190
But you could see, like when they're in the hospital,

267
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:28,749
what they might receive so post-op they wanted to non-carbonated low kilocalories, low sugar, no caffeine, no alcohol.

268
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:32,740
So they're on clear liquids that are essentially no sugar.

269
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:39,240
So what might that be? That would be like no added sugar.

270
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:45,580
They can have decaffeinated tea, they can have clear broth.

271
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:49,719
I believe water, of course, but not a whole lot.

272
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:56,580
They can have the first two days. Yeah, I was just wondering about that because it seems like one.

273
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:05,970
Yes. So are they. So they're at this for about.

274
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:16,380
It's crazy. What is the thing?

275
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:24,980
Ending her life for. Yeah.

276
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:34,930
So that's a good question. I should say the the likelihood that they're going to get to the more extreme under another state is that's less common.

277
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:44,170
But we do see that and I think we'll maybe see a little bit more of that now that we have more data patient center um a long time

278
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:53,290
post-op now because this was you know he's got really popular um 1020 years ago now they're so popular that the procedures are safer.

279
00:31:53,770 --> 00:32:00,510
So. You know, people have different thoughts on bariatric surgery.

280
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:05,589
I think the data is compelling that some people essentially are able to reverse

281
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:09,999
chronic disease or really lower chronic disease risk like type two diabetes,

282
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:21,159
cardiovascular disease. And the the considerable health burden that that may left would be overall like a benefit for a certain population.

283
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:28,930
Now some are going to go and have complications and then become malnourished with different trends, but that wouldn't be an expected outcome.

284
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:36,879
We have pretty close protocols and follow up plans in place that sometimes things just get lost or patients don't follow them,

285
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,880
or they have more and more complex surgery.

286
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:48,159
So that's a good question. But I don't this is not like the common outcome to have like pull on nutritional issues.

287
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:51,670
Most people do quite well and they do gain some weight back.

288
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:58,510
That's expected once their stomach capacity kind of changes or adapts a little bit.

289
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,059
Okay. So you see, like if we we'll start with clear liquids,

290
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:08,889
then they'll go to something like called full liquids where they can have things that have protein.

291
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:12,250
So like some dairy foods, protein powders, things like that.

292
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:20,470
Even things like putting yogurt, those types of textures are often considered for liquids.

293
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:29,140
But again, still that limited amount of sugar recommendation and that is due to the potential for dumping syndrome.

294
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:39,860
Okay. And you can see, like after, you know, 10 to 14 days post-op what they might go to.

295
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:44,629
They can have more like soft, moist protein foods.

296
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:51,200
We're always kind of pushing the protein foods first. Why might we do that after somebody has had any type of gastric surgery?

297
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:57,240
Yeah, they are healing in their stomach.

298
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:00,930
Capacity is very small, so they're only going to be able to eat a small volume.

299
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:04,979
So we want that volume to be of maximum benefit to them.

300
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:10,590
So each are protein foods first, so you don't fill up on like clear liquids or stuff.

301
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,360
That's not going to get a whole lot of nutrition.

302
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:21,070
Okay and you can see about four weeks post-op advanced diet as tolerated just to like kind of a regular

303
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:30,160
diet some things that are going to be maybe softer still or a little bit less fiber always protein first.

304
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:37,720
And adequate hydration is really important as well. Okay.

305
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:45,910
We'll just connect. You can always look through this, but this is just an example of the staged approach where it is several weeks before they're

306
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:51,910
actually like kind of on a a regular diet and there's still capacity or volume limits there.

307
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:58,030
Often they eat several times a day. They'll have like a protein drink or something to ensure they're getting enough protein.

308
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:08,130
But this is a whole process like there are if you have any of you like shadowed or been to a bariatric clinic or yeah,

309
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:16,290
there's always a couple of students that do that and they really like or you get really involved with working with the patient.

310
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:23,770
Did you have any experience that you want to share? Some patients are like waiting to have surgery for like.

311
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:29,880
Sure. So they go through a. Like I'm adapting a very old lifestyle.

312
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:36,120
And then you roll the dice or something. So, yeah, it's a whole.

313
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:45,340
It's not like patients are definitely screened to be appropriate because this is a big lifestyle change for many reasons,

314
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:49,990
not just how they're going to be eat, but how they're going to be eating lots of other things.

315
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:57,850
There is a big psychological component with this whole process and that degree of weight loss that can be expected.

316
00:35:57,850 --> 00:36:05,740
So it can take some time to actually between inquiring about getting the surgery and then when they actually get the surgery,

317
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:10,060
they usually work pretty closely with the dietician throughout that whole process.

318
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:20,290
All right. Let's talk about why we see some deficiencies in this population.

319
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:27,370
So talking about gastric surgery in general for whatever reason, and also potentially bariatric surgery.

320
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:37,600
So we talked about protein. While people may have an adequate protein or protein deficiency is usually they're not eating enough.

321
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:42,610
So they have just overall decreased intake, decreased volume of protein consumption.

322
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:48,580
We want them to eat their high protein foods before other foods that would be

323
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:53,980
lower in protein and tend to fill them up really because of that healing process.

324
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:00,010
They may need to supplement with like a protein powder or or some type of protein supplement.

325
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:06,250
And we like to work towards just like a general goal of 60 to 80 grams per day.

326
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:13,170
So for some of our patients, that's still going to be quite low, like our patients with very large BMI.

327
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:19,510
But still that would be the amount we try to work to in the mouth that would be feasible given their new stomach capacity.

328
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:27,910
So that's kind of just like a blanket recommendation, and that may change depending on the patient or what institution you're at.

329
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:39,160
Okay. Calcium. So why do we see calcium deficiency potentially could be due to bypassing the absorption side.

330
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:49,180
So if somebody has had a malabsorption procedure and we bypassed part of the duodenum and the upper part of the jejuni,

331
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:53,950
we could lose some of the absorption, optimal absorption sites for calcium.

332
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:59,319
We do supplement with 1200 to 1500 milligrams of calcium citrate.

333
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:06,070
So this is a form of calcium for by over the counter that tends to be best tolerated.

334
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:12,879
And we spread out the meals to decrease the risk of of oxalate stones.

335
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:18,760
Not everybody is going to be prone to those that's usually in people that are prone to kidney stones.

336
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:25,430
And usually if people are prone to actually kidney stones, um,

337
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:33,610
calcium supplementation can be a risk factor for that, not necessarily calcium from foods themselves.

338
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:42,440
We want them to take calcium supplements separately from iron supplements and iron containing foods.

339
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:47,420
So calcium in large amounts can inhibit iron absorption.

340
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:52,970
So we have patients take them separately because they can impact health.

341
00:38:53,480 --> 00:39:02,600
How I heard it's absorption. Then we'll always have vitamin D with the calcium supplements, or at least take it separately.

342
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,750
But they will have have vitamin D supplementation as well.

343
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:11,100
Okay.

344
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:19,660
So Ion, why might we see iron deficiency again, possibly bypassing the primary absorption site, which is the duodenum and the upper part of that,

345
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:26,100
you know, a decreased amount of gastric acid depending on how much of their stomach has been removed.

346
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:35,430
So acid iron does like an acidic environment for optimal friction, decreased intake of high iron foods potentially.

347
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:45,959
There are reports and our studies have shown that there's more tolerance or just an aversion to red meat after gastric bypass surgery,

348
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:49,110
which is a source of of good humor.

349
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:56,820
Of course, you can get iron from plenty of other source sources, but we see we have seen that in the literature as well.

350
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:07,579
Other considerations. If we have, let's say, a female patient that's still menstruating after a gastric bypass procedure,

351
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:13,489
they're are going to be more susceptible to iron deficiency. Do we want to take iron separately from calcium?

352
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:19,460
We talked about that to optimize absorption of these high oxalate foods as well.

353
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:23,299
These are like dark greens, generally like kale, spinach.

354
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:28,100
Those types of things can also impair the absorption of.

355
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:35,540
Of iron mostly not my hair. So that's just a consideration as well.

356
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:45,770
And we do kind of over supplements. So. 18 to 27 milligrams of elemental iron maybe a little bit more if it's a female

357
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:51,139
patient who's menstruating in the supplement can be taken in a multivitamin.

358
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:56,180
Often multivitamins don't have enough iron, so they might have to take more on top of that.

359
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:03,390
And sometimes we'll say to take iron supplements or eat the iron rich foods with those that are high in vitamin A,

360
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:10,669
vitamin C, vitamin C combines with non-game iron to form a compound that is more easily absorbed.

361
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:20,240
So if you guys all heard this before, like put red bell peppers on your spinach salad to optimize the absorption of the iron in the spinach.

362
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:25,580
So it is still a recommendation we use because it can be helpful.

363
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:32,100
Okay. B12, let's talk about B12.

364
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:41,760
So it is relatively common, especially after a ruined wide gastric bypass occurs in about one third or more patients postoperatively.

365
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:52,860
So the etiology of the deficiency, inadequate contact with intrinsic factor, decreased gastric acid and low intake of foods rich in vitamin B12.

366
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:59,070
So who can tell me why decreased gastric acid might matter.

367
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:08,200
With B12 and why it might be especially important in these patients that have had part of their stomach for.

368
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:15,370
Want to ask you to prepare for the.

369
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:26,709
Yes. So it's involved in kind of the first part of absorption of B12 so often.

370
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:29,920
And this is like specific to Bruin. Why? Because that's the procedure.

371
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,900
We see the highest rates of B12.

372
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:41,530
There are relatively few parietal cells present in the small gastric pouch that is remaining because a lot of the fundus has been removed.

373
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:46,210
And these are the cells that help secrete this gastric acid.

374
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:55,970
So inadequate gastric acid is available for the initial step of absorption, which is the cleavage of vitamin B12 from dietary protein.

375
00:42:56,550 --> 00:43:04,510
Okay. So that very first step to kind of get the B12 off the protein can be inhibited

376
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:08,200
because we've lost now a lot of these trial cells by removing the fundus.

377
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,850
So there's not enough gastric acid.

378
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:19,390
Additionally, a decreased amount of intrinsic factor may be available after gastric surgery due to the nature of what has been removed.

379
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:28,180
Intrinsic factor, of course, binds to B12. After attaching to the intrinsic factor, the B12 travels to the intestines to be absorbed.

380
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:32,320
So this entire process is disrupted to some degree,

381
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:39,249
both the initial cleavage of B12 from protein and then the ability in contact

382
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:44,770
with intrinsic factor to travel to the rest of the GI tract to be absorbed.

383
00:43:46,810 --> 00:43:57,220
So we do monitor B12 levels and supplementation is usually with a sublingual B12 which is rapidly absorbed into the blood vessels under the tongue.

384
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:02,770
Or some patients may opt for a monthly injection if they require that amount.

385
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:14,579
All right. So let's just talk about a couple of other things. Diamond absorbed primarily in the duodenum and proximal jejune them.

386
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:18,780
Again, lots of vitamins and minerals are formed in this area.

387
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:23,970
So for bypassing that, we have risk for some deficiencies to develop over time.

388
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:33,570
The ruined Y and the below pancreatic duodenum switch patients below pancreatic diversion two are not switch patients.

389
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:42,700
Their risk is elevated since their alimentary path or that RU limb bypasses the duodenum and the proximal.

390
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:48,630
So those are the more malabsorption procedures. So the rate of malabsorption is a little bit higher.

391
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:55,540
So deficiencies of these water soluble vitamins can happen really quickly.

392
00:44:55,550 --> 00:45:02,680
So even within three weeks after surgery, if the patient is, let's say, having a lot of GI symptoms,

393
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:08,680
maybe having a lot of vomiting or really not eating well, these can this can happen quickly.

394
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:13,920
You guys don't need to know these specific recommendations.

395
00:45:13,930 --> 00:45:18,549
I'm just giving you an idea of what type of recommendations may happen.

396
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:25,990
So they might require I.V. thiamin intramuscular administration and then an oral maintenance dose.

397
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:34,210
So like a pretty aggressive depletion. And then they'll be some like a maintenance dose that they can take orally.

398
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:46,360
Okay. Vitamin D3, the etiology is due to decrease amount of gastric acid potential fat malabsorption,

399
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:49,630
which worsens the absorption of all of our fat soluble vitamins.

400
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:58,150
And all of these patients will be on vitamin D supplementation and a little bit may be higher than like a normal maintenance adult dose.

401
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:05,589
And to serve fat soluble vitamins in general or a Dex or a D and K.

402
00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:12,160
Those are fat soluble vitamins. The jejune M and the ilium are the primary sites for absorption of this class of vitamins,

403
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:19,210
and this is more likely to occur with a greater portion of the jejune and is bypassed or removed.

404
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:25,900
But again, that ilium the ilium can adapt pretty well if that just can take some time.

405
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:38,700
Okay. So what are some long term complications if there is other micronutrient deficiencies out there?

406
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:41,890
So if you're interested in this, I would read that paper I posted.

407
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:45,640
It's just a good paper that reviews some of this.

408
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:53,649
I had a patient years ago when I was working in patient with really severe neuropathy.

409
00:46:53,650 --> 00:47:01,420
Like they could not walk well, like their gait had been altered and this patient was maybe ten years post-op from a gastric bypass,

410
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:06,340
but doing well otherwise like that was ten years ago.

411
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:13,749
They were they were doing fine, but they had all these issues with neuropathy and walking and the patient had

412
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:21,580
not been taking the vitamin and mineral supplements as like routinely because,

413
00:47:21,790 --> 00:47:25,030
you know, several years post-op doing really well.

414
00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:32,950
And we ended up checking a copper level because that can happen with which is the nature of

415
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:37,779
the surgery and this patient had a copper deficiency that we pretty things pretty sure I

416
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:44,649
think was responsible for that neuropathy and a difficulty walking and that could be like

417
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:51,850
a long long term effect of an adequate intake and supplementation of that trace element.

418
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:57,719
So a really interesting case. We're going to write it up but as like a case report.

419
00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:57,990
But.

420
00:47:59,470 --> 00:48:07,660
It's just interesting that we don't we didn't really know, like, what kind of long term complications are possible in our seemingly healthy patients,

421
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:17,440
that they may be at risk for developing some long term or some micronutrient deficiencies if they're not monitored annually.

422
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:23,600
So that paper kind of gets into that. What are some potential long term considerations?

423
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:35,440
Okay. So just some other deficiencies that can arise. I think this is absorbed in the duodenum and the upper part of the jejuni.

424
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:44,650
It can be linked to fat absorption and zinc deficiency, can follow a bypass or malabsorption very malabsorption bariatric operations.

425
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:49,600
That's why we have these protocols in place for their vitamin and mineral supplementation.

426
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:54,670
Copper absorbed in the stomach and the upper part of the duodenum,

427
00:48:54,820 --> 00:49:03,910
which that's both of those sites are manipulated usually during in a ruined why not necessarily a gastric sleeve.

428
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:10,040
Deficiency can be worsened by iodine supplements, which these patients will be on.

429
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:14,110
Selenium absorbed in the duodenum and proximal to genome.

430
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:18,849
We do see this in 14 to 22% of patients.

431
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:24,280
That number may have been this is, I think, a couple of years on this.

432
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:33,450
Statistic, but if anything, I think that might be a little bit better because we're kind of getting away from these more extensive procedures.

433
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:42,010
Okay. So this the point is these patients need to be on supplementation and they need to be on that pretty much long term.

434
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:48,250
So two multivitamins daily that include iron are recommended, especially at first.

435
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:55,040
So we do recommend a chewable or liquid form for the first month of gummy formulations.

436
00:49:55,040 --> 00:50:00,030
So they may take a gummy multivitamin. Always look at.

437
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:04,400
A lot of times there's no minerals and that type of thing that I always tell you.

438
00:50:04,410 --> 00:50:11,240
When I'm talking to parents of my little patients, they're they're usually like a gummy that has like no iron, no calcium, nothing.

439
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:18,000
So the zombies don't usually they're not complete, whereas some of the two more liquid forms are.

440
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:27,850
And then the patient will have to be on calcium citrate and those should be dosed throughout the day, so not take it all at once.

441
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:33,430
So The Flintstones complete is actually a really good one. It contains some some iron.

442
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:40,300
And often our our adult patients will be on that to of those at least for that first month.

443
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:51,940
Often they'll be on sublingual vitamin B12. They'll be on vitamin D if additional iron is needed.

444
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:55,540
They might take that with vitamin C to maximize absorption.

445
00:50:56,170 --> 00:51:01,240
And we do recommend 2 hours between iron and calcium supplements so they don't interfere with each other.

446
00:51:03,990 --> 00:51:11,340
Okay. I did post some patient education on the multivitamin and mineral supplements for these patients.

447
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:23,420
And then after a month, they can switch to pills. But that first month, it's important that they're on those chewable liquid forms.

448
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:30,450
And this gives a list of ones that would be considered like complete chewable options here.

449
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:41,500
And then it just goes into some more specifics, which is really helpful for sometimes for patients to have.

450
00:51:42,310 --> 00:51:47,770
You just want to make sure if we gave this patient handout that it is actually what their doctor is recommending.

451
00:51:50,850 --> 00:51:54,540
Okay. Let's see if there's something I wanted to point out here.

452
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:57,179
Okay. So this says do not buy time. Really?

453
00:51:57,180 --> 00:52:04,880
So, like, have you guys seen medications or supplements that'll say delayed release or extended release, too?

454
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:08,350
What does that mean? So we know.

455
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:12,480
Yeah. How it is digested.

456
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:16,260
Like usually when it's extended release, it's in a capsule.

457
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:26,160
So it's a little bit takes a while to. Get broken down and have it going to be absorbed where it is like an instant release.

458
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:30,550
Usually not coded. It is kind of chunkier.

459
00:52:31,490 --> 00:52:34,520
Easily absorbed. Yes, exactly.

460
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:40,880
So why might an extended release, medication or supplement not be ideal for these patients?

461
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:48,000
Oh, good, good. No, you do better because.

462
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:52,530
It might take too long to absorb. Or the breakdown might not.

463
00:52:53,980 --> 00:53:02,170
Yeah. So now we've had, we've had a manipulation of the GI tract, so that increased intestinal length can reduce the overall absorption time.

464
00:53:02,170 --> 00:53:10,000
So it might be released too late or too soon depending on the medication.

465
00:53:10,450 --> 00:53:14,349
So when prescribed incorrectly,

466
00:53:14,350 --> 00:53:21,549
those types of medication after bariatric surgery can cause the patient to absorb too much or it can lead to leg ulceration.

467
00:53:21,550 --> 00:53:24,850
So they have to be careful with with that type of thing.

468
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:31,930
Yeah. Um, with the last line replaced, some of the vitamins are like children's ones for adults.

469
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:35,150
They just take more. Or do they take a children's now?

470
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:42,700
They'll take to the like. Usually they'll take double like I know for I think it's for the Flintstones.

471
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:46,660
They take two of them. They might even have to take more than that.

472
00:53:47,110 --> 00:53:53,870
Yeah, they'll take a higher amount of them. Yeah.

473
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:59,480
It's beneficial to have them to see, you know, before they start to use.

474
00:54:02,190 --> 00:54:05,430
I don't know. I haven't, I haven't heard of that or.

475
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:18,820
Yeah, I don't know. Because this and.

476
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:23,330
Still have this as part of the US?

477
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:29,760
Sure. You know, I'm not as familiar with if that is a recommendation, but I could see the rationale.

478
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:34,120
But I don't know what to do with that. Yeah. Okay.

479
00:54:39,590 --> 00:54:41,239
Okay. And then it'll reinforce.

480
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:48,860
Do not take your other vitamins at the same time as your calcium, because the calcium and iron in the multivitamin will compete for absorption.

481
00:54:50,030 --> 00:54:55,640
So take them a couple of hours apart. Want them to spread out their dose of calcium.

482
00:54:55,850 --> 00:54:58,680
So not take all 1200 milligrams at once.

483
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:06,380
That is a little tough on the GI tract, but also can make patients that are more prone to kidney stones that could make it worse.

484
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:12,140
It's best to take calcium supplements with meals, but really the citrate, you don't have to.

485
00:55:12,590 --> 00:55:18,239
So but this is a common recommendation. You'll see. All right.

486
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:22,320
So what other considerations might come up in our gastric bypass patients?

487
00:55:24,090 --> 00:55:32,790
In terms of monitoring, we do want to we do want to monitor certain laboratory tests for vitamins and minerals there,

488
00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:37,620
you know, blood pounds for signs of anemia, electrolyte pills.

489
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:44,580
Usually those are performed three months postoperatively six months and then hopefully annually thereafter.

490
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:54,090
And that would be important. So we can try and catch any potential deficiencies that are happening even when the patient is seemingly doing well.

491
00:55:54,090 --> 00:56:00,629
So we do want some annual monitoring of certain vitamins and minerals and then additional

492
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:06,450
testing if we think that there are nutritional deficits or those are being identified.

493
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:14,500
What else we might monitor for. Disordered eating patterns can arise in in these patients,

494
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:22,000
although there is a big screening process to ensure that patients are well equipped to handle the surgery and all that comes with that.

495
00:56:23,950 --> 00:56:26,240
But we do see higher rates of disordered eating.

496
00:56:26,350 --> 00:56:32,950
There are a significant number of individuals that go into weight loss surgery with disordered eating behavior.

497
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:39,639
So it could be. Binge eating disorder or other disordered eating patterns.

498
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:47,549
So we might not always disclose these behaviors, although there is a big kind of screening process.

499
00:56:47,550 --> 00:56:53,340
But in order to maintain the weight loss that typically follows the surgery,

500
00:56:53,340 --> 00:57:02,970
this involves a big change to lifestyle and eating patterns, so that can be very difficult to implement and maintain for some patients.

501
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:10,860
Okay. So the big takeaway is these patients, especially with bariatric surgery.

502
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:15,000
Yes, it is a an intentional procedure in most situations.

503
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:22,800
But there are definitely some nutrition implications that we have to to address and monitor.

504
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:29,330
Okay. So we're going to finish up today with a discussion of Gastroparesis.

505
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:38,000
So whereas we talk about rapid stomach emptying in dumping syndrome, Gastroparesis is kind of the opposite thing happening.

506
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:48,110
So this is delayed gastric emptying, and this is characterized by abnormally delayed emptying of foods, particularly solid foods from the stomach.

507
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:52,820
Usually liquids, liquid emptying as is preserved for the most part.

508
00:57:54,920 --> 00:58:03,530
So this occurs when the vagus nerve, which controls the movement of food from the stomach through the digestive tract, is damaged.

509
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:11,839
So from the recorded lecture, remember that disruption of the vagus nerve to the parietal cells of the proximal part of the

510
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:19,230
stomach can decrease the secretion of gastric acid and reduce cellular response to gastric.

511
00:58:20,210 --> 00:58:28,100
But if a lot if total parietal cell innovation is severed or damaged or there's like of the economy work,

512
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:36,050
like the vagus nerve is really manipulated that can control or impact gastric emptying significantly.

513
00:58:36,230 --> 00:58:41,629
So the vagus nerve is is kind of involved in multiple things, the gastric acid secretion.

514
00:58:41,630 --> 00:58:46,550
But if it's more damage to that nerve, we can see issues with gastric.

515
00:58:49,510 --> 00:58:53,740
As a result, the muscles of the stomach and the intestines do not work normally,

516
00:58:54,190 --> 00:58:58,960
and food then moves slowly or stops moving through the digestive tract.

517
00:59:01,270 --> 00:59:04,750
So this is very uncomfortable. Our patients with gastroparesis.

518
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:10,150
You can see vast majority of patients are nauseous.

519
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:18,399
Many will have vomiting, abdominal pain, either specific or nonspecific early satiety.

520
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:22,030
So a feeling of being really full, even after just a couple of bites.

521
00:59:23,230 --> 00:59:26,530
And then the other, you know, after eating just full is bloating.

522
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:30,040
And most of these patients will experience some degree of weight loss.

523
00:59:35,930 --> 00:59:45,379
All right. So diagnosing gastroparesis. Usually you can get a sense just based on, like, what they're telling you, their clinical history,

524
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:50,900
diet history, all that is if they're experiencing something like delayed gastric emptying.

525
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:55,610
But the the way this would be diagnosed is called a gastric emptying study.

526
00:59:56,150 --> 01:00:02,660
And we'll take a look at what that might look like. Essentially, they're going to eat a certain volume of food.

527
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:09,620
I think traditionally it's so scrambled eggs and then they're going to look and see

528
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:13,339
how much of that food is still retained in the stomach at different time periods.

529
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:23,570
So gastric retention of more than 60% at 2 hours and more than 10% at 4 hours is diagnostic of just delayed gastric emptying.

530
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:29,390
The greater retention seen at that four hour mark is associated with increased severity.

531
01:00:35,790 --> 01:00:44,090
Okay. So these this picture like the ABC doesn't necessarily coincide with the mild, moderate, severe.

532
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:50,219
So hopefully that's not too confusing. But this is at the four hour mark.

533
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:55,590
So mild gastroparesis would be if there's 10 to 15% retention.

534
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:59,280
You guys don't need to know these numbers. I'm just trying to give you a kind of an idea.

535
01:00:59,730 --> 01:01:09,960
Moderate gastroparesis would be 15 to 35% retention of the food contents in the stomach and then severe would be like greater than 35%.

536
01:01:11,170 --> 01:01:14,500
So this little picture here of a gastric emptying study.

537
01:01:15,070 --> 01:01:20,470
This a patient is a healthy control patient with normal gastric emptying time.

538
01:01:21,890 --> 01:01:24,910
And this is. Essentially the stuff in here.

539
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:34,670
And you can see the food that's highlighted. B is a patient with rapid gastric emptying.

540
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:40,010
So you can see that the food actually moved very quickly from the stomach into the small ball.

541
01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:43,309
And then C this is a big atomized patient.

542
01:01:43,310 --> 01:01:54,139
So this was where the vagus nerve had been either intentionally removed or damaged and they have severely increased gastric emptying time.

543
01:01:54,140 --> 01:02:03,260
So you can see that at that four hour mark or this is at the two hour mark, a considerable amount of content is still in the stomach.

544
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:12,480
Yes. Are you saying that you really don't know this?

545
01:02:12,510 --> 01:02:17,570
No. This is just showing rapid gastric emptying. This is like a healthy control.

546
01:02:17,580 --> 01:02:24,780
It's a two hour mark. You can see that the food is is starting to leave the stomach for the most part.

547
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:28,200
This is a sample of what the gastric emptying would look like.

548
01:02:28,530 --> 01:02:32,550
And this is where you get it. Not so fast.

549
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:37,410
So we don't we wouldn't know unless the patient actually said, I'm having.

550
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:42,630
Possibly. But this is this is what I looking at.

551
01:02:42,630 --> 01:02:50,160
This would be gastroparesis. So can you imagine if food is not moving out in the stomach?

552
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:55,350
It's just kind of sitting there quite uncomfortable and patients feel really, really sick.

553
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:00,630
All right. Let's talk a little bit about the disease process.

554
01:03:02,130 --> 01:03:11,880
Gastroparesis is often considered idiopathic, meaning that there really is not a known cause, so it can arise spontaneously.

555
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:14,910
But usually we have an idea of what may have led to that.

556
01:03:15,870 --> 01:03:22,380
So diabetes is the most frequently recognized systemic disease associated with Gastroparesis.

557
01:03:22,390 --> 01:03:29,400
So a lot of our diabetic patients, I would say especially are type one diabetic patients.

558
01:03:30,150 --> 01:03:37,170
A lot of them experience gastroparesis, and that's usually attributed to autonomic neuropathy.

559
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:44,700
Can anybody explain to me what might be happening here? Why might a diabetic patient experience gastroparesis?

560
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:54,530
Has anyone heard of like when patients have diabetes that they go in for, like, foot checks?

561
01:03:54,770 --> 01:03:59,730
And why do they do that? Yes.

562
01:03:59,740 --> 01:04:07,160
So if they are running really high, their blood sugar, high blood sugar or hypoglycemia can cause some nerve damage.

563
01:04:08,690 --> 01:04:12,589
And so that's why they have like these heated foot protocols,

564
01:04:12,590 --> 01:04:20,480
because sometimes they they might step on something and not feel it and they have maybe a cut that they can become infected.

565
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:30,079
We've seen people that get toes or even part of their limbs amputated as more of like an extreme manifestation of neuropathy.

566
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:37,050
So they have this nerve damage due to poorly controlled blood sugar and they can't really feel, you know, what's happening there.

567
01:04:37,070 --> 01:04:41,020
So the same thing can happen with the vagus nerve.

568
01:04:41,030 --> 01:04:50,299
So if they have really high or uncontrolled blood sugar, that can lead to nerve damage of the nerves that help control gastric emptying.

569
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:53,570
And then that can that can cause this gastroparesis.

570
01:04:57,380 --> 01:05:03,440
Okay. So delayed gastric emptying can then lead to worsening blood glucose control by altering

571
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:08,569
the pharmacokinetics and oral hypoglycemic agents and postprandial insulin levels.

572
01:05:08,570 --> 01:05:11,630
So if they're dosing their insulin,

573
01:05:11,990 --> 01:05:21,979
normally this food might not be in the right absorptive state for then the insulin to react on it because it's staying in the stomach.

574
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:29,570
So it's like this vicious cycle where their poor blood sugar can lead to poor gastric emptying, delayed,

575
01:05:29,570 --> 01:05:35,420
gastric emptying then can in fact affect how their blood sugar can be controlled because of the dosing of their insulin.

576
01:05:36,650 --> 01:05:44,390
So we can see really wide swings of hypoglycemia and then we can see unexpected postprandial hypoglycemia

577
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:51,040
because maybe they don't see their insulin and there's no substrate there for it to act on and then go well.

578
01:05:52,310 --> 01:05:57,500
So it can be very, very difficult to control with these patients.

579
01:05:58,100 --> 01:06:04,950
Yeah. Explain why you. Usually that's all I say.

580
01:06:04,950 --> 01:06:10,470
In my experience. It happens more often with type one diabetic because there's an insulin deficiency there.

581
01:06:11,850 --> 01:06:18,000
And so blood sugar management can be just more difficult because they do they have to dose insulin.

582
01:06:18,630 --> 01:06:23,520
So they tend to be a little bit more difficult to control.

583
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:33,860
So they're more prone to type of like. Hypoglycemic episodes now that most patients will be out of pumpkin their monitor very closely, that helps.

584
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:37,480
But those patients are more prone to things with.

585
01:06:43,270 --> 01:06:48,770
Okay. So in my experience, when I would get consulted in the hospital for Gastroparesis,

586
01:06:48,770 --> 01:06:55,159
often it was in a diabetic patient and they're just miserable because they they can't eat.

587
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:59,270
A lot of times they lose weight and this is up with their insulin dosing and they

588
01:06:59,270 --> 01:07:04,390
continue to run really high in their blood sugar and it can be really problematic.

589
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:07,610
So how do we treat gastroparesis?

590
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:11,450
And this is really from like a medication management.

591
01:07:11,870 --> 01:07:22,089
So usually initial management consists of dietary modification, which we'll talk about optimization of glycemic control if it is a diabetic patients.

592
01:07:22,090 --> 01:07:28,730
So getting those blood sugars under control will help in making sure the patient stays hydrated.

593
01:07:30,050 --> 01:07:36,740
Patients that are continuing to have symptoms, they might require medications so such as broken medications and antiemetics.

594
01:07:36,740 --> 01:07:43,160
So a pro kinetic agent is one that will increase or stimulate gastric emptying.

595
01:07:44,180 --> 01:07:52,100
So usually they'll take their pro kinetic 10 to 15 minutes before meals, and that should help to some degree.

596
01:07:52,370 --> 01:07:56,389
So there's a common one called wrinkling that you'll see patients on.

597
01:07:56,390 --> 01:08:01,459
So they'll take their regular and before eating, some might also be on erythromycin.

598
01:08:01,460 --> 01:08:08,600
So these are broken X and ANTIEMETICS These are just like anti-nausea anti vomiting medications.

599
01:08:08,990 --> 01:08:18,140
So they're using Gastroparesis is based on their efficacy in controlling nausea and vomiting, and a common one will be zofran.

600
01:08:19,310 --> 01:08:25,340
So it helps them tolerate helps control those symptoms so they can tolerate eating a little bit better.

601
01:08:26,940 --> 01:08:32,209
All right. So let's talk about medical nutrition therapy, small, frequent meals throughout the day.

602
01:08:32,210 --> 01:08:37,610
Remember, if you have slow gastric emptying, a larger meal is just going to take even longer.

603
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:46,160
So small frequent meals is helpful consumption of more liquid calories, especially if symptoms increase over the course of the day.

604
01:08:46,910 --> 01:08:50,930
Liquids do empty faster than solids in all of us.

605
01:08:51,470 --> 01:08:56,990
And for many, liquid emptying is preserved to some degree, even during Gastroparesis.

606
01:08:56,990 --> 01:09:02,210
So sometimes that's a way to get the calories in is through liquids and liquid supplements.

607
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:09,130
Chewing foods will help that process of breaking down the foods any way we can.

608
01:09:09,790 --> 01:09:15,820
Sitting up during, setting up during and for one or 2 hours after a meal may be helpful.

609
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:19,060
So different than what we talked about in dumping syndrome.

610
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:28,300
When there's rapid gastric emptying, we have to lay down when there's the have been we want them to sit up and help gravity work with them.

611
01:09:29,740 --> 01:09:34,420
Reducing the amount of fat consumed. Why would that be?

612
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:40,720
A recommendation and gastroparesis. Started to push up.

613
01:09:42,990 --> 01:09:47,010
Well, he might have heard. But what else in terms of.

614
01:09:50,230 --> 01:09:53,230
Yeah. That is harder to digest. Yeah.

615
01:09:53,250 --> 01:09:59,320
So Fat takes the longest to digest in all of us, so it kind of just hangs out in the stomach anyways.

616
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:07,150
So if you have a really high fat meal and you have gastroparesis for most people, that is when they have major symptoms.

617
01:10:07,150 --> 01:10:13,900
So that takes longer to digest. And so if there's delayed gastric emptying, that's just going to exacerbate the whole situation.

618
01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:21,260
Fat in liquids is usually tolerated, like a nutritional shake or like even like a milkshake type of thing.

619
01:10:22,270 --> 01:10:27,170
Yeah. Just sitting there.

620
01:10:27,230 --> 01:10:32,120
Sit. Yeah. It's just not digesting, but it just moves to the side.

621
01:10:35,210 --> 01:10:38,840
So this digestion of the.

622
01:10:40,810 --> 01:10:45,850
He's like. Well, yeah. It's really uncomfortable to just for.

623
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:55,960
Yeah, they will often they will be very cautious the moment, but they have like a really crazy army in this case, see?

624
01:10:56,270 --> 01:11:05,120
Like funding streams. In between meals I add to between breakfast and lunch just to have a perfect mix.

625
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:11,780
He seems to help them. Usually any way we can get the nutrition in and often through liquids.

626
01:11:11,780 --> 01:11:16,220
So fat in liquids usually is okay. It's not as.

627
01:11:19,370 --> 01:11:23,480
All right. Low fiber y. Low fiber. Yeah.

628
01:11:26,130 --> 01:11:30,060
Five delays, gastric emptying, fat delays, gastric emptying.

629
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:37,380
So when there's delayed, gastric emptying, we want to limit fat and fiber to some extent because that will often worsen symptoms.

630
01:11:39,820 --> 01:11:47,370
Yeah, but I understand we have three books floating down by the Melville, usually.

631
01:11:47,390 --> 01:11:53,410
Yeah. So, like, if you blended something up, that can help.

632
01:11:54,080 --> 01:12:01,780
Um, some people will do that. They'll like what we call, like, a homogenized meal, like blend it up into a liquid form.

633
01:12:01,780 --> 01:12:05,380
Even it has fiber that could be tolerated better.

634
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:10,980
Yeah. To discourage all bits of labor, mostly soluble fiber.

635
01:12:11,670 --> 01:12:19,020
I would say more general, like just very high fiber foods, whether it's insoluble or soluble.

636
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:24,940
Sometimes, again, if it's like more soluble fiber,

637
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:33,750
I guess even insoluble fiber that is blended or processed in a way that it can be maybe drank like in a drink.

638
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:42,590
That can be better. Yeah. It is a kind of long term good question.

639
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:51,150
It can improve. So if it is related to diabetes, if they get their blood sugar under control and it's consistently controlled, that can get better.

640
01:12:52,410 --> 01:12:57,660
Sometimes the nerve damage is significant that this can persist, though.

641
01:12:58,030 --> 01:13:01,100
So those. Those eggs.

642
01:13:02,820 --> 01:13:06,270
They might be. Yeah, they might be on the right, but just.

643
01:13:06,690 --> 01:13:10,739
And definitely with. But it can't.

644
01:13:10,740 --> 01:13:14,850
It can't get better. Um, let's see.

645
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:22,200
Okay, so this is, like, the basics. I did post a handout for my for gastroparesis, too.

646
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:28,860
So I want to finish with the case real quick. We should have enough time to kind of go over it together.

647
01:13:29,970 --> 01:13:38,460
So this is our patient, Janice. She's 36 year old female, admitted for an evaluation as a candidate for ruined y gastric bypass surgery,

648
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:43,500
given her BMI, co-morbidities and previous attempts to lose weight.

649
01:13:44,010 --> 01:13:49,080
In addition to an interprofessional assessment, she is considered a suitable candidate for the surgery.

650
01:13:50,210 --> 01:13:57,800
And you can see she works as an administrative assistant in a medical office and her information is provided in these slides.

651
01:13:58,040 --> 01:14:05,600
So she prevents presents for a regularly scheduled follow up with her surgeon in clinic three months later,

652
01:14:06,260 --> 01:14:08,990
although she's very happy with the results of her surgery,

653
01:14:09,010 --> 01:14:19,730
sure admits to having a problem with nausea and continued acetic acid reflux after asking about the foods that Jenna Jones has been preparing at home.

654
01:14:19,790 --> 01:14:23,150
The surgeon asks you, the dietician, to consult with the patient.

655
01:14:25,130 --> 01:14:32,060
So here's her current weight. This is about three months post-op, so she's down about £46.

656
01:14:33,110 --> 01:14:43,250
So here's her anthropometric. You see her medications here, vital signs and then her nutrition focused physical exam.

657
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:49,099
She appears fatigued, but otherwise healthy. So she's on anti reflux medication.

658
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:56,320
She's on vitamin B12, vitamin D3, calcium citrate plus D in her multivitamin with minerals.

659
01:14:56,330 --> 01:15:00,440
And then she's on a statin and a diuretic, maybe due to other conditions.

660
01:15:03,260 --> 01:15:06,559
So here is her past medical history, obesity, hypertension.

661
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:12,830
She's pre-diabetic. She's got gastroesophageal reflux disease and a history of hyperlipidemia.

662
01:15:14,270 --> 01:15:22,070
So she's been she tells you she's been trying her best to follow a healthy diet that was discussed in her preoperative nutrition classes.

663
01:15:22,550 --> 01:15:30,440
And she admits that when she is rushed at dinnertime, she often chooses a frozen meal with a small glass of chocolate milk before bed.

664
01:15:31,370 --> 01:15:34,150
So here, it's like her 24 hour diet recall.

665
01:15:34,160 --> 01:15:42,050
At breakfast, she has carnation instant breakfast powder with low fat milk and English muffin with jelly and coffee.

666
01:15:42,950 --> 01:15:49,040
Once she has a sandwich with some type of protein, whole wheat bread, mayo and iced tea,

667
01:15:49,370 --> 01:15:54,700
and then at dinner, frozen meal are spaghetti with marinara sauce, cooked broccoli and orange juice.

668
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:59,570
Always love the diets they put in. Okay.

669
01:15:59,570 --> 01:16:04,850
So based on that information, what type of diagnosis might we have for this patient?

670
01:16:11,070 --> 01:16:27,370
Take a few minutes to think about it. I'd say think about what symptoms she's presenting with and what foods she's eating in her recall.

671
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:32,110
And also, of course, consider the surgery that she had.

672
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:44,370
So anybody have any thoughts? I know we'll go through kind of quickly.

673
01:16:48,870 --> 01:16:52,170
Yeah. You know, I just. I don't know what it is. I mean, she's not.

674
01:16:53,070 --> 01:16:58,040
She's not eating enough meals like small me mean looks like three bigger meals or maybe inadequate or on tape.

675
01:16:58,060 --> 01:17:02,910
Maybe she's not getting it. She's fatigued. I don't know. She's not eating enough for sure.

676
01:17:02,910 --> 01:17:09,389
She's she's eating the three larger meals and they're not even large, but three meals instead of small frequent meals.

677
01:17:09,390 --> 01:17:14,820
She's having this reflux nausea. So could be inadequate oral intake.

678
01:17:16,170 --> 01:17:21,270
I have a couple here similar to that like an adequate protein intake,

679
01:17:21,540 --> 01:17:28,679
maybe due to her increased needs for protein following her surgery as evidenced by her diet really does,

680
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:32,070
is it had a lot of really great protein sources.

681
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:38,820
Some of these, you know, excessive caffeine intake, maybe, maybe not.

682
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:45,120
But she is consuming, you know, two servings and she's reporting reflux.

683
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:52,290
We know that coffee can worsen reflux or caffeine can undesirable food choices.

684
01:17:52,290 --> 01:17:56,370
Maybe there's a lack of knowledge there in terms of what foods might trigger her.

685
01:17:56,640 --> 01:18:09,480
Her reflux could be increased nutrient needs or inadequate protein intake really related to what she told us and in her diet recall.

686
01:18:09,750 --> 01:18:16,170
But I think also inadequate oral intake would be fine because she's having these symptoms.

687
01:18:16,170 --> 01:18:22,889
She's not getting probably enough total nutrition because she's doing like those those three larger meals.

688
01:18:22,890 --> 01:18:29,170
And that could also be complicating her Gerd. So plenty of options you could have out here.

689
01:18:29,170 --> 01:18:34,590
I know we're going through this kind of quickly. So some nutrition interventions.

690
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:43,400
In terms of her meals and snacks, we might modify the distribution type and amounts of foods and nutrients within meals.

691
01:18:43,420 --> 01:18:55,649
So these are just taken from our general recommendations following the surgery, high protein snacks between meals, kind of like what can you saying?

692
01:18:55,650 --> 01:19:03,450
Get some smaller, more frequent meals in there. Talk about getting more protein in the diet, eating those foods first,

693
01:19:04,020 --> 01:19:09,989
and maybe some diet education on gastroesophageal reflux disease and see what

694
01:19:09,990 --> 01:19:14,069
symptoms might be or what foods she might be having that would trigger symptoms.

695
01:19:14,070 --> 01:19:17,670
Yeah. It was not the case for this particular concern.

696
01:19:18,210 --> 01:19:29,670
But if you have someone, it's like you're oral and you do that when they're eating, but they're eating it incorrectly, like reading it wrong or not.

697
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:36,490
Yes. Now, is there a diagnosis for that would be inadequate or.

698
01:19:37,980 --> 01:19:54,900
Yes. I have to look at the sheet. I think there is something about the timing of intake of meals or something about the dietary pattern.

699
01:19:55,140 --> 01:19:59,980
Yes. So you what you could if you didn't have a diagnosis for it, you could still address it.

700
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:06,510
You're mentioning the timing and delivery of, you know, like if they're eating one large meal at the end of the day,

701
01:20:06,510 --> 01:20:13,080
yeah, we're getting enough nutrition, but we want to change how they're distributing their meals throughout the day.

702
01:20:13,140 --> 01:20:17,340
Okay. That would be if you could just have an intervention for it, even if you didn't have a diagnosis.

703
01:20:17,910 --> 01:20:21,930
But I thought there was a diagnosis that could work. But the look at the sheet there.

704
01:20:24,370 --> 01:20:26,020
Okay. Let me just finish up here.

705
01:20:26,230 --> 01:20:33,490
So some monitoring and evaluation because I chose to focus kind of on the protein and the caffeine is my two problems I identified.

706
01:20:35,260 --> 01:20:40,180
I'll have some specific ways to monitor or goals for the protein so patient to consume

707
01:20:40,180 --> 01:20:45,790
high protein food at all meals and add to high protein snacks between meals every day.

708
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:49,540
And we're going to try and limit caffeine to no more than one cup per day and

709
01:20:49,540 --> 01:20:53,500
see if this helps with any of the reflux or nausea that she's experiencing.

710
01:20:55,220 --> 01:20:58,880
So I know that was really fast. I think it had time to kind of talk through it.

711
01:20:59,450 --> 01:21:03,469
But this is just a way to kind of go from your diagnosis to some interventions to

712
01:21:03,470 --> 01:21:08,210
what we would then monitor based on what we determined to be the major problem.

713
01:21:10,130 --> 01:21:15,170
So anybody have any questions on our upper GI stuff that we talked about?

714
01:21:17,070 --> 01:21:21,299
Okay. So we will begin Lower Guy on Thursday.

715
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:27,180
So we're going to move out of the stomach and into the small bowel and then we'll wrap that up when you guys get back from break.

716
01:21:28,780 --> 01:21:33,570
All right. Thank you. See you on Thursday with.
