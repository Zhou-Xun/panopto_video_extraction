00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:09,640
Welcome to the lecture on
Adapting to an Aging Population.

2
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:13,740
I'm your instructor Jane Banaszak-Holl.

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:19,010
And as an associate professor
in Health Management and Policy,

4
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:23,690
I focused my research on
healthcare services and

5
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:28,460
how they are adapted
to population changes.

6
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:33,710
The aging population is a key factor for

7
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:39,690
understanding how healthcare will
change in the upcoming decades.

8
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:48,280
We will need to respond to an aging
population with healthcare policy reform.

9
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,390
And critical to health policy reform
will be the urgency to address how

10
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:58,990
population need first services
at a time when our financial

11
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:04,490
resources are not growing
will be addressed.

12
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:09,420
Public dialog must address
critical questions of where

13
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,210
we are spending existing resources and

14
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:19,530
what we can give up to
address future health needs,

15
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:27,040
including the critical preventive care
services essential to population health.

16
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:35,160
These are the issues that we
raise in today's lecture.

17
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:40,750
So you will age, that is a fact of life.

18
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:43,830
And we are all getting older.

19
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:51,520
In the United States and marginally across
the world, our cultures emphasize youth.

20
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,490
This is seen in most cultural means,

21
00:01:55,490 --> 00:02:00,470
particularly movies,
television, social media,

22
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:06,250
seniors are underrepresented
in all of these forms.

23
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:10,930
Advertisements also focus
predominantly on youth,

24
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:18,010
which means you are exposed to images of
youth much more than images of seniors.

25
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:23,480
Popular sports events focus on
competition among those at the peak of

26
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:28,930
physical fitness, which means we
are constantly exposed to top physical

27
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:34,890
performances as the focus of health and
fitness activities.

28
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:40,110
That leaves consumers with
a negative perspective on aging, and

29
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:48,980
our cultural perspective is dominated
by problems in aging and disability.

30
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:53,430
Disability is much more
prevalent with age but

31
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:57,870
it's a consequence of
disease not of aging.

32
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:05,440
In our youth dominated culture,
Satchel Paige's quote is very irrelevant,

33
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:11,980
because our culture repeats the message
that aging leads to disability,

34
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:17,530
and truly it takes mind over
matter to focus on the positive

35
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:24,270
aspects in ways we can and
prove quality of life as we age.

36
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,390
Even as we live with disability,

37
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:33,290
there are ways to maximize our
potential for improved quality of life.

38
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:38,178
In his words, if you don't mind,
it doesn't matter,

39
00:03:38,178 --> 00:03:42,444
becomes challenging when
culture is constantly

40
00:03:42,444 --> 00:03:52,160
delivering the message that
disability is the problem.

41
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:58,562
So today I want to draw your attention
first to the key components of aging and

42
00:03:58,562 --> 00:04:03,563
population health that impact
how it address both the needs

43
00:04:03,563 --> 00:04:11,560
of seniors and
health policy related to medical care.

44
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:16,146
Demography is the distribution
of individuals across

45
00:04:16,146 --> 00:04:21,690
important categories related
to our life experiences.

46
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:25,578
Since aging is a life cycle process,

47
00:04:25,578 --> 00:04:30,972
the demography of aging
focuses on how individuals

48
00:04:30,972 --> 00:04:35,630
are distributed across life cycle stages.

49
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:38,050
And we'll focus on a number

50
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:43,980
of different types of life
cycles that humans experience.

51
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:48,520
Health is just one of
those critical cycles.

52
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:53,500
For example, if there is a critical
life cycle of family relations,

53
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:59,090
when you're young your parents are largely
responsible for your care and health.

54
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:05,869
When you reach adulthood, which is
defined most times during your 20s and

55
00:05:05,869 --> 00:05:10,400
30s, you'll move into building
partner relationships,

56
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,440
establishing new family ties,
and becoming parents.

57
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,890
In later life stages,
you may become grandparents,

58
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:24,130
lose a spouse, have children move away.

59
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:30,980
Health is impacted by how we
experience these family relations.

60
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:36,110
For example, people talk now
of the sandwich generation,

61
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:41,920
those individuals who are caregivers for
both children and parents,

62
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:47,730
and who's experience of health
depends on their ability to

63
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:53,210
manage these intensive
family care giving needs.

64
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:57,830
The demography of health follows
an important life cycle that starts with

65
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:03,280
growth and
maturity from childhood to adulthood and

66
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,800
then moves to a period when
health problems increase and

67
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,380
the body loses functional ability.

68
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:16,010
As mentioned already,
our culture paints a bleak picture of our

69
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:20,430
senior years as a period of health decline

70
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:26,190
in which we struggle to maintain
independence and bodily function.

71
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:33,610
To some extent, this picture is correct in
that health problems accumulate over time

72
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:39,490
and there is a substantial impact
of disease burden in late life.

73
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:45,520
However, these are not
a necessary part of aging,

74
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,900
and that disease burden strikes
individuals differently,

75
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:54,660
at different ages and
with different needs.

76
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,550
You can substantially
alter the impact that

77
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:01,060
this disease burden on quality of life.

78
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:06,920
Furthermore, a more balanced cultural
image of health in demography

79
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:11,780
would address how we adapt
to our health at any

80
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:16,990
particular age, and
how at each age the needs and

81
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:23,260
disease burden particular to that
stage of the life cycle are important.

82
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:27,760
So I'll explain this
further in just a minute.

83
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,790
Part of the reason that
old age is associated with

84
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:37,440
disability is because chronic disease
burden accumulates over time.

85
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:43,270
For example, in this graph that
shows the percent of the population

86
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:48,280
with diabetes over time,
you see that the percent

87
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:53,750
of the population with
the disease increases with age.

88
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:57,735
And by approximately 60 years of age,

89
00:07:57,735 --> 00:08:05,160
20% of the population, or
one in five has diabetes.

90
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,874
This is compared to approximately 2% of

91
00:08:08,874 --> 00:08:13,340
the population that has
diabetes at the age 20.

92
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:18,740
This is fairly characteristic
of a number of chronic diseases

93
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:24,640
including the hypertension, asthma,
arthritis, and the heart problems.

94
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:33,480
With age, an increasing percent of
the population experiences the disease.

95
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,560
It's fairly rare that an individual,

96
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:42,260
once diagnosed,
moves back to the state without disease.

97
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:48,771
And the focus needs to shift from
resolving these health issues completely

98
00:08:48,771 --> 00:08:58,863
to adapting to the presence of disease for
each individual.

99
00:08:58,863 --> 00:09:04,397
While the incidence of new cases of
chronic disease increases with age,

100
00:09:04,397 --> 00:09:11,550
thatâ€™s not the only factor contributing
to the prevalence of chronic disease.

101
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:18,830
Particularly in age categories
at the high end, so

102
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:25,730
for those 65 and over,
an important factor is attrition.

103
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:32,630
And the fact that we see fewer
cases of obesity at older ages

104
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:39,630
is due in part to the fact that those with
obesity have higher rates of mortality.

105
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:46,410
Consequently we observe fewer
cases within the population,

106
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:52,120
and that gives us a curver
linear relationship between age

107
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:57,960
and obesity across age category.

108
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:02,710
Finally, before moving on, I'd like
to draw your attention to the gender

109
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:08,360
differences in obesity rates
across age categories.

110
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:13,550
In general women experience more
chronic disease burden than men and

111
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:17,110
it begins at an earlier age.

112
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:24,192
Consequently, over time we observe
an increased gap between men and

113
00:10:24,192 --> 00:10:39,340
women in their, Rates of chronic disease.

114
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:43,996
So I've included this graph to
illustrate that not all age

115
00:10:43,996 --> 00:10:49,140
related changes are negative or
disease related.

116
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:53,810
The textbook mentions that
wisdom increases with age.

117
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:58,925
In addition to that, social disruptions
also occur less frequently, and

118
00:10:58,925 --> 00:11:06,420
in this slide you can observe
the divorce rate declines with age.

119
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:11,670
Subsequently, the group experiencing
the lowest rate of divorce

120
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:15,110
is the 65 and older category.

121
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:19,660
We actually observe also
that divorce rates have

122
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:26,220
increased historically
from 1990 to the present.

123
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:31,120
As I mentioned earlier,
our focus is often predominantly on

124
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:36,560
the deficits that arise from
chronic disease burden.

125
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,680
Indeed once a chronic disease is
identified for an individual, its

126
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:47,610
pathology leads to a number of symptoms
that can interrupt daily routines.

127
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:52,643
So once the disease is recognized,
the focus should be on how

128
00:11:52,643 --> 00:11:59,470
to deal with the impairment
that arrives from the disease.

129
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:05,730
This does not necessarily mean that
individuals lead a poor quality life.

130
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:11,700
And in particular,
the focus once disease is recognized

131
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:16,280
should be on how to improve
quality of life, and

132
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:22,740
change the context in which
the individual lives.

133
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:27,670
In particular, the social and
personal environment for

134
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:31,900
an individual has a big impact

135
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:38,460
on whether pathology alternately
leads to disability.

136
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:43,340
For example,
asthma may lead to reduced lung capacity

137
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:46,690
that makes outside activity difficult.

138
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:52,570
Arthritis can lead to persistent pain and
swelling.

139
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:57,645
But these impairments can be
mediated both with medication and

140
00:12:57,645 --> 00:13:03,487
with changes in behavior that affect
both the functional limitation and

141
00:13:03,487 --> 00:13:10,090
ultimately handicap that
individual's experience.

142
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:14,859
Theoretically, it is the inability
to adapt to the environment

143
00:13:14,859 --> 00:13:18,560
that creates disability, or a handicap.

144
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,290
And consequently, the main focus
of treatment for chronic disease

145
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:27,750
is on adaptation to
the functional limitations and

146
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:32,270
the impairments that
individuals experience.

147
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:36,315
Addressing needs for
adaptation to functional limitations in

148
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:41,840
disabilities is different from
addressing disease pathology.

149
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:46,660
It requires attention to
the individual's unique personal and

150
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:57,850
social system as the important
point of intervention.

151
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:02,860
So we'll return to impairment in a moment
but I want to shift your attention

152
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:07,620
to the impressive changes
we've been able to make in

153
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:13,820
reducing the impact of disease and
social disruptions on our lives.

154
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:18,740
If we expect that disease happen
throughout our lifespan and

155
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:22,502
puts us at risk for
death whenever they occur,

156
00:14:22,502 --> 00:14:28,370
we see that impact has
shifted over our time.

157
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:36,545
Looking back to 1910, the risk of death
was already quite high at young ages.

158
00:14:36,545 --> 00:14:42,480
The y-axis here represents the percent
surviving to a particular age.

159
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:49,790
If we look to when 20% of
the population has died,

160
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:55,490
that ends up being somewhere
approximately in the 20s.

161
00:14:55,490 --> 00:15:02,980
Survival rates today have increased
significantly such that 20% of

162
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:08,580
the population is dying
over the age of 70.

163
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:16,320
So more than 80% of the population
survives to the age of 70 or older.

164
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,870
This is remarkable progress.

165
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:24,470
And much of it has been attributed to
the treatment of infectious disease,

166
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:31,010
to stable political regimes, and
to improved maternal and child health.

167
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:37,121
We are living much longer than before and
that drives us to think ambitiously

168
00:15:37,121 --> 00:15:44,480
about what we can do to improve
overall health outcomes further.

169
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,632
When asking the question
of how we can improve life

170
00:15:47,632 --> 00:15:52,285
beyond the significant achievements
we have made in the 20th century,

171
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:57,260
we need to tackle the problems
of chronic disease directly.

172
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:00,930
Demographers believe
that only by addressing

173
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:04,340
the challenges of chronic
disease will we be

174
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:10,270
able to continue to make significant
achievements in improving health?

175
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:13,010
That leads to the question
of what types of

176
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:17,430
health improvements we want to accomplish.

177
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:23,894
If we are able to extend life further
beyond the current average age to death,

178
00:16:23,894 --> 00:16:29,065
we may also be extending the period
over which chronic disease

179
00:16:29,065 --> 00:16:36,780
leads to impairments and
disruptions in daily life.

180
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:41,899
Alternatively, researchers may
focus on pushing later not just

181
00:16:41,899 --> 00:16:51,690
the risk of mortality, but the risk for
chronic disease more generally.

182
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:56,493
That may not reduce the length
of period that people experience

183
00:16:56,493 --> 00:17:00,208
morbidity that accompanies
chronic disease but

184
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:05,810
they may have a longer lifespan
before morbidity occurs.

185
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:11,090
Finally healthcare could focus on
reducing the period of morbidity,

186
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:15,820
in which one experiences
impairments from chronic disease,

187
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:20,270
without necessarily gaining longer life.

188
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:25,163
The recognition of these
different goals has led to

189
00:17:25,163 --> 00:17:29,603
significant shifts in
scientific funding and

190
00:17:29,603 --> 00:17:35,064
is now leading to a greater
focus on disease morbidity and

191
00:17:35,064 --> 00:17:39,729
how we manage disease in
addition to our previous

192
00:17:39,729 --> 00:17:47,100
focus on curing disease for individuals.
