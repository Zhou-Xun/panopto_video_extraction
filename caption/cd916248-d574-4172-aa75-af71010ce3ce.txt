1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,670
You're not going to like that. I was like, All right, why don't we go ahead and get started, everybody.

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:12,899
Welcome back. Happy Monday. I thought I would start today, actually,

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:22,800
by drawing your attention to a couple new items on the course websites that hopefully will be populated over the course of the term.

4
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:27,000
So I've got a couple announcements in the announcements section.

5
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,140
Some local events that might be of interest.

6
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:39,720
So January 11th, which I guess is this Wednesday, we're going to see the fifth anniversary of our U of M Precision Health Initiative.

7
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:45,239
And so they've got a whole morning of events that day, if you're interested,

8
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:50,280
including an interesting panel discussion that will be moderated by one of my colleagues,

9
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:56,130
Kate Spector, Baghdadi, who does a lot of work around the law and ethics of use of genetic data.

10
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:01,739
And so that particular part of that symposium might be of interest.

11
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:08,310
So I think it's free to register. You can check it out if you're free and have interest for that January 11th.

12
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:14,910
And then January 24th, there's a seminar in the Department of Human Genetics.

13
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:23,399
Yvonne Bombard is from University of Toronto. She's done a lot of interesting work on interventions around delivering genetic

14
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:29,270
information and trying to expand access through digital delivery of genetic information.

15
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,770
So she'll be visiting from Toronto and presenting as part of the Human Genetics Seminar Series.

16
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:40,260
It's both in person over in view, but also I think there's a hybrid option.

17
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:44,700
So those are just kind of a couple examples. I'll try to do this over the course of the term.

18
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,690
If there are events on campus, I think you might find interesting, I'll post them.

19
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:53,080
Also, feel free to let me know of any that you think might be of interest to the classroom.

20
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,210
And we can also add that to the announcements section.

21
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:03,089
Also, I mentioned last time we have a genetics in the news section.

22
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:08,040
So if you go to the discussions part of the course website, there's a genetics in the news thread.

23
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,440
And so I just threw up a few of the options that we talked about last time.

24
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:21,030
So feel free. As I mentioned last time, if you encounter any kind of news stories you think might be of interest to post them yourself.

25
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:25,080
And again, I also consider this part of class participation.

26
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:31,920
So for those of you who are maybe on the quieter side, this might be a way to to participate as well.

27
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:37,709
And then last but not least, I think you should hopefully know this now,

28
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:44,250
but one of your assignments for today's session is to indicate your interest in the group presentation topic.

29
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:48,060
So there should be a link there to a Qualtrics survey.

30
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:57,150
And so you can go in and I think you just like move these things around to rank order what you would like to present on this term.

31
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:01,920
And so please make sure to complete that survey if you haven't already done so.

32
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:07,350
And I'll use those preferences and hopefully by next class session I'll have you

33
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:13,800
all assigned to a group and you can be off and running in researching your topic.

34
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:19,800
So any, any questions on on any of that? Yeah. Andrew, can you just go to your main page for a second?

35
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:29,940
Sure. And then go down to like one of the class periods and everybody does this differently.

36
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:35,040
So I just want to make sure I understand the way that you have it. So if you click on, like, January 9th or today.

37
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:39,150
Mm hmm. When you say required readings, I assume that's for that class.

38
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:46,469
Yeah. For like the next class? That's correct. So for today, hopefully everybody's looked at these over.

39
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:50,730
And what I do is I will have the slides for today that I'll be presenting are posted here.

40
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:58,350
I have the discussion questions we'll be talking about. And then afterwards what I'll do is it should be recording us right now and Panopto.

41
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:05,550
And so what I do afterwards is link to the Panopto recording that's particularly relevant if you're not able to be here in person.

42
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:13,440
But you know, if you want to review some brilliant comment you made in class discussion, you can also go back to that that recording.

43
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:18,540
Does that help clarify things? And then, yeah, here's where that survey is.

44
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:24,180
And if you're if some of the topics aren't clear to you, feel free to use.

45
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:28,650
Look at this document. I'll kind of describe in a little bit more depth some of the different topics.

46
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:38,210
All right. Any other questions on the horse side or any of these, of course, related issues?

47
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,420
All right. Well, let's jump into things here.

48
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:51,260
Uh. Oh.

49
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:58,380
I'm going. So, do we have any folks who were not here last time?

50
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:09,870
Yes. Oh, is it Helen? Yes. Hi, Helen. So what we did last time is we did some introductions, so maybe you can say who you are, what program you're in,

51
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:15,840
and any kind of interests or experiences related to the course you think might be relevant for folks to know about.

52
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:26,050
I'm Helen. I'm a degree. I'm doing my MPH and Eugene, and then I may just say an agency or an undergrad.

53
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:28,480
I also majored in molecular genetics.

54
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:35,010
I've just kind of carried that interest throughout, even though I'm not too sure if I can really incorporate everything that I could do into one job.

55
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:41,490
Hold on. Keep up. Okay, great. Well, thanks so great to have you on board.

56
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:48,330
Yeah, and I think we've already covered these other two points, so I'll just keep on rolling.

57
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:55,740
So, yeah, today we're going to be just providing some basic background information to kind of set the stage for what we'll be talking about this term.

58
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:04,709
And I thought we could start. I think the modern era of genetics really traces itself to the completion of the Human Genome Project.

59
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:08,910
And I think this is you know, you saw a little bit of that in the code documentary.

60
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:13,080
It talked about, you know, the competition between the NIH and industry.

61
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,830
But again, just as a reminder, this was a complete mapping of the entire human genome.

62
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:23,159
It was interesting to me learning about the history of it is before they completed it,

63
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,910
we didn't even know how many genes are there in the human genome.

64
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:32,580
In fact, I think there was like you kind of office pool to guess what do you think the final number is going to be?

65
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:38,549
And so this was, you know, a draft that was initially completed in 2000.

66
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:45,720
And in the documentary, I think, highlighted this competition between Francis Collins, NIH Group and Craig Venter, Celera group.

67
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:52,890
That was it wasn't fully complete. Then a fuller draft was completed a few years later.

68
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:59,080
And I think one of the hallmarks of this project was to try to give open access to

69
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:06,120
the idea that people can learn if they have if it's not proprietary information.

70
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:12,329
And the thought was, you know, the human genome is kind of represents our common humanity.

71
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:17,549
So it shouldn't be necessarily, you know, a product to be necessarily commercialized.

72
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:20,100
Although we'll talk about obviously with gene patents,

73
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:29,190
that's been an interesting area of policy where some companies have successfully patented certain genes and the ways of testing those genes.

74
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:32,700
And so it's raised some interesting ethical and policy questions there.

75
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:39,240
But I think it's, you know, laid the foundation for a couple of decades now worth of really important scientific discovery,

76
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:45,900
a lot of health applications. And so I think it continues to be a really important foundation.

77
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:50,790
And it was, you know, named the number one medical advance of the entire decade.

78
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:55,799
And so here's some of when it was initially completed, that initial draft, you know,

79
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,300
they had a White House ceremony and President Clinton was in charge at the time.

80
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,599
And so you can see how it was heralded.

81
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:09,570
Francis Collins, who led the NIH group talking about this, as you know, ranking up there with going to the moon,

82
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:16,530
Clinton himself talking about it being the most important, most wondrous map ever produced by mankind.

83
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:21,989
So pretty, you know, high praise, pretty lofty language here.

84
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:24,600
So keep that in mind because that'll be a theme.

85
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:32,280
We'll talk about some today, but not everybody was quite as excited as Francis Collins and President Clinton.

86
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:41,670
You saw particularly, I think, in some of the social sciences, some concerns about this, this language that was being used at the time.

87
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:44,520
Oh, this is going to revolutionize all of medicine and science.

88
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:53,640
And and so expressing skepticism of whether this is really as important a revolution as being made out to be.

89
00:08:53,970 --> 00:09:02,340
And, in fact, a lot of critics, you know, kind of talked about genomics as what they might call a promissory technology that,

90
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:07,920
you know, these appeals to, oh, this is really going to pay off in these huge ways down the line.

91
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:14,880
But then some would suggest, you know, is that payoff really worth all the huge investment we're making,

92
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:22,320
both in terms of kind of financially and otherwise into investigating the human genome.

93
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:30,059
And so there have been some examples, you know, over time. And I think the code documentary got at this where we've seen a lot of hype.

94
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:34,500
So initially it was like gene therapy is going to revolutionize care for all these different diseases.

95
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:39,540
Then a few years later it was, you know, genome wide association studies.

96
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:45,080
Was this really important methodology looking at the link between genes and risk of common conditions?

97
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:53,719
Oh, that's going to revolutionize our understanding of common disease. You saw Collins himself, I think I mentioned last time was saying, oh,

98
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,440
primary care doctors are soon they're going to have a genetic profile on all their patients.

99
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:03,950
And that's going to be used to tailor all kinds of approaches, whether you're screening or medications.

100
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:09,510
And it's going to revolutionize primary care. And so in each of those cases.

101
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:17,640
Not to say there hasn't been some progress in those areas, but we haven't quite seen the promise fulfilled in a major way.

102
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:24,020
One of my colleagues, Jim Evans, who at USC, a major even though he's a geneticist himself,

103
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:30,740
he likes to use this metaphor of how, you know, in the United States, we often talk about soccer is the sport of the future.

104
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:35,899
And and he likes to say soccer is the sport of the future in the U.S. And it always will be this idea that we

105
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:44,180
keep expecting it to take off and it just hasn't quite done so and as dramatic a fashion as as one might like.

106
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:55,219
And so I think that's been an interesting dynamic that people in public health have maybe used to say, hey, let's let's tamp down the excitement and,

107
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,740
you know, recognize the importance of genetics,

108
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:05,210
but recognize that it doesn't always deliver in the ways its most excited enthusiasts might might claim.

109
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:16,040
So I'm interested in your thoughts here, because on one hand, I think you're seeing some folks, you know, having such excitement, hope.

110
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:22,730
On the other hand, genetics has also generated a lot of kind of concern and fear even.

111
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:29,689
And this, I think, kind of crosses over both the scientific community as well as the lay public.

112
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:36,950
And so I'm interested in your thoughts here. Why do you think genetics has hold for such strong reactions in these groups?

113
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:45,950
What are your some of your thoughts here and why it seems to have such a stimulus value across a range of of interest groups?

114
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:58,450
Bridget. Right. I think you like certain areas of medicine in oncology and also in pharmacology.

115
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:07,120
I think there's a huge interest in sequencing and personalized medicine in that regard.

116
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:13,580
However, a good way to target sort of like in the documentary not this week.

117
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:20,760
The previous week is about the idea of having the sequence to then inform treatment plans and things like that.

118
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:33,549
I think that Big Pharma has a lot of interest in that, but I would say that there's not a true one year relationship between genetics and disease.

119
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:39,060
So that's sort of just like this excitement and concern.

120
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:46,050
Mm hmm. Yeah. Good, good points there. What I'm hearing is like you're saying that maybe some of the excitement is about, wow,

121
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:52,200
potential for major improvements in medical care on one hand and then maybe also excitement

122
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:58,140
about the financial profits that might be realized by some of these new technologies as well.

123
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:04,530
Jessica, you had a hand up. Yeah, I was going to talk about the fear in the public,

124
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:12,210
like when all of this genetic advancement started happening, we had only really seen it in like sci fi.

125
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:17,520
And now all of a sudden it's also TV, and we're like, we're going to change your DNA.

126
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:23,429
And it's like, you know, you see, like the Frankenstein or like Marvel villains and stuff.

127
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:26,040
And now it's like, but we're going to use it on you in medicine.

128
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:32,540
So if you don't have a background, it would be pretty scary to just like have all that put on you at once.

129
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,349
So you think the way in which some of this has been portrayed in popular culture

130
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:43,320
may kind of amplify some of these fears about scientists playing God with.

131
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:49,500
Yeah. With some of these new technology. Yeah. There's a really I forget exactly which part of the readings it was then,

132
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:55,860
but a really interesting comment about like if you went on to prevent all of these different,

133
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:02,669
you know, diseases and disabilities like preventing Down's syndrome, what happens to the population that has it now?

134
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:07,139
And so would there be less funding, less care given to that?

135
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:10,620
And that was a certainly a perspective that I had not really considered before.

136
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:13,829
Um, and so I think, you know, if you're in that group,

137
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:23,190
then you do have some like anxiousness about changing the way that the world is because it very much might personally affect you going forward.

138
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:29,940
Yeah, great point. Yeah. Well, when we get to prenatal testing, we'll talk about, you know, the concern in the Down's community in particular.

139
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:38,190
But there might be other communities who are around a particular condition or trait that might also feel threatened as well.

140
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:45,389
And Jennifer, I think there's also some uncertainty of, you know, we're learning more about the human genome.

141
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:49,950
What does that necessarily to ask, you know, a patient as a provider,

142
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:56,829
how do you realize this information and kind of the fear of potentially saying wrong information

143
00:14:56,830 --> 00:15:01,990
and spreading misinformation about things when there's not enough research to think about?

144
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:06,179
And then also the potential for, you know, genetic discrimination,

145
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:16,780
like if you have a genetic condition or your carrier or some families that, you know, work or health care or health insurance.

146
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:24,540
So, you know, this sounds like you're talking about concerns both among professionals and patients or lay public.

147
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:32,250
Yeah. Yeah. I was coming at it from the book side, just how this was a kind of genetics as being deterministic,

148
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:37,500
as a way of determining what your health is going to be, what like how you're going to work, everything.

149
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:46,320
And so I think just that recognition, I think also like in the uncertainties that are associated with the health system, the strong reactions,

150
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:56,220
even though we now know that it's not just or genetics that influences your health, I think it still does plays a part in it and that in itself.

151
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:01,280
And also just getting reactions on how you are seeing it, how you look into it.

152
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:10,919
But do you think the stronger the genetic determinism, if you will, the stronger the reactions, no matter what the context we're talking about?

153
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:18,900
Or do you think this idea of strong reaction is linked to this notion that, you know, genetics is destiny?

154
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:27,299
I think so. Yeah, I think more so the latter, I think just because. Because you don't have to be like what we have now.

155
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:31,110
We know that like different positions where there is a stronger links than others.

156
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:36,239
I think even just at the time, there is still this recognition that, oh,

157
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,890
you're genetics does play a large part in who you are and what your health outcomes could be.

158
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:49,469
And so I think because of that, there's a lot of mixed reactions in terms of what I would entail,

159
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:56,850
especially when we move into treatments that are targeting the genetic component.

160
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:06,510
Other thoughts here, other reasons why we're seeing this kind of strong range of reactions to different developments.

161
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:13,630
Sarah Ah, yeah, I'm kind of looking at it from the side of my excitement and hope.

162
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:21,500
I think genetics itself is obviously a very complex subject, especially for the general public who doesn't know a lot about it.

163
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:26,459
And so I think that when you look at we sort of talk less and not with misinformation and stuff.

164
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:32,940
And I think that the way that the media portrays it, like in the opposite way, like I remember when I was in high school,

165
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:41,110
people started talking about like, you know, the like designer babies and some whole you can choose like your baby's hair color and stuff like that.

166
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:47,190
And I think that that caused a lot of like pulled and people like excitement about like what the future holds,

167
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:50,760
but like obviously that hasn't really come to fruition. Mm.

168
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:56,549
Yeah. Yeah. I think particularly your point is well taken when you think about a lot of the diseases we're talking about.

169
00:17:56,550 --> 00:18:06,720
Applications are severe, incurable conditions where we've known about the causes for decades and we just really have kind of spun our wheels,

170
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,520
whether it's, you know, things like sickle cell or other kind of rare genetic conditions.

171
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,790
And so I think there is understandable enthusiasm.

172
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:23,180
Well, hey, here's something that maybe has plagued my family for for multiple generations, and here's a chance for a really big breakthrough.

173
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:29,790
So I think on one hand, I think we need to temper those expectations given some of these historical examples.

174
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:39,810
On the other hand, you can't help but understand why certain families might really see the promise here and get really excited about,

175
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:43,200
you know, some of the new applications that are being talked about.

176
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:48,520
So, you know, so we'll keep those those themes in mind.

177
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:57,399
I want to kind of talk a little bit more, though, about genetics through the lens of the powers that be at the National Institutes of Health,

178
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:02,840
because, again, that's the group that's really been driving a lot of the progress that funds a lot of the research.

179
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:08,500
And so I mentioned Francis Collins before as kind of the face of the Human Genome Project,

180
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:13,900
which he led for over a decade, and he did that when he was the leader of,

181
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:19,600
you know, if you know anything about niche, you know, it's got multiple different institutes with different areas of focus.

182
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:26,350
So he led the National Human Genome Research Institute, or NatGeo Gyri for a long time.

183
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:32,740
Before then, many of you may know he was actually here on the faculty in our medical school for about a decade,

184
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:36,360
and he did a lot of fantastic research at that time,

185
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:44,440
and some of his work helped lead to genes being identified for cystic fibrosis, Huntington's disease, hemochromatosis.

186
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:52,209
And so he's got that U of M link. I'll be a shameless go blue proponent at different times throughout the course.

187
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:58,600
So I thought I'd mention that. And then most recently he, you know, for over a decade he was the head of all of NIH.

188
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:08,739
And so I think it was no accident that with him as the head, you saw the kind of continued flourishing of genetics and genomics research within NIH,

189
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:12,129
although interestingly, it kind of moved out not just from Jerry.

190
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:20,350
You started cancer was mentioned earlier, you know, NCI, the National Cancer Institute, you know, the name Age, which deals with mental health.

191
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:24,670
So you saw all kinds of other institutes funding, a lot of research as well.

192
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:32,650
And so Francis Collins, when he that second draft of the human genome was completed in 2003,

193
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:39,790
he put out this really important paper in nature that set out his vision for the future of genomics research.

194
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:47,019
And it was not only an important paper with a kind of visionary in the field laying out his thoughts.

195
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:57,520
But it also was very practically important because it was really used directly as a means of prioritizing areas for research funding.

196
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,660
So if you know anything about research funding, you know that they have these are called R.

197
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:11,290
A's requests for applications. And so a lot of the language from this paper went straight to those RF A's and, you know, solicited grant applications.

198
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:17,290
So he talked about these grand challenges for the integration of genomics at multiple levels.

199
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:20,559
And he used this kind of architectural metaphor.

200
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:26,650
And we'll talk a lot in this class about the importance of metaphors for conveying complex topics to the public.

201
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:33,520
But he had this architectural metaphor where he said, you know, the foundation of everything is really the completion of this human genome project.

202
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:40,929
And so he talked about these different levels of integration, you know, genomics into biology, into health and to society.

203
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:48,759
And then he had these different pillars that cut across that you can see listed here, feel like we had to, you know, locate our course.

204
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:52,120
We're probably somewhere on the second or third floor over here.

205
00:21:52,120 --> 00:22:00,609
But he talked about. LC You know, these ethical, legal, social issues, education, training, computational biology, resources, technology development.

206
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:06,040
So these are these kind of pillars that cut across these different levels of integration.

207
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:15,210
So I thought I would talk a little bit. We won't go into super great detail, but talk some about this metaphor and how he saw it playing out.

208
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:18,220
So let's talk about that first floor of genomics.

209
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:25,839
So biology. So I think Collins was talking a lot about, you know, we really need to understand the function of most genes.

210
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:30,819
And I think those who are not experts in the field don't necessarily realize how much we still,

211
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:36,100
even 20 years later, have to learn about just the basics of what.

212
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:41,280
First of all, we didn't even know how many genes were the human genome, let alone what they actually did.

213
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:47,380
And so I think there's still a lot of room to understand. But what is the the basic function of all these different genes,

214
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:52,870
understanding what is the variation from one person to the next in terms of the human genome?

215
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:58,000
And when does that variation matter in terms of relevance for health?

216
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:02,860
And so that continues, I think, to be kind of a bedrock issue as well.

217
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:08,530
And then he talked a lot about doing all this research is really going to make

218
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:13,270
us have to think about policy issues around how basic science is governed.

219
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:19,059
And so he talked a lot about how are we going to think about issues of data sharing and intellectual property.

220
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:22,060
On one hand, we want to incentivize innovation.

221
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:26,620
On the other hand, we don't want to have people having, you know,

222
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:33,249
kind of monopolies on certain kinds of genetic information that it's not open source, those kinds of things.

223
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:40,720
So these are some of the big themes he talked about in thinking about how genomics might be integrated into the study of biology.

224
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:45,180
Then at that next level, he's talking about genomics to health and.

225
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:50,610
So here's where, again, a lot of the themes of this course are at this level as well.

226
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:59,700
So we've already seen there's been a lot of look at the genetic contributions to disease and how, you know,

227
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:04,919
today it seems like it's taking more of this rather than looking at kind of monogenic causes of conditions.

228
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:10,080
We're seeing a lot more focus on, you know, polygenic contributions or polygenic risk scores.

229
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:15,570
But also he he highlighted the importance of not just looking at genetic contributions to disease,

230
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,650
but also genetic contributions to health and resilience.

231
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:26,160
And when I used to be at Boston University, they had this famous study of centenarians.

232
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:29,549
You know, people had lived to 100 years or above.

233
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:33,720
And so there have been some interesting studies looking at people who seem to have had

234
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:39,930
the kind of unusually good health that maybe goes beyond just their health behaviors.

235
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:47,879
In fact, the pie of the centenarian study is often asked like, well, how how do you live to such a great old age healthy?

236
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:55,050
He says, Pick your parents wisely, which is kind of a joke about like the importance of genetics to contributing to to resilience.

237
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:59,640
And so I think we've seen, you know, trying to look at genetics from this angle as well.

238
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,630
We've already talked about gene based therapies some.

239
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:10,140
So Collins even 20 years ago was talking about the importance of gene therapy in pharmaco genomics to directly inform therapies.

240
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:15,300
And then, as you might expect, genetic risk assessment was also mentioned.

241
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:22,350
And then even though global health really has not been an area where I think we've seen huge contribution so far,

242
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:26,520
given that a lot of the focus in global health has been infectious disease,

243
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:30,749
that's not to say that infectious disease control can't benefit from genetic knowledge.

244
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:38,370
And I think we'll talk about that some this term when we talk about we'll have a session on on genetics and COVID, for example.

245
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:45,690
So that's that was kind of a big picture view of what he was thinking about in these genomics to health.

246
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:50,280
But again, these are all, I think, still quite relevant today.

247
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:55,470
And then finally, I think he was interested in this idea of genomics as society.

248
00:25:55,470 --> 00:26:01,230
So here's where some of these policy issues come in and how genetic discrimination was mentioned earlier.

249
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:10,860
So how can we guard against that, whether in a medical context, how do we think about policies around genomics, research, insurance?

250
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:19,759
These were all things that were on his mind. We'll talk a lot next time about the troubled history of genetics and race since.

251
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,150
So that's been a perennial concern here that he's mentioned.

252
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:32,520
Also thinking not just about health and disease, but thinking about genetics in terms of traits and behaviors.

253
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:38,129
And so what are the consequences of learning about genetic contributions to traits,

254
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:42,000
whether they be and has been the most controversy perhaps around intelligence,

255
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:50,430
but obviously athletic ability, musical abilities, all kinds of other, you know, personality of like introversion versus extroversion.

256
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:52,740
There's a lot of interest in behavioral genetics.

257
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:59,760
And you might imagine we need to think carefully about how we apply discoveries learned in those kinds of realms.

258
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:06,749
And then finally, he talked a lot about ethical boundaries of the uses of genomics and when do we

259
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:11,430
feel like we maybe just because we can maybe we should not always go there.

260
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:15,960
And so a lot of this comes up around these themes of genetic enhancement,

261
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:25,860
like when should we even allow uses of genetics for like enhancing people's abilities beyond just kind of,

262
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:31,019
rather than curing disease, making people kind of having super ability in certain areas.

263
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:35,459
And this comes up a lot around the context of assisted reproduction.

264
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:40,910
And so there's been a lot of debate around prenatal genetic testing and when should we, you know,

265
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:49,080
for example, allow genetic modification or genetics to be used in selection of embryos in those contexts.

266
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:55,469
So again, these are some of the big themes of this paper, and I wanted to highlight them because, again,

267
00:27:55,470 --> 00:28:02,370
even though this paper was put out many years ago, I think it represents the thinking of a real luminary in the field.

268
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:10,890
And I think these have not certainly not gone away and in fact, in some ways have only picked up speed in terms of their debate and study.

269
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:20,970
So I'll pause there to see people have any questions or comments on Colin's vision as depicted in these last few slides.

270
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:33,000
So then Colin's left and it's Jerry. And this scientist named Eric Green took over.

271
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:41,420
And so he had an update where he kind of had his own director's vision paper, if you will, back in 2011.

272
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:45,319
And it was titled From Base Pairs to Bedside.

273
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:51,440
And I thought that to me, being a public health, I thought that was interesting because again, the the end point is the bedside.

274
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,540
It's very much kind of a clinical context.

275
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:59,870
And so I think those in public health might say, well, maybe the endpoint should be population health as opposed to the bedside.

276
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:05,519
But again, it's maybe it reflects some of this more biomedical focus at NIH.

277
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:12,589
Chair I but Eric Green was talking about at this point, we were starting to see, wow, we can think beyond just, you know, DNA sequencing.

278
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:16,760
We can think about fields like epic genomics, where we're thinking about gene environment interactions.

279
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:23,689
The microbiome has become a big topic to think about in terms of health at this time.

280
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:27,650
There was kind of explosion of bioinformatics and big data,

281
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:34,919
and we were seeing how genetics was starting to be integrated more frequently into electronic medical records.

282
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:43,820
So thinking about the practicality and challenges there, and also Eric Green was thinking about some challenges around community engagement.

283
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:53,330
So this was a time I think I mentioned the Havasupai case last time that had become big news just a few years prior to the publication of this report.

284
00:29:53,960 --> 00:30:01,040
And that highlighted, I think, some of these concerns about how not all communities are really excited necessarily about

285
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:06,110
these advances and may have a lot of wariness about participating in genetic research,

286
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:13,729
which was also the time when we were seeing concerns about research with newborn screening samples.

287
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:20,010
Does anybody know some of the controversies that were happening around this time where, you know, some data was, you know,

288
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:24,770
newborn screening, as we'll talk about is, you know, the screening of newborns for rare genetic conditions at birth.

289
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:30,310
Some states started to use that data for research purposes as well.

290
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:39,470
And does anybody know what controversies started to happen in the research use of these blood spots from from newborn screening?

291
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:55,740
I think the concern was I mean, property may have been a little bit of a concern there, but these were actually academic groups that were were using.

292
00:30:56,550 --> 00:31:00,750
And we're still being critiqued for for using these samples for research purposes.

293
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:08,320
I like to show this photo. This, I think is from I don't know which status is this some family they.

294
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:13,510
Dressed their infant in this onesie says help. The government has my DNA.

295
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:18,410
But it was this kind of concern that really around informed consent issues like

296
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:23,280
we don't actually require informed consent for newborn screening of infants.

297
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:31,440
And so in certain people were like, wait a minute, you didn't tell me you're using my baby's blood spot in your Biobank.

298
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:35,219
And I have a real problem with that. And so you saw in certain states,

299
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:45,090
Texas perhaps being and Minnesota being the most prominent examples where these angry families filed suit and that had the entire Biobank destroyed,

300
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:51,000
they were successful in making the legal argument. You're using our data really without our permission.

301
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:54,780
And even though they were ostensibly being used for,

302
00:31:55,080 --> 00:32:03,659
quote unquote noble purposes of finding maybe new links between genes and diseases, the families didn't see it that way.

303
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:08,729
And so I think it all pointed to the need for, wow, we need to do a better job of community engagement.

304
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:12,930
We can't just kind of presume people trust us and think we're going to do the right thing.

305
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:19,950
We need to think more carefully about how do we engage communities around use of genetic information.

306
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:24,570
So that was a little bit on an evergreen uptake here.

307
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:28,940
So fast forward a few more years.

308
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:38,450
We're into the end of the Obama administration and again, at the niche level, we're seeing more and continued investment in genetics research.

309
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:48,950
And so you saw at this point this idea of a private precision medicine initiative being floated that was ultimately funded a few years later.

310
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:57,660
And it really set the stage for this major new longitudinal cohort study, and it's now become all of us.

311
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:07,880
And was it the day or did you write in your with the you who said you actually worked on the all of us study in a lot of Western sites for all of us.

312
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,320
Yeah. You okay with sharing just a teeny bit about what you did?

313
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:15,100
Was it good to have a personal tie here? Sure. Yeah.

314
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:21,380
So this was pre-COVID. Okay. So I know quite a bit have changed since then on how they were approaching.

315
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:31,810
Participants must be part of the study. But at least in my role in Northwestern, it was pretty much on one hand Hollywood theater recruitment.

316
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:35,110
So working in liquidity events were like stacking tables.

317
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:41,889
Like I was talking with people just about what this research study was about addressing any questions they had.

318
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:49,660
I know a lot of the concerns that will come up are just about on privacy and security in particular.

319
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:55,930
But also you would ask questions just about the genetic testing that was in problems as part of the study.

320
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:00,640
But I would involve and questions about that.

321
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:06,310
So pretty much engaging people to address all those questions and concerns.

322
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:12,730
And then the study of topics like you're doing,

323
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:19,540
like the actual concepts are going through like about 30 minutes of videos and questions just to make sure that they understand what it's about.

324
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:24,999
And then I'd also work with participants to actually like what their measurements are,

325
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,770
like physical measurements, and then providing blood gamble if they're consenting to that.

326
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:39,429
But I think the thing that was fun that we had a real life all of us employee in our midst here.

327
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:42,460
So thank you for being put on the spot like that and sure.

328
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:50,650
So yeah as as videos saying it's this I mean, hundreds of millions of dollars have been put into this project.

329
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:56,889
So the idea is that over time, they're going to try to get 100 million U.S. adults to agree.

330
00:34:56,890 --> 00:35:00,879
I don't know what the latest numbers are. They're certainly not at a million yet.

331
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,350
And the idea is to follow people for at least ten years.

332
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:10,749
And do we have any students here in particular who can tell us why do epidemiologists love the

333
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:19,180
idea of a longitudinal cohort study where you follow a large number of people over multiple years?

334
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:29,770
What are some of the advantages of whether genetics or not have having kind of a big population study like that?

335
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:36,730
They're growing on that five fold less sure.

336
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:42,219
But the long follow up allows you to observe like you incidence of disease.

337
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:48,940
So it provides more evidence for like a causal link you a a gene and whatever, a disease or observing.

338
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:53,590
And of course, the more people you have in the more data points you can gather, it increases the statistical.

339
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:57,450
Statistical power of your results. Mm hmm. Yeah.

340
00:35:57,490 --> 00:36:05,710
Just to have a much more representative sample because again, I think unfortunately a lot of our studies of the links between genetics and disease,

341
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:13,450
you know, tend to be biased in many ways in terms of the demographics, whether it's by race, whether it's by education or sex.

342
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:20,550
So, yeah, so even though genetics is a big part of the picture, they're certainly not only connecting DNA.

343
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:26,250
So there's a pretty extensive questionnaire piece where they're asking about people's health behaviors.

344
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:29,860
There's a lot of social demographic information, family history information.

345
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:37,510
I think if you do consent to the blood test, you know, they can do a little bit more in terms of biomarkers.

346
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:45,280
But I think some people just only participate in the kind of questionnaire part, at least as my understanding.

347
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:49,780
I think the closest local site is Henry Ford in Detroit.

348
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:52,089
So anyway, there's there's a lot of excitement here.

349
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:59,889
And so the hope is by building this kind of study, we're going to have new insights into the relationships between genes,

350
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:05,140
environment, health history, health behaviors and disease.

351
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:08,800
And so that's kind of the the vision, if you will.

352
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:14,200
And so it's launch. It's our charity, almost five years old, which is kind of hard to believe.

353
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:18,909
But as was alluded to earlier, I think, COBE, it has been a big challenge here.

354
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:21,730
And interestingly, we won't talk a lot about it today,

355
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:29,200
but there has been some effort to try to think about allowing people to get their genetic information back,

356
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:38,319
but just for a really circumscribed set of genes that have kind of very strong links to two different health conditions like cancer or heart disease,

357
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,280
but even that has taken several years to get up and running.

358
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:46,870
I think they're just now rolling that out. You know, Jessica, I'm in the study.

359
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:54,430
Oh, yeah. And I did like the saliva collection, and they had an option to, like, select if I wanted my genetic report back.

360
00:37:54,700 --> 00:38:01,090
Yeah. So I think they they're coming a long way with that now because they actually let you get it back.

361
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:04,629
Yeah. Have you get it back. I said no. You said no.

362
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:11,000
And you say, okay, I'm a I'm part of it too, but I haven't yet given biological samples.

363
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:16,690
So I don't I don't have that option starting to rule out returning DNA results to people that consented to it.

364
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:20,440
Yeah, they partnered with this company called Color Health.

365
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:24,970
So it used to be called genomics that has kind of made its mark in bracket testing.

366
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:27,700
And I think they can do the genetic testing.

367
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:32,439
And I think they're they're really taking seriously this idea of the prior employees and genetic counselors,

368
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:36,429
I would think, to kind of assist in that disclosure. But some people might be like yourself.

369
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:40,210
They might be like, hey, thanks, but no thanks, I don't need to know this information.

370
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:48,180
So anyway, being a health education class, I thought it might be fun for us to take a look at what they're doing.

371
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:56,250
So what I'm going to do here is first I'm going to show you a brief kind of intro video that they use to try to interest people.

372
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:03,960
And then what we'll do is afterwards have you break into smaller groups after watching that video.

373
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:13,950
I'm going to this this URL where you'll try to see what do they have in terms of like, you know, frequently asked questions, learning more.

374
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:20,370
And so the idea will be for you and your smaller groups to and we'll do this from time to time.

375
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:24,360
We'll say, here's an example of kind of public education about genetics.

376
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:29,970
What do you think? What do you what do you think? And strong points are? Where could it be improved?

377
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:36,660
So these are when we get into the small groups. These are the kinds of questions that I'm hoping your groups can discuss.

378
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:40,049
And we'll do this, you know, on multiple occasions this term.

379
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:46,350
And I think the hope is that by the end, remember, your final project will be for you to develop your own educational tool.

380
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:51,780
So having kind of done this several times, you might hopefully pick up some ideas for,

381
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:56,069
hey, wow, that, that website, I could actually have done that section better.

382
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:59,070
And so in your final project, you'll get the chance to do that.

383
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:09,960
So these are the questions to keep in mind. But before we break into the small groups, I thought we would just take a quick look at the brief video.

384
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,669
So always rolling the dice to me and Avi.

385
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:19,489
But let's. Sonia is less than 2 minutes, so hopefully it will work.

386
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:23,900
So I'm just play it right now. Meet Ray. Ray lives on a farm.

387
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:28,580
He likes playing football with his grandkids, but lately he's gotten a little slower.

388
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:32,960
And when visiting the doctor a lot more often. This is Kim.

389
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:41,480
Kim lives in the city. She loves to exercise, cook healthy meals, and can't remember the last time she called in sick people.

390
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:48,350
But not all people are listening. And yet, when we visit the doctor, our treatments don't work that different.

391
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:53,300
Why is that? Because we just don't have enough information to do it better.

392
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:56,630
Until now. Answer all of us.

393
00:40:57,110 --> 00:41:00,110
The research program based on precision medicine.

394
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:09,050
Precision medicine is a revolutionary new approach to treating and preventing disease that's personalized instead of one size fits all.

395
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:15,800
Regarding health data from 1 million people like Ray and Kim and Trevor and Samir.

396
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:22,730
Our country's best researchers will be able to develop treatments that are as unique and complex as they are.

397
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:30,710
With this new information, doctors will have a better understanding of disease so they can innovate the next great breakthroughs in medicine.

398
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:34,310
Once enough people die, suddenly everything changes.

399
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:41,360
Information becomes clear, patterns emerge, and simple data transforms into lifesaving knowledge.

400
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:46,549
This means that Ray and Kim's children and their children's children can live longer

401
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:50,990
and healthier lives by becoming one of the first 1 billion people to volunteer.

402
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:55,460
You can help reshape the entire future of health care for generations to come.

403
00:41:55,670 --> 00:42:01,100
If we can figure out how to fly, put a man on the moon and connect with the entire world.

404
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:06,280
Surely we should be able to improve the future of health care, not just for Ray,

405
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:15,260
even or even you and all of us who sign up and join all of us for the future and health begins with you.

406
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:24,810
All right. Well, before you begin your small groups, any sort of immediate reactions to this video or what it just like or.

407
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,720
Well, let's start there. What did you like about this video as a way of maybe.

408
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:33,649
Getting people money, is that right? It goes pretty straight forward.

409
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:40,190
And she was also soft spoken as well. But the general audience, it shouldn't be complete surprise.

410
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:47,540
It's a pretty, pretty understandable at a range of literacy levels, you thought and thought about inviting.

411
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:59,719
NARRATOR. Other than that, sometimes I really like how it appeals to multiple like a preference of the interest that people have the interest of,

412
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:08,810
like making your life and your children much better, like tourism, like having them work versus medicine or to to help other people around the board.

413
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:16,250
So it's not only focusing on like one aspects of like the practice of like our president, all of them, without going into detail.

414
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:19,520
So if you are interested in one of them, you can learn more on that later.

415
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:23,540
Mm hmm. Do you view all of the other options of the advantages of this?

416
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:27,680
Yeah. So kind of some broad based appeals here.

417
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:33,890
Yeah. It's hard for people to who wouldn't get behind some of the goals they were talking about.

418
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:41,390
Yeah, it's Marcella. Yeah, I thought that visually, they were very intentional in making sure to showcase diversity.

419
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:43,700
Mm hmm. So it's kind of spreading the message of, like,

420
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:49,430
precision medicine has the ability to close those equity gaps that are known just historically exist in medicine.

421
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:55,190
Mm hmm. Yeah, I think they were very. And we'll talk a little bit more about how they actually funded certain outreach

422
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:59,810
programs to try to make sure they're being more inclusive than prior efforts have been.

423
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:11,530
Other reactions. I liked how my grandmother would always use the phrase, If we can put a man on the moon, why can't we do X?

424
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:17,090
And so it kind of reminded me of my grandmother. Why can't we, you know, fix the roads if we can put a man on the moon?

425
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:21,610
Yeah, that's what you're doing, Alex.

426
00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:25,739
I thought it was interesting. I feel like it did kind of fall into the category.

427
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:30,520
A little bit of, like, the overhyping, because as soon as we hit a million, we're going to get all these answers.

428
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:36,050
Yeah. And the overhyping, I think before is something I hadn't really thought about in my previous genetics class.

429
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:41,400
And so I think it does fall into that a little bit is like all we need is a million people and we'll get all these answers.

430
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:45,450
Do you worry that it's a promissory note that to be persuasive?

431
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:48,569
Yeah, I think it's a good approach for that purpose.

432
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:54,990
But there's such a higher BS like they will weigh these issues of like you can't overpromise on benefits,

433
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:59,819
whether it's genetics or not, because it could be seen, as always, that kind of undue influence.

434
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:07,540
If they're if you're kind of overselling the benefits, I guess some idea you must have a Andrew.

435
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:14,820
Yeah, I really think it's overly optimistic. I mean, even in a data set of a million, you can still have a lot of noise.

436
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:16,320
I mean, I work with big data.

437
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:24,450
Um, so, like, we, we intentionally seek out patterns and you may actually end up doing significant damage because you think there's something there,

438
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:27,329
but there's not actually something there at all.

439
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:31,680
And now you've convinced these people that you're going to cure them when you don't actually know what the answer is.

440
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,830
Mm hmm. Yeah. You bring up this concept we'll talk about.

441
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:38,530
It's called the therapeutic misconception, which happens in some.

442
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:43,320
You may have heard about a research ethics concept where where people might misconstrue

443
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:49,660
the purpose of a study as being more about having direct benefits than it really does.

444
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:59,250
So it sounds like both you and Alex are picking up on these themes of or is there overhype happening here, other reactions to that?

445
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,309
Yes, sir. I thought it was interesting.

446
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:08,700
They didn't really talk about what the participants would actually have to do, because it's someone who has done a lot of recruiting.

447
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:14,610
Those people are not interested in taking any more time out of their day unless they're like guaranteed to get some money out of it.

448
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:19,050
So it didn't really say like, Oh, it's really easy to participate or like it'll take as much time,

449
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,710
which might make people not even interested in looking into what it is.

450
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:29,400
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, to be fair, I think they're trying to see this is the teaser trailer and then you click to learn more,

451
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,020
then you find out some of those details.

452
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:37,349
But are you suggesting you thought maybe a nod to that in the actual video might be like it's only because have so many

453
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:44,130
people that like click away immediately or hang up on a call if they think it's going to take any time out of their day.

454
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:45,420
Yeah. Okay.

455
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:53,759
So in terms of taking the time when I participate in this, the first question was so long, but then I actually give them a chance with everything.

456
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,569
But they're really processing and they're calling news, so they call multiple times.

457
00:46:57,570 --> 00:47:02,580
And so, I mean, like there are 20 minutes left from this question and you need to complete.

458
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:06,240
And then after that we will call you and like the location you can go.

459
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:14,759
So I think that the idea of our like outcomes from this is so they don't want to like say something in the teaser because it is sometimes,

460
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:20,700
I mean even that is like even the day I went to to do like, like lunch with me like 2 hours prior.

461
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:24,520
So I think they're right up there.

462
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:30,989
This is the foot in the door. So we're going, well, I think what I'd like you to do, as I mentioned,

463
00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:36,050
is it's now you've seen the video, but here's the website where you can learn more.

464
00:47:36,070 --> 00:47:42,780
So break into smaller groups. Again, I leave it up to you exactly how to sort yourselves, but take some time,

465
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:50,760
poke around the website and then talk in your small group about your how you think about these these questions.

466
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:56,220
So I'll have you do that now and then we'll see what you come up with.

467
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:13,740
Do you know who is this, your company?

468
00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:27,140
That how about I like I said, I know that I'm going to return.

469
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:31,660
Really. So it's great to work on that.

470
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:48,320
I had learned in the drawing and from doing the site, I found out this is sort of like I was like, Oh, this is where I'm going to be.

471
00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:52,230
Like, because they do have something new about this one more time.

472
00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:57,480
Working on another subject, I had this.

473
00:48:58,770 --> 00:49:16,450
I think so. You got it on reporting for us to really have anything out there about trying to get

474
00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:39,129
us more excited about the story and arguing that the only reason why Nelson says

475
00:49:39,130 --> 00:49:51,070
not a question that they've got to try to be respectful around the office is everyone

476
00:49:51,130 --> 00:50:13,870
and I think there's something terribly important is to get as much as you can.

477
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:33,930
I think it was kind of like what you thought about how hard it is when want to talk about this section.

478
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:55,050
All of them are struggling to understand that you I want to hear of things that people and how it can happen.

479
00:50:56,020 --> 00:51:13,060
That there are some things that kind of have already confidentiality, but certainly not something that's really going to be done before.

480
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:23,670
It's strange that you can't speculate about their decision to work in the writers room.

481
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:30,760
For Americans not like you, it's just a simple yes or no.

482
00:51:32,110 --> 00:51:49,509
I will not use that for criminal acts if that's what to get out of letting people know that it's just

483
00:51:49,510 --> 00:52:01,270
going to come out and there's going to be a question about presidency that I didn't like about that.

484
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:11,180
No, no. So how about this?

485
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:26,140
Yeah, I heard about it in front of the website and online, and I was thinking that.

486
00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:42,310
But I'm surprised about that because that's a big part of the incentive for a lot of people.

487
00:52:42,900 --> 00:53:04,840
Thank you for sharing. So, like I said, I would agree with your I would want to point out that I don't know the exact point or,

488
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:15,300
you know, genetically, I'm sending a signal which was like, oh, my God, what have I done wrong?

489
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:29,810
I know that, like when you talk about what you're trying to find there and then then we want to look like a very positive influence how easy it is.

490
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:42,830
Sometimes I think the same would be true if they say they had a hard time just

491
00:53:42,850 --> 00:53:58,490
because I think that you're single and I don't think anyone or anything like that.

492
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:02,800
I. I. You I. I love cilantro.

493
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:10,310
It's truly great.

494
00:54:10,610 --> 00:54:14,040
I just I don't know.

495
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:22,850
They are not necessarily how they do it, you know, 24 seven, like someone like me.

496
00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:35,090
And they're like, oh, you don't like that?

497
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:49,240
That's like, I have no idea how that works.

498
00:54:54,330 --> 00:54:57,780
And then I'd be like, Ah, well, know what it is.

499
00:54:57,780 --> 00:55:01,800
And in that regard. Very much like, I mean, there's something we're going to work.

500
00:55:02,150 --> 00:55:13,260
Well, I was like, my job is to get you in there and be like, That's what we're going to do.

501
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:18,300
Everything we cover is out there, just like you guys are.

502
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:27,060
Well, it's like once you're in, you feel obligated to all this stuff that I've never had,

503
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:40,560
and I think that's been directly benefit you and that you're going to need a lot of it.

504
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:51,090
Yeah. All right. Let's come back together, everybody. My apologies if I sent you short, but time is break.

505
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:55,799
Keep things rolling. So. Yeah, so any. Any group want to chime in?

506
00:55:55,800 --> 00:56:00,450
Want some of their take home points were in discussing these questions.

507
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:09,660
Yeah. Not only for the question to be discussed how the African-American population specifically might

508
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:20,010
have a hard time wanting to join this initiative because of the Tuskegee experiment with syphilis.

509
00:56:20,070 --> 00:56:29,220
Mm hmm. So a lot of African-Americans have even had difficulty wanting to get their COVID vaccine because of what happened in the past.

510
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:32,610
So this is something that they wouldn't really take lightly.

511
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:36,030
So, I mean, yeah, I think not just African-Americans,

512
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:42,149
but other groups as well who have not historically had positive experiences with not just genetic research,

513
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:45,630
but even kind of encounters with the medical establishment more broadly.

514
00:56:46,050 --> 00:56:53,430
You sounds like were you thinking you might want a little bit more direct attention to those issues in the recruitment or.

515
00:56:53,760 --> 00:57:01,970
Yeah, maybe more like security and safety issues, the like and what they plan on doing with the data, how they're collecting it.

516
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:11,430
So like assurances, assurance and like they're not going to, you know, whatever we give them, they're not going to use it for another reason.

517
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:21,659
Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Yeah. So these issues around kind of informed consent, making sure people are truly apprized of what it will and won't be used for.

518
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:25,110
I feel like I heard this group maybe also talking about privacy as a theme.

519
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:30,719
Yeah. So regarding the idea, that was something that was talked about.

520
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:38,070
And I think part of the difficulty is because this is basically just trying to create a database to help future research.

521
00:57:38,430 --> 00:57:43,320
And so I think that can be a challenge in terms of what research will actually help support,

522
00:57:43,350 --> 00:57:46,950
just because it's just trying to collect that data from everyone.

523
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:51,839
Mm hmm. And so I think really just setting that expectation of where, um, probably could have been more clear,

524
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:56,790
it's how we're trying to build a database, and it's not funding any specific research project.

525
00:57:56,790 --> 00:57:59,850
It's just you're going to be part of a dataset, essentially.

526
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:07,370
But I think, again, this is from my experience of trying to prepare for this.

527
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:11,610
Security and privacy was definitely a really big concern for a lot of people, especially because,

528
00:58:12,330 --> 00:58:18,750
you know, maybe having access to your electronic medical records, whichever system you're going through.

529
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:25,319
And so I think they do mention like in there, I think U.S. about security and privacy,

530
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:33,300
but I think they could have gone in more detail just because that is a big concern for a lot of people and has been probably,

531
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:40,559
again, is where I think it's like one of the biggest barriers for women wanting to sign up for it because they want to keep their information private.

532
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:43,860
They don't want their information being out there for someone to access. Yeah.

533
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:49,980
Diana, as we'll talk about when we talk about genetics and race, we'll talk about, you know, in the late public,

534
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:56,910
I think there's this sense that genetic information is used for all kinds of purposes and that even though professionally we may know,

535
00:58:56,910 --> 00:59:02,220
oh, there's really kind of a firewall between the all of us Biobank and like the FBI,

536
00:59:02,250 --> 00:59:10,440
CODIS databases just use one example and the public there may not be that appreciation or even that even if there is maybe not that trust,

537
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:17,510
that there wouldn't be some way to link genetic information that's collected for medical purposes with how it's used sometimes,

538
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:21,089
you know, in the criminal justice system. So I think I think that. Marty, back to your point.

539
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:27,900
I think this issue of kind of trust and privacy, I think is really important and really does maybe matter differently to different

540
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:33,450
groups and can pose a challenge for collecting and truly representative data.

541
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:36,389
What else? So what other points?

542
00:59:36,390 --> 00:59:43,260
Yeah, Carly, I know one of the biggest incentives for people to participate would be the returning of their genetic information.

543
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:48,540
And I think that that raises some ethical issues of what kind of information are you returning,

544
00:59:49,170 --> 00:59:53,999
what supports, if any, are you offering to people who are having that genetic information return?

545
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:59,520
Because there's a lot of mis interpretation and lack of knowledge in interpreting

546
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:04,770
those results yourself that could lead to kind of like a mental burden.

547
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:11,339
And is it ethical to inflict that on people who aren't fully aware of what those results could mean

548
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:17,430
and that that's a burden that they could face by obtaining those results that we talked about.

549
01:00:17,430 --> 01:00:26,249
Then I think I 15 in last semester also like how prepared and how much of informed consent can you get from people when giving

550
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:32,819
their genetic information back because do they really fully understand the gravity of some of these results that may come back?

551
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:37,830
And how much are they giving them doing it? Right. Yeah, great points there.

552
01:00:37,830 --> 01:00:40,500
So it sounds like I mean, I think this return of results,

553
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:46,739
I think is seen in one way as a potential direct benefit that could entice people to take part.

554
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:54,059
But you're raising the good point that it needs to be done carefully and responsibly if it truly is going to be a benefit.

555
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:59,940
I think you're also bringing up these issues of, well, maybe for some issues, there needs to be what we might call a tiered consent model,

556
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:04,140
where you have kind of an initial informed consent to give information,

557
01:01:04,470 --> 01:01:12,240
but then maybe you need to read consent to people on other important factors, such as, do you really want your results or not?

558
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:18,450
I don't know. Jessica in your experience, I'm assuming they probably came back to you with a separate query.

559
01:01:18,450 --> 01:01:28,209
Do you want your was that my very first day? I doubt they were separate from the enrollment that you had to watch movies like 30 minutes of videos.

560
01:01:28,210 --> 01:01:31,260
And at the end it was like, are you sure?

561
01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:38,100
All these questions about like, I understand this and there's like a quiz on was to make sure you understood.

562
01:01:38,490 --> 01:01:46,230
Yeah, like what you're consenting to. So I think they were trying to break this up and think of consent at multiple levels.

563
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:52,920
Yeah. As we'll talk about when we talk about return of results, I think the study has been relatively conservative upfront.

564
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:58,680
I think some of you may know about this ACOG list of clinically actionable genes.

565
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:05,159
I think they're relying on that. It was originally they got a list of like 56 and I think now it's in the seventies, but it is it's not.

566
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:09,090
You know, for example, we'll talk about Alzheimer's. Aphiwe is not part of that mix.

567
01:02:09,090 --> 01:02:13,319
It's just for conditions where we know we have proven treatment or prevention options.

568
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:17,969
And the genetic test tells us, you know, not with absolute certainty,

569
01:02:17,970 --> 01:02:23,940
but at least you're pretty notable in terms of its linkage between the gene and the risk of disease as opposed to,

570
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:27,780
oh, you have a 3% higher chance of diabetes because of this variant.

571
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:37,290
So yeah, so interesting discussion of return of results, other themes we haven't talked about it, new groups going into.

572
01:02:37,650 --> 01:02:46,889
We also talked about how the media is somewhat good and that creating a diverse population of people in India is not encompassing all.

573
01:02:46,890 --> 01:02:52,750
So there's no bodies different body size of the different villages in the media school.

574
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:56,940
This huge portion of people within the US is that is not appealing to them.

575
01:02:57,390 --> 01:03:02,640
And I talked about like when I was a participant I went to like personally to do the test,

576
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:07,950
didn't have leg equipments that like fit my body size and that causes problems.

577
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:15,240
I think they're trying to diversify, but like there are steps that they can take that could put.

578
01:03:16,810 --> 01:03:22,209
So now talking about the the ways that they are trying to diversify,

579
01:03:22,210 --> 01:03:28,690
because I'm just looking at the events and they're all in major cities and a lot of them are in Las Vegas.

580
01:03:29,140 --> 01:03:35,830
And like the first person they showed on the video was a rural farmer, supposedly.

581
01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:46,780
And then I also wondered the composition of all of us researchers like John Letter organizing these events.

582
01:03:47,140 --> 01:03:51,970
Are they nonwhite bodies? Yeah, great question.

583
01:03:51,990 --> 01:03:55,750
I'll talk about it more next time because next time it's history.

584
01:03:55,750 --> 01:04:01,750
We'll talk about like how we learn from the past. I'll use all of us as an example where they've learned some lessons.

585
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:03,880
So they did. Just to give you a sneak preview, though,

586
01:04:04,150 --> 01:04:10,479
they did have kind of an open call for community partners who are interested in working with all of us to get funded.

587
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:15,530
So they think they did have kind of specific organizations that got awards, you know,

588
01:04:15,530 --> 01:04:21,010
and some of them were you know, they were around different racial ethnic minority groups, LGBTQ groups.

589
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:27,610
So those they were like kind of community partners that all of us through this process is now working with.

590
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:32,080
But again, it's not all encompassing, as I think you're both bringing up.

591
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:36,729
There's so many different groups that have not been well-represented.

592
01:04:36,730 --> 01:04:41,770
And so I think they're making some strides, but it's certainly not an exhaustive list.

593
01:04:41,770 --> 01:04:46,659
But I think it did actually represent a break with the past in that most of these kinds of

594
01:04:46,660 --> 01:04:51,820
studies really haven't made any very minimal effort around any kind of a community engagement.

595
01:04:52,150 --> 01:04:54,820
So I think we can critique it. And public health is not going far enough.

596
01:04:55,240 --> 01:05:00,910
But I think at least it was thinking outside the box of, oh, it's this very top down expert model.

597
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:06,280
And it was at least, hey, why don't we talk to people who speak for these communities?

598
01:05:06,580 --> 01:05:09,639
But I do think your point is well taken around the diversity of investigators.

599
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:19,240
I think we still see, you know, a real challenge there. I don't have a great sense now of the composition of the all of us team.

600
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:25,900
But I think your point is that it's ultimately going to be used not just by the primary collectors of the data,

601
01:05:26,350 --> 01:05:29,500
but we're going to see a lot more secondary use as well.

602
01:05:30,790 --> 01:05:34,450
So I hope that it's kind of long winded. I'm a professor.

603
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:40,060
Long winded. Other thoughts?

604
01:05:41,050 --> 01:05:47,860
Yeah. Is it chewy? Yes. What improvement we thought might be necessary is in regards to accessibility.

605
01:05:48,190 --> 01:05:55,540
So in the eligible page, they say that you don't need Internet access, you don't need a device to be a part of the study.

606
01:05:56,230 --> 01:06:00,040
But then in those, what participants share, like the step by step, what you need to do.

607
01:06:00,970 --> 01:06:06,810
One of the things you have to do is answer these health surveys, and the only options given are to answer them on a computer,

608
01:06:06,820 --> 01:06:10,870
tablet or smartphone, and there's no paper option or anything like that.

609
01:06:10,870 --> 01:06:15,519
So we were thinking like something they could do was have a mail out survey or say

610
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:18,690
that you can complete those surveys that you did that I presented or something.

611
01:06:18,940 --> 01:06:27,390
Yeah, certainly having worked with a lot of older adults, sometimes that can be a barrier to participation among people, you know, 17 of us.

612
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:33,850
So I don't know what their age range is off the top of my head, but that could be a concern for representation.

613
01:06:33,860 --> 01:06:38,649
Plus, just the digital divide issues here. All right.

614
01:06:38,650 --> 01:06:43,240
Well, so some good thoughts here. I think in the interest of time, I'm going to move on.

615
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:47,020
But again, as I as I said, I think we'll do this from time to time or I'll give you, hey,

616
01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:54,430
here's an example of an existing, you know, educational tool in the name of genetics, research or practice.

617
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:58,120
And we'll try to, you know, look critically at some of that.

618
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:06,010
So I'm going to shift gears. I'll talk a little bit. So Eric Green did have a follow up, more recent kind of vision paper, if you will.

619
01:07:06,340 --> 01:07:14,709
I won't go into great detail, but these were some of the themes that he was talking about in this more recent vision that,

620
01:07:14,710 --> 01:07:19,450
again, I think will be broad course themes as well.

621
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:23,830
But let's shift talking about public health genetics in particular.

622
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:28,420
And again, I know some of you have already taken epic courses in this realm,

623
01:07:29,260 --> 01:07:32,440
but I think it's important when we think about public health genetics to think about,

624
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:36,700
well, what are the core services in the field of public health to begin with?

625
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:43,810
And so many of you have probably seen this wheel before that kind of highlights the ten essential services.

626
01:07:44,890 --> 01:07:48,010
And to think about, well, how does genetics map on this?

627
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:53,650
I think we can all be talking about that. But before we get into that, I'll just add a big picture level.

628
01:07:54,160 --> 01:08:02,080
When you think about shifting from maybe a more medical focus to a public health approach, what are going to be the differences in emphasis?

629
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:08,140
Can you imagine in terms of the types of applications or interventions that might be entertained?

630
01:08:08,410 --> 01:08:11,680
Yeah. So. Katie Right. Yes. So in some of the articles,

631
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:20,880
it talked a lot about how the public health viewpoint really focuses on the social determinants of health and not just the biological basis,

632
01:08:21,310 --> 01:08:28,389
the environment and everything. Right. I think like a medical approach would just look at that biological basis and would

633
01:08:28,390 --> 01:08:33,070
just look at that to treat it and not really use it to understand the patterns.

634
01:08:34,510 --> 01:08:39,790
I think hopefully that's changing some in medicine, but I think traditionally that has it's you know,

635
01:08:40,050 --> 01:08:48,400
of has tried to take more of the bio psychosocial and then the medical has been a little bit more at the biological end of things.

636
01:08:49,750 --> 01:08:56,590
Other thoughts here about differences in emphasis in the public health genomics kind of approach?

637
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:12,930
Average. What do you recommend? Like more communicators of genetic information to integrate like social determinants of health,

638
01:09:12,930 --> 01:09:19,290
like having them sort of play into a kind of a communication of that.

639
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:25,800
Yeah. So you're asking about, like, how to integrate more discussion of that?

640
01:09:26,490 --> 01:09:30,870
Yeah. Like, of course on like the educational side for practitioners.

641
01:09:30,870 --> 01:09:38,690
And then also then how do you sort of take an account for different, you know.

642
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:45,110
External things that aren't purely about the genetically engineered to disease.

643
01:09:45,330 --> 01:09:45,979
Well, yeah, I think.

644
01:09:45,980 --> 01:09:51,560
Well, some of it might start on the research and I think that's where the all of us approach does have some promise because again,

645
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:57,920
a lot of our when we talk about giving people risk information, it's only as good as the data we collect.

646
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:05,300
And if we don't account for these social determinants in our risk models, then we're really not going to be able to say much about,

647
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:10,400
well, you may have this genetic risk factor, but here's how these other factors might counteract that.

648
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:18,320
We can't really say anything in a quantitative way if we haven't done the research that actually is kind of broader based.

649
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:23,540
But I think another point I would make too is and we'll talk some about I mentioned the importance of metaphor.

650
01:10:23,810 --> 01:10:30,440
So thinking about the metaphors we use when we talk about genetics, a lot of times it is in these very deterministic,

651
01:10:30,890 --> 01:10:41,810
like the blueprint for life, you know, or that kind of language that does not necessarily allow for much of a social determinants perspective.

652
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:46,219
So I think those kind of attention to language and metaphor would be another thing.

653
01:10:46,220 --> 01:10:54,049
But I think keep your questions a great one. Let's keep that in mind as we go through this semester, you know, as you critique different materials,

654
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:59,180
maybe, you know, a point you'll keep coming back to is, hey, where are the social determinants in this?

655
01:11:00,150 --> 01:11:06,090
Specific communication. Andrew I think one of the problems is that especially in modern medicine,

656
01:11:06,090 --> 01:11:11,820
there is so much incentive, particularly financial incentive to focus on reactionary treatment,

657
01:11:12,210 --> 01:11:18,570
whereas public health is much more focused on prevention and how do we stop things from happening in the first place?

658
01:11:19,410 --> 01:11:22,980
And so certainly like thinking about that in terms of genetics, you know,

659
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:28,860
working ahead of time, oh, you're susceptible to, you know, having something later on.

660
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:32,900
What can we do to lower that risk rather than try and cure it entirely?

661
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:34,589
Yes.

662
01:11:34,590 --> 01:11:45,270
So prevention, genetic testing is to be used thinking more on the front end as a screen where then we might advise behavioral changes to lower risk.

663
01:11:45,660 --> 01:11:49,110
Yeah, that's saying yeah, yeah. This is sort of going off.

664
01:11:49,110 --> 01:11:56,070
As Andrew's point, the public health approach could also focus more on like a genetic environment interaction,

665
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:03,240
which seems like the environment is not emphasized all that much in the medical and other things.

666
01:12:04,770 --> 01:12:08,580
So maybe that would be like epigenetics could be another like environmental health,

667
01:12:08,610 --> 01:12:15,150
risk factors and hazards, things of that sort, like toxic stuff that.

668
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:18,830
Yeah. So, you know. Yes.

669
01:12:18,830 --> 01:12:21,880
I'm thinking about fields like epigenetics and genomics.

670
01:12:21,890 --> 01:12:27,800
These these films that inherently think about things in a gene environment, interaction kind of way.

671
01:12:27,890 --> 01:12:30,790
Yeah. Well, in the interest of time, let me just keep keep rolling here.

672
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:35,390
So traditionally, this is a kind of a complicated table, but it comes from one of your assigned readings.

673
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:36,590
Traditionally,

674
01:12:36,590 --> 01:12:44,389
how genetics has been incorporated in public health has been through newborn screening that we'll talk about a little bit on clinical genetics.

675
01:12:44,390 --> 01:12:54,049
So taking kind of existing genetic programs in medicine, you know, traditional focus has been, you know, sickle disease, sickle cell disease outreach.

676
01:12:54,050 --> 01:13:01,370
And more recently, we've seen a lot around cancer genetics, but trying to do things like having outreach clinics or partnering to kind of expand,

677
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:05,510
reach and access to these clinical proven clinical genetic services.

678
01:13:06,050 --> 01:13:11,300
And then there's been a fair bit on kind of birth defects. So this is kind of the traditional approach.

679
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:16,730
But again, in recent years, I think we've seen an expansion behind those three traditional domains.

680
01:13:16,730 --> 01:13:22,700
And we've also seen a shift towards looking at genetics and focusing more on genomics.

681
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:28,399
So this table, I think, is a nice way of kind of highlighting some of the distinctions,

682
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:34,730
whereas in in medical genetics were often looking at diseases primarily caused by a single gene,

683
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:43,340
whereas in genomics we're looking more at these kind of complex diseases where it's a much more complicated picture,

684
01:13:43,940 --> 01:13:48,140
but then therefore it's also relevant to a broader range of conditions.

685
01:13:49,130 --> 01:13:55,430
And so I think these are some of the distinctions that not just between genetics and genomics as fields of study,

686
01:13:55,700 --> 01:14:03,919
but also in clinically how it works is that we've seen a lot of focus in medicine, on genetics and in public health.

687
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:10,610
We're trying to integrate genomics more thoughtfully across these different kinds of realms.

688
01:14:10,610 --> 01:14:17,989
And again, I'm I realize I'm being like highly oversimplifying and I don't mean to to to insult realms of medicine

689
01:14:17,990 --> 01:14:23,060
that have really moved towards a genomics focus or that do really take seriously social determinants.

690
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:30,620
But these are just kind of some of the first kind of a straw man approach to to highlight the differences.

691
01:14:31,010 --> 01:14:34,700
So I think we've been already hitting on some of these themes.

692
01:14:35,030 --> 01:14:39,290
So again, this idea of population thinking in population health as opposed to specialty care,

693
01:14:39,620 --> 01:14:45,830
I think thinking about health disparities is really prominent. So thinking about equity and reach and access,

694
01:14:46,190 --> 01:14:52,549
I think also thinking about before we'll even kind of pursue something or fund it really in public health,

695
01:14:52,550 --> 01:14:56,210
we really want to understand, hey, is it cost effective?

696
01:14:56,600 --> 01:15:01,790
We want to have that body of research ahead of time before really investing heavily.

697
01:15:03,350 --> 01:15:05,780
And then I think people have already talked about this.

698
01:15:05,780 --> 01:15:10,849
Social determinants of health seem to counteract what might be known as the streetlight effect.

699
01:15:10,850 --> 01:15:15,140
I don't know if people know about this metaphor, this idea of sometimes.

700
01:15:16,660 --> 01:15:21,399
Genetics research has been critiqued, as, you know, looking for things only where the light is shining.

701
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:27,459
And the light here might be our technology of gas or or gene discovery.

702
01:15:27,460 --> 01:15:32,710
And so even if the the answer might be outside of where that light is shining,

703
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:38,410
the temptation is to only look there, because that's where we have the powerful tools to illuminate.

704
01:15:38,740 --> 01:15:42,850
And so the hope is by expanding some of our research teams.

705
01:15:42,850 --> 01:15:47,319
And so I think you're seeing a call to move towards or transdisciplinary research to

706
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:52,240
really get partnerships across disciplines that haven't always worked together before.

707
01:15:53,620 --> 01:16:02,050
I think in public health, because of these concerns about broad population benefit, we've seen folks like Bayer and Goliath.

708
01:16:02,110 --> 01:16:06,580
Sandra I used to be here at Michigan. He's now the dean at BYU School of Public Health.

709
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:16,510
And so, again, this quote, I'm not going to read it all, but it kind of highlights some of the concerns that are really the the bang for the buck,

710
01:16:16,510 --> 01:16:23,559
if you will, of just strict genetic approaches has not always been as great as as more public health approaches.

711
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:29,790
And I think some of this may have to do with a phenomenon that I first saw described as gizmo idolatry.

712
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:32,500
I really like this kind of turn of phrase.

713
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:41,080
This doesn't refer just to to genetic technologies, but also kind of more broadly in medicine, how particularly in the U.S. medical system,

714
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:49,810
we tend to often be seduced by these really kind of exciting, potentially powerful, technologically oriented solutions.

715
01:16:50,140 --> 01:17:01,990
And so these authors are kind of saying it's one thing to be kind of entertained or intrigued by them, but worry that we go too far in adopting these.

716
01:17:01,990 --> 01:17:11,649
And so they kind of in this paper, they lay out some of the reasons why they think this this phenomenon of gizmo idolatry has such a hold in medicine,

717
01:17:11,650 --> 01:17:15,700
whether it's genetic testing or other technologies.

718
01:17:15,970 --> 01:17:20,530
And they highlighted some of the reasons why they think it has such staying power.

719
01:17:20,530 --> 01:17:28,750
And some of it may have to do with, you know, some things are they're just inherently kind of cool technologies, though, and that this is what I,

720
01:17:29,020 --> 01:17:33,729
I like this idea of, you know, exploits versus uneventful diligence,

721
01:17:33,730 --> 01:17:37,750
a lot of kind of traditional public health approaches might not seem that exciting.

722
01:17:37,750 --> 01:17:43,479
They might seem like uneventful diligence. Maybe they don't draw people into the field, but they they're tried and true.

723
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:50,320
And they can be very powerful. Perhaps they're less jazzy or sexy than some of these more technologically focused approaches.

724
01:17:50,590 --> 01:17:55,239
This idea that it's a way to kind of show that you're an early adopter or,

725
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:58,569
you know, ahead of the curve if you're if you're into these new technologies.

726
01:17:58,570 --> 01:18:06,280
And so it's seen as a proof of competence. And particularly on the commercial side, it can be a great way of generating a lot of venture capital.

727
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:10,330
If you can kind of appeal to these ideas of, hey, we've got to the next great thing.

728
01:18:10,570 --> 01:18:15,610
But these authors, you know, they have some caution as well that oftentimes, you know,

729
01:18:15,610 --> 01:18:22,540
we have unintended harms and we don't have that population based benefit through the high tech approaches.

730
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:29,050
So I'll close today by talking just a little bit about kind of traditional public health genomics efforts.

731
01:18:29,290 --> 01:18:35,620
So I talked about Francis Collins on the nature side. I mean, we inquiry is kind of his counterpart at CDC.

732
01:18:35,950 --> 01:18:42,220
So they have this Office of Public Health Genomics there that's now celebrating its 25th anniversary.

733
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:49,179
So Dr. Kroger is kind of a luminary in the field, will be talking this semester about some of their initiatives.

734
01:18:49,180 --> 01:18:51,010
So we'll talk some. For example,

735
01:18:51,310 --> 01:18:58,870
they've developed a whole different rating system for different kinds of genetic tests based on their kind of cost effectiveness and utility.

736
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:07,360
So we'll talk about Tier one versus Tier two versus Tier three test tier one being kind of the highest level of of evidence.

737
01:19:07,930 --> 01:19:12,309
This group has already highlighted the importance of also not just thinking about genetic testing,

738
01:19:12,310 --> 01:19:16,780
but thinking about the importance of family history and identifying high risk groups.

739
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:23,530
So these are, you know, just a few themes that the public health genomics officer, CDC has highlighted.

740
01:19:24,430 --> 01:19:27,850
They do have, if you're interested and I'll try to post something online,

741
01:19:27,850 --> 01:19:33,879
they're having kind of a new symposium to roll out in February celebrating their anniversary.

742
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:40,150
They also have a great kind of weekly digest. If you're interested, if you go on their website, you can subscribe to that.

743
01:19:40,150 --> 01:19:46,420
So Cory really talks a lot about some of these themes we've already kind of gotten into.

744
01:19:46,420 --> 01:19:51,159
But Andrew, you'll be pleased. This idea of treatment to prevention, a shifting focus.

745
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:59,860
He, Cory, uses this idea of familial hypercholesterolemia as a great example of where we could probably do more using genetic testing,

746
01:19:59,860 --> 01:20:05,890
because this is a very treatable condition that we can nipped in the bud early.

747
01:20:06,460 --> 01:20:09,880
So in the interest of time, I won't march through all of this.

748
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:16,120
But just to note that we're going to talk some about precision medicine, but we'll be talking.

749
01:20:16,260 --> 01:20:20,910
A lot here about this notion of precision health and what does that mean?

750
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:27,750
So that's it for today. So for Wednesday, we'll talk about some historical themes.

751
01:20:27,870 --> 01:20:34,440
So you also if you haven't done so already, you had your first opportunity, a semester to read and respond.

752
01:20:35,190 --> 01:20:40,380
We'll talk about this CC little building controversy here at U of M a few years back.

753
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:44,700
So that would be some of our focus for next time.

754
01:20:46,170 --> 01:20:49,260
So with that, let's call it a day.

755
01:20:57,030 --> 01:21:08,580
How are you guys going to do that? You're going to keep your text, not it from the resources like right now.

756
01:21:09,390 --> 01:21:16,440
I know. I know.

757
01:21:16,740 --> 01:21:21,810
I remember. Right?

758
01:21:22,260 --> 01:21:25,770
I know. I know. I know.

759
01:21:27,930 --> 01:21:39,749
I forgot to look at Morgan Stanley analyst Thank you.

760
01:21:39,750 --> 01:21:48,450
But you know, so I should have asked last time.

761
01:21:50,730 --> 01:21:55,020
This is later. So there you have it right here because she's an English teacher.

762
01:21:55,020 --> 01:21:59,070
It's been there since I have documentation and I have enjoyed.
