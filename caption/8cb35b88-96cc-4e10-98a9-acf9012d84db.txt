1
00:00:00,283 --> 00:00:06,253
Now we're going to talk about after the search, so we've talked about what to do before the job search, what to do during.

2
00:00:06,253 --> 00:00:10,363
And now we're going to talk about after. Yes, there's stuff you do after.

3
00:00:10,363 --> 00:00:14,173
Remember, though, that the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.

4
00:00:14,173 --> 00:00:20,923
And the after. It's important to keep thinking about your dreams and revisiting the activities you did in the first section

5
00:00:20,923 --> 00:00:29,533
around your values and what you'd like your future to look like and keep considering that throughout your career.

6
00:00:29,533 --> 00:00:38,863
So you got an offer, congratulations. When an offer is first extended, remember, you do not have to respond during that initial conversation.

7
00:00:38,863 --> 00:00:42,343
You can ask for time to consider and evaluate that offer.

8
00:00:42,343 --> 00:00:47,173
You don't have to say yes as soon as you get it. And also, don't forget that you can negotiate.

9
00:00:47,173 --> 00:00:55,783
A lot of times people may feel uncomfortable with negotiation. But I promise they're sort of expecting it.

10
00:00:55,783 --> 00:01:03,883
So be open to that. If you think perhaps there's some wiggle room or something that you need that based on your research that you've seen,

11
00:01:03,883 --> 00:01:12,043
perhaps there's a specific salary that you want. Are there specific benefits that you need to make that job work for you?

12
00:01:12,043 --> 00:01:16,033
Don't be afraid to ask. The worst they can say is no.

13
00:01:16,033 --> 00:01:23,953
And if you don't feel confident about this company or position or the offer that you got, it's OK to consider turning it down and looking elsewhere.

14
00:01:23,953 --> 00:01:31,423
I know for me, during my job search, I had gotten an offer at an organization that I thought perhaps it was something I knew I could do,

15
00:01:31,423 --> 00:01:36,983
but it wasn't where my passion was. And I had a difficult conversation of turning that offer down

16
00:01:36,983 --> 00:01:44,533
and I waited and three months later I got what I considered my dream job outside of graduation.

17
00:01:44,533 --> 00:01:49,423
So be open to that. You don't have to say yes. Consider your options.

18
00:01:49,423 --> 00:01:55,303
The opportunities will come. So how do you review that offer?

19
00:01:55,303 --> 00:02:02,863
How do you even know if you need to negotiate. As you evaluate you want to consider if the job is something you're excited about?

20
00:02:02,863 --> 00:02:07,963
Does it fit within your goals or was it something you just applied for because you wanted something to do?

21
00:02:07,963 --> 00:02:14,683
Do you have any hesitations about the organization? Maybe it's a topic you don't really have a lot of interest in.

22
00:02:14,683 --> 00:02:19,963
But you just like, OK I want to have a job closer to home. Consider those as well.

23
00:02:19,963 --> 00:02:25,333
How does the package align with industry trends and your expectations? Consider the salary.

24
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:30,763
Do you have any health vision and or dental benefits? What is a vacation and leave policies?

25
00:02:30,763 --> 00:02:38,383
Do they offer a retirement plan? Is there a location and cost of living that you have to consider perhaps?

26
00:02:38,383 --> 00:02:43,793
Do they offer relocation packages? Maybe if you're trying to get from Chicago to California.

27
00:02:43,793 --> 00:02:52,043
Are there other opportunities such as mentorship programs, maybe parking and transportation, a start date that they propose?

28
00:02:52,043 --> 00:02:56,063
Are all these things in line with what you want? Now nothing is perfect.

29
00:02:56,063 --> 00:03:02,993
So you may not have a job that hits 100 percent of what you want, but maybe it hits like 90 and you can do that.

30
00:03:02,993 --> 00:03:07,133
Figure out for yourself what you're willing to accept and what you're not willing to.

31
00:03:07,133 --> 00:03:12,323
What can you compromise on and what cant you? And if you're deciding between multiple offers,

32
00:03:12,323 --> 00:03:17,413
you might consider making an appointment with a career coach at your university or talking with a mentor,

33
00:03:17,413 --> 00:03:24,583
someone who can help guide you through that process to figure out what might be the best next step for you.

34
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:30,013
So to further evaluate the offer, you want to research your typical salaries, cost of living.

35
00:03:30,013 --> 00:03:32,863
See things on the organizational culture.

36
00:03:32,863 --> 00:03:41,833
I've mentioned some of these Web sites before, such as Glassdoor, LinkedIn, PayScale, salary.com and salary expert.

37
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:49,633
The last three are really useful when you're assessing cost of living and comparing locations, comparing the salaries.

38
00:03:49,633 --> 00:03:58,483
And the first two would help you research the positions and offer more insight perspectives into those organizations.

39
00:03:58,483 --> 00:04:05,943
Do your research and be sure to be able to see that you're able to make informed decisions.

40
00:04:05,943 --> 00:04:10,143
So you decided you want to negotiate now before you begin

41
00:04:10,143 --> 00:04:16,383
you want to decide what specifically you're seeking. Maybe you want like a five percent increase in salary,

42
00:04:16,383 --> 00:04:22,683
or perhaps you want to negotiate more vacation time or maybe you want a transportation allowance.

43
00:04:22,683 --> 00:04:28,533
Use the resources available to you to assess your requests for salary or cost of living that I just mentioned.

44
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:32,133
You then want to set a time to talk with your hiring manager, if possible

45
00:04:32,133 --> 00:04:36,603
try to do it over the phone. Be confident and positive.

46
00:04:36,603 --> 00:04:45,813
Highlight why you want to be the why you want to have this position, take on this role, highlight how much it means to you.

47
00:04:45,813 --> 00:04:52,443
And also mention, you know, why you're perhaps thinking about the offer a little bit more.

48
00:04:52,443 --> 00:04:57,543
Explain that you've looked over it and discussed the positives of the offer.

49
00:04:57,543 --> 00:05:00,633
Point out the concern that you'd like to discuss further.

50
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:06,633
And then at this point, you need to ask the question about whether the element of that offers negotiable.

51
00:05:06,633 --> 00:05:12,213
Not every company has negotiable benefits and not every company negotiates their salary.

52
00:05:12,213 --> 00:05:16,593
So you need to be sure to ask to see what's open to you.

53
00:05:16,593 --> 00:05:21,693
Also, the key point here is after this conversation, be sure to get everything in writing.

54
00:05:21,693 --> 00:05:29,193
You want to make sure the details you negotiated are sent to you in an updated offer letter.

55
00:05:29,193 --> 00:05:33,783
In addition to negotiating. So after you ask, is this is negotiable?

56
00:05:33,783 --> 00:05:38,283
You want to outline your specific ask if it's a yes as well as research

57
00:05:38,283 --> 00:05:48,633
you used to generate the ask. So you remember I mentioned looking at salary.com glassdoor to see other perspectives on this and what's out there.

58
00:05:48,633 --> 00:05:50,313
This is where that research comes in handy.

59
00:05:50,313 --> 00:05:57,553
And you want to highlight the things you're gonna bring to the organization that show why you deserve what you're asking for.

60
00:05:57,553 --> 00:06:04,273
If they say no and you have time on your offer, don't feel the need to accept or reject the offer over the phone, process

61
00:06:04,273 --> 00:06:09,963
this new information. Look at it again and say, OK, can I accept it as it is?

62
00:06:09,963 --> 00:06:17,893
And then if it's a maybe that means a lot of times they may say, OK, we've listened to your requests, we need to get back to you.

63
00:06:17,893 --> 00:06:24,253
And that's OK. Wait for them to get back to you. Perhaps they may not give you five percent more, but they may come back with three percent.

64
00:06:24,253 --> 00:06:32,413
Know where you're willing to stop and what is your end goal at the end of the call?

65
00:06:32,413 --> 00:06:33,913
With gratitude for the offer,

66
00:06:33,913 --> 00:06:40,633
you want to thank them for their time and come to that consensus about when you will get back to them about your decision.

67
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:44,013
Make sure you're not stretching the truth. Be honest, during the process.

68
00:06:44,013 --> 00:06:51,073
Consider negotiating for better benefits and perks, especially if perhaps a salary is not negotiable.

69
00:06:51,073 --> 00:06:57,883
Maybe getting better vacation time will make the job more worth it.

70
00:06:57,883 --> 00:07:02,143
I also want to remind you to close the loops, so respond to your written offer.

71
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:06,673
Be sure to review it to make sure it matches that verbal offer. Complete

72
00:07:06,673 --> 00:07:10,303
any new hire paperwork that you have. Ask questions

73
00:07:10,303 --> 00:07:16,843
If there's anything there's anything you don't understand. I'm a big believer of not signing something without knowing what you're signing.

74
00:07:16,843 --> 00:07:29,383
Ask questions and get clarification. So you are aware of the policies you're agreeing to and other perhaps things that the organization might need.

75
00:07:29,383 --> 00:07:33,523
Also, ask questions about the background check. Typically, organizations do a background check.

76
00:07:33,523 --> 00:07:37,853
Find out how that process works and what the next steps are.

77
00:07:37,853 --> 00:07:42,223
And if you had other scheduled or completed interviews with other organizations,

78
00:07:42,223 --> 00:07:49,513
let those hiring managers know that you were drawing your application. The job search process is actually very long and expensive one.

79
00:07:49,513 --> 00:07:55,183
So you want to keep good relationships and let them know that you were thankful for their time.

80
00:07:55,183 --> 00:08:00,253
However, that you've accepted an other interview, or another offer somewhere else,

81
00:08:00,253 --> 00:08:06,013
and perhaps in the future you would cross paths with that organization again.

82
00:08:06,013 --> 00:08:09,193
Be sure to also read the employee handbook.

83
00:08:09,193 --> 00:08:16,153
It can be kind of tedious, but I always, when I start a new job, read from cover to cover the employee handbook.

84
00:08:16,153 --> 00:08:24,223
So I'm familiar with all the policies that I'm agreeing to. I like to know what the dress code is, perhaps what the time of policy is.

85
00:08:24,223 --> 00:08:30,433
Is there a remote work policy? Any specific things that you may want to consider?

86
00:08:30,433 --> 00:08:35,773
For instance, my last job, they had a fragrance free policy at the office.

87
00:08:35,773 --> 00:08:41,253
I would not have known that had I not read the employee handbook.

88
00:08:41,253 --> 00:08:48,713
And I want you to remember to thank everyone, send thank you notes to those who interviewed you and also to anyone that provided a recommendation

89
00:08:48,713 --> 00:08:52,043
letter or reference. Consider making it a personal connection,

90
00:08:52,043 --> 00:08:56,333
so maybe there is something in that interview that stood out to you or you connected with maybe you were

91
00:08:56,333 --> 00:09:03,503
from the same city or you talked about baking or something in a small town that comes with the interview,

92
00:09:03,503 --> 00:09:10,533
highlight that, highlight how much it meant to you. And for recommendation, recommenders and references.

93
00:09:10,533 --> 00:09:16,433
Give an update. Let them know Hi Thank you so much for your recommendation,

94
00:09:16,433 --> 00:09:21,053
Fortunately, I got the fellowship or the job or unfortunately I didn't get this opportunity,

95
00:09:21,053 --> 00:09:26,663
but I got this instead. Keep them up to date because they're also on this journey with you.

96
00:09:26,663 --> 00:09:34,643
If possible, try sending a handwritten thank you note. But if not, a well-written email will suffice.

97
00:09:34,643 --> 00:09:39,973
And I want to say, remember to keep learning. So you've got this job or fellowship.

98
00:09:39,973 --> 00:09:46,593
Continue trying to learn new things. Ask your employer about professional development opportunities.

99
00:09:46,593 --> 00:09:54,873
Take courses on train.org. TRAIN is a national learning network that provides quality training opportunities for professionals in public health.

100
00:09:54,873 --> 00:10:00,753
And it's free. So consider using that. Perhaps your organization gives you access to LinkedIn learning.

101
00:10:00,753 --> 00:10:04,973
Watch some videos. YouTube also has a lot of free resources out there.

102
00:10:04,973 --> 00:10:10,263
Attend webinars, workshops and conferences and stay up to date on what's happening in the field.

103
00:10:10,263 --> 00:10:14,403
Maybe you want to set some Google alerts for things happening in the news.

104
00:10:14,403 --> 00:10:24,103
You want to join a bunch of Malina's or join some more professional organizations so you can keep up to date on best practices within the field.

105
00:10:24,103 --> 00:10:29,203
So to recap, we've talked to about what to do before the search

106
00:10:29,203 --> 00:10:32,593
during the search and now after the search. Remember,

107
00:10:32,593 --> 00:10:41,893
the difference between great people and everyone else is that great people create their lives actively while everyone else is created by their lives,

108
00:10:41,893 --> 00:10:49,423
passively waiting to see where life takes them next. The difference between the two is the difference between living fully and just existing.

109
00:10:49,423 --> 00:10:52,903
I hope that this series of presentations

110
00:10:52,903 --> 00:11:00,073
helps you see that difference between living fully or just existing and helps with in your career exploration.

111
00:11:00,073 --> 00:11:04,493
Thank you.
