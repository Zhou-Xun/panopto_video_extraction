00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:04,830
Hello. Welcome today's
lecture covering

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,265
visual summaries of data
encountered in public health.

3
00:00:08,265 --> 00:00:11,550
Now rarely, can we look at
a list of numbers in a data

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,120
set and quickly make a meaning
or conclusions from them.

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,265
For example, what's the highest

6
00:00:17,265 --> 00:00:19,865
or the lowest lead level
we see in children?

7
00:00:19,865 --> 00:00:23,430
Or what proportion of people
are living in poverty?

8
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,009
A graphical or pictorial
representation

9
00:00:26,009 --> 00:00:27,600
of that data is much easier to

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,480
digest and often helps us to

11
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,135
make very profound
conclusions from data.

12
00:00:32,135 --> 00:00:34,370
Interpreting graphs
is an important skill

13
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:36,275
for all public health
professionals.

14
00:00:36,275 --> 00:00:37,880
So in this lecture,
I'm going to teach you

15
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,220
the three most commonly
used graphs which are

16
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:44,015
barplots, histograms,
and scatterplots.

17
00:00:44,015 --> 00:00:46,070
So the learning objectives today

18
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:47,420
are first to talk about how

19
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:48,500
our barplot is used to

20
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,675
summarize the
categorical variable,

21
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:52,460
then how a histogram is used to

22
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,655
summarize a continuous variable,

23
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:57,140
and how a scatterplot
is used to summarize

24
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:01,660
the association between
two continuous variables.

25
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,980
Now, a barplot is used to

26
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,170
summarize one
categorical variable,

27
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,775
whether that variable
is ordinal or nominal.

28
00:01:09,775 --> 00:01:12,875
Each bar and a barplot
corresponds to

29
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:14,960
each specific
category or variable

30
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,915
that the variable can
have in your data set,

31
00:01:17,915 --> 00:01:20,030
and the height of each bar

32
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:22,370
denotes how many
individuals are in

33
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:24,200
the same category or have

34
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,215
the same value for the
variable in your data set.

35
00:01:27,215 --> 00:01:29,315
So in this data set here,

36
00:01:29,315 --> 00:01:31,070
there were six
possible responses;

37
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:33,095
A, B, C, D, E, and F,

38
00:01:33,095 --> 00:01:35,540
and you can see that among
all the subjects there were

39
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:38,965
30 subjects who gave
the responsive B and

40
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:41,840
you could say for example
that the response C was

41
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,690
given to probably
about 25 subjects.

42
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:47,720
Again, the exact number
is not known but it is

43
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:52,550
certainly somewhere
around 25 individuals.

44
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:56,050
Now, a histogram is a barplot,

45
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,980
but it is a barplot
that is applied

46
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:01,175
specifically to a
continuous variable.

47
00:02:01,175 --> 00:02:04,730
We first take the continuous
variable and we divide

48
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:08,225
the range of possible
values into intervals.

49
00:02:08,225 --> 00:02:09,710
Each of the intervals must be

50
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,645
the same width and

51
00:02:11,645 --> 00:02:14,210
essentially each of these
intervals is now a category.

52
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,085
We have taken a
continuous variable

53
00:02:16,085 --> 00:02:18,050
and made it categorical,

54
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:21,515
and technically we call
these categories bins.

55
00:02:21,515 --> 00:02:23,450
In the histogram on the right,

56
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,865
we see that the
original variable as

57
00:02:25,865 --> 00:02:26,990
each person to indicate

58
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:29,405
the total number of
hours they slept.

59
00:02:29,405 --> 00:02:32,270
Now again, because this
number is continuous

60
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:35,035
and can take any positive
value above zero,

61
00:02:35,035 --> 00:02:37,360
we first take those
values and then

62
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,535
divide them into
separate categories.

63
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:42,970
We have a category of less
than four and then 4-5 hours,

64
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:46,020
5-6, and so forth.

65
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:49,870
We have a series of bars
for each of these bins,

66
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,700
and the height of each bar is

67
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,740
again the number or often with

68
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,810
histograms the percentage of

69
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:58,300
individuals with a
value in that bin.

70
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:02,020
So as highlighted by the
orange bar in this histogram,

71
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,990
we see that the percentage
of individuals indicating

72
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:09,385
between 4-5 hours of sleep
is just under 10 percent,

73
00:03:09,385 --> 00:03:11,320
perhaps it's 8 or 9 percent.

74
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,440
Again the exact number
cannot be figured out but we

75
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,460
can get pretty close with

76
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:18,290
an approximation
just using our eyes.

77
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:21,340
Now, the real utility
of histograms is to

78
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,995
compute what we call
cumulative probabilities.

79
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,660
In the histogram,
I've highlighted

80
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,970
five bars in blue
and these indicate

81
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,920
all the individuals
in the data set who

82
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,725
indicated they slept eight
or a few hours a night.

83
00:03:32,725 --> 00:03:35,920
We can then add up the height
of these five bars to get

84
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,645
a total percentage which in
this case is 88 percent.

85
00:03:39,645 --> 00:03:42,010
So we conclude that 88
percent of people were

86
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,270
below the recommendation of

87
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,085
eight hours of sleep per night.

88
00:03:45,085 --> 00:03:48,040
You can individually
approximately figure out what

89
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,180
the height of each of these bars

90
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,325
is and then add up
the five numbers.

91
00:03:51,325 --> 00:03:54,550
You probably will not get a
number of exactly 88 percent,

92
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:57,265
but you should get a value
close to that number.

93
00:03:57,265 --> 00:03:59,770
As another example,
we can look at

94
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:02,660
the first four bars which
represent every individual

95
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,225
who indicated no more than
seven hours per night of sleep

96
00:04:05,225 --> 00:04:08,330
and the height of those four
bars adds up to 60 percent.

97
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,100
So we could conclude
that 60 percent

98
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,540
of individuals were below

99
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:14,030
the National Sleep Foundation's
minimum recommendation

100
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,320
of seven hours per
night for sleep.

101
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,855
The third plot is a scatter plot.

102
00:04:18,855 --> 00:04:20,185
As an example here,

103
00:04:20,185 --> 00:04:21,800
I show you a plot
that was published in

104
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,120
Siegel and Rothman's article in

105
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,830
the American Journal
of Public Health.

106
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:27,500
On the x-axis, we represent

107
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,570
the average percent
firearm ownership in

108
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:32,270
a US state and on the y-axis,

109
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,590
we represent the number of

110
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:38,230
male firearm suicides per
100,000 in each state.

111
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:41,135
Therefore, each dot in this plot

112
00:04:41,135 --> 00:04:44,915
represents two pieces of
information for a single state.

113
00:04:44,915 --> 00:04:47,270
I've indicated one
state here that had

114
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:50,930
an average percent firearm
ownership of 38.8 percent.

115
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:54,740
Correspondingly, that
state had 24.4 per

116
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:59,275
100,000 males committing
suicide through firearms.

117
00:04:59,275 --> 00:05:02,860
We have another point here
for another state that again

118
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:06,420
represents how many
individuals own the guns,

119
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:09,090
in this case 60.6 percent
of people in this state

120
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:11,250
own guns and there were 15 per

121
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,720
100,000 males suicides
in this state.

122
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,770
Now, a scatterplot
is used to visually

123
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:20,995
represent the relationship
of two continuous variables.

124
00:05:20,995 --> 00:05:23,560
We can see from these
dots that they tend to go

125
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,260
from the lower left
to the upper right,

126
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,310
indicating that there is

127
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:31,075
some association in which
more people owning guns

128
00:05:31,075 --> 00:05:33,550
seems to be related to having

129
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:36,520
more suicides due to
firearms in males.

130
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,950
So we could consider
drawing a line through

131
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:41,775
these dots that indicates
this relationship.

132
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:46,240
This line will be discussed
in a future lecture.

133
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,740
So pictures and tables are

134
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:52,100
necessary parts and important
features of data analysis.

135
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,755
However, they do
still have an element

136
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:57,530
of human judgment used
to interpret them.

137
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:59,750
Instead, we would
like a systematic way

138
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,890
to summarize features of

139
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:04,910
the data that are independent
of human interpretation.

140
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:09,469
These would include numerical
summaries or statistics.
