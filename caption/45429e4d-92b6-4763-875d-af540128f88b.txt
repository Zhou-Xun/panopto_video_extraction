1
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:20,600
So we'll we'll get started here. So, first of all, affirmative entry for you.

2
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:25,890
So before we get to that, just a couple notes about the exam.

3
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:33,630
There's a few people that still haven't taken it, so I can't get the exams back and they still won't take it until next week.

4
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,560
So you guys won't be able to get your exams back, probably not from next Wednesday.

5
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:44,150
And so you can still do that. There'll be an exam review activity, but that'll be do like two weeks after that.

6
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,930
So it's not the opportunity that to love this.

7
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:55,470
So this is a good time, sort of the way ish through the course to do a bit of a check in.

8
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:01,100
So just as a couple of reminders, so to pass the course, so we'll have a couple of parts is a C-minus.

9
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:04,490
So you have to get 650 points, right? Not really.

10
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:11,379
Any concerns that he was going to have that. Now, to get a little bit more confidence, you have to get there's two milestones.

11
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,700
So one is you have to get a thousand points, which I'll talk about in a moment.

12
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:21,570
The other is you have to get a combined 375 points on all three midterms, plus the review activity.

13
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:26,160
So functionally, what that means is you have to average 75% on the 3%.

14
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:29,220
You don't get you don't have to get 75% on the three.

15
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:36,390
You have to average 75% across the three. And the points you get on the review activities count towards that 75%.

16
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:43,499
So if you're not sure where you are going into the final, if you look on the little bar graph, there's going to be a multicolored bar graph.

17
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,500
When you look at the great prop that says how many points you have from the various categories.

18
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:52,350
If you send them over the exam number, it'll tell you whether you have a date for the exam.

19
00:01:52,500 --> 00:02:00,150
And then you can just take that -375, figure out sort of how many points you need to get out of 150 on the final,

20
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:12,180
which will be, I think December 7th is the third day of the final exam, which is also the other day, though.

21
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:18,240
It's okay. So it's I think it's a week after let us put it on cards.

22
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:23,940
Okay. So let's put your name interval pass and to get it a so like I said,

23
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:28,140
now's a good time in the next week or so to check in on grade predictor, see where you are.

24
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:34,139
So just as a general check in, this is what's left in terms of like normal required stuff.

25
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:44,730
There is 255 points left between the last exam, the five quizzes, the five perusal activities and some various in-class things that we do.

26
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:49,170
So if you think you're going to average about 80% on all of those things, that's about 200 points.

27
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,590
So if I were you and I was sitting at around 800 points,

28
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:57,750
including things that haven't been graded yet, that's where you should feel so like, you know,

29
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:04,350
think it's a reasonable expectation that the average student you get above 200 more points if they do nothing beyond the sort of normal things.

30
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:09,240
So right now, if you're at 950 points, if you like, stop doing extra stuff.

31
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,410
If you're at like 600 points, maybe, maybe look into doing some extra thing.

32
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:22,139
So that's sort of like our checking here. And again, you know, I'm not super concerned about about anybody and we're cut up more or less.

33
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,730
We're very close to being called for grading.

34
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:29,200
I think we leave things like two grades right now, and I hope to finish that before the Thanksgiving break or we finish this stuff.

35
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:36,840
I know with this book, it's always a bunch of sort of logistical stuff to me, questions about any of that.

36
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:43,530
All right. All right. Great. So we're going to move on to the protein.

37
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:51,089
So it's a bit of a weird timing things. We have one class today, a week off, and then four more classes till the end of the semester.

38
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:56,370
So two more weeks after today, I feel like.

39
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,770
Yeah, so I'm going to do a bunch of introduction stuff again. So some of that stuff.

40
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:08,550
Well, we're going to touch on both times as over the course of the next, the product is not done so as we start.

41
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:14,070
So where do we get pretty far? As you know, people get these from either animal or plant products.

42
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:20,610
This is the first time we've come across a major macronutrient that is widely supplemented, although I guess make it six fatty acids count too.

43
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:25,350
Two supplements come in different forms and effects of the package for the pack to the protein.

44
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,100
So the MDR, the range for the MDR is shown in the graph on the right.

45
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:37,320
So for adults between ten and 35% of calories, so pretty similar to what we saw, what we saw for fat.

46
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:43,919
That's the lower limit. The upper limit. Now, one nice thing of a protein is that unlike carbs and fat,

47
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:49,170
there's not really good direct biomarkers for whether somebody is protein replete or not.

48
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,820
Sorry, is carb replete or fat replete are not. So that's why the ranges are so broad.

49
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:59,190
But in the case of protein, we do have good biomarkers of protein sufficiency,

50
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:03,569
which we'll talk about in the next class in terms of nitrogen balance and things like that.

51
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:08,940
So we can pretty accurately estimate at the individual level whether somebody is getting enough protein for their bodies needs or not.

52
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:15,450
And so because of that, because we have good biomarkers for that are good enough testing for that, there is an RDA for protein right now.

53
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:19,530
It is said to be 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight per day.

54
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,090
So if you're 100 kilograms, it could be like Â£254.

55
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:30,420
That would be 80 grams for the average person. That's somewhere around 50 to 60 grams of protein in that.

56
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:36,450
Now, this is pretty controversial in the field. Some suggest it should be higher just for everybody.

57
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:41,840
The RDA is based on measuring the primarily nitrogen diet.

58
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:47,670
So it's basically as we'll talk when we get the nitrogen balance, as you don't eat enough protein, you start breaking down your intelligence protein.

59
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,110
So that's the level at which it set so that now you're not eating enough.

60
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,390
Right. But that's not exactly the same thing. Is that the optimal level for health?

61
00:05:54,810 --> 00:06:00,100
So some people would argue it should be much higher, upwards of 1.6 grams per kilogram per day.

62
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:05,699
Other people would say maybe, maybe it doesn't need to be that high because all we're talking about is sufficiency.

63
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:11,549
Right. But this is an extreme example. And this is kind of where we start to cross over from macronutrients to sort

64
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:14,879
of vitamins and minerals in terms of the amount of protein you should eat.

65
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,960
There's sort of two plus one is, are you getting enough from a sufficiency standpoint?

66
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:27,860
We never had asked that question for fats or carbs, but also about that, how much more is better based on your lifestyle and other things?

67
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:34,040
Right. So so that's and that's why there's there's some debate. But the idea is exactly based on consistency.

68
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:41,970
Okay. So I want to start with proteins with taking a bit of a bit of a sidetrack here into greenhouse gas emissions.

69
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:49,350
So if you look at overall greenhouse gas emissions and this data is from 2018, although I don't think it's changed super dramatically,

70
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:57,210
you can see that overall agriculture, both land use and agricultural production comprise about a quarter of our total greenhouse gas emissions.

71
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:01,650
And so you can see that that agricultural production is broken down here.

72
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:07,529
The majority of the agricultural portion of that is due to ruminant and fermentations.

73
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:11,700
That basically means cow culverts, basically.

74
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:18,270
Is that part of act. There's also down here you have ruminant waste on pastures and management and then the energy that goes into that.

75
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:22,649
So a huge amount of greenhouse gas production, or at least of the human a lot of viable,

76
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:28,979
non-corporate energy production is from from any production of particularly ruminants.

77
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:34,080
And if you look at food types and this is greenhouse gas equivalents across different types of food,

78
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:37,800
it is the worst offender by far is to feed that long.

79
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:43,800
And so there has to be about 6% of all global emissions are from these.

80
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:49,860
And and again, part of that is from methane production, not from manure and internal fermentation,

81
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:56,540
but also from changes in lengths of land that could be used that maybe might suck carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

82
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,650
Now not that. And so that's a huge change.

83
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:06,630
So that's why one of the reasons why people focus a lot on considering using beef as a way to reduce your greenhouse gas production.

84
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,299
Now that's one way of thinking about sustainability.

85
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,710
Another way would be water use, which of course is generally much higher for plant based proteins.

86
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,840
But for meat, you can see the difference between if you just compare, say, for example,

87
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:21,720
cream, dairy to beef and mutton, they're kind of in a completely different stratosphere.

88
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:27,570
And of course, in North America, the vast majority of our meat production is out of the EU.

89
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:34,690
I personally spent a good amount of the weekend hanging around with cows, and trust me, they didn't even know that pretty.

90
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:39,300
Pretty much. Okay. So that's sort of just a general thing if you're more in if you're interested.

91
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:44,660
Sort of a deeper dive into the sustainability aspects of meat in particular or food in general.

92
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:54,630
Andy Jones, who is our associate department chair. He teaches two classes that are specifically focused on US food systems about nutrition 35 and 644.

93
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:59,550
If you'd like to learn more about that and for Andy can tell you we're way, way, way, way more than that.

94
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:06,830
Okay. So we're going to start here with sort of a brief assignment, kind of get you thinking about different proteins.

95
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:11,750
What I want you to do is pick up food. And the first thing that you think of that is a protein source.

96
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:14,900
And then I want you to go into the USDA database, download it,

97
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:21,530
and then figure out how much grams of protein and other things on this table are eager to fulfill.

98
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:26,290
So you can do this individually. Hopefully, many of you are pretty familiar with using the USDA free database,

99
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:31,820
and there should be a shared Google doc where you can enter your information together.

100
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:37,120
So spend 10 minutes or so on this one for Google.

101
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:49,090
He's just. The gray shaded columns like column, each tab, whatever it is.

102
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:55,540
Don't fill those out. I'm going to use those for I'm going to fill up some stock based on what you check here for next week.

103
00:10:55,540 --> 00:11:01,299
And so if you don't mind, also when you fill in your numbers, Feldman Don't put like Grams or anything and just use grams,

104
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:05,150
but fill in just the numbers because otherwise I have to go and do the calculation and plus.

105
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,240
Thank you so much for.

106
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:53,350
He's considering. This is how you're willing to get someone else lined up.

107
00:11:54,070 --> 00:12:04,290
Yeah. Okay. That's why I guess that is for sure.

108
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:09,380
That's a lot less chicken.

109
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,790
But I just realized someone else got it. Really?

110
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:24,010
Tastes like a book. That's interesting.

111
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:29,610
I think it is a mystery that we don't know.

112
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:34,210
It's just different teams like that.

113
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:43,000
Yeah. That's just interesting.

114
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:47,260
There's a restaurant I like. We're going to continue. You know what it is?

115
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:52,620
And it shows. It's like, leave it alone.

116
00:12:53,680 --> 00:13:05,580
That's right. Was like, yeah, it was.

117
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:23,890
I want you to talk about else that.

118
00:13:28,980 --> 00:14:17,010
I can't because she's like, oh, she's still a Christian.

119
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,730
Okay, so it looks like most people are more or less done.

120
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:25,380
Please make sure you've got that all filled out because like I said, I'm going to use this data twice more aggressively semester.

121
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:29,379
So. Okay, so we move on to a person who's going to run.

122
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:36,190
She's going to be today's food of the day. And in case any of you have camel as your protein, of course, she's going to count all of that coming.

123
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:55,040
Just can't see what you can see here.

124
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:59,870
91. Hey, you. Yeah.

125
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:06,740
Okay, so Natalie and I.

126
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:11,970
I choose this topic because I feel like it's really interesting to know more about families.

127
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:16,730
It's actually one of the most popular animals in my country, in Saudi Arabia.

128
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:28,689
And so we do know about camels. So actually can almost be known as the ME producer because, you know,

129
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:34,929
it's like I live in a very difficult conditions like for example like and also

130
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:40,120
sometimes with camels they also have a very cold environment and violence.

131
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:46,400
So let's know more about the history of camels actually these days,

132
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:55,480
camels of the 100 times they took place in the east coast of Denmark, and they've been there like for a few years ago.

133
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,690
And I see, as I said before,

134
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:08,770
it's one of the most unique like sort of of the Arabs because of its ability to leave with very difficult conditions and camels.

135
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:13,929
They are not only used as a like we can consider them only as a source of meat or meat,

136
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:23,500
which also people they are using them as transportation of riding or for sport or they even use them, I mean, their skin as a wheel.

137
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:29,950
So how many types of camels? There are two types of camels that are dromedary.

138
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:34,810
Camels would be one half camels. And the bacteria and camels, only 200 camels.

139
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:41,049
So let's know what about the other side, the dromedary camels or the one had to come up and they got their name.

140
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:49,720
They dromedaries this. What they told me from news comes from the Greek and it's meaning like running and running or runs.

141
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:59,480
That's why they got this name also. And as I say, as I said before, it's really popular in the Arabian Peninsula.

142
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,280
A lot of it's not only in this I mean, not only in my country.

143
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:10,300
They are popular, but also they are still popular in the northern and eastern Africa and also Southeast Asia.

144
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:17,500
And actually beside with camels they want to kill is the more popular element, the more prevalent type.

145
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,280
Like it's what, 90, 91% of the whole country's population.

146
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:25,540
And so it's more than the other time.

147
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:29,950
It wasn't the two camels. They still had camels.

148
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:33,820
It's very rare. It's only 6% of the whole population.

149
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:39,530
And it's like usually they you can find them in really hard environment.

150
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:45,850
And it's an example like something in Syria, China and Mongolia and this kind of camels.

151
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:52,000
They come from a region called Victory in Katrina and cases in Asia.

152
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,900
And that's what they find where they got their names.

153
00:17:56,290 --> 00:18:05,980
And actually, I find this nice picture just to anyone like Netflix you can use it can be enjoyed literally to the hilt.

154
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:13,930
So they literally want to become more widely considered to have stolen its stuff a little bit.

155
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:17,950
So you can just remember the the letter B with a two covers.

156
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:29,110
So let's start with the nutritional values of dromedary camel milk camel needs so physical and become obese.

157
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:35,649
I think this is the green colors and it is very present in most countries.

158
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:39,240
They are in the unconcealed income of wheat. Why is it wrong?

159
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:44,979
One, they are in most countries that they are produce it come from meat and actually the production

160
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:52,630
of governments they like to cross growing 6% times 2018 higher than their previous years.

161
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:58,090
And this is what this is about the consumption and production of common needs.

162
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,110
So let's know more about the content of the camel meat.

163
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:10,210
Actually, the moisture content leads and it's between very between 63% to 77%.

164
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:18,069
And it's I mean, the moisture, it's high and lower content of fat, the protein content.

165
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:29,200
And, you know, it's ranging from 17 to 22% is tumbleweeds and the fatty acids while engine have tumbleweeds contain and no distinctive of science

166
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:39,830
and that's why that good strong evil and is still in the movie it's about 57 to 100 gum which is lower than any other meats.

167
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:45,760
And we like for example, here in beef, it's 74 milligrams, 100 grams.

168
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:54,460
So the soil content is low. What in the in the company and the company compared to the other meats.

169
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:59,910
And also you'll also the police antiquated fatty acids. It's very high in the camel needs.

170
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:09,910
It's higher. Getting us to that next item here, a strange piece of evidence processing and a time of 98%.

171
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:17,010
This is the most important thing about the fact is refined income leads for amino acid profile.

172
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:20,919
The most abundant is in steel and.

173
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:26,200
Amino acids is lysine and then using methionine ice,

174
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:32,540
muesli and seasoning and the use of any and also the essential amino acids because

175
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:36,280
it's higher in the calories means if you compare it with any other with meats.

176
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:42,070
That's why the protein and the couple of its it has like a very high protein value.

177
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:47,160
And actually they say sometimes it's because of the low content of the fat.

178
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:52,360
That's why sometimes the protein content is high, slightly higher.

179
00:20:53,140 --> 00:21:01,060
If we compare with any other meats and also normal meats, it's a bit of something, but it's not essential.

180
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:06,280
I mean, I see it's done with the lamb and goes meats for me and vitamins.

181
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:13,569
There are no big difference between calories and any other, you know, potassium contents.

182
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:20,830
It's very high in the cannabis and the content of this what I love you and calcium respectively and I also

183
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:30,729
calories is very rich in iron it's about 10 to 2021 milligrams milligram 100 for the fish meat while another.

184
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:38,280
So the also the I think the the iron contains in calories the 1.52 milligrams per 100.

185
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:43,800
If we compare that with the beef, I would say about one milligram or 100 gum.

186
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:54,579
And also for what time is the if we compare camel meats, they are higher than any other meats in vitamin C, B6, B12 and D.

187
00:21:54,580 --> 00:22:02,740
And why so many? This is about basically why the content of company's the health benefits of camel meats in general.

188
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:08,950
They they are influence I mean, they are influenced by these types of muscles.

189
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:19,059
What are examples the age of the telling me. I think if I become a meat then as it is increased the and the fat level also increased.

190
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:26,830
So also the cholesterol even will be increased. So in general, the young camel is fitter or it's healthier than the older one.

191
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:33,640
And this is the important thing that I wanted to say here. Also, the chemical composition of emissions of camel meats.

192
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:42,070
It's very different based on the differences in the ribs and also in the type of muscles here.

193
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:45,220
Also, it's just like a summary of what I've seen before.

194
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:56,350
I think most important thing is that the camel, these crazy contains a very low fat content which make it like more healthier or a good choice,

195
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:00,399
especially for people who are supposed to reduce their daily intakes.

196
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:06,610
Plus, for example, if they are at risk of hypertension or coronary, usually because as you know,

197
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:17,350
the high level of saturated fatty acids, intake and withdrawal, that will increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and hypertension.

198
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:23,680
So for people who they are concerned and who they want to maintain, like, I mean, then how cool.

199
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:32,420
I mean, they supposed to like restrict their diet so they don't like to eat at all with meat.

200
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:38,070
But here I can see they can eat the camel meat since it's very long and they control

201
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,490
and at fact level and also for the people who they want to lose some weight.

202
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:49,600
So it's a good choice here. I mentioned that the camel needs is that everything is internal amino acids, as I said before,

203
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:56,530
and vitamins, minerals like components like a see and serine and lutetium and essential fatty acids.

204
00:23:57,010 --> 00:24:03,010
So that's all about human needs. You know what? I'm going to talk about a bunch of camels, camel milk.

205
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:07,420
I tried to suggest that's the most important thing.

206
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:13,690
The content of camel milk. It's so low in sugar and cholesterol if you compare it with cow milk.

207
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:19,120
And also it's high in sodium, potassium, iron conflict, zinc and magnesium.

208
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:22,900
Vitamin C here is a systematic review.

209
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:23,860
It's a study.

210
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:34,330
They actually their aim their aim actually to determine the nutritional value of camel milk and the medicinal characteristics for children.

211
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:44,710
It's safe for children to consume this milk. So out of the 472 records, they use only 35 studies and been done.

212
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:49,780
And the research showed that it's totally safe for you to consume the company instead of milk.

213
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:59,470
I mean, the camel milk is the cow milk because it's it's high, it's an additional value and it's totally safe.

214
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:05,650
And it also is also another study actually is this was in Saudi Arabia.

215
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:12,070
There is similar results. They just compared between the camel milk and the cow milk.

216
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:20,350
And they found that like, as I said before, to make it slow enough to casein and it's now a lot of the problem cow.

217
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:26,890
That's. Like even that, like tolerance to exposition can still come away rather like cloud milk.

218
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:36,880
Also, I would like to do a study for children where they are allergic to milk and the like when they give them the camel milk.

219
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:42,630
They should like lower the I mean, the symptoms for allergies decrease.

220
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:47,920
That's why it's totally safe to use me. I need to drink to give them the incoming milk.

221
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:54,590
Also, camel milk its high and easy to digest milk.

222
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:59,540
It's high in calcium proteins, low in saturated fatty acids and three times more.

223
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:09,910
If I can see that common also it's high in vitamin D, it's easy to the stomach and it's ten times higher than common in Ireland.

224
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:21,040
So this is basically a of the camel milk. And so with I want to talk more about if there is any other uses of camels.

225
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:27,340
Yes. Not only to make ends meet, there are they can be you can use their wool.

226
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:33,280
And especially for this thing, because the infected in camels are the two cousins.

227
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:43,870
That's very helpful and they like it if they can get to it's very beneficial for getting their well instead of the one from two camels.

228
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:53,470
Sometimes it is because they can as they can. However, the and the other uses is the camel.

229
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:56,670
As I say, it's camel means it's very popular in my country.

230
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:07,020
So the most traditional meal in my country, they use either like a lamb or chicken or camels.

231
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:16,599
And they basically they make it with a they cook the meat like for one hour or 2 hours and they mix it with rice and believe it in 15 minutes more.

232
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,200
And they just sit with, as you can see here.

233
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:28,840
Also, as I said before, camel milk can be used as a drink, but not only as a drink can be used for beauty as for the body as body lotion.

234
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:34,240
Also, I want to mention something very, very popular in my country is the camel race.

235
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:38,410
It's just like camel. It's like horse racing.

236
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:46,239
And it's very, very popular in my country. And it's only Saudi Arabia, but also the United Arab Emirates and Western Asia.

237
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:58,990
Not 99 million is China because the camel that has its 90 clarinets and their fans and they can run at speeds up to 65

238
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:08,830
kilometer in a short space and they can maintain their speeds for one hour like and it's like 40 to a speed of 40 kilometers.

239
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,820
And that's what I want to say about Camel.

240
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:17,260
I really hope you enjoyed this presentation. There are a lot of information about camels.

241
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:20,890
I tried to speak. I want to talk about these things.

242
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:43,839
Thank you so much. Thank you. So compared to people, I can taste like, Oh, that's a good person to have tried to kill me as many times.

243
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,860
It sounds stronger, like it's not easy to do.

244
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:58,980
It's because it's content, low fat content. But yeah, once you know what I find like it's interesting, the camel milk, I've never tried it before.

245
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:03,100
So when I want to buy this, I feel like one download benefits from it.

246
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:17,050
So I'm thinking to try this when I, when I go back to my kitchen and I can find any business in between the home,

247
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,510
the camels, nutrition, and that will come back.

248
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:29,120
Yeah, well, that's interesting question. Yeah, I mean, the home, what do you think is the why?

249
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:34,540
So. Because some people, they thought it's there is a water in the home. It's because they come with the candy.

250
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,000
They don't drink water.

251
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:47,349
But obviously there's a sense in the home because when the camels thought the fat in the house and like for a long time so there's no food to drank

252
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:57,180
its energy from the house and also I don't I remember of the people who they buy and sell things at the house they look at the size of the house.

253
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:02,890
Why was it mean? They tell me it's not even anymore.

254
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:07,300
So as the hump is larger, as it's healthier,

255
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:19,500
but it's in relation to their nutrition the fact they can they like I want to respond to the fact it's contains very tiny little surprising

256
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:30,220
to many people and also it's three times like higher of all these seeds than the if you compare that with some kind of form of salt.

257
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:37,350
Yeah. Just the new thing and instance.

258
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:44,640
Yeah. Do they like farm camels in the same way?

259
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,570
Like they farm calves on the same scale.

260
00:30:51,360 --> 00:31:04,620
So, you know, and I think that how they feed their cows, it's really important because as you know, it's they feed the animals and be also good.

261
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:21,720
Okay. Okay.

262
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:29,310
So I didn't know anything about camels meat before today. So all of that was new information, although I didn't know that he had.

263
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:34,440
I think I learned that when you showed that graphic, I was like somewhere somewhere.

264
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:39,360
I mean, in elementary school, I remember seeing it in some other medical, some partially undergraduate.

265
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:45,569
And my first thing was not to just be like, so, so I'm going to start here.

266
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,520
I'm going to come back to this slide a few times.

267
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:54,180
So one of the there was a bunch of interesting things that are different about protein amino acids relative to glycogen.

268
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:59,129
And the most important, I think maybe thing that's going to come up a lot over and over and over is really

269
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:03,330
this concept here is that there's no such thing as a glycogen or right for protein.

270
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:11,010
So proteins, when we store excess proteins, there's not like a neutral storage matter molecule for it, right?

271
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:19,290
So we have excess protein. It's generally going to get stored in the form of functional proteins, right where, you know, we deplete our glycogen.

272
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:22,590
It has some effect that might affect performance, but it doesn't affect any bodily functions.

273
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,749
But when we talk about breaking down proteins,

274
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:33,120
if we need to access proteins or our bodies proteins as part of having amino acids available, that's going to come at a functional cost.

275
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:38,040
In a way that breakdown of triglyceride to breakdown of glycogen doesn't really have.

276
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:44,759
And we're going to talk a lot about that today. What do we think about when we use amino acids for things?

277
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,070
Amino acid can be used for a lot of things they can use for energy.

278
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:52,650
They can be converted depending on the amino acid into glucose or fatty acids when they're in excess.

279
00:32:52,650 --> 00:33:05,400
And then they can be used to synthesize a whole bunch of non protein compounds, things like choline or creatine or carnitine or tryptophan.

280
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:09,000
I direct things like melatonin and serotonin so they and run of a whole class about that.

281
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,990
So amino acids are used for a whole bunch of things in addition to just being used for protein.

282
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:17,430
So that means that the requirement exists on really any of these slides, right?

283
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:21,000
So if you have a demand in any of these things and in other macronutrients aren't available,

284
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:24,149
you're going to draw away from the ability to make other things right.

285
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:28,680
So if you start needing energy and you get to the point where you have to break down your body proteins,

286
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:32,750
then what that's going to do is it's going to come at a cost of both the body proteins you may have,

287
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,520
let's say, actin or collagen or whatever in your body,

288
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:39,470
but also that it comes at a cost potentially of the ability to use the proteins for other things.

289
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:45,780
Right, because you can't get it from glucose and fats and obviously you can't store these at glucose.

290
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:53,490
Right. So that's the big essential difference between proteins and fats in triglycerides is that we don't have storage, we don't just have,

291
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:59,520
you know, in our livers or something, a big pool of actin that is not doing anything useful that we can we can break down.

292
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:04,080
Now, when we think about the amino acid pool, this is really just a conceptual footprint.

293
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:08,190
So this comprises of all the three amino acids are in the blood and in the tissues, right?

294
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:13,409
So the amount of amino acids that are available first is going to you're thinking I have to think about it at the cellular level.

295
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:18,150
So if a particular st muscle cell wants to make some actin, it's got to access that pool there.

296
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:23,340
If they're screaming wasn't it can use that. If not, it can draw them in from the blood if necessary.

297
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:28,380
And if it still can't, then it's going to have to draw it in either from the diet or from breaking down some other protein,

298
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:32,310
either within that cell or within the body. Now, as you can imagine,

299
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:39,030
the cost of taking a protein like actin or collagen or albumin and then breaking it down and then using it to make another protein,

300
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,190
that's something that we really, really careful about. Right?

301
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:45,990
That's not something we want to just break down and reform in the way that glycogen or triglycerides are quite interchangeable.

302
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:47,040
So as you'll see,

303
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:53,070
there's going to be a lot of roadblocks that are going to come for both the breakdown of proteins and especially the breakdown of amino acids,

304
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:58,709
because once you break them down, it's very, very, very costly to break them up so they can be used for all these other things.

305
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:03,850
But generally arms unless other macronutrients are not available, right?

306
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:09,300
So generally when we start breaking down the proteins in your body for energy, once you've depleted the carbohydrates and divide,

307
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:13,080
and again, that's because of some of the regulatory mechanisms that are going to stop that.

308
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:22,350
If you have been wondering then how the things that you consume excess calories, what happens when you're consuming excess powders, the protein?

309
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:27,659
Yeah, so let's give you the same thing. So if you have an excess, this pool is again, it's because it's a conceptual pool.

310
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:33,750
It's hard to actually measure what that is. But any excess is going to get broken or is going to get converted into either glucose or fatty acids.

311
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:39,059
And so so if you edit the pure protein diet and you're on a caloric excess, you would still starve.

312
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:46,350
It's not perfect. But as we'll talk about when we get through, that's actually functionally quite difficult to do.

313
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:53,880
The other general thing I kind of want to remind you here of proteins is every protein is going to be made up of a bunch of different amino acids,

314
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,470
20 different amino acids that that encode protein plus a few analogs.

315
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:03,540
And so I was trying to think of protein synthesis using this like barrel analogy that you're

316
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:06,720
trying to synthesize a protein and you're looking for all these different amino acids,

317
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:10,170
but you can only make a barrel as tall as whatever the smallest plant is.

318
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:14,910
Right. So even if you had plenty of access of all of these other amino acids, if you were limiting.

319
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:20,330
In this case here, it's showing a rotation of lysine. That means that limits how much of that protein you can make.

320
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:25,160
Right. Lysine is a is an essential amino acid that that is quite often made in human diets.

321
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:28,640
So, again, it's not as it's much more complicated than just carbohydrate,

322
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:32,840
where you're not only limited by the amount of free glucose and maybe the amount of insulin you have here,

323
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:36,010
you've got to be able to measure and sense all 22%.

324
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:42,079
Right. And we've started to learn some about how a cell can determine whether or not it has enough of these amino acids.

325
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:45,379
But it's something we're really just learning about really in the last four or five years.

326
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:49,340
And again, we'll talk about that more. We get to the protein synthesis, right?

327
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:59,270
So that's sort of the general my general thing about proteins, because proteins are functional, they do almost everything we've talked about so far,

328
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:04,759
the transcription factors and enzymes that transport proteins and apolipoprotein, all of these are indulgence proteins, right?

329
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:10,730
And so all of these, if you conceptually start making them, it would have some functional deficit.

330
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:18,080
So for example, one of the one of the consequences of three of protein restriction is fatty liver disease.

331
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:22,760
And that's thought to be because of the lack of ability to make the apolipoprotein 100,

332
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:27,740
which is important for getting triglycerides out of the liver, as you remember, from last week.

333
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:31,910
So if you can't do that, that's going to come at a functional cost.

334
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:38,120
Now, it turns out most of these proteins that we use like K1 and Google Kinase or whatever are pretty rare in terms of and in fact,

335
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:42,919
like almost half of all the proteins in our body are just for different proteins.

336
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:48,739
So collagen, actin myosin. And so collagen is part of the connective tissue.

337
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:52,639
It's important for skin and keeping tissues bound together.

338
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:56,660
Actin to myosin, of course, are the contractile components of skeletal and heart muscle.

339
00:37:56,780 --> 00:38:00,950
And then albumin is the most abundant and most abundant protein in blood.

340
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:04,729
And we talked about it originally in terms of transporting of fatty acids,

341
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:08,270
but it also has a really important role in maintaining osmotic balance in the blood.

342
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:12,470
So what that means is that if you start to get deficits in protein,

343
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:17,389
you're going to first start to see it as it pertains to the deficits of these four proteins.

344
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:22,580
Right. Because that to me, the ones that give you the most notice first. So if you have a big reduction in collagen, you'll see that.

345
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:28,999
You'll see that in a deficiency. So there's two different I'm going to the next 5 minutes.

346
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:34,250
So we're going to talk about some of these deficiencies. So are two different types of deficiencies a protein?

347
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:40,610
The first is a difficulty protein, but not necessarily a deficiency in calories.

348
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:46,400
And so that's called kwashiorkor. And so here's some of the symptoms for that understanding element fatty liver,

349
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:52,550
hair and teeth loss, anorexia and then trends child mental and physical challenges in children.

350
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:57,980
That's different than a deficiency of protein. And so that would be called miraculous.

351
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:04,370
So miraculous is actually pretty rare because it's pretty easy with our global food supply to get calories for people.

352
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:08,360
It's not quite as easy always to get protein and calories.

353
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:13,069
You can always just sort of ship buckets of of fat or rice or grain or whatever.

354
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:18,260
But it's hard to get protein in certain places because most common in sub-Saharan Africa.

355
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:22,220
So this is the relative prevalence of kwashiorkor from 2017.

356
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:24,499
As you can see, it's pretty rare in Western countries,

357
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:29,990
but it's still reasonably areas of concern, especially in regions where there's a drought event.

358
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:34,490
So why do these things happen? So I already talked about maybe a couple of these already.

359
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:43,040
So fatty liver is thought to be because you can't make the level proteins that results are going to allow for transport of fat and hair and teeth.

360
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,279
Loss is thought to be a loss of collagen. All right.

361
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:52,040
So apology is important for both hair and teeth. So that idea is that you are not able to make enough collagen in your body.

362
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:57,770
Therefore, you have challenges that there's also skin lesions that are common with this to the distended abdomen.

363
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:01,610
We're going to talk a little bit inside now. Anorexia, which seems paradoxical, right?

364
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:04,790
These people are protein deficient. They are effectively starving.

365
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:07,370
You would think that they would have extreme hyper aphasia.

366
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:12,050
They don't actually know how the anorexia and the physical and mental development challenges occur.

367
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:19,700
One theory is that some of the non protein compounds that we'll talk about in the last class, such as serotonin and dopamine and noradrenaline,

368
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:23,480
and they may be affected somewhat in extreme cases of a protein restriction,

369
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:32,020
but we don't we don't really actually know exactly what that is and or how exactly to treat it other than just providing provided for you.

370
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:41,180
Okay. So like I said, as you would see a loss of proteins, the first the first one should be pretty straightforward.

371
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:44,330
If you lose active myosin, you can have a loss of muscle mass.

372
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,780
So that's also, you know, a symptom that people see.

373
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:51,049
If you lose collagen, you're going to lose hair and nails because that's what connects.

374
00:40:51,050 --> 00:41:00,110
That now means a little more tricky. An element is related to this distended abdomen here, which is again characteristic of especially cushier calves.

375
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:05,809
And so what the reason for that is, is that albumin is a key arsenal and what it oscillate is,

376
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:11,390
is when you have something that has osmotic potential that keeps water in whichever side the spotlight is.

377
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,540
So if you imagine this side here as being the blood.

378
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:22,430
And then there's a bunch of albumin in the blood that's going to keep water in the blood compared to over here, which would be same in the tissues.

379
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:31,360
So if you have a loss of hospital on this side, you're going to end up with more water that can flow flow to the other side.

380
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:34,130
Right. So that's fluids coming out of your blood and into the tissues.

381
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:40,580
So that can cause edema, which is sort of just swelling, especially pitted edema, which is sort of you can push it and it stays warm.

382
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:43,250
And then that's what causes the swelling of the right.

383
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:49,220
So it's fluids that are in the abdomen that should be in the blood, but they can't be in the blood because the osmotic potential of the blood as well.

384
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:54,950
And again, that's because the primary weight in blood is albumin, which is the most abundant protein.

385
00:41:56,330 --> 00:42:01,910
And again, it's the loss of any of these could cause that. It generally has to get quite severe before you start seeing some of these things.

386
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:05,960
But even mild protein restriction, you can see changes in muscle in here.

387
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:11,150
Why is the abdomen in particular with question reports compared to like peripheral?

388
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:16,310
Yeah. So if you imagine the abdomen, there's a lot of tissue there relative to the blood supply.

389
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:22,820
Right. And so it the blood is getting out of there. There's just a lot of space for that to go into all the various tissues and organs.

390
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,360
So it's not like necessarily that, well, there is swelling of the liver. That's a separate thing.

391
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:31,940
So it's not that sort of there's swelling, but it's the fluids in between, say, the various organs that are not in the blood.

392
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:35,650
That's one. But it's also quite common. You can see the edema enhancing the.

393
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:40,010
That's the other major causes for you, see. Okay.

394
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:44,659
So that's that's sort of what happens and that's how this relates to these four really abundant proteins.

395
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:48,469
Of course, there's probably many, many other phenotypes that exist that aren't visually appealing.

396
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:53,000
Almost all of these phenotypes are like visibly striking, I'm sure, with many other things,

397
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:57,640
for example, about the anxiety and the anorexia are much harder to see.

398
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:02,329
Okay. So I'm going to move on a little bit to the protein structure.

399
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:07,730
So there's four levels of organization of a protein. So unlike a triglyceride, which is functionally very, very simple,

400
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:12,799
just three fatty acids attach fruit literal or glycogen, which is pretty straightforward, just two different bonds.

401
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:18,410
So there's different levels of branching. Every single protein in our body has a completely different structure to it.

402
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:23,860
And that is going to turn is going to matter a lot when we talk about the digestion and the absorption of the proteins.

403
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:30,589
So there's four levels of organization. The primary is just the sequence of which amino acids occur in which ordered those then fold

404
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:34,640
one each other to generally form simple structures that are called either helices or sheets.

405
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:41,990
This is an example of an alpha helix, those secondary structures that fought upon each other to form more complicated three dimensional structures,

406
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:48,200
a tertiary structure and then a category structure is when you have multiple proteins that are bound to each other.

407
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:51,770
So for example, we've talked about colitis and pancreatic life.

408
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:57,469
Those are two proteins that bind together. So each of those individually would have a primary, secondary and tertiary structure,

409
00:43:57,470 --> 00:44:01,730
but the entire bound multimatic protein would be an example of term restriction.

410
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:09,410
So as I said, for human nutrition purposes, what that means is that unlike breaking down starch or a lactose or something,

411
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:12,889
the enzymes that are going to try to break down a protein have to deal with sort of two things.

412
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:20,629
They begin with the primary sequence is different. Remember for glycogen there's only two different possible like acidic bonds

413
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:23,870
here there's 20 amino acids could all be bound to 20 different amino acids,

414
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:27,800
right? So there's almost an unlimited number of of bonds that can be broken.

415
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:33,139
And then even if it's a linear chain, you would still have to deal with, well, how do I get it to be a linear chain?

416
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:39,560
How do I make it accessible to all of the different enzymes that we're going to talk about next Monday for digestion?

417
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:43,350
And that's one of the reasons why acid deterioration of proteins is going to be up.

418
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:49,250
It's going to be pretty important now to kind of highlight that many of you probably heard of the two major proteins taken away.

419
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:56,480
These are the two major proteins in in milk. And so I apologize for the lack of color here, but if you look at the digestibility,

420
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:05,240
so this is an experimental study where they gave equal amounts in grams of casein and when so when protein first is the dark triangles,

421
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:11,990
I guess at the top. So you can see whey is digested quite easily as measured by the amount of essential amino acids that are expressed.

422
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:14,300
On the other hand, casein is absorbed,

423
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:21,830
but for slope now this has nothing to do with the amino acid component of casein or when they're actually effectively the same level of completeness.

424
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:23,960
They're very, very similar composition of amino acids.

425
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:31,190
But the structure of whey is folded such that it is very easily to be digestible, is very accessible to our digestive enzymes.

426
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:35,990
Another and casein is much more difficult to access.

427
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:39,610
So you can think of it, it's like a very tightly ball, tightly wound ball of yarn, right?

428
00:45:39,650 --> 00:45:44,540
So it's hard to get at that, whereas whey might be more of a pile of loose bands or something.

429
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:49,999
So it's easier to get the the enzymes that and then to kind of highlight that what see has h on this graph

430
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:55,520
here which is the white things here what happens if you take casein and then you denature it with acid.

431
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,930
So this is hydrolyzed casein.

432
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:05,320
So now you've gotten rid of its secondary and tertiary structure and now you see casein is digested more or less exactly the same as we put it.

433
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:08,930
Right. And so now you can see that that structure is really the difference.

434
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:14,810
If you get rid of the structure, look right here now they end up being more or less functionally equivalent is one reason.

435
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,900
Like whey protein is very commonly sold as a dietary supplement because it's easily absorbed.

436
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:25,110
Also, casein is sold as a dietary supplement because it's more slowly and maybe you might want casein before you go to bed,

437
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:28,200
but you might want ways to shortly after some physical activity.

438
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:33,150
I fail to see the advantage of actually having casein hydrolysis, although they will sell that to you as well.

439
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:37,230
Right. If you want to keep my promise that you could just buy me instead.

440
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:44,790
So that's the structure. And again, as we talk about this on the digestion lecture for next Monday, we'll talk a lot about how the structure,

441
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:48,630
how we deal with these challenges of every single thing we consume could have a different structure.

442
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:54,180
The other thing I want to mention here about the structure is that almost all food,

443
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:59,340
instant food and sensitivities and food allergies are based on protein structures.

444
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:05,250
Right. So when we say that somebody is allergic to milk or peanuts or shellfish or gluten,

445
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:10,050
what we mean is that they have an amino reactivity to a particular structure of protein.

446
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:14,250
Gluten, if you didn't know, is a protein that is commonly covered in wheat.

447
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:19,890
And so it's those unique folds, those unique shapes in those proteins that cause that amino reactivity.

448
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:26,850
It's not, in general any other substance. There's a couple a couple exceptions of that, but this is the major source of that.

449
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:31,110
And that's because, again, every protein has a different shape and your body could react differently to different shapes.

450
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:39,960
Okay. So when people grow out of allergies, whether they get older or whatever the case may be, is it because the structure changes or.

451
00:47:40,170 --> 00:47:42,060
No, they just don't respond to the same structure.

452
00:47:42,450 --> 00:47:48,360
So if you for example, if you had a peanut allergy and you roll with that, it's not because the peanut has changed.

453
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:54,720
It's because your way you respond to the shape of the protein in peanuts. And it's the same if people start gaining allergies.

454
00:47:55,620 --> 00:48:02,399
Yes, exactly. So it's the same thing. So something maybe a tree nut you previously consumed in your body, didn't think it was an immune response.

455
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:09,270
But then at some point something has happened to your immune system where now it sees the shape of a protein in the in the tree, not as an individual.

456
00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:13,560
Right. And so now it takes that little epitope and mounts an immune response to it generally.

457
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:20,040
Generally. And again, of course, food sensitivities, food allergies, specifically, food allergies are really, really rapid.

458
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:28,090
And the effect 45% of the population right so we talked way back when about I love gluten doesn't exactly

459
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:34,220
this and you can see this by I mean immuno reactivity usually immunoglobulin E which are these guys.

460
00:48:35,970 --> 00:48:39,330
Okay so that's a very and secondary structure.

461
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:46,770
So the next thing I want to kind of get to is this idea that proteins are made up of different amino acids and they are from 20.

462
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:51,389
How many do I think there's actually going to be three more amino acid we're going to talk about that are not folding in protein.

463
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:54,470
One of them we've already talked about that story is completed by ourselves.

464
00:48:54,750 --> 00:49:01,290
So there are other amino acids that don't go into proteins, but there are 20 that 20 to do and they all look like this.

465
00:49:01,290 --> 00:49:05,100
They all have the same sort of area. They have a carboxyl from one end of amino group on the other.

466
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:11,880
And then this ah is the thing that varies from amino acid to amino acid and there's a huge type of huge variety

467
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:19,079
of different types of our groups and that results in differences in how they totally get encoded in our proteins,

468
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:22,710
but also how they sort of functionally affect us.

469
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:30,510
So in terms of their metabolism, the side chains dictate whether or not amino acids can become an operative,

470
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:36,150
which makes them amino acids or if they cannot become an operative, which makes them ketogenic.

471
00:49:36,570 --> 00:49:43,170
So for example, you see that lysine, they get metabolized exclusively to the South Pole and as we'll talk about the oxidation unit,

472
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:45,150
so therefore they are not glucose genic at all,

473
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:50,759
whereas all these other ones can be converted to something that is in a cycle, all the glycolysis that way.

474
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:55,650
And therefore they are. They are generally. Yeah.

475
00:49:55,980 --> 00:50:01,559
So here's the structure of all of the amino acids. Please don't try to remember the structure of the amino acids.

476
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,190
You always Google it if you need it.

477
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:09,180
If you asked me questions about you know, or anything like that, but there's a bunch of different ways that you could classify.

478
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:14,309
So one is you could think about their hydrophobicity. So that is how much do they reject water?

479
00:50:14,310 --> 00:50:22,020
For example, some of these large hydrophobic ones like fan I told you st loose exclusively using phenylalanine they tend to be large meanwhile,

480
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:27,000
so they tend to be folded inside of a protein. So if you imagine protein kind of like an apolipoprotein particle,

481
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:31,920
you're going to have the more hydrophilic stuff on the outside and the more hydrophobic stuff on the inside.

482
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:38,100
So that's one way to think about them. Another is they're charged so they can have positive or negative charge that makes them either acidic or basic.

483
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:44,879
The two acidic ones are aspirin, glutamate, and then the two, three basic ones are histidine, lysine and arginine.

484
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:50,880
Right? So these are positively charged. These are negatively charged. So they're going to tend not to be a certain outside of the amino acids.

485
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:56,940
They might have aromatic rings like tryptophan and and allowing those not only affect their hydrophobicity,

486
00:50:56,940 --> 00:51:03,149
but they also could affect what these can become. So tryptophan can get converted into serotonin and melatonin,

487
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:11,640
which all have this indoor ring structure here I spent of money allowing can get converted into into tyrosine which is out here

488
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:18,510
or can be dispersed between noradrenaline and adrenaline because it has that structure in there because of the aromatic groups.

489
00:51:19,170 --> 00:51:22,770
And then the last group that I want to kind of mentioned here is sulfur containing amino acids,

490
00:51:22,770 --> 00:51:26,110
of which there are two, which are cysteine and the binding.

491
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:30,670
They are sort of interchangeable between them, but they both contain a sulfur group to them.

492
00:51:30,690 --> 00:51:39,419
So for example, when people consume a lot of protein and their their gasses smell different, a lot of that is from hydrogen sulfide gas.

493
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:43,530
That hydrogen sulfide largely comes from the catabolism of these things.

494
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:50,459
If you imagine yourself as sort of a bacteria, if you were faced with an excess of these amino acids,

495
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:53,370
you could see these would catabolism to all sorts of different things.

496
00:51:53,370 --> 00:52:00,029
And so one of the things that we've been learning a lot about in the last three or four years is there are bacterial metabolites of,

497
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:04,799
say, tryptophan and and Lalonde in particular, that maybe end up being bioactive.

498
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:11,070
And they may be part of the way that our body responds to changes in our gut, microbiome and our diet that affect physiological.

499
00:52:11,970 --> 00:52:16,799
We get we'll talk about that, I guess so. Like I said, lots of different amino acids.

500
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:25,890
That's one way to think about them is and it's it's sort of a specific structure, but we need to know which amino acids it's associated with.

501
00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:29,520
Like I know nothing like that.

502
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:34,049
You'll see as we go through there'll be some like for example when we're I have a whole thing about your defense,

503
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:38,220
your tornado, melatonin, so that kind of thing where you have to know what the first thing is as a precursor.

504
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:39,620
You'll have to know that you know,

505
00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:47,760
definitely have to know that you have to know they vary in function and physical characteristics like it might help.

506
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:51,930
It's hard for me to say I know the structure of amino acids for like two thirds of my life.

507
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:58,530
So for you to say it doesn't help understand the structure is not for me to say, but I certainly won't be like, what is the structure of this thing?

508
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:05,280
Okay, so that's one way to classify amino acids is through their their physical properties.

509
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:09,179
Another way to classify them is through can our bodies make them?

510
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:11,339
So that's through this concept of essentiality.

511
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:16,230
So we've already talked about one will be with it's already the omega three of the omega six fatty acids.

512
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:22,499
If you remember, the reason that fish are dispensable for omega three fatty acids is because they have a particular

513
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:27,570
enzyme that Delta 12 and 15 saturates that allowed them to make omega three fatty acids,

514
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:32,430
whereas we didn't. So therefore we were all consumers of that same in plants.

515
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:35,940
Plants can make six fatty acids because they have to have the correct hypothesis.

516
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:42,270
So in the case of amino acids are really three groups. Yeah. So there's the conditionally sort of nutritionally essential.

517
00:53:42,270 --> 00:53:44,160
So these are ones we absolutely have to get from our diet.

518
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:48,660
There's the entirely dispensable ones, which are ones that we do not need to get at all from our diet.

519
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:53,910
We can make them ourselves. And then there is this gray area of conditionally, essentially conditionally essential.

520
00:53:54,210 --> 00:53:59,430
And usually what that means, it is dependent on some precursor that is usually essential.

521
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:04,319
Right? I'll go through some examples of that. Now, the condition can be biochemically conditional,

522
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:08,670
which is a problem that you can guess the way I would think of it, or it can be functionally essential.

523
00:54:08,670 --> 00:54:13,440
So it could be it's essential because of the metabolism and therefore you need thing X to make the why.

524
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:17,730
Or it could be because of demand. Maybe you just happen to need a lot more y.

525
00:54:17,970 --> 00:54:24,900
So for example, babies require a lot of arginine. We can make some arginine, but not enough to supply the needs while we're growing.

526
00:54:25,050 --> 00:54:31,830
Another example is during mass of tissue repair, you need a lot of glutamate glutamate, so that makes them essential at that particular time.

527
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:37,140
It's also possible that you can have a genetic disorder where for most people you can convert X to Y,

528
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:41,489
but you may have a disorder where you cannot without the another example of unconditional essential.

529
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:44,550
And we'll go through examples of of all three of these in the next five, 10 minutes.

530
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:50,399
So there's no actually, there isn't one.

531
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:54,060
I'll get to that if you think about.

532
00:54:54,570 --> 00:55:00,000
This is all of the amino acid synthesis pathways. If you were I believe this is from from a plant.

533
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:03,540
So all the amino acids are shown here in white to realize this is pretty small.

534
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:07,710
And you can see some of the pathways for the amino acids are pretty straightforward.

535
00:55:07,890 --> 00:55:12,750
So for example, colony, which is right here, we can just make directly in one step from pyruvate.

536
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:16,500
This is that alt enzyme that we like to talk about, like hops.

537
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:21,729
So it's pretty straightforward. Aspartate can be drawn directly from alcohol acetate.

538
00:55:21,730 --> 00:55:26,790
So again, that's a pretty straightforward one step reaction. A few of these other ones are slightly more complicated.

539
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:34,830
So up here you had Syrian and glycine and cysteine. They are generated from three possible glutamate like what it precursor.

540
00:55:34,950 --> 00:55:38,880
And now it's like one or two steps, right? So those are all pretty straightforward.

541
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:43,079
On the other hand, some of them you can see down here, there's many, many steps, right?

542
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:47,309
So if you tried to make lysine, you could see there would be one, two, three, four,

543
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:51,970
five, six different chemical reactions, starting with alcohol acetate to make lysine.

544
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:58,860
And if you look here, which is ISO losing down here, you can see there's so many steps that they just got lazy and stopped running.

545
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:02,309
So there's so many steps here. So if you're trying to think evolutionarily,

546
00:56:02,310 --> 00:56:09,420
why did we select that we can make certain amino acids and not other ones is because basically the ones where there's many, many steps,

547
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:15,629
like all these steps up here to make tryptophan and tied to the quality are all of these steps down here to make lysine

548
00:56:15,630 --> 00:56:22,500
and and three mean and I saw leucine in all here all of these steps that aren't even shown that we've seen in here.

549
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:27,120
So usually if that's more than three steps, we've evolved not to keep all of those enzymes.

550
00:56:27,390 --> 00:56:33,400
So taking the lysine is an example. If you're a plant, you've got to maintain the function of one, two, three, four, five different enzymes.

551
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:40,889
And humans realized at some point we were just getting enough lysine in our diet that we could just not keep making all of these different enzymes.

552
00:56:40,890 --> 00:56:45,150
Right? So that's why we've evolved to not need them, because presumably there was enough in our environment.

553
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:49,800
Now, if you plant, you know, a choice, right? There could be a whole pile of Lucy like right next to you.

554
00:56:49,950 --> 00:56:53,010
And there's nothing you can do about it because you're a plant and can't move. But humans can.

555
00:56:53,400 --> 00:57:00,480
So humans can detect that they are lacking in things and they can go right. Whereas plants always have to make all of these amino acids for them.

556
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:02,490
So that's the main biochemical differences.

557
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:08,310
Ones that have multiple steps are the ones we've stopped using, whereas the really easy, straightforward ones one step, two step.

558
00:57:08,430 --> 00:57:13,350
We generally make those ourselves right, because generally we don't get enough.

559
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:17,010
Now there's a couple of weird exceptions here. These are the dotted lines here.

560
00:57:17,190 --> 00:57:21,210
So in these cases here, there are two reactions that theoretically can occur.

561
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:26,700
For example, we could take out the key to glutamate, which is right here, and turn it into glutamate in principle.

562
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:30,330
But in practice, for some reasons, we'll talk about the oxidation unit.

563
00:57:30,450 --> 00:57:34,920
We almost never do. And so that's why this is the dotted line here.

564
00:57:35,070 --> 00:57:37,260
And then arginine here again. We can make it.

565
00:57:37,290 --> 00:57:43,590
We have this enzyme, but generally it's not sufficient for us to make it when we have high arginine needs when we're doing a trial.

566
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:47,360
So even though we have this reaction, it doesn't work classical.

567
00:57:47,450 --> 00:57:55,530
Same with same with this. Right? So that's the sort of biochemical distinction between that one sort of shortcut we have is right here.

568
00:57:55,770 --> 00:57:59,489
So even though we cannot make tyrosine from this thing here,

569
00:57:59,490 --> 00:58:05,940
which is free and needs proven in preventing whatever that is, we cannot make tyrosine from that.

570
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:11,140
We can sort of take a side cut from phenylalanine and hydroxylase it and make tyrosine, right?

571
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:16,980
So we have this one enzyme right here called phenylalanine hydroxylase and it takes phenylalanine and it makes tigers.

572
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:23,010
So we cannot make tyrosine this way, but we can make tyrosine using this one little shortcut region here.

573
00:58:23,310 --> 00:58:28,680
So what that means is as long as you have enough petal alanine and you've been allowed to add hydroxylase,

574
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:34,890
you're always going to have enough tyrosine, right? It doesn't really matter that you don't have any of these very, very complex.

575
00:58:35,130 --> 00:58:41,670
So what that means is that hydrazine is conditionally essential and having sufficient amounts of that allowing.

576
00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:49,110
So that's what that means. That's a precursor is that allow it and it makes the technically non essential amino acid hydrazine.

577
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:55,770
This is also true for cysteine, which is dependent on Seri and for these streaming devices which are dependent on glutamate.

578
00:58:55,920 --> 00:59:00,660
And up here, a special gene which is dependent on on glutamate.

579
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:05,160
Right. So all of these there's another reaction. But usually you have plenty of this.

580
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:11,970
And as long as you have the enzyme that can convert to this, this, it doesn't actually matter if you're directly consuming tyrosine or not.

581
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:18,930
But as you can probably guess, there's a genetic disorder that is associated with this that can disrupt this process.

582
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:25,139
So this is a disease called you don't get when you're ill. And what it is, it is a disorder of not having that enzyme.

583
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:28,890
So you do not have sufficient amounts of fennel alanine hydroxylase.

584
00:59:28,890 --> 00:59:36,780
So that's the enzyme that takes fennel alanine and would normally the hydroxyl group, which is the only difference between finally and A.C.

585
00:59:37,050 --> 00:59:47,220
And so this is, you know, reasonably not super common, but well diagnosed disorder, generally diagnosed now by points by testing,

586
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:53,430
but used to be diagnosed by a by the by seizures, and as you can guess, a deficiency.

587
00:59:53,950 --> 01:00:01,360
In Paris. They also have to let me just say yes.

588
01:00:01,370 --> 01:00:04,420
Yeah, we'll talk about that in like two, two slides.

589
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:13,390
Yes. Now, that's that is a really good point. So what that means is it becomes slightly complicated in how you nutritionally treat people with PKU.

590
01:00:13,630 --> 01:00:19,150
So what I want you guys to do for the next 5 minutes or so is get into groups of severe trigger platelets.

591
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:23,649
Neuro can prove them. And I want you to sort of think about these questions here.

592
01:00:23,650 --> 01:00:27,850
So I want you to think about you're going to have to treat these people. You have to be very careful.

593
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:33,970
You can give them a diet. This can be very specific how you're going to treat them, how are you going to monitor it?

594
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:39,520
And then what would piracy be for this patient following his or her behavior?

595
01:00:40,450 --> 01:00:44,290
And they can be treated completely, kind of like totally free time.

596
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:49,299
I guess one other factor, I guess I didn't say which is important to your your activity here is not only do

597
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:54,010
you need phenylalanine hydroxylase to keep an eye on it and turn it into tyrosine,

598
01:00:54,190 --> 01:00:58,509
but also the catabolism of penalty also goes through the same pathway, right?

599
01:00:58,510 --> 01:01:03,880
So if you need to get rid of that, allow any because you have too much in your body that the first step is to turn it to piracy.

600
01:01:04,030 --> 01:01:11,650
And the entire scene is the thing that gets further metabolized eventually into into the cuckoo genic amino acid precursors.

601
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:19,389
So I think that's all you guys need to do. So I guess I will spend probably about 10 minutes on on this part here.

602
01:01:19,390 --> 01:01:27,459
If you can kind of go through and aside, I should say we re not going to get an instrument that Fredricka and I'll

603
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:33,280
circle around because you guys want to make sure you submit your group first.

604
01:01:35,140 --> 01:01:38,400
You want to join our group, believe me.

605
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:50,290
And you know, these are things.

606
01:01:54,080 --> 01:02:01,820
So what is it like the vice president also?

607
01:02:02,470 --> 01:02:38,320
So taking the role, I saw some great people I thought was, you know, that was nice because we don't like I said, I don't like registering.

608
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:56,200
So he was like, oh, I was like, oh, yeah.

609
01:02:56,610 --> 01:03:00,130
You know, I didn't know that. It does sound like a brand name.

610
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:04,570
I feel like I was making something very dynamic, constant, you know.

611
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:14,100
So don't be sorry. You said.

612
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:30,660
Yeah, I like you could just measure it like a little almost like nanometers that if you have this because know so then

613
01:03:31,450 --> 01:03:46,060
let's go back to like well the first part of it is probably what happens now when you go into the country.

614
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:51,130
I think you have a build up of.

615
01:03:51,730 --> 01:04:14,750
Yeah, I know, I don't know if you can see you have the positioning and you know how we look like we have to you know that mindset.

616
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:30,380
So, you know, that's a mission accomplished thing in terms of what you're saying.

617
01:04:30,610 --> 01:04:44,950
But I don't know, you know, what's the drawback is motion.

618
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:53,500
You don't really need to trust your intuition.

619
01:04:55,480 --> 01:05:16,920
I'm sure that after a while you feel like the seconds you got.

620
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:27,040
You know how it is. So, like, I feel like that's how I.

621
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:38,790
But they can't do any of those things.

622
01:05:39,550 --> 01:05:44,130
That's why it's so great. Because to be so.

623
01:05:47,210 --> 01:05:54,770
So here, you break it down unconditionally.

624
01:05:54,930 --> 01:05:59,820
Yeah, I like it.

625
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:11,900
All You set your sights, and it was very distracting.

626
01:06:19,330 --> 01:06:38,750
But my attention was supposed to go and see what he looks like, and I know nothing about it,

627
01:06:38,750 --> 01:06:48,710
but I like to watch stuff that I imagine feel like, yeah, my cousin, partially.

628
01:06:49,250 --> 01:07:04,970
I mean, a lot of these guys will be like, right, I'm not treated like it's like not possible.

629
01:07:05,180 --> 01:07:37,320
I was like, Yeah, this is your first time shooting a movie.

630
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:43,220
You need something else.

631
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:47,899
Okay, so it sounds like most people are winding down,

632
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:54,790
so why don't we start with the first question you're going to have to give somebody at least a phenylalanine reduced diet, right?

633
01:07:54,800 --> 01:08:00,040
Because they're going to have a risk of not having or having to build a family because they can't get it.

634
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:05,080
So how would you monitor if this diet's, like, working well or not or whatever?

635
01:08:11,930 --> 01:08:14,540
Yeah, you could do blood or urine tests for any amino acids.

636
01:08:14,540 --> 01:08:23,870
So in the case of most people who have PKU, there's like a blood test you can use that can monitor your family level sort of throughout the day.

637
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:27,650
And you have to stay within a very normal range. So could you be treated?

638
01:08:27,890 --> 01:08:31,960
Your question would be monitored. Yeah.

639
01:08:31,970 --> 01:08:37,340
So I'll get to that in a second here. Yeah, you're right. At that point it would be so I'll come down to that.

640
01:08:37,340 --> 01:08:43,400
That's the third question. But the second question is, could they be treated with a diet that is like specifically generated that no phenylalanine?

641
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:50,830
What would you recommend that I did not know because you would still need some amount of it to make the proteins that requirement.

642
01:08:51,590 --> 01:08:57,980
Yeah, exactly right. Because that alone is still essential amino acid, all those proteins are content about, which is basically every protein.

643
01:08:58,820 --> 01:09:02,070
So the collagen is going to require something off.

644
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:04,459
So it's a really tricky treatment window. Right.

645
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:10,010
Has to be low enough that it's not building up, but high enough that it's sufficient for protein synthesis.

646
01:09:10,010 --> 01:09:13,460
Right. So there's a very narrow range that's by just be very, very carefully monitored.

647
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:18,380
Okay. So how would you characterize piracy here? And this is this is a little bit sort of definition.

648
01:09:18,890 --> 01:09:21,830
Definition. Yes, you could depend on your definition,

649
01:09:21,830 --> 01:09:28,520
but would you think now tyrosine is essential or dispensable or conditionally essential for or for this particular person?

650
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:35,450
He said essentially it went from conditionally essential to essential. Because you're only taking off.

651
01:09:36,110 --> 01:09:39,530
Yeah, because it has to be directly, directly provided.

652
01:09:40,130 --> 01:09:43,700
So. Yeah, so it would die. What I would characterize it is now it is essential for this person.

653
01:09:43,850 --> 01:09:50,479
You could also say the reason we consider tyrosine conditionally essential is there are people out there like this that that is the condition.

654
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:57,440
The PKU is is the condition. Okay. And then to the to the last point the last point that the brain mentioned,

655
01:09:57,590 --> 01:10:00,889
usually we don't monitor levels of target because it's more important to keep

656
01:10:00,890 --> 01:10:05,570
the phenylalanine arranges development allowing the cause of the problem. But you can certainly measure tyrosine if that's a concern.

657
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:10,480
One more thing about monitoring what we like. Information about seizures, frequency.

658
01:10:10,850 --> 01:10:16,610
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. So so this slide all on by the slide in your in your notes.

659
01:10:16,610 --> 01:10:21,169
But this is just a little more a little more details on it. So it's a reasonably common disease,

660
01:10:21,170 --> 01:10:27,880
one in 12 thousands if you're an activist clinical that is in the obviously not under threat somebody with PKU at some point this is pretty rare.

661
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:34,370
There's two problems. There's a build up of a lack of breakdown phenylalanine so that builds up and then a deficiency in tired since you have to

662
01:10:34,370 --> 01:10:40,609
supplement with higher C but also have very low levels of mental health and the main outcomes adverse outcomes are seizures,

663
01:10:40,610 --> 01:10:44,240
hyperactivity of mental well-being and early death.

664
01:10:44,870 --> 01:10:50,180
So the treatment is a medical diet that is very low but not zero in phenylalanine and higher types.

665
01:10:50,390 --> 01:10:55,250
So to an endpoint point from before the activity.

666
01:10:55,490 --> 01:11:02,330
That's one of the risks so that's reason is tested for blood spot testing for newborns is that there can be a risk for for

667
01:11:02,330 --> 01:11:07,040
breastfeeding with very little because the mother's milk very likely has high levels of phthalate phenylalanine in it.

668
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:10,529
So right away they generally get transferred to a nutritional diet.

669
01:11:10,530 --> 01:11:14,870
And so for those of you who remember in the States, I guess it was March or April,

670
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:20,449
there was a manufacturing issue with food formula where all formula was low.

671
01:11:20,450 --> 01:11:24,020
And so then mothers who were looking for any formula started buying this like

672
01:11:24,140 --> 01:11:27,500
other alternate formulas because you could just buy the final outing free formula.

673
01:11:27,650 --> 01:11:33,280
And then that became a bigger problem because those women who have children with PKU, they don't have at all any other option.

674
01:11:33,290 --> 01:11:38,359
I absolutely agree with that. And so at least in Michigan, they then pulled up fee free stuff and pulled it off.

675
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:43,460
So you couldn't just buy it off somewhere. In most cases, you could buy the medical food off off the shelf.

676
01:11:44,330 --> 01:11:49,370
Quite often you might have tyrosine supplements and it's very you have to be very careful with water.

677
01:11:49,790 --> 01:11:49,939
Now,

678
01:11:49,940 --> 01:11:55,790
it actually turns out the range that you have to keep it in which I forgot to put on the slide actually varies with age because as you're growing,

679
01:11:55,940 --> 01:12:01,280
you actually need quite a lot of free phenylalanine because you need to be building all that protein, right?

680
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:03,290
So as you're growing, you're making lots and lots of new proteins,

681
01:12:03,290 --> 01:12:08,000
but as you become an adult and then as you become elderly and your protein levels decrease,

682
01:12:08,510 --> 01:12:12,890
now you need less in your diet because it's going to come out of your proteins as well as your your effort.

683
01:12:13,940 --> 01:12:19,849
Okay. So the last thing I want to talk about here is sort of just a general concept that we'll talk about throughout the rest of this unit.

684
01:12:19,850 --> 01:12:25,669
And this is the idea of thinking about protein bodies. So we've already done this with car quality and fat quality as well.

685
01:12:25,670 --> 01:12:30,560
But there's really protein quality is is quite good because there's really specific metrics that we can use.

686
01:12:30,830 --> 01:12:35,180
So the three things that I think of when I think of is a protein, a good quality of protein is three things.

687
01:12:35,420 --> 01:12:37,700
One is how easily is it digestible?

688
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:44,270
If we are trying to optimize the amino acid delivery to the patient, we want it to be a very digestible protein way, even better.

689
01:12:45,290 --> 01:12:52,880
So that's the first framing. The second framing is the amino acid profile doesn't have enough of all the essential amino acids as well.

690
01:12:52,950 --> 01:12:57,830
I it's going to expand the way. And then the third thing is what else comes with that protein?

691
01:12:57,950 --> 01:13:03,589
So for example, EVA comes along with a fiber compared to steak, which which does not.

692
01:13:03,590 --> 01:13:08,980
Right. So what are the other things? Is there iron there? Is there other methods that are associated with this?

693
01:13:09,860 --> 01:13:11,239
Now, Observationally,

694
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:19,220
this is looking at a bunch of different protein sources and the association of all protein sources with weight gain over over a five year period.

695
01:13:19,430 --> 01:13:24,410
And so what you can see here is a hamburger and lean hamburger and hot dogs.

696
01:13:24,620 --> 01:13:32,060
They were all associated observationally with with increased weight gain, whereas down here this was yogurt, seafood, chicken skin.

697
01:13:32,270 --> 01:13:38,120
They were generally associated with with low risk. So I'm going to tell you right now, from a compositional or even a digestive standpoint,

698
01:13:38,210 --> 01:13:42,290
there's not that big of a difference between a chicken or a yogurt and a hamburger.

699
01:13:42,830 --> 01:13:44,870
All of this is because of the protein package. Right.

700
01:13:44,870 --> 01:13:51,469
So the generally that probably the reason there's an increase here is because of the excess fat that is part of the protein package,

701
01:13:51,470 --> 01:13:55,730
whereas down here that is less obese. Okay.

702
01:13:55,790 --> 01:14:01,159
So like I said, there are ten amino acids that we cannot make ourselves depending on whether or not you count arginine.

703
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:04,250
So this is the mnemonic I use to kind of keep track of them.

704
01:14:04,790 --> 01:14:10,670
It's not super helpful, for example, if you don't know all of the abbreviations, but these are the first letters for most of them.

705
01:14:10,910 --> 01:14:14,510
Arginine is, as I mentioned before, it is somewhat essential.

706
01:14:14,510 --> 01:14:16,730
It's really only technically essential for children.

707
01:14:16,820 --> 01:14:24,049
It's somewhat dispensable for for adults if we look at whole proteins, many plant sources of protein.

708
01:14:24,050 --> 01:14:32,930
So here this is just a I would say, somewhat biased selection of protein sources, all compared to how much of the essential amino acids we need.

709
01:14:32,990 --> 01:14:34,520
So this is all the essential amino acids.

710
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:41,990
And then you see lysine and tiny divided by an inflation mean the two that are the most rare in an incomplete protein.

711
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:49,460
For context on black here is humans. Not because I'm arguing for cannibalism, but that's what we actually need is the black box.

712
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:57,770
And as you see most animal sources here, so this is egg beef, chicken casein for casein whey.

713
01:14:57,770 --> 01:15:01,100
And so that's the kind of cheating to make it seem like these are five totally different things.

714
01:15:01,490 --> 01:15:03,270
They're all pretty complete, both interesting.

715
01:15:03,290 --> 01:15:12,020
All these meanwhile sets and the limiting ones, whereas several protein sources, for example, lentils and lupines as well as oats,

716
01:15:12,170 --> 01:15:17,390
they're all quite low in the fighting, whereas other things such as wheat are low in lysine.

717
01:15:18,020 --> 01:15:22,360
And in fact. So this used to be my favorite thing on Wikipedia until somebody made a Wikipedia added.

718
01:15:22,850 --> 01:15:26,390
So there is no source to this except for Wikipedia from five years ago.

719
01:15:26,630 --> 01:15:33,710
This is showing a bunch of different foods going across here and then what the limiting of essential amino acid is.

720
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:38,300
So you can see several things are low in lysine. They tend to be more green based things.

721
01:15:38,690 --> 01:15:43,640
And you can see if you compare it to something else, there is much there's low levels of.

722
01:15:44,910 --> 01:15:49,260
Let's see. There's other things such as these tend to be low in the findings.

723
01:15:49,350 --> 01:15:54,299
So what this means is you can combine the two. You can have a grain alone with a bean.

724
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:58,620
And then you're getting your name from the grain and you're getting your lysine from the beans.

725
01:15:58,650 --> 01:16:01,860
So you can call that together to make a more complete version of the protein.

726
01:16:02,070 --> 01:16:06,930
But even though there's ten amino acids that we cannot make from a nutritional standpoint,

727
01:16:06,930 --> 01:16:10,710
there's really only two that cause the deficiency in most cases.

728
01:16:11,190 --> 01:16:19,259
The one exception here is you can see tryptophan, which is down here, is low in a couple of foods, but those foods are even lower in something else.

729
01:16:19,260 --> 01:16:28,260
So tryptophan is low in corn, but it's lower in lysine, whereas it's and it's also low in green peas, but it's lower in the binding.

730
01:16:28,450 --> 01:16:31,799
Right. So technically, you could be deficient in Japan,

731
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:37,560
but as far as I've ever seen a food source that was too low in terms and but not low in something else.

732
01:16:38,250 --> 01:16:44,580
Next class, we're going to go through a scale, that year scale, which is going to talk about how do we actually put a number to the completeness.

733
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:49,409
And it turns out that every single protein source or combined protein source or mixed meal source you can

734
01:16:49,410 --> 01:16:54,750
decide does give it an exact number of how complete of a protein it will go through that next class.

735
01:16:56,130 --> 01:17:00,680
Okay. So the last thing I want to mention is amino acids, because they're all different structures.

736
01:17:00,690 --> 01:17:06,840
All the amino acids are now in green. And our sort of handy chart we've been using all semester because the catabolism is so complicated,

737
01:17:07,350 --> 01:17:11,490
every amino acid has a different catabolic factor as these like various oxidation is complicated.

738
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:15,129
There's only one pathway for that, right? We have 20 different catabolic pathways.

739
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:21,900
So I'm going to try to give you an overview of here. There really distinguish between ones that go into the TCA cycle such as all these guys here

740
01:17:22,050 --> 01:17:30,220
and ones that cannot which are are not within lysine and APC which go through acetylcholine.

741
01:17:30,630 --> 01:17:34,830
So that's how we differentiate between the glucose genic and the ketogenic amino acids.

742
01:17:35,100 --> 01:17:36,540
So they've been on the mark I used,

743
01:17:36,540 --> 01:17:44,189
but this is flipped or split depending on you use atropine for phenylalanine and then the two LS are the exclusively ketogenic amino acids.

744
01:17:44,190 --> 01:17:49,829
So that means if somebody was hyper hypoglycemic and you provided them with just supplemental leucine as you could buy at

745
01:17:49,830 --> 01:17:54,570
a health food store that would never help with their blood glucose or because that leucine can never return to humans.

746
01:17:54,840 --> 01:18:01,530
Whereas if you gave them histidine or threonine in principle, that could be converted into of course, because these are.

747
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:06,330
Chuck okay, that is all I have. I hope you guys all have a wonderful Thanksgiving.

748
01:18:07,380 --> 01:18:14,130
Enjoy some coffee or other protein source in the appropriate time and see you guys next week.

749
01:18:16,620 --> 01:18:25,140
So I know this is the second line I want to do.
