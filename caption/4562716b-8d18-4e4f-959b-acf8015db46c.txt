1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:12,570
OK, so earlier on, you learned a lot you were introduced to a lot of statistical concepts, you know, concepts that we use in quantitative research.

2
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,280
Now, in this segment, I'll be doing some descriptive statistics.

3
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:23,580
I'll be operationalizing some of the terms that we talked about earlier on so they can make more sense to you.

4
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:31,080
You can see what they look like in action. So what I have here is my R studio interface.

5
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:39,840
And like I said, you can download R it's free It's open source. And I have another presentation where I do an intro to R,

6
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,360
In that video you'll see more of a step by step of how I use R with this one

7
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,260
I'm just mostly going to be doing analysis. All right.

8
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:58,020
So this is a R markdown file that I'm using. And I'm going to start out by loading my libraries for my analysis today.

9
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,610
So if I run this this chunk right here, it's going to load my libraries.

10
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:09,990
And I already uploaded my data right, already read in my data.

11
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,140
So I'll just do this to show you guys, you know,

12
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:20,100
starts by setting up my working directory and you'll see this more more of this in my other presentation.

13
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,040
And my dataset is called scores.

14
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:32,190
So as I noted in the segments, we will operationalize some of the concepts and methods covered earlier on in the PowerPoint presentation.

15
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:40,650
We'll start by doing some descriptive statistics. The dataset that will be used was obtained from statisticsbyJim.Com.

16
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:46,320
It contains the test scores of a hundred eighth graders in the state of Pennsylvania.

17
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:54,420
All right. So let's look at our dataset. If we go over here to our environment, let's go here.

18
00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:01,590
You could see scores if I click on this or I can also view if I click on view scores, it will show me.

19
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:10,050
So let's do this to quickly view our dataset. Now, what you can see is that I have two columns and the columns represent my variables.

20
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:14,850
So make note of the terms that I'm using because I mentioned some earlier on.

21
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:21,180
So I have two variables working with. One is known as satisfactory the other is test.scores.

22
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:29,880
So let's just say test scores. And as you can see, satisfactory is a categorical variables with two levels, yes or no.

23
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,380
Test scores is a new market variable. And this is a continuous variable.

24
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:40,440
As you can see, I have a lot of decimals. Right. So if I go back to my main file.

25
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,630
So I've used my dataset and another thing to notice is that I have 100 entries.

26
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:49,610
So this essentially means I have 100 observations, right?

27
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:54,940
100 rows and I have two columns. So what can we do with our data set?

28
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:59,920
The first thing I'm going to do is to generate summary statistics and to do this

29
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:09,940
I'm going to use a command known as the favstats command, and it's within within R we have different packages.

30
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:18,370
So this one is I believe it's within the latest package so its within the Mosaic package that I loaded earlier on.

31
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:25,270
Right. And this is just going to give me So let's see what it produces. So you can see it's giving me my minimum value

32
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:36,760
My first quartile, my median, my Q3 which is my third quarter, my maximum means, standard deviation and n my number of data points.

33
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:41,830
So again, we kind of touched on some of these concepts in the Core Point presentation.

34
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:46,360
But it's it makes more sense to actually see them in action when we have a data set.

35
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,440
So you can see that the mean score was 79 not too bad.

36
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:55,810
The median was 78, the median is that point that separates your data into two halves.

37
00:03:55,810 --> 00:04:00,370
Right. Now this is just showing you the scores in general.

38
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:05,920
But I can also group them right. Since I have my

39
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:13,240
Ill just call this my grouping variable because this satisfactory variable right here gave me two levels.

40
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:19,390
Yes or no, so saying yes for what's satisfactory or no represents what's not satisfactory.

41
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:23,730
So I can do my favstats command by group. So let's see what that looks like rather.

42
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:29,500
So again, it's going to me my variable right here.

43
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,370
This row represents what's not satisfactory, and this is for yes.

44
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:43,300
So you can see right off the bat the mean your average the average score for what's satisfactory is higher than the No.

45
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:51,230
Right. So we see that this is 81 the other one is 66. The median for the satisfaction scores

46
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:54,820
the median score is also higher, 79 versus 68.

47
00:04:54,820 --> 00:05:00,250
So this kind of gives us a quick snapshot of, you know like I said,

48
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:06,970
the median represents your measure of central tendency and the mean is also a measure of central tendency.

49
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:13,240
So it gives you a quick snapshot of how your data is distributed. Now, we can also visualize our data.

50
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:18,430
I'm a visual learner, right? So we're going to do a box plot, box and whisker plot.

51
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:22,540
This is the command that I'm using. And I'm going to do this by a group.

52
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:27,340
So let's look at that our box plot. All right.

53
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:33,040
So you can see, since we're doing it based on the group, we're getting two plots.

54
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:37,270
And right off the bat, we notice this dots right here represents the median.

55
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:42,970
We can see that the median for the satisfactory group is higher than the median for the group

56
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:55,090
that's not satisfactory. And what I like about a box and whisker plot is that it aligns perfectly with my with what my fav stats command gives me.

57
00:05:55,090 --> 00:06:00,370
So, for example, this gives me my mean, my minimum, my Q1, my median.

58
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:08,200
I can easily identify those points on my plot. So this line right here, would represents the minimum.

59
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:13,120
This represents my first quartile Q1. The dot is the median.

60
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,070
This right here at the top of the box represents the third quartile, Q3.

61
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:25,840
And then the top represents the maximum value. So it's perfect alignment of what we have right here.

62
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:32,560
So you can always match up those values. And if you notice for the No group, the group, that's not satisfactory.

63
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,450
You can see that we have two outliers right here at these two points right here are outliers.

64
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:42,150
All right. Another thing that we can do is to do a density curve.

65
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:46,390
A density plot is another tool for visualizing our data.

66
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:53,230
This is the command that I'm using for my density plot. And I have a title, test scores by a satisfactory level.

67
00:06:53,230 --> 00:07:02,860
So let's see what that looks like. All right. So because I use auto.key = true.

68
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:09,070
You know, it gives me a key for what my two my two graphs represent.

69
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:13,510
Right off the bat you can see that for the blue, for example, this is skewed.

70
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:18,940
This is less skewed and it's seems to be trimodal, I have three modes going on right here

71
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:29,040
three peaks right here. And for the other curve, sort of looks flat, but you can see that you have greater values under the group

72
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,060
that's satisfactory.

73
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:40,900
So just looking at this and what I showed you earlier on about the normal distribution, we can see that this data is not normally distributed.

74
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:48,070
And if something is not normally distributed, we would use the median as the measure of central tendency.

75
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:52,310
So in terms of comparing the scores, we would talk more about the median as opposed to

76
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:59,090
talking about the mean, right? So that's how some of these concepts come into play.

77
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:04,880
And another thing that we can do, earlier on in the PowerPoint segment,

78
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:10,130
I talked about a Bivariate analysis, and that means that we're analyzing two variables.

79
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:16,790
So we will investigate if there is a relationship between test scores and satisfactory level.

80
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:22,550
In other words, do students with satisfactory scores have higher test scores?

81
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:30,440
Now, the reason why we need to do a statistical test for this is because something may differ numerically.

82
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:36,140
We can see that the median is higher. It doesn't mean that this difference is statistically significant.

83
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:40,460
So that's what we're doing the test to see is this difference really meaningful

84
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:48,290
right, from a statistical standpoint. And what I have here is that it is clear that the data is not normally distributed.

85
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:55,100
So we will do what is known as a wilcoxon test to determine if the scores of the two groups differ significantly.

86
00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:00,890
This is my command for doing my wilcox test, test scores by a satisfactory level.

87
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:05,390
What I have here, you know, number sign  anything thing that you put a number sign before

88
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:09,660
It means that it's going to be, it's not going to be read by the software.

89
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:15,950
Right. So I can run this, and what I'm going to look at now is my P value.

90
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:21,980
I see that P is two times ten to the minus nine P is less than .05.

91
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:28,010
In most statistical tests, we set our alpha level as .05.

92
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:34,190
So if or P is less .05 we know that our finding here is statistical significance

93
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:43,970
and we can reject our null hypothesis because our null hypothesis going into going into this specific investigation was that there is no difference

94
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:53,060
between the test scores of the satisfactory group versus the non satisfactory group since we obtain a P value of less than .05.

95
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,760
We can reject that null hypothesis.

96
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:05,720
So this is how this is one way of doing it bivariate analysis in R, so hopefully these concepts make more sense to you.

97
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:11,450
And when you play around with your data more, it will become sort of more meaningful.

98
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:25,800
Now in the next segment we will talk about inferential statistics and you will see how I do other analysis using different data with more variables.
