1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now that you have your Canvas assignment, you're ready to configure the Yellowdig Community.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Open the assignment and click the "Load new window" button.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This is a one time setup to configure your community. By default, the community will have

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
the same name as your Canvas site and will be private so that it's restricted to only those enrolled in the course.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:37,000
At the bottom of this page, you will need to change the community organization from University of Michigan to Umich School of Public Health.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Then submit. Your new community has been created and we have a message at the top directing us to finish the setup.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We'll do this from the settings menu in the left hand toolbar.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Beginning with the Basics menu, double check to make sure the community organization is set to

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Umich School of Public Health. If it's not, go ahead and change it here and click save at the bottom of this page.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Moving on to the Point System, participation points and grade passback are enabled in order to send the grades back to your Canvas grade book.

11
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Click the Weekly Point Configuration. This is the part of Yellowdig that drives interaction, the earning of points to incentivize participation.

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The first step is setting the earning window. This will be the start and end dates of your course.

13
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Yellowdig will use this to create weekly earning periods.

14
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Next, you'll set the periodic target. How many points should students earn each week?

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Since we're new to using Yellowdig, we're recommending using the suggestions provided.

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So in this example, students will work to earn 10,000 points each week,

17
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
working towards a goal of 130,000 for the semester.

18
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
That's a lot of points. But if you think in terms of a pinball machine or a video game,

19
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:21,000
we're going to allow students to earn a significant amount of points for each thing they do to engage with their peers.

20
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Clicking next, the periodic buffer is how many points over the periodic target or weekly point goal

21
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:39,000
are students allowed to earn each week? So if students should be aiming to earn 10,000 points and I allow them to earn 30 percent over that,

22
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
they'll be allowed to earn up to a maximum of 13,000 points each week.

23
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
This comes into play as we're not able to take a week off per say.

24
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
If there's a school break in the middle of your semester, for instance,

25
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
we're not able to tell Yellowdig not to penalize students for not earning their points that week.

26
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
What students will need to do is make up for those points, which they can do by earning more than the target

27
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:16,000
in other weeks. In that case, you might consider increasing this buffer to allow even more flexibility each week.

28
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Because once the student meets, this buffer in this case, hits that 13,000 points,

29
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:32,000
they won't be able to earn any more points for that week, even if they do additional activity in the community.

30
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,000
The earning rules tab is where will decide how many points students earn for posting,

31
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
for commenting on others posts and when their peers interact with their posts.

32
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Again, because we're new to Yellowdig, I'm going to use the suggestions provided.

33
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
But know you can adjust these.

34
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:05,000
In fact, one way to encourage peer to peer interaction is to increase the amount of points students earned by commenting on another user's post.

35
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
This will reward them for listening and engaging with others.

36
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So if we pause and look at the right hand side, I can see a summary of the choices I've made so far.

37
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Every time a student posts meeting the 40 word minimum, they'll earn 1,500 points. When they reply to a peer's post with a minimum of 20 words,

38
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:38,000
They'll earn 800 points. Students will earn 500 points for every comment that is left on their post and earn 300 points

39
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
any time someone leaves an emoji reaction. When I click next,

40
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Yellowdig is going to do a point review and I can double check the summary in the right hand panel. When I'm ready,

41
00:04:50,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm going to submit this configuration. Let's look at some of the other things available in the Settings menu.

42
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I can look at the accolades. This is one way I, as an instructor, can award points and recognize students for a good post.

43
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I can edit these to give them a new name, a new icon or a different point value.

44
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I can also create new accolades. Topic tags are a way students can categorize their posts.

45
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You'll also get some analytics about these topic tags in one of the report menus,

46
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Yellowdiig suggests we set this to require students to select a topic every time they post.

47
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Create new topics that align with your course, content that students can choose from.

48
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:57,000
The next menu emojis allow you to select or restrict what emojis can be used in posts,

49
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:05,000
and in response to posts and comment. Groups, while you can have Yellowdig divide your class up into groups,

50
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:13,000
it's not recommended as students will have more opportunities to earn points by interacting with more of their peers.

51
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
One possibility to allow students to discuss topics in groups would be to create

52
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:26,000
a topic tag with the group names that students can attach to their posts.

53
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And we'll look at how posts can be filtered using these tags. I can return to the home page using the Community button in the left hand navigation

54
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Yellowdig pre-populates two posts and attaches your name to them as the instructor.

55
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You can click on the more menu to make edits to this post.

56
00:06:50,000 --> 00:07:04,000
This menu is also how you can award accolades. In the right hand panel is where students will be able to see the points they're earning.

57
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Students can see how to earn points and monitor their participation or how they're doing throughout the semester.

58
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Notice the sorting tools below this. You can sort by recent posts and comments.

59
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You can collapse and expand posts. And you can filter posts by topic tags, for example, or by hashtag or by a specific user.

60
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
To create posts, all community members can click on the blue Create button.

61
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:48,000
As your students begin interacting in this community, you can use the data menu to see how they're doing.

62
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Use the Community Health reports to view analytics on your community usage of the topic tags and on individual students.

63
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
The Reports area will allow you to see the points everyone has earned.

64
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
The Network graph provides a visualization to see how your classes interacting with

65
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
one another and whether there are students that are not interacting with others.

66
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You'll want to check this to make sure that students are not just interacting with you.

67
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,000
The instructor, but are also engaging with one another.

68
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:37,744
