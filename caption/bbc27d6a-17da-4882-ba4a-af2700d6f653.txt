1
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:09,730
All right. So this is just going to be a brief overview of occupational health and health care settings.

2
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:12,450
So, again, a lot of this is stuff that we kind of covered last semester.

3
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:18,210
For those of you who took the previous class, if you didn't take it, that's fine.

4
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,950
Don't worry. It's just going to be kind of a quick, quick overview.

5
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,330
So this is a slide that I shared before last semester.

6
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,570
So these are some of the functions of occupational health programs in health care settings.

7
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:45,180
And really the goal of occupational health programs is to keep our employees safe so our health care personal safe and also to keep our patients safe.

8
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:55,379
So we have kind of two different functions. And probably one of the biggest things that we do to keep our health care personnel

9
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:59,910
safe is to make sure that they are up to date on all their immunizations.

10
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:08,130
So when we have new employees who come to work for us, we do a comprehensive communicable disease and immunization history.

11
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,850
And I'm going to kind of review that again just quickly.

12
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,130
So you guys have a refresher on which immunizations we require for our health care workers.

13
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,530
And then Christy is going to talk a lot about exposure management.

14
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:31,019
So I'm not really going to get into that today. And then, of course, keeping our patients safe.

15
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,429
So it turns out that when we vaccinate health care workers, that also helps to keep our patients safe.

16
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:39,270
Right. Because we're not, you know, giving them like flu and measles and stuff.

17
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,999
So that's a good thing. And then we do have work restrictions for health care workers with communicable

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,780
diseases to everyone or who have potentially an exposure to a communicable disease.

19
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:57,829
And I'll talk about that just quickly. I'm not going to talk a lot about patient exposures, Christy.

20
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:01,680
You may get into that a little bit, but we're not going to really cover that today.

21
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:07,859
So I'm just going to go quickly through the the communicable disease and immunization

22
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:14,040
history that we take when we have new employees who come work with us at the hospital.

23
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,840
So we're going to go through kind of the required and recommended immunizations.

24
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:29,640
Again, this is mostly review for most of you. So we do require all of our employees to have the anima or measles, mumps and rubella vaccine.

25
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:37,830
They have to provide either proof of immunity, meaning they actually bring their childhood immunization records with them.

26
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:43,680
Or we can draw a titer.

27
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,500
If they're not able to provide their immunization records,

28
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:53,430
we can draw a tighter to see if they're immune to measles, etc. I think I mentioned this before.

29
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:58,799
We used to accept birth prior to 1957 as proof of immunity to measles because back

30
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,540
then there was no measles vaccine and pretty much all kids got measles at some point.

31
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:08,219
But it turns out that's not actually super reliable as proof of immunity.

32
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:17,100
We actually had a few years back, we actually had an outbreak of not an outbreak, but a huge measles exposure,

33
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:23,370
not involving a health care worker, but involving a patient who had actually traveled to India and got measles.

34
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:27,150
And she was like a nurse. She was born well before 1957.

35
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,870
So clearly that rule doesn't always apply.

36
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,740
So basically you have to either show that you got the vaccine at some point or we're going to draw your blood to check for your antibodies.

37
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:50,580
Same thing for chicken pox varicella. We require proof of vaccination, otherwise we will dry your blood to make sure that you're immune.

38
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:58,140
Some of us, like myself, are a little bit older, actually may have proof that we had chicken pox and we were a kid.

39
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:04,379
That's pretty rare, though. It's pretty rare to be able to, like, dig up your pediatrician records from, like, the 1970s.

40
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:12,780
So, so, so for me, I ended up getting my blood drawn to show that I was immune to varicella.

41
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:21,030
And then we do require the flu shot annually at our hospital for everyone who works there.

42
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:34,080
We also require the the pertussis vaccine, which is you guys me know, is there's a combined vaccine that covers tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis.

43
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:40,530
And we require everyone to have at least one dose of that vaccine after the age of 18.

44
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:47,730
And I think Christy is going to go into pertussis a little bit for you guys to learn more about that.

45
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,270
The hepatitis B vaccine.

46
00:04:51,780 --> 00:05:01,380
So hepatitis B is a blood borne virus and vaccination is recommended but usually not required for health care workers who have.

47
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:07,540
Patient care responsibilities. And this is really more to protect the health care worker from the patient.

48
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:16,890
Right. So if you have a patient who has hepatitis B and you're exposed to their blood for some reason that you could potentially acquire hepatitis B,

49
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:23,550
and it actually used to be very common before the head B vaccine was around back in like the 1980s.

50
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:29,370
Before that, it was very common for health care workers to get happy from patients like it was.

51
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:34,380
It was considered sort of like a rite of passage in kind of a kind of weird way.

52
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:42,510
But we really never see that anymore now that people are pretty much universally vaccinated against hepatitis B.

53
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:47,340
We do have occasionally health care workers who are infected with hepatitis B,

54
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:57,030
and we actually have a protocol that we follow for those individuals because there is sort of a slight risk.

55
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:04,019
For example, if if we have a health care worker who's infected with hepatitis B and they're performing surgery on a patient,

56
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:12,030
they cut themselves with a scalpel or something. Potentially the patient could be exposed to their blood and that could pose a risk for the patient.

57
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:15,690
So we do have kind of a monitoring program for those employees.

58
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:23,129
I think right now I could think of we have one nursing student who has hepatitis B and basically he

59
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:29,160
just has to send me his labs every six months to show that his viral load is below a certain level.

60
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,939
Hepatitis B is very common in other parts of the world, not in the United States,

61
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:42,149
because we have universal vaccination now, but it is super common in many parts of the world.

62
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:46,320
So we do occasionally run across health care workers who have happy.

63
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:56,129
And then, of course, the COVID vaccine is required. And it's not just required because the University of Michigan requires it.

64
00:06:56,130 --> 00:07:05,880
It's actually required because it's a federal law that health care workers have to receive the primary COVID vaccine series,

65
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,660
and that's per the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

66
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:18,390
And if you do not follow this regulation, then CMS will not fund your hospital and your hospital will cease to exist.

67
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:25,410
So it is required now. It is also a university requirement, as I'm sure all of you know.

68
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:33,510
That's just for the primary series boosters, that the boosters are required at some hospitals, including ours.

69
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:42,540
And that's, again, not just hospital policy. It's across all of U of M everyone is required to have the primary series in at least one booster.

70
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:51,600
Right now, as you guys, I'm sure you're aware, there is a new booster that just came out last month, which is the Bivalent booster.

71
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:58,800
We're still debating whether or not we're going to require that for our health care workers.

72
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:04,319
There are sort of reasons to required and reasons not to.

73
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:09,480
And I can get into that a little bit later. But anyway, this is our required vaccine as of right now.

74
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:15,239
So this is just a summary of the recommended and required vaccines for health care workers.

75
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,629
We have and I have the administration's schedule on here.

76
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:23,160
This is not something you need to memorize. I do not even know the administration schedule.

77
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:31,620
I look this up but just have sort of a general idea of which vaccines are required and recommended for health care workers.

78
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:37,560
Some of these, like the MMR and varicella vaccine, usually are given in childhood.

79
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:42,600
So probably most of you got those when you were babies. I know I did, except for varicella.

80
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,920
I didn't get that, but you guys probably did. And then the flu shot is given annually.

81
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:52,050
The Tdap, I told you, is usually at least one dose after age 18.

82
00:08:52,980 --> 00:09:01,740
The happy vaccine is a three dose series. It's currently given universally starting at birth start since the 1990s, I think.

83
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:08,910
So most of our kind of younger employees got the vaccine when they were born.

84
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:14,610
But we will occasionally get someone coming in who's never received the happy vaccine before and we can provide that for them.

85
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,980
And then the COVID vaccine, you know,

86
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:23,130
there's like a bunch of different vaccines and they all have sort of different schedules that I'm not going to go into here.

87
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:27,830
So any questions so far? Now.

88
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:33,570
Okay. All right. So just a few words about vaccine exemptions.

89
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:42,180
So we do require all of these vaccines that I went over. But we do allow exemptions for both medical and religious reasons.

90
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:47,490
There are some people who have legitimate medical contraindications to some of

91
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:55,110
these vaccines that may include the perhaps they're immunocompromised or pregnant.

92
00:09:55,350 --> 00:10:00,570
And those individuals could not receive live virus vaccines such as an inner varicella.

93
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:04,469
There are some people who have allergic reactions to vaccines.

94
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:13,170
That's a common one that we've seen with COVID vaccines, because there are certain components of that vaccine that the people may be allergic to.

95
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:18,150
So those are kind of legitimate reasons why people can't get a vaccine.

96
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,729
And so typically,

97
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:28,080
we do accept those those medical exemptions as long as the employee provides some kind of documentation from their health care provider.

98
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,629
We don't just, like, take people's word for it.

99
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:37,440
And a lot of people will say like, oh, my grandmother had an allergic reaction to the flu shot, you know, like in the 1950s.

100
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:43,200
And that doesn't count. It has to be it has to be your own personal medical thing.

101
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,860
So, yes. Do you have a question? Are you okay or don't worry.

102
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:50,960
And then, you know,

103
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:59,760
sometimes we do have to consider whether it's appropriate for health care workers who are not vaccinated to be working with high risk patients.

104
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,209
We obviously in our hospital have a lot of high risk patient populations.

105
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:07,590
We have, you know, bone marrow transplant patients. We have a new natal ICU.

106
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:12,630
And so it's just something to think about, whether it's appropriate for people who are,

107
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,440
you know, potentially high risk to be working with these patients.

108
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:24,360
And then we are also required to provide religious accommodations per the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,

109
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:28,050
which is part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

110
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:36,810
And so if we have employees who say that they cannot receive a vaccine for religious reasons or we are required to honor that,

111
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:43,530
even though there actually are not any religious traditions that prohibit vaccination.

112
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:52,230
But regardless, we have to honor people if they say that their religious tradition does does not allow them to get vaccinated.

113
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,900
And I could give a whole lecture about that, but I won't.

114
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:04,709
So so just some questions to think about which vaccines are usually required, which are recommended,

115
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:10,260
and then some of the valid reasons for exemptions for there from your required immunizations.

116
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:14,920
So those are some things to maybe know forward.

117
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:25,170
And then just to kind of round out the communicable disease and immunization history, in addition to asking people about their immunizations,

118
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:32,820
we also do TB screening for tuberculosis at the time that new employees start working at our hospital.

119
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:40,380
And those who do provide direct patient care typically are required to have a baseline screening for TB when they're hired.

120
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:46,650
And that can consist of either a TB skin test or they can have their blood drawn to look for TB.

121
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:54,450
And many of you guys may have had that test, one of those tests done before, if you've worked in a hospital or other setting, that requires that.

122
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:00,990
We do have a fair number of employees who do have a positive TB screen when they're hired.

123
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,950
It's very common, especially in people born outside of the United States.

124
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:10,020
TB is extremely rare in the U.S., but is very common in other parts of the world.

125
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:18,209
And so for those individuals who do have a positive screen, the vast majority of them have what we call latent TB,

126
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:21,510
meaning they were exposed at some point, but they're not actively infected.

127
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,950
They're not contagious to others.

128
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:31,719
But we do require a symptom check, and those individuals have to have a chest x ray to make sure that they're not working with active pulmonary TB.

129
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:38,220
You're right, that probably makes sense and that we do offer them treatment for latent TB if they haven't received that already.

130
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:45,360
The annual we used to do annual TB screening every year for all of our health care workers.

131
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:52,800
And we kind of stopped doing that a few years ago because the CDC said we didn't have to.

132
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:59,279
And the reason for that is that the yield of doing it TB test on every employee

133
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:04,979
every year is was zero like we did it for decades and found zero cases of TB.

134
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:11,070
So it was like a huge doing 30,000 TB test every year was a huge waste of time and resources.

135
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:16,590
So we do have some populations within our health care workers that we do the annual TB screening,

136
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:25,800
like people who work in the micro lab with TB specimens, and then some of our pulmonary doctors who perform their high risk procedures.

137
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:33,460
They wanted to can. You with the screenings that we said, that was fine. But in total, that's maybe like 50 people instead of 30,000.

138
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:41,290
Can you think of when we might want to do TB screening and a health care worker other than just sort of routinely.

139
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:46,870
Yeah. Possibly they would work with the patient.

140
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:52,410
Yeah. If they had an exposure. Right. And so Kristy's going to talk to you about TB exposures later.

141
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:57,810
But yeah, so that's really the exception to this is we still do post-exposure testing, which makes sense, right?

142
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:06,870
And then hepatitis C and HIV, these are not vaccines are diseases where vaccines are available.

143
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:12,590
But again, there is risk of transmission from healthcare worker to patient.

144
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:21,480
And it's so technically health care workers are supposed to disclose to their employer if they have hep C or HIV.

145
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:26,610
We're not really allowed to like ask people, obviously, because this is very sensitive.

146
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:29,130
We don't like test people routinely for HIV,

147
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:36,960
but technically they are supposed to disclose this since there may be work restrictions that go along with that.

148
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:45,720
It's pretty rare for an employee to have work restrictions related to either of these now because there's effective treatment for both of these.

149
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:55,680
So I think this was much more of a concern, you know, back in like the eighties, nineties, when there was no treatment for HIV or hepatitis C.

150
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:59,910
So just for I. All right.

151
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:07,500
So moving on. So that's kind of our intake that we do. When employees come to work with us at the hospital, we ask them about all those things.

152
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:17,160
And then another big part of what we do in occupational health is exposure prevention and post exposure management.

153
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:25,200
And I talked a lot last semester, and if you guys learn in other settings about exposure to Bloodborne pathogens,

154
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,880
and so I'm not really going to go into that a whole lot,

155
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:38,070
and then you're going to learn a lot more today about exposure to other communicable diseases such as flu, pertussis, TB, etc.

156
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:45,540
I will talk a little bit about COVID exposures. There's not really much to say about that anymore because we don't really do anything about it.

157
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:56,490
But anyway, so exposure prevention is really just using standard precautions, which we learned about earlier this semester,

158
00:16:57,090 --> 00:17:01,590
as well as transmission based precautions, which hopefully you guys remember what those are.

159
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:07,110
And then sharp safety are really the keys to exposure prevention.

160
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:18,540
In that body. Substance exposures, health care personnel who have a body substance exposure should report that to occupational health for evaluation,

161
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,809
and we cover that process in the previous semester.

162
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:29,330
So I'm not going to expect you guys to to know that this this go around and they're not really going to spend a lot of time on it.

163
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:37,160
This is these are just some examples of work restrictions for health care personnel who have communicable diseases.

164
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:40,340
These are just a few examples. There are many others.

165
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:48,800
So for upper respiratory infections or flu like illness, you know, usually you off work until 24 hours fever free.

166
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:54,470
The exception for that is colvera. If you test positive for COVID, we have separate restrictions for that, which I'll tell you about.

167
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:58,639
And the nice thing about the COVID restrictions is they change like every 5 minutes.

168
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:06,740
So that's been really fun, too, to keep up with that. Conjunctivitis or pink eye staff work until your eyes are pink and goopy anymore.

169
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:12,260
A lot of these are sort of like common sense, but you would be surprised. Infectious diarrhea.

170
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:15,260
Obviously, you should stay home until you're not having diarrhea.

171
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,980
When I was a resident or when I was a med student,

172
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:28,940
there was a there was a salmonella outbreak at a not here at a taco place like across in the hospital.

173
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:36,770
And one of the residents I was working with had salmonella and she was like coming to work with like an IV pole hooked up and it was just gone.

174
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:44,000
So anyway, if you have infectious diarrhea, should stay home. There's actually for infectious diarrhea.

175
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:50,630
This is sort of the general rule, but there is actually a stricter rule for people who are food handlers.

176
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:58,730
If they have salmonella or something like that, they actually have to have negative stool cultures in order to return to work.

177
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:00,709
So they have a little bit more stringent requirements,

178
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:06,650
which is probably kind of reassuring to know as someone who eats food in the hospital cafeteria and stuff.

179
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:16,940
Pertussis, stay home until you finish your antibiotics and then MRSA, stay home until, you know, basically till the infection goes away.

180
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:22,099
So we don't want for example, we don't want a surgeon who has like an MRC infection on their hand.

181
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:25,100
We don't want them operating until it, you know, until it heals.

182
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:31,040
And then for measles virus, all the staff work until the rash goes away.

183
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:35,870
So these are not it's not something you have to memorize, but these are a lot of these are sort of common sense, right?

184
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:46,100
If you're sick, you should stay home until you're better. And I think with COVID, we as health care workers have become a lot more cognizant of that.

185
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:52,960
I think before it was like even if you were like at death's door, the expectation was that you would still show up, you would drag yourself into work.

186
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:59,090
But now I think we understand that if we do that, first of all, it's not good for us.

187
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:03,620
It's not good for our patients. It it's putting, you know, putting people at risk.

188
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:10,940
So I just wanted to go over in the last little bit here before I finish up.

189
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:16,220
So in our occupational health department, as you may or may not,

190
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:23,300
you may or may not know that like 90% of our work over the past couple of years has been related to COVID.

191
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:29,330
That basically, like took over everything that we do. And so I wanted to kind of go over that a little bit.

192
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:36,350
These are so these are some of the additional functions that we've kind of taken on related to COVID 19.

193
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:42,919
And a lot of this is is kind of new for us because for the most part,

194
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:49,310
as an occupational health department, we've kind of stayed out of sort of like personal illness.

195
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:53,630
So we managed sort of like work related exposures and injuries.

196
00:20:54,410 --> 00:21:00,390
But for the most part, we haven't managed people sort of personal illnesses that they acquire outside of the hospital.

197
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:04,910
But that really changed with COVID, where we kind of took on that extra work.

198
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:17,030
And so we really have done a ton with employee testing, which I'll get into in more detail providing guidance about quarantine and isolation.

199
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:21,410
And as I mentioned, that guidance changes about every 5 minutes or so.

200
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:25,190
And it's always different whether you're a health care worker or just like a regular person.

201
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:31,490
We've had clusters and outbreaks of COVID in the hospital among employees and patients,

202
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:38,930
and then we also spearheaded the COVID vaccination program at our hospital.

203
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:47,870
So it's been a lot of extra work over the last couple of years and gives me a little bit of PTSD to talk about this, but I'll muddle through here.

204
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,760
So basically, we are in occupational health.

205
00:21:53,360 --> 00:22:02,780
Early on, we kind of took on responsibility for testing employees for COVID and primarily testing

206
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:08,270
symptomatic employees with the idea being that we want to offer testing for those people.

207
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,910
So they can know if they have COVID or not, and then they could at that point decide whether they can work or not.

208
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:24,520
That was really sort of the idea. And we did take our own testing for all you that employees, including Michigan Medicine,

209
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:28,640
Ann Arbor, Flint, Dearborn, the student employees and Health Professions students.

210
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:34,460
And overall, this covers probably about 70 to 80000 people, I would say,

211
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:40,070
who we were kind of responsible for offering COVID testing to those individuals.

212
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:49,640
We do offer primarily PCR testing, and we don't actually do it in our occupational health clinic,

213
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:58,700
which is so our occupational health clinic, for those of you guys who haven't been there, is located like within the hospital.

214
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:04,580
And the idea is that if you're sick and you think you have COVID, you shouldn't be coming into the hospital.

215
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:11,360
And so we offer PCR testing at some of the ambulatory care testing sites.

216
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:17,270
And these are set up as sort of like kind of drive through curbside locations.

217
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:22,130
Right. The idea being that you go there, you get your test and you're not like exposing a million people.

218
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,960
So so these facilities were kind of set up to for that testing.

219
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:33,710
We do have rapid pace. So the turnaround time for standard PCR tests is probably about 24 hours or so.

220
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:41,870
And then we do have rapid PCR testing for our health care workforce members.

221
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:49,580
And the reason for that is, you know, a lot of our health care workers have like very time sensitive work that they may have to do.

222
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:54,260
Maybe they have the sniffles and they're supposed to be operating on patients all day.

223
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:59,900
And they need to know very quickly within like 15 minutes that they have COVID or not if it's safe for them to come to work.

224
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:04,190
So we did set that up for our our hospital employees.

225
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:09,079
And then I'm sure all of you are aware in terms of asymptomatic testing,

226
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:14,090
because a lot of times people they may not have symptoms, but they just want to go get a COVID test.

227
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:19,070
Maybe they're traveling somewhere, you know, whatever reason, maybe they got exposed.

228
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:24,940
So we do have asymptomatic testing that's available through the CSP program.

229
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:31,040
Probably a lot of you guys have used that before where you go spin the little tube and get your result tested you like the next day.

230
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:37,970
That program, as far as I know, will be lasting through the end of this year.

231
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:49,730
But after that, it's sort of up in the air whether that will will continue because the demand for that has plummeted recently.

232
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:53,990
Why do you guys think the demand has plummeted for COVID testing?

233
00:24:54,890 --> 00:25:00,270
Is COVID gone? No. But are they like a big part of.

234
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:03,469
It's probably like people can trust that. Exactly.

235
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:08,240
Yeah. Right. Because I don't know about you guys, but I have like a hundred of those antigen tests,

236
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,590
like stacked up because you keep getting free ones from places and like I have like a million of them at home.

237
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:18,260
So yeah. So where you get to say the same thing, I feel like there's is like burnout people like who get it like I don't want to.

238
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:23,930
Yeah, people don't really care anymore. Right. They're like, I don't know, I don't I want to know if I have COVID.

239
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:28,639
So whereas before people were really, really concerned about it.

240
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,250
But I think the burnout factor is huge.

241
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:42,709
The other thing is that the you guys may or may not be aware that for the unvaccinated employees and students who have an exemption,

242
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:47,090
they used to be required to do the weekly testing and that went away for the semester as well.

243
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:53,359
And that was like a huge percentage of that this year. So I don't know how much longer that program is going to be around.

244
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:59,630
It's really nice, though. It was. It's a nice thing to have. But I think it's I think it's days are probably numbered.

245
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:04,730
We'll see. It's very expensive for the university, as you might imagine.

246
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:14,180
So these are the symptom criteria that we use for our employee COVID testing through occupational health.

247
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:21,950
And, you know, basically all it's saying is that you you know, you have to have some kind of symptoms in order to get tested.

248
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:26,899
So we kind of set that as having one of the following fever, cough,

249
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:32,870
shortness of breath or any two of the following, including like chills, muscle aches, etc.

250
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:38,870
So, so anyway, the way that we have it set up now.

251
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:44,780
So we used to have we used to have employees call us when they needed a COVID test.

252
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:49,160
And that worked okay until January of 2022.

253
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:55,580
And I'll show you a graph in a few minutes about what was going on in January of 2022.

254
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:07,280
But that was the big like a crowd surge. And like we at that point were getting like thousands of phone calls every day with people who had symptoms.

255
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:13,970
Because there was so much COVID at that time. And at that point we were like, we can't we can't do this anymore.

256
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:24,230
So we actually created a sort of a virtual care module through the my U of M health patient portal.

257
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:26,990
And some of you guys may use that if your patients over at U of M.

258
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:33,290
But basically, it allows our employees to go in and they could just click a few buttons and schedule a COVID test for themselves.

259
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:36,739
And that has I don't know why we didn't think of that like two years ago.

260
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:39,820
That would have been amazing, but that's been a huge lifesaver.

261
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:46,120
So basically employees can go in and be like, Yeah, I'm having a fever and they can schedule their COVID test the same day.

262
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:56,550
So it's been that's been really nice. So I just wanted to share a little bit of our, um, employee COVID testing data.

263
00:27:56,570 --> 00:28:04,910
So these are all the results of tests that either of we have ordered in

264
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:09,500
occupational health for employees who were sick or that had been reported to us.

265
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:15,070
So employees are welcome to get tested anywhere. They don't have to get tested through us.

266
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:19,370
They can go to their own doctor, they can take an antigen test at home.

267
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:30,050
But we do ask, especially if they're positive, that they report those results to us and we have a nice little like web link QR code that people can

268
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:36,980
go and just report their tests quickly to us and that way we can provide them with guidance about,

269
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:45,620
you know, what, you know when they can come back to work. And also for sort of a public health standpoint, it's important to know that.

270
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:47,569
So the total number of tests,

271
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:56,219
so this is going back to March of 2020 and this shows the total number of tests that either OHSU has performed or that have been reported to us.

272
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:02,780
So you could see there's we've managed 284,000 test results, which is a lot.

273
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:09,320
And you could see kind of the breakdown of where these tests have been done.

274
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:16,129
Surprisingly, Ann Arbor campus has the largest, followed by University of Michigan Health.

275
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:22,610
Other is Flint and Dearborn, which is a pretty small percentage of med school nursing school for C.

276
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:28,549
And so you could see so that's the total number of tests.

277
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:31,310
The total number of employees tested is lower. Right.

278
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:40,490
So a lot of the employees have had multiple tests that they've reported to us and a lot of employees have had COVID two or three times.

279
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:47,750
And then the total number of positives that we've managed during that time has been 17,000.

280
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:55,010
So that's a lot of a lot of COVID cases. So that's just kind of an overall look at our data.

281
00:29:55,010 --> 00:30:10,100
So this is a graph that shows our tests over time, and I think it's a little bit hard to appreciate some of the the subtleties here.

282
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:21,350
So the the orange line is a positive test and the blue line is negative tests.

283
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:28,100
And you can kind of appreciate, I think, you know, so this is going back to March of 2020.

284
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:36,830
You actually one thing that I think is kind of notable here is that the the testing volume was very low.

285
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:42,500
Why do you guys think that was? Why were we not testing many people in March of 2020?

286
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:49,530
Yeah, there weren't. There were no tests, like, literally none.

287
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:52,800
And it was it was very hard to get people tested.

288
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:59,490
All the testing was done either through the state or the CDC, and they had very strict criteria.

289
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:05,430
You had to have initially it was you had to have traveled to China, which is totally ridiculous.

290
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:13,890
And then they kind of broadened it a little bit more, but it was really basically impossible to get people tested at the beginning of the pandemic.

291
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:18,150
And then you could see that testing started to kind of pick up.

292
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:24,750
And then there was a big kind of surge here in the fall of 2020.

293
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:32,160
It's kind of hard to appreciate the the positive surges here because it looks pretty flat just because there's so much data.

294
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:38,669
But this is the big Omicron surge in sort of like January of 2022.

295
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:47,040
And you could see that that just like blew everything else out of the water in terms of the number of employees who were positive.

296
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:53,849
And then we had another surge kind of in the spring of 2022.

297
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:56,940
And then we've had just kind of these ups and downs since then.

298
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:03,780
So that's that's kind of where we're at right now. It's hard to show you.

299
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:13,560
I think this you can appreciate it a little bit better here, but these are the the positive cases by week again.

300
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,059
So orange is positive. Blue is negative.

301
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:26,550
And so you can appreciate, you know, we kind of had a obviously this was the initial surge and then this was kind of the fall of 2020.

302
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:34,740
But it's really interesting because you look at these previous peaks and they were like really nothing compared to what we saw in January of 2022.

303
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:43,740
And the case number numbers have really been pretty steadily high over the past, you know, past few months.

304
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:49,290
They haven't really maybe kind of going down a little bit here, but it's been pretty steady that we've been seeing,

305
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:56,160
you know, three, four or 500 employee COVID cases per week, you know, which is not insignificant.

306
00:32:57,030 --> 00:33:01,890
And if you think about it, those are all people who are going to be out of the workforce for at least, you know, five days.

307
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:08,520
So still seeing a lot of COVID. So COVID is still the pandemic is not over, unfortunately.

308
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:19,350
But obviously, it's it's more part of regular life now as opposed to something that is causing sort of massive, massive freak out.

309
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:23,810
So this is just a graph showing the percentage of positive tests.

310
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:28,740
So this is sort of the the percent of tests that are done that are positive.

311
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:36,510
You can see this zero is 25%. So initially, the percent that was positive was very high because our testing volume was very low.

312
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:49,680
But you could see even throughout in these kind of big peaks that the percent of of tests that was positive was was very high.

313
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:59,130
It actually remains quite high. And I think a big part of this is there's probably a good amount of reporting bias, right?

314
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:02,220
So people are not going to report a negative.

315
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:08,459
Like if I take an antigen test at home and it's negative, I'm not going to bother to log in to the website and report that.

316
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:12,790
Right. So I think we're seeing a lot more bias toward reporting positive results.

317
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:17,520
So I think that's partly responsible for why the percent positivity is is so high.

318
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:23,450
So anyway. All right.

319
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:27,710
So just a little bit about the guidance that we've been providing for people.

320
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:43,040
So throughout the pandemic, quarantine was really a major public health strategy and the guidance around quarantine has changed very frequently.

321
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:48,110
And really kind of where we are right now is that quarantine is it's not a thing anymore,

322
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:53,840
like quarantine for the general public went away I think months ago.

323
00:34:54,770 --> 00:35:04,400
And the most recent guidance from the CDC on September 23rd got away are basically did away with quarantine for health care workers.

324
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:14,150
So up until September 23rd, we were still requiring our unvaccinated health care workers to quarantine if they had a COVID exposure,

325
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:20,360
meaning that they couldn't come to work for like 7 to 10 days, basically.

326
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:25,550
But with the latest CDC guidance, we've kind of gotten rid of that.

327
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:32,420
And, you know, I think really what we've seen, you know, unfortunately over time,

328
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:39,680
is that the vaccine has remained very effective at preventing severe illness and hospitalization.

329
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:47,270
But it's when you look at the and the odds of getting COVID, whether you're vaccinated or not, it's kind of the same.

330
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:58,159
Now, there may be you know, the vaccine provides a little bit of protection from getting COVID, but but it's really it's kind of equalized over time.

331
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:07,219
And so it just doesn't make sense to have a public health policy where you require certain people to quarantine based on their vaccination status.

332
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:11,750
When vaccination status doesn't seem to play a big role in whether you get COVID or not.

333
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:17,240
So does that make sense to everyone? So I think that's kind of why that that guidance has changed over time.

334
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:23,750
We still do recommend that people get tested following an exposure, especially if they have symptoms, obviously.

335
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:30,530
And the the latest guidance from the CDC is that health care workers,

336
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:38,540
if they have an exposure or should get tested on days one, three and five following the exposure, which is kind of insane.

337
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:42,559
Right. And so basically what we've been telling people is like, hey,

338
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:47,000
if you've got some antigen test lying around at home, feel free to, you know, feel free to use them.

339
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:57,530
You could also use the FTP sites for post-exposure testing, but that's just sort of general guidance that we that we give to people.

340
00:36:57,530 --> 00:37:00,620
So quarantine basically just really isn't a thing anymore.

341
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,990
That's that's kind of gone by the wayside, which I have to say I'm very grateful for,

342
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,980
because it was a huge pain to keep up with all those changing regulations.

343
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:19,040
And then guidance for COVID positive individuals has changed like a million times as well.

344
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:22,849
So what do we tell people now? Well, it really depends, right?

345
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:29,989
So if you're just a regular person who doesn't work in health care, then for the most part,

346
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:37,969
you can discontinue isolation after five days, and then you're supposed to wear a mask for 6 to 10 for health care workers.

347
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:46,610
We have more stringent requirements and we do allow health care workers to return to work after five days.

348
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:53,540
But they have to have a negative antigen test in order to return to work, and that is per CDC guidance.

349
00:37:54,920 --> 00:38:02,660
The thought is that that the antigen test result may correlate somewhat with whether you're contagious or not.

350
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:06,170
We don't really know that for sure because no one has really studied it.

351
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:18,950
But that is the current guidance. Yeah. So the idea of something that you're just like knows a lot of people are like peak symptoms that are negative.

352
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:22,940
Yeah. Yeah. Because the virus is kind of mutated.

353
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:29,630
Yes. Should there be guidance there?

354
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:36,530
There should be, probably, but there hasn't been. It seems like the CDC is always a few months behind.

355
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:42,200
Yeah. So so yeah. But that's that's what we're doing right now.

356
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:48,630
But yeah, there I think there is some thought that the antigen tests may not be quite as accurate with such reluctance.

357
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:51,690
So to have like only 30%. Yikes. That's so.

358
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:58,910
Yeah. But so the interesting thing though is that what we're seeing so we allow our health care workers so we say,

359
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:04,550
all right, you got to, you know, at least staff for at least five days, take an antigen test on day five.

360
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:08,600
And if it's negative, you can come back to work on day six.

361
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:17,150
Well, we're still seeing that about like 60% of people are positive at five and then it kind of drops down from there.

362
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:21,680
I had someone recently and I told her, stop taking antigen test, but she kept doing the.

363
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:26,100
And she was positive for like 21 days. It's like, just stop, stop doing them.

364
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:32,700
And so anyway, if they're still if they're still testing positive after like seven days,

365
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:36,480
we're just like, all right, you just have to stay off for ten days and then you can come back.

366
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:44,640
So it is kind of interesting. If you look at the guidance for the general public, it says you can you can take an antigen test if you want,

367
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:48,180
which is it's kind of silly because people are going to be like, you know,

368
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:52,050
no one's going to look at that and, you know, actually want to do that for the most part.

369
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:59,759
So anyway, so this is what we're doing right now. This may change in the next next few weeks, months, whatever.

370
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,920
But this is the current the current guidance.

371
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:13,500
I think eventually we'll probably get to the point where COVID is just like any other cold whenever where you just stay home until you feel better.

372
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:17,639
I think eventually we'll get there and we'll do away with all this testing.

373
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:26,490
But for right now, this is where we're at. And then for people who are immunocompromised, they may shed virus for longer.

374
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:32,940
So sometimes they have to isolate for a longer period of time. So we have a kind of a different protocol for employees who are immunocompromised.

375
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:38,790
We have them do an antigen test on day ten. Actually, you know, they have to do I don't know who came up with this.

376
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:46,260
It wasn't my idea. They have to take antigen tests on day ten and 11, and if they're negative, they can come back to work on day 12.

377
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,600
So so that's something that I think the Health Department came up with.

378
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,859
So anyway, this is where we're at right now with our COVID isolation.

379
00:40:55,860 --> 00:41:03,960
So just real quick. We have seen numerous clusters and outbreaks of COVID among our employees since March of 2020.

380
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:10,680
Typically what we've seen is that these have been associated with prolonged, unmasked contact between employees.

381
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:16,260
For example, everyone's eating lunch together in a crowded break room on the unit.

382
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:22,050
A lot of them have been related to socializing outside of work, like weddings and things like that.

383
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:31,230
And then they bring it back to work and and continue kind of a spread within their their, you know, unit wherever they work.

384
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:38,410
We have had occasional transmission, we think, from patient to employee and vice versa, employee to patient.

385
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:41,880
So I'll just give an example.

386
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:50,310
This is actually from last year, but we've had many kind of similar outbreaks on inpatient units in different areas in the hospital.

387
00:41:50,850 --> 00:42:00,570
So this is from last year. We had one of our inpatient units had 15 employees who tested positive for COVID over a relatively short period of time.

388
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:07,860
It turns out most of those people were vaccinated so that, you know, vaccination status didn't really seem to play a role here.

389
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:15,510
All of them ended up being symptomatic, which means that some of them probably came to work,

390
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:19,170
at least for a period of time while they were having symptoms, before they got tested.

391
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:24,150
And then, unfortunately, as a result of this on that unit, we did have five patients who.

392
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:33,630
So we still test all of our patients for COVID when they're admitted to the hospital just for sort of, you know, placement, isolation purposes.

393
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:43,890
And unfortunately, there were five patients who did not have COVID when they came into the hospital who got COVID in our hospital.

394
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:46,340
And this is something that we have seen.

395
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:54,060
We actually just had an outbreak like a few weeks ago on one of our units that was very similar to this is very unfortunate.

396
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:58,470
So it just goes to show that this you know, it is a very contagious virus.

397
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:11,460
And, hey, Christi, I'm just finishing up. And, you know, we just I think we always just have to be sort of cognizant that these things can happen.

398
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:19,170
So our response to this outbreak was reinforcement of our infection prevention measures, making sure people are masking when they're supposed to.

399
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:24,870
So unlike the rest of the world, you still in you guys know this because you're over there doing your hand hygiene observations.

400
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:31,140
You still have to wear a mask everywhere in the hospital. We did lots of testing for unit employees and patients.

401
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:39,510
We actually had this big stockpile of antigen tests that we were able to drop off for you to an employee so they could test themselves,

402
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:48,329
did testing of patients. And in this outbreak, actually, the unit ended up being closed to new admissions, which is a huge deal for our hospital,

403
00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:55,230
because we're always bursting at the seams in terms of needing to to meeting places to put people.

404
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:00,330
So this this outbreak, of course, it did end up ending just as all outbreaks do.

405
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:06,420
But it just shows you that what can happen and Christi knows, we just this is from last year,

406
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:10,559
but we had an outbreak just like this a couple of weeks ago on one of our inpatient units.

407
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:17,130
So unfortunately, it keeps happening and I don't think there's any end in sight.

408
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:21,630
And then we led the initial vaccination effort.

409
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:26,890
Because as you guys probably recall, who was eligible to get the vaccine first it was health care workers, right?

410
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:33,459
So we ended up leading the vaccination effort and we still offer the Pfizer vaccine to our employees.

411
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:36,460
And just a little plug to get your baby in the booster if you haven't already.

412
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:45,430
All right. So quick summary. Occupational health programs play an integral role in protecting health care workers and patients.

413
00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:50,930
And then immunizations in exposure management are really a vital part of that process.

414
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:57,670
And then we talked about sort of the additional functions that we have taken on during the pandemic.

415
00:44:58,450 --> 00:45:02,470
So I'm going to go ahead and and you guys have any questions for me before we move on.

416
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:08,780
No. You're good. Okay. I am going to hand it off.

417
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:16,060
To Christie at this point. And maybe I'll have you.

418
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:24,080
Do you want to like. Is there, like, a good stopping point where you can give them a break for, like, five or 10 minutes or for sure?

419
00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:30,100
Okay. What time do they usually like? Well, we're here for 3 hours, so, like, halfway through would be okay?

420
00:45:30,850 --> 00:45:35,980
Yeah, absolutely. Would that be okay? Yeah. All right. You guys are just going to push through.

421
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:40,510
All right. Good. Oh, yeah, for sure. On 1030 on, we'll just kind of.

422
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:44,980
Okay. Sounds good. All right. Well, I'll let you go ahead and introduce yourself to everyone.

423
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:53,500
Hi, everyone. My name is Christie Scipione. I am a see here 2004 graduate of the H me program here.

424
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:58,270
I worked in infection prevention from 2004 until 2015.

425
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:01,870
Here I was off for about five years.

426
00:46:01,870 --> 00:46:05,649
I had twins and life got a little bit weird for a while.

427
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:15,430
And then two months before the COVID pandemic, I went back to work in a small hospital on the East Side,

428
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:25,270
which was a giant mistake because all of a sudden my kids who were in school and I was homeless now were home and I had to be at work and whatnot.

429
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:31,660
And so but given that so much has changed with the pandemic in terms of what you can do virtually, I live on the east side.

430
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:37,179
I came back to infection prevention in November of last year, which it's been wonderful to be back.

431
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:42,280
So I am what my title is as communicable disease epidemiologist.

432
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:47,560
And so when I transitioned back, I'm doing most of the communicable disease exposures.

433
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:56,860
Technically, I'm only part time. But given the the surges we keep having with COVID, it's it's never really a part time gig anymore.

434
00:46:56,860 --> 00:47:01,209
So today I'll go through a couple of different.

435
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:08,110
I think what we'll do today is I'm going to do an overview of sort of how we do our, our communicable disease exposures.

436
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:14,800
I have three organisms we're going to talk about pertussis, pulmonary TB and then varicella.

437
00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:17,830
And then whenever there's a good stopping point,

438
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:25,420
we'll take a little break and then we'll pick up and then Kerry is coming after I'm done to do a a PPE lecture.

439
00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:31,990
So so when we have exposures in the hospital or in the outpatient setting,

440
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:37,060
it's because we have a patient that's not known to have a communicable disease.

441
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:40,780
So we don't do this for all communicable diseases.

442
00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:52,270
It's just a select group that would have either testing or recommended quarantine or possible treatment that we would do something,

443
00:47:52,270 --> 00:47:58,360
for example, just like an upper respiratory infection. That would not be something that we would do a communicable disease exposure for.

444
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:06,100
So this happens when we don't know that they have it and they come into the hospital and we don't manage them with the appropriate isolation.

445
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:13,270
And in a few slides, I'll talk about what different different types of transmission based precautions we use for different organisms.

446
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:19,120
And so what happens is that people aren't wearing the appropriate personal protective equipment.

447
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:24,459
And so then that leads to exposures to staff, to patients, and then to other visitors.

448
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:32,290
And so when this happens, we do exposure investigations and follow up and that's primarily what I do and that that will result in

449
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:38,409
either prophylaxis or symptom monitoring or follow up testing and in certain situations quarantine as well.

450
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:44,140
So like I said, we're going to do the top three. These are all the diseases that we typically do exposure follow ups for.

451
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:53,200
I will say that most the most frequent disease on this list that we do a follow up for is COVID 19.

452
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:59,739
Not surprising. We mostly we mostly just recommend testing, though, after.

453
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:08,170
And so today we're going to go through three, three organisms that potentially have a little bit more to it than just you've been exposed.

454
00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:17,110
We recommend that you test yourself for COVID. My least favorite on here is probably also the least serious of them all is scabies.

455
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:24,610
People can be exposed to terrifying things in the hospital, but if you say that somebody has life or that somebody has scabies,

456
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:29,980
it is a full on sort of freak out by everybody that has been even anywhere near the unit.

457
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,080
But we won't do escapees today.

458
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:41,140
So in terms of the diseases and how they are spread, so this is really important to know because when we have exposures to these diseases,

459
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:46,750
we look to see what were people wearing when they cared for the patient and if they

460
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:51,580
weren't wearing the appropriate PPE for whatever transmission based isolation they're in,

461
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:58,270
then that would equal in certain situations, depending on how long they cared for the patient, it would lead to an exposure.

462
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:05,890
So for respiratory isolation. So these are diseases that are spread by their airborne spread.

463
00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:09,759
They're very small, they're spread by just even talking and breathing.

464
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:13,510
So patients that are in isolation, respiratory.

465
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:20,040
Isolation. They get put into a negative pressure isolation room so that the sort of the badness is kept within the room.

466
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:29,700
And then you you being the health care worker or whatnot that enters the room, would be wearing either an N95 respirator mask or a paper.

467
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:35,310
And so this is what we do for pulmonary tuberculosis. This is also what we do.

468
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:40,890
If you have chickenpox or if you have disseminated shingles.

469
00:50:40,890 --> 00:50:44,520
And so both of both of those fall under the varicella umbrella.

470
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:48,600
Now, contact precautions. You'll see varicella is on here twice.

471
00:50:49,050 --> 00:50:52,950
So varicella has really two, 2 to 3 ways of spread.

472
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:58,830
It's contact and then it's droplet airborne. And so you sort of always default to the highest level.

473
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:04,919
So if you have either chickenpox or disseminated shingles, you would also require contact precautions.

474
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:11,440
And that's thinking about the skin and possibly touching the rash or the vesicles if you have shingles.

475
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:15,600
So it's both airborne spread and then also contact spread.

476
00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:19,530
And then pertussis. Pertussis is droplet precautions.

477
00:51:19,530 --> 00:51:26,250
And so that spread, those are larger respiratory droplets and those are spread primarily from coughing and from sneezing.

478
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:32,940
And so for droplet precautions rooms, you wear a regular mask inside of the room.

479
00:51:32,970 --> 00:51:39,870
Eye protection. And then also gowns and gloves in the event that there's contamination from respiratory secretions.

480
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:46,570
So why do exposures happen? Well, there are a variety of reasons.

481
00:51:47,110 --> 00:51:50,620
Sometimes it's because symptoms are vague or unusual for the disease.

482
00:51:51,130 --> 00:51:57,800
A couple of examples here are pertussis in adults. Many times pertussis in adults looks different than kids.

483
00:51:57,820 --> 00:52:03,280
A lot of times kids will have a classic wound to their to their cough, whereas many times adults do not get that.

484
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:09,190
Also, COVID 19. I think that given the spectrum of symptoms you can have.

485
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:11,889
There are certainly people that come in with perhaps,

486
00:52:11,890 --> 00:52:18,010
maybe not the most consistent presentation that we're used to seeing for COVID 19 that are then identified to have COVID 19.

487
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:25,180
There are diseases that are maybe rare is not the word, but not quite as common that are not always considered like measles, mumps.

488
00:52:25,870 --> 00:52:29,109
There are also emergency situations like meningococcal meningitis.

489
00:52:29,110 --> 00:52:37,540
So many times when patients come to the ED for meningococcal disease, they are very sick and it is an emergent situation.

490
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:43,779
And so health care workers are actively performing patient care and many times

491
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:49,050
the appropriate PPE is not always sort of the forethought in their mind.

492
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:51,220
They are more concerned about the patient themselves.

493
00:52:51,850 --> 00:53:00,310
There are also issues like process failures, like if isolation is ordered, let's say, in one unit, but they're not communicated into another unit.

494
00:53:01,030 --> 00:53:06,639
The way that we have our our patient chart and our the epic that we use,

495
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:15,550
a lot of times this is solved because we've been given flags and headers so that people anywhere a patient travels within the hospital system,

496
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:21,010
whether it's there on an inpatient floor or the ED, and then let's say they go to radiology for a procedure.

497
00:53:21,370 --> 00:53:26,409
Anybody that looks at that patient's chart should be aware that the patient is in that type of isolation.

498
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:31,120
So we don't have to worry as much as we used to about the communication piece.

499
00:53:31,450 --> 00:53:36,489
But there are times, especially when a patient comes into the ED, when perhaps maybe they're managing the precautions,

500
00:53:36,490 --> 00:53:39,940
but they don't actually put the physical, they don't actually put the order in.

501
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:47,620
And so then the patient might travel somewhere. And the the department that gets them isn't aware that the patient is in isolation precautions.

502
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:57,100
And that's when there's that process failure. There are several important components that we look for when we're doing these exposure workups.

503
00:53:57,490 --> 00:53:59,860
The first one is the method of spread,

504
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:05,440
because the method of spread will help us determine what type of PPE that you should be wearing inside of the room.

505
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:12,720
The incubation for the disease is also very important to know because that will help us when a person is exposed,

506
00:54:13,030 --> 00:54:19,960
when we need to start being concerned that they may have symptoms or sort of what our window may be for prophylaxis.

507
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:25,710
There's the communicable period, which is an important component because we need to look to see,

508
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:28,720
okay, if a person has been communicable for X number of days,

509
00:54:29,290 --> 00:54:36,009
then we need to look to see where they've traveled within the system and where they may have potentially exposed someone,

510
00:54:36,010 --> 00:54:43,630
a health care worker or another patient. And then also to the susceptibility of those people that are exposed in certain situations.

511
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:47,889
If you're immune, then there's really nothing else to do. In other situations.

512
00:54:47,890 --> 00:54:54,510
We do post-exposure prophylaxis or symptom monitoring, regardless of what your immunity is.

513
00:54:56,740 --> 00:55:08,979
There's sort of a certain sort of order that we go into when we're notified that a patient is thought to or is confirmed to have a disease,

514
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:14,680
that we would do an exposure workup for. The first thing, and this is the most important is to contain the infection.

515
00:55:15,070 --> 00:55:21,129
And this is most important, obviously, if the patient is currently an inpatient in the hospital.

516
00:55:21,130 --> 00:55:25,090
So the damage has already been done for the people that are already exposed.

517
00:55:25,090 --> 00:55:31,719
And so it's important to get them isolated right away. And then you can deal with the the people that have already been exposed.

518
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:39,070
But to prevent future exposures. Now, if it's a patient that, let's say, came to an outpatient appointment, then they're already home.

519
00:55:39,070 --> 00:55:42,160
And you're really just dealing with the people that were exposed during the appointment.

520
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:51,070
And there are also situations to where we'll possibly get a call like, well, we're concerned that this patient may have TB.

521
00:55:51,070 --> 00:55:53,799
We don't know that for certain. Yeah, but we're concerned about it.

522
00:55:53,800 --> 00:56:00,130
Well, we'll always have somebody preemptively isolate because we can take them out of isolation if it turns out that they don't have TB.

523
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:06,400
But if you delay getting them isolated and that's all of those health care workers and other people that may be exposed.

524
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:11,740
The second thing we do is that we try to confirm the diagnosis or the suspicion of disease.

525
00:56:12,130 --> 00:56:16,030
Now, this can be either lab confirmed or a clinical diagnosis.

526
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:20,290
Like, for example, we'll get to I'll we'll sort of go over each of these.

527
00:56:20,290 --> 00:56:25,690
But for something like pertussis, we would typically wait for there to be someone maybe suspicious for pertussis,

528
00:56:26,110 --> 00:56:29,139
but we would usually probably wait for laboratory confirmation before we didn't

529
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:33,580
exposure workup given that and that post-exposure antibiotics are involved

530
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:37,419
where something that's pretty more common like shingles that's something that

531
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:41,830
we would use a clinical diagnosis of when we're doing the exposure workup.

532
00:56:42,790 --> 00:56:50,319
And then from there we collect facts. So the medical record has made doing exposure workup so much easier than it used to be.

533
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:58,660
When I started doing infection prevention, there were it's it's not that there weren't online medical records somewhat available.

534
00:56:58,990 --> 00:57:07,120
Some was still being done in the paper chart. But if you were to try to figure out, let's say, where a patient went or who cared for them,

535
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:13,900
all of that would need to be done based on essentially walking over to the unit and talking with the unit leadership to say,

536
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:16,930
okay, who worked this day? Who may have been over here?

537
00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:21,280
And then there were all the possibly the ancillary staff that wasn't you wouldn't even know about,

538
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:26,919
like the environmental services crew that comes to clean the room, the food nutrition people that come to drop off the food trays.

539
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:35,320
So trying to just figure out who may have cared for the patient or been in any kind of interaction with the patient's room was very challenging.

540
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:42,190
Now, it's it's so much easier now because not only can we see what is called sort of the treatment team,

541
00:57:42,610 --> 00:57:45,790
which is really most people that have cared for the patients,

542
00:57:46,090 --> 00:57:53,110
it doesn't include, like I mentioned, the Environmental and Environmental Services crew or that or the food nutrition crew.

543
00:57:53,800 --> 00:58:00,430
But it will also tell you things that maybe weren't always as easily apparent, like perhaps they came to the E.D. today,

544
00:58:00,430 --> 00:58:06,820
but yesterday they went to a lab draw station, or yesterday they went to an outpatient radiology site and had a chest X-ray done.

545
00:58:07,270 --> 00:58:14,770
Those things are now much easier for us to identify so that we're appropriately capturing everybody that needs to be captured.

546
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:23,740
So we look for just all sort of the basics, the appointment dates, the date of symptom onset, who was exposed.

547
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:28,960
For every scenario, we always look at staff and then we always look at patients and sometimes the visitors as well.

548
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:35,380
And then take each of those pieces to say, okay, does this group meet the exposure criteria?

549
00:58:35,890 --> 00:58:41,410
And so we do this for all visits that would happen during the communicable period.

550
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:47,470
So if if we decide that, okay, we do indeed have an exposure workup that we have to do,

551
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:52,670
the staff exposure workup piece is usually a little bit more seamless.

552
00:58:52,690 --> 00:59:00,309
Occupational health is we work closely with them and they're very good at streamlining the

553
00:59:00,310 --> 00:59:04,810
process for really if staff were to need some type of work restriction or prophylaxis,

554
00:59:05,290 --> 00:59:09,220
things are usually much messier. If there are patient exposures.

555
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:13,450
If the patient is still hospitalized, then we can work with the team there.

556
00:59:13,810 --> 00:59:15,610
Once a patient has left the hospital, though,

557
00:59:15,610 --> 00:59:21,759
that then becomes even more complicated because sometimes getting in touch with them is not easy or trying

558
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:26,980
to convey the information that either testing has done or possibly prophylaxis would be recommended.

559
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:32,200
So first responders and outside hospital are also another.

560
00:59:32,530 --> 00:59:38,530
It's another piece of people that we need to convey information to because they don't know unless we tell them.

561
00:59:38,530 --> 00:59:44,829
And so many times somebody will be at an outside hospital and they are not known to have, you know, sad disease.

562
00:59:44,830 --> 00:59:51,190
They come here, they are diagnosed with said disease. Well, there is no way to communicate that information unless we physically tell them and

563
00:59:51,190 --> 00:59:55,150
so that they can then do their own appropriate exposure evaluation if necessary.

564
00:59:55,950 --> 01:00:04,020
First responders are also another group. The EMS crew or survival flight or whatnot that we would typically communicate to as well.

565
01:00:04,290 --> 01:00:09,990
With the COVID pandemic, they most of the time are always wearing at least a mask.

566
01:00:10,410 --> 01:00:16,410
But depending on the disease, they would possibly not be wearing the correct mask so often and 95% needed.

567
01:00:16,410 --> 01:00:18,330
They might only be wearing just a regular mask.

568
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:27,600
And then public health, depending on whether that is a laboratory confirmation or a clinical diagnosis we have,

569
01:00:27,990 --> 01:00:30,540
that will go if it's laboratory, you go straight to the health department.

570
01:00:30,540 --> 01:00:34,889
If we have something that we are diagnosing, that would be like a clinical diagnosis.

571
01:00:34,890 --> 01:00:38,640
And then we would also have to sort of actually tell the health department about that.

572
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:46,589
Once we finish up making sure that we've identified everybody, communicated to them, everybody sort of has gotten what they need.

573
01:00:46,590 --> 01:00:49,260
Then we go and we do the last pieces of the root cause.

574
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:55,350
And that's just trying to figure out what went wrong here and what can we do to try not to have this happen again in the future.

575
01:00:56,310 --> 01:01:00,090
The the steps that we take are for exposure.

576
01:01:00,090 --> 01:01:09,320
WORKUPS are mostly the same. What differs is sort of the detail, whether it's testing versus prophylaxis versus, you know,

577
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:13,860
the way in which the organism is spread, which makes each exposure work up a little bit unique.

578
01:01:14,610 --> 01:01:22,500
So we'll start with pertussis. So pertussis is caused by border delta pertussis, the method of spread is droplet.

579
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:29,640
And so as a reminder to that, that is wearing a regular mask inside of the room with eye protection gowns and gloves.

580
01:01:30,210 --> 01:01:37,650
The incubation period is 4 to 21 days, but it's usually around a week to ten days, the contagious period.

581
01:01:37,710 --> 01:01:45,600
So when you are able to give somebody else, pertussis is during active disease and five days after you start appropriate treatment.

582
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:49,290
And I have a slide a second that I'll talk a little bit more about the cumulative ability.

583
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:56,550
So in terms of susceptibility, if you are not immunized, then obviously you are susceptible.

584
01:01:56,640 --> 01:02:04,620
But if we do have a pertussis exposure workup that we need to do, your vaccination status does not matter.

585
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:12,389
We will still do a post-exposure prophylaxis even if you are vaccinated because of waning immunity and then isolation.

586
01:02:12,390 --> 01:02:15,000
The type of transmission based precaution that you use,

587
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:21,930
that would be the droplet precautions and that's for five days until they've been on treatment.

588
01:02:21,930 --> 01:02:25,799
And that goes with kind of in line with what the contagious period is.

589
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:30,630
So you're not contagious. And so that after five days and so that's when you can stop the isolation.

590
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:36,540
So this is a nice sort of outline for what the disease progression looks like.

591
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:40,530
The first stage, the lateral stage that lasts for 1 to 2 weeks.

592
01:02:40,530 --> 01:02:44,340
And one thing that I think is important to notice about this is there's two things.

593
01:02:44,730 --> 01:02:46,950
One is that this is when you're most contagious,

594
01:02:47,310 --> 01:02:54,389
this is also when your symptoms sound kind of like any other upper respiratory infection that you could have a runny nose,

595
01:02:54,390 --> 01:03:00,330
low grade fever, occasionally coughing. So it's easy to see how many people when they're very contagious.

596
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:06,240
It may be missed and people would possibly not be isolated as they should be.

597
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:13,440
This second stage, the proximal stage that lasts from 1 to 6 weeks, usually it can go up to ten weeks.

598
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:17,370
This is when, at least for kids, sometimes you start to have the more classic loop.

599
01:03:17,370 --> 01:03:22,859
So this may be when if you've gone to the doctor two times for an upper respiratory infection,

600
01:03:22,860 --> 01:03:26,669
and finally you get to that stage where you're looking more clinically concerning,

601
01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:30,900
like, oh, this sounds more like, you know, a pertussis cough where they may test you.

602
01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:33,810
And then the last stage is the recovery stage.

603
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:43,890
So when we talk about exposures for staff for pertussis, this is somebody who has close contact with somebody who's confirmed to have pertussis,

604
01:03:44,610 --> 01:03:51,390
is not wearing a mask and fits any of the criteria where they have direct face to face contact for 10 minutes.

605
01:03:51,930 --> 01:03:58,589
They are sharing a space in close proximity for greater than an hour or they're doing a close contact activity.

606
01:03:58,590 --> 01:04:04,260
I won't read all these, but these are all, you know, performing an exam, really doing patient care.

607
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:17,010
So I will say that we have not since I have been back, I have yet to have a positive pertussis, but the use of universal masking now has made I mean,

608
01:04:17,010 --> 01:04:23,850
it's really changed sort of everything in terms of pertussis exposures because everybody is wearing a mask now.

609
01:04:23,850 --> 01:04:32,570
And so my goal is that I would actually like to see masks are always worn for when we're when you're when you go to, you know,

610
01:04:32,690 --> 01:04:39,450
an outpatient appointment or in the hospital, because it really is doing a lot besides for the the spread of COVID,

611
01:04:39,450 --> 01:04:41,520
it's it's helping us some other things out as well.

612
01:04:43,770 --> 01:04:50,759
When we talk about patients and visitors, this is when things kind of get a little bit dicier because in our pediatric hospital,

613
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:55,860
we have mostly private rooms, which is great in our adult hospital.

614
01:04:55,930 --> 01:05:03,880
We have mostly shared rooms, which is less great because if you share a room with somebody that may have pertussis,

615
01:05:04,810 --> 01:05:10,270
then that is sort of challenging because even though patients are recommended to wear masks all the time,

616
01:05:10,690 --> 01:05:15,880
if you're in the hospital for whatever period of time, you're you're probably not sleeping in a mask.

617
01:05:15,890 --> 01:05:21,070
Some people are, maybe, but there are large periods of time where you're sharing a room and people aren't masked.

618
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:25,780
If you're also cared for health care workers with pertussis, I,

619
01:05:26,290 --> 01:05:35,320
I would take like 20 patient exposures any day over a positive health care worker with anything just because it's always so messy.

620
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:39,729
They're interacting with other health care workers, unmasked many of the times, break rooms.

621
01:05:39,730 --> 01:05:45,850
They're interacting with patients. They're caring for high risk patients that we have to be really thoughtful about.

622
01:05:46,930 --> 01:05:56,440
Sometimes mask compliance, as we've learned with some of our COVID COVID unit outbreaks are perhaps, maybe not ideal in certain situations.

623
01:05:57,340 --> 01:06:01,989
There are other scenarios and this applies more to pediatrics.

624
01:06:01,990 --> 01:06:07,720
But if you're having like people playing together and this would be like two kids playing together in a waiting room,

625
01:06:08,290 --> 01:06:12,040
working up waiting rooms is always a little bit tough.

626
01:06:12,550 --> 01:06:15,970
Sometimes we're able to do it, sometimes we're not able to do it.

627
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:22,390
If they were together for 10 minutes, then greater than 10 minutes for a ptosis, we we would try to work them up.

628
01:06:22,810 --> 01:06:29,980
If you think about places like I don't know if anybody here has been to the emergency department in the last, I don't know, a year or two years.

629
01:06:30,490 --> 01:06:36,370
But it's it's it's jam packed. And these waiting rooms are kind of overfilling.

630
01:06:36,370 --> 01:06:42,040
And mass compliance, I'm sure, is sometimes, you know, questionable with certain with certain people.

631
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:45,760
And so waiting rooms can be a big challenge for some of these.

632
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:50,500
All right. So what kind of walk through one and how will do this?

633
01:06:50,950 --> 01:06:54,519
Well, we'll talk about the scenario and then we'll talk about each question.

634
01:06:54,520 --> 01:07:01,480
And as much participation as anybody would like to give, then that would be great or else I can just help us walk through them.

635
01:07:01,780 --> 01:07:02,829
So the first one is Eric.

636
01:07:02,830 --> 01:07:13,389
He's a three year old who presents to the pediatric Ed from home with his mom on May 14th at 7:53 a.m. So he's had a two week history of coughing.

637
01:07:13,390 --> 01:07:25,360
He knows low grade fever. He man tells the Ed that he was seen by his pediatrician ten days earlier, on May 4th for a viral upper respiratory illness.

638
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:32,710
So the Ed sees like, okay, he has respiratory symptoms and they immediately place him into a room,

639
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:35,710
which that was the part that they did that was great.

640
01:07:36,220 --> 01:07:42,129
The part that was less great was that they did not initiate isolation and staff were not wearing masks.

641
01:07:42,130 --> 01:07:48,640
So let's pretend as we walk through these these outbreak, these exposures are less interesting if what the universal masking.

642
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:53,470
So we're just going to pretend that this happens pre-COVID. So and it's surprising.

643
01:07:53,710 --> 01:07:57,190
I mean, nobody would wear a mask pre-COVID.

644
01:07:57,370 --> 01:08:03,549
I mean, we would have these these sometimes these exposures where you would think, oh, certainly somebody would want to throw a mask on for this.

645
01:08:03,550 --> 01:08:08,530
And nobody really ever masked very frequently before COVID.

646
01:08:08,530 --> 01:08:14,170
And so they were not wearing masks in this situation. So they were roomed, but isolation wasn't ordered.

647
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:17,680
The ED physicians do a physical exam of the nose and mouth.

648
01:08:18,070 --> 01:08:21,309
They think it's probably an asthma exacerbation from the viral illness,

649
01:08:21,310 --> 01:08:25,990
but they decide to order a pertussis swab in addition to ordering the viral respiratory swab.

650
01:08:26,590 --> 01:08:31,780
So he's admitted from the emergency room and goes up to a pediatric general care floor.

651
01:08:32,230 --> 01:08:36,910
So there's no documentation at this point that the droplet precautions were initiated by the ED.

652
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:43,629
He's admitted to a private room, which is great news in the inpatient setting on the 14th around 10 p.m.

653
01:08:43,630 --> 01:08:44,710
So you know,

654
01:08:44,740 --> 01:08:51,220
he got to the ED around 7:53 a.m. and is now going up to the floor at 10 p.m. So he spent almost an entire day in the emergency department.

655
01:08:52,570 --> 01:08:57,430
The next day at 10 a.m. on the 15th, somebody thinks, well, maybe we should order droplet precautions.

656
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:05,800
Really, the moment that they they thought about testing him for pertussis, that should have been a sort of a light bulb that,

657
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:10,360
wow, if we think that this could possibly be something, let's get that isolation ordered.

658
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:18,040
Because if you look at when the swab was ordered, you could have saved yourself, you know, nearly a day where they weren't in isolation.

659
01:09:18,790 --> 01:09:24,490
So finally they the next day, somebody decides to order droplet precautions and staff began they began masking.

660
01:09:25,270 --> 01:09:33,250
The pertussis is confirmed that night and he started on treatment and then we are notified of it via our reports that we typically get the next day.

661
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:36,280
So this is just like a little timeline to kind of keep in mind.

662
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:42,220
I have a couple repeats of this so that we can think about this as we are doing our exposure workup.

663
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:47,950
So these are all of the questions that we will go through. So the first one, this is the method of spread.

664
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:54,350
Does anybody know what the method of spread here is for pertussis? Droplet?

665
01:09:54,590 --> 01:10:04,160
Yes. Very good. So these pertussis is spread, mostly coughing, sneezing, respiratory droplets, large, you know, larger droplets.

666
01:10:04,170 --> 01:10:09,500
And so as a reminder for droplet precautions, this is when you wear a regular mask,

667
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:12,980
eye protection and then gowns and gloves when you're entering the room.

668
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:20,960
So we get this lab result. What is the first thing that we want to do when we find out that a patient has pertussis?

669
01:10:22,130 --> 01:10:26,140
This is like the first thing before we do anything else.

670
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:31,420
Just throw anything out there. Yeah.

671
01:10:32,630 --> 01:10:37,040
Perfect. So, yes, that is always the first thing is that we want to get them isolated.

672
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:41,090
The damage has already been done. So let's make sure we get them isolated.

673
01:10:41,090 --> 01:10:45,919
And then after they're isolated, we can deal with everything else that's already happened.

674
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:51,950
And so we get the patient into droplet precautions. So next is determining the duration of contagiousness.

675
01:10:52,490 --> 01:10:58,100
And I think that we can that we can all agree based on this timeline,

676
01:10:58,100 --> 01:11:06,139
that since the contagiousness is four from the start of symptoms until five days after treatment,

677
01:11:06,140 --> 01:11:13,700
that Eric's entire entire interaction with the hospital, he's considered to be contagious.

678
01:11:14,450 --> 01:11:21,020
The piece that we don't know yet is is that do we literally need to work up every single moment and every single visit that he's had?

679
01:11:21,140 --> 01:11:30,320
So that's that's the next piece we have. So what do people think about the encounters that we need to evaluate for exposure?

680
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:36,460
Do people think that there's a visit to the pediatrician?

681
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:44,060
Is that something that we would need to assess for exposure investigation that can most people agree that?

682
01:11:44,210 --> 01:11:48,200
Probably, yes. Right. Because his symptoms started on the first.

683
01:11:48,740 --> 01:11:56,240
And as far as we know, when he went to the pediatrician, they they what we don't really know at this point,

684
01:11:56,240 --> 01:11:59,450
but we need to investigate whether he was managed appropriately.

685
01:12:01,070 --> 01:12:05,120
And the next piece is is when he arrives to the emergency department.

686
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:10,990
And so I would say that we could probably also agree that his entire.

687
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,650
Yes, I was going to ask. Yeah.

688
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:21,500
If if the patient went to a pediatrician that was like unaffiliated with your role, would you alert that pediatrician or like.

689
01:12:22,970 --> 01:12:24,920
Yeah. So I that's a great question.

690
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:33,500
And I would say any time that we have the knowledge that they went to a place and we were able to contact them, we absolutely would.

691
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:38,959
I mean, certainly, I don't think like we interview like we wouldn't we wouldn't like interview the patients say,

692
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:46,430
tell me all the places that you've been. A lot of times the health department will deal with things in the community.

693
01:12:46,430 --> 01:12:53,570
And I think that they would even probably also try to capture maybe other areas, other visits that they may have had that we wouldn't know about.

694
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:55,819
You know, people go to urgent cares all the time.

695
01:12:55,820 --> 01:13:01,399
And some of them our medical chart is is nice now because there's this feature called Care Everywhere.

696
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:07,070
And so you can see a lot of where they've gone. And so we absolutely would in certain situations like that.

697
01:13:09,110 --> 01:13:16,370
So he has arrived to the E.R. and as we already talked about, he spent this whole time in the E.R. and nobody had ordered isolation.

698
01:13:16,370 --> 01:13:20,860
So I think that we can also agree that we're going to have to look at the EDPs

699
01:13:21,620 --> 01:13:24,950
and then he goes up to the general care for we're still not in isolation.

700
01:13:25,940 --> 01:13:32,360
And then the pertussis is finally finalized at 8 p.m. the following day.

701
01:13:32,390 --> 01:13:40,370
Now, do people think that we need to work him up from the time that he got to the general care floor until 8 p.m. on the following day?

702
01:13:40,370 --> 01:13:45,890
When when it's. No, you think so. When were you going to say when the droplets initiated.

703
01:13:46,190 --> 01:13:51,319
Yeah. So then when we look at the, the general care piece,

704
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:56,810
it would be from when he basically from the time from 10 p.m. when he got up there until 10 a.m. the next day.

705
01:13:57,080 --> 01:14:01,940
From this point forward, from 10 a.m. on, he's still considered to be communicable,

706
01:14:02,210 --> 01:14:06,500
but because he's in isolation precautions, people will be wearing the appropriate PPE.

707
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:12,290
So we don't have to worry about exposures. Okay.

708
01:14:12,540 --> 01:14:24,839
So so the next piece then is kind of is kind of going through each of these pieces and is is finding out for each you what you want to find out,

709
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:28,499
were there staff exposures and were there patient exposures?

710
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:33,899
And so the piece there is unknown for the clinic visit for both of them.

711
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:37,410
So we don't know if they spent time in the waiting room.

712
01:14:37,410 --> 01:14:41,460
That's not something that we can typically find and even now with with good documentation.

713
01:14:42,150 --> 01:14:46,740
So typically what we would do then as we would, we would reach out to the clinic and say, Hey,

714
01:14:46,740 --> 01:14:53,459
are you able to tell me how long you think the patient spent in the waiting room and were there a lot of other kids there?

715
01:14:53,460 --> 01:14:58,140
If we're able to identify those, especially sometimes because mask compliance isn't the best for smaller kids,

716
01:14:58,530 --> 01:15:07,290
then that would be an area that we would try to work up. In terms of the staff exposures, we would inquire whether staff wear masks.

717
01:15:07,350 --> 01:15:14,700
Now, I will say, though, sometimes as as the case here, he went to the clinic on 514 or on five four.

718
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:19,620
And by the time this is ten days later when he is actually finally diagnosed,

719
01:15:19,620 --> 01:15:23,520
if you were to call a clinic and say, hey, remember that random three year old you saw with a cough?

720
01:15:23,970 --> 01:15:29,430
Were you wearing a mask? Well, there have been, you know, 150 random three year olds with a cough that have come in since that time.

721
01:15:29,430 --> 01:15:33,749
So most of the time we just have to default and say we're going to go ahead and

722
01:15:33,750 --> 01:15:37,260
inform all of the health care workers that may have interacted with with Eric.

723
01:15:37,710 --> 01:15:42,870
And then they will sort of have to decide from there whether they think they meet exposure criteria.

724
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:51,330
And then in terms of the ID and the general care, the the patient was roomed immediately in the ED.

725
01:15:51,420 --> 01:15:54,300
So that's great. We don't have to worry about the waiting room for that piece.

726
01:15:54,630 --> 01:15:58,230
Then the piece so that we do have to worry about is that he spent 14 hours

727
01:15:58,230 --> 01:16:03,809
in the ED and so the the likelihood that staff would meet exposure criteria.

728
01:16:03,810 --> 01:16:10,170
Remember this is a pre-COVID world nobody's wearing a mask is very high and that also showing the general

729
01:16:10,170 --> 01:16:15,510
care from the time he went up until the time at 10 p.m. so when isolation was ordered the following day.

730
01:16:16,650 --> 01:16:22,860
So when we have identified that, okay, there are indeed exposures, who do you think that you know?

731
01:16:22,860 --> 01:16:24,690
Who do you think you would communicate with?

732
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:33,750
So depending on where they are at, so for this situation, we would want to get in touch with the leadership of the area.

733
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:40,830
So the leadership for the clinic, the ED and the inpatient floor, and then any employees that have maybe cared for them.

734
01:16:40,830 --> 01:16:46,200
And like I said, this is much easier to try to identify because a lot of this is documented down.

735
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:54,900
But there are some areas, like I said, that are a little bit harder to try to to try to figure out environmental services,

736
01:16:55,950 --> 01:17:02,190
food, nutrition for something like pertussis, though, where everybody would, would, would, should be masked.

737
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:11,280
Hopefully that wouldn't be so much of an issue. Occupational health needs to know who we've identified as possibly being exposed

738
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:15,630
so that they know who they would need to provide possibly prophylaxis for.

739
01:17:16,110 --> 01:17:19,559
And there are always people that sort of come out of the woodwork.

740
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:26,790
And this is why we always contact the leadership, because maybe somebody that we missed in sending the notification to like they know, oh, well,

741
01:17:26,790 --> 01:17:32,609
this person actually was a float nurse and they ended up coming in here and they were covering a lunch and maybe they didn't document something,

742
01:17:32,610 --> 01:17:35,580
so we didn't pick them up that way.

743
01:17:36,390 --> 01:17:43,170
And then also the local public health, making sure that they're notified for the communicable disease so that they can do that.

744
01:17:43,170 --> 01:17:49,170
They can do their piece of it. In most of the times they've received, they receive the lab result around the same time we do.

745
01:17:49,590 --> 01:17:52,920
So they're sort of doing their exposure piece when we're doing our exposure piece.

746
01:17:54,970 --> 01:18:05,709
So does anybody have any idea why they think sort of now that we're we have identified who these people may, may be and we've sent them all off.

747
01:18:05,710 --> 01:18:09,910
We've sent them notifications, we've notified everybody. Everybody's getting the prophylaxis that needs it.

748
01:18:09,910 --> 01:18:11,530
If they've met this criteria,

749
01:18:13,030 --> 01:18:20,230
now it's time to kind of do the root cause of it is does anybody have any thoughts on maybe which of these would play a role into the exposure?

750
01:18:25,290 --> 01:18:29,790
Well, for this, I would say it's the first and the last.

751
01:18:29,820 --> 01:18:37,020
So the symptoms were vague. You know, like I mentioned, when when I showed you sort of the timeline for the protests,

752
01:18:37,020 --> 01:18:43,979
the symptoms of the viral symptoms were pretty nonspecific during that initial that initial piece.

753
01:18:43,980 --> 01:18:47,190
And they were concerned that, you know, he was having an asthma exacerbation.

754
01:18:47,190 --> 01:18:54,000
So that that made it a little bit confusing. And then there were the process failures as well.

755
01:18:54,300 --> 01:19:00,030
So the clinics and the ED have this like a triage system that they use.

756
01:19:00,030 --> 01:19:05,249
And they basically there is a list of questions and if they think you're communicable, they kind of shoot you in one direction.

757
01:19:05,250 --> 01:19:09,750
And and although they did that appropriately in the emergency department and the

758
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:14,129
patient skipped sitting in the Ed or skip sitting inside of the waiting room,

759
01:19:14,130 --> 01:19:17,430
they did go into a room without any isolation precautions.

760
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:23,669
So in an ideal world, what would have happened is they would have been asked the treehouse questions, they would have been scooted to a room assigned,

761
01:19:23,670 --> 01:19:29,040
would have gone up on the door, the order would have been put in, and then that would have prevented the exposures.

762
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:34,360
Does anybody have any questions on that? Yes.

763
01:19:35,420 --> 01:19:39,320
In times when variables aren't off, does, um.

764
01:19:39,610 --> 01:19:43,810
What happens to patients who should be recommended for isolation?

765
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:47,140
Well, they do a lot of juggling.

766
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:57,219
Certainly our isolation burden makes things really challenging, especially in the adult hospital, and it's under usually rare situations.

767
01:19:57,220 --> 01:20:01,570
I've not. The hospital I used to work at, we had to do this because it was a small community hospital,

768
01:20:01,570 --> 01:20:04,930
but we don't typically do cohorting of COVID patients here.

769
01:20:05,350 --> 01:20:08,110
But it makes beds. It makes things very difficult.

770
01:20:10,530 --> 01:20:18,030
So this is you know, we're also always trying to get people out of isolation as soon as possible and not over isolate when we don't need to.

771
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:23,080
To try to avoid that. Because it's a problem. Okay.

772
01:20:23,590 --> 01:20:26,649
All right. So let's hear. So. Okay, so we're at we're at 1022 right now.

773
01:20:26,650 --> 01:20:30,900
We could either do a quick break now or why don't we do a quick break now?

774
01:20:30,910 --> 01:20:35,140
Because varicella goes for a bit. Is that okay? Okay. Maybe come back at 1030.

775
01:20:35,230 --> 01:20:42,400
Yeah, that's. That works. Just this one's really riveting.

776
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:59,830
And I know you're not going to want to take a break once we get started. Yeah. I prefer.

777
01:21:44,850 --> 01:21:49,780
The lake dropped like 25 degrees. Yeah. I was walking over here.

778
01:21:50,530 --> 01:21:54,880
Oh, like, I forgot how long it takes to walk from here to here.

779
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:58,810
Yes, that's how it is in a country, isn't it?

780
01:21:59,140 --> 01:22:03,920
As you say. I guess.

781
01:22:09,410 --> 01:22:12,530
I knew she was ready to dove.

782
01:22:19,790 --> 01:22:28,830
When I got to class, I was just like, Oh, yeah. Like you.

783
01:22:31,860 --> 01:22:40,610
I don't think it was her kids doing this kind of like 5 to 7 minutes after.

784
01:22:45,050 --> 01:22:48,120
Oops. Oh, awesome. That's great. Little things.

785
01:22:48,950 --> 01:22:52,290
Oh, I don't think so. I don't really know. I'm good.

786
01:22:52,650 --> 01:22:56,090
I'm good. Did you start new schools or anything this year?

787
01:22:56,090 --> 01:22:59,140
With everybody my son with have promise. Oh, yeah.

788
01:22:59,150 --> 01:23:03,170
And. And it was. But he's. He's doing great.

789
01:23:03,170 --> 01:23:11,460
And I just remember I know school was so traumatic for me to do it.

790
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:17,680
So I was expecting. Strongman. Yeah, we really upset.

791
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:22,790
Yeah. And an elementary school. And some of your friends and everything are.

792
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:31,070
Yeah. I think it's more of a girl thing. Yeah. So yeah, he loves it.

793
01:23:31,100 --> 01:23:35,240
He writes the post every day and let me have the time to know where he is.

794
01:23:35,820 --> 01:23:45,900
I think it was great going out with friends at point whether they were drinking and.

795
01:23:46,350 --> 01:23:50,010
Good. And they're better. Yeah. Okay.

796
01:23:50,160 --> 01:23:53,710
Yeah. One, two.

797
01:23:57,210 --> 01:24:03,930
Oh. I don't think anyone.

798
01:24:04,620 --> 01:24:15,120
No, I didn't think there was not enough response from the teachers and parents when I first came out.

799
01:24:16,980 --> 01:24:21,150
Like, it's just not like money like this.

800
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:26,610
And she was looking at her like, I think she's pretty honest.

801
01:24:26,610 --> 01:24:30,440
I don't want anything to happen to her.

802
01:24:30,470 --> 01:24:36,170
Yeah, I read somewhere that. That's what I'm thinking.

803
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:42,540
Yeah, yeah, that's fine. Oh, how did you.

804
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:45,930
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

805
01:24:46,100 --> 01:24:51,010
I think so.

806
01:24:51,550 --> 01:24:56,960
Yeah, I think you should have the right. Right. Yeah, I do.

807
01:24:57,030 --> 01:25:05,040
Like I say in Rockford, Illinois, people ask me, I was like, that was the greatest like country.

808
01:25:05,850 --> 01:25:12,030
Like if you listen to all you ever heard is no about.

809
01:25:15,180 --> 01:25:18,640
Got it. Yeah, I didn't get it, which is amazing.

810
01:25:18,660 --> 01:25:23,940
So the story on what was what got you on the right.

811
01:25:25,290 --> 01:25:28,580
But. Yeah, I think we know. Yeah.

812
01:25:29,210 --> 01:25:36,440
Yeah. Like, how do you prevent and about how you.

813
01:25:39,190 --> 01:25:42,580
Basically, I was not careful that I wasn't.

814
01:25:47,490 --> 01:25:52,430
You can't. Her name is 1028.

815
01:25:52,600 --> 01:26:03,850
Okay. So like she would say yes, yeah, yeah, I'm a yeah.

816
01:26:04,690 --> 01:26:08,510
Know I don't have any other day after Friday.

817
01:26:09,710 --> 01:26:15,580
I always that I think actually. Well I have nothing in the house now.

818
01:26:16,050 --> 01:26:23,120
I don't watch else.

819
01:26:23,510 --> 01:26:26,600
Yeah, that would be cool enough.

820
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:40,150
Yeah. You know, you're not taking more word, but she's going to go there, you know, I suppose, you know?

821
01:26:41,870 --> 01:26:47,190
And I just was like, you had been having things again.

822
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:52,350
Yeah. They have friends here. The States.

823
01:26:54,790 --> 01:27:01,070
Oh. And I was like, I know Yahoo!

824
01:27:01,590 --> 01:27:06,930
Is going to be talking about that a lot.

825
01:27:06,930 --> 01:27:17,240
Especially somebody that was. You know, that whole thing that I'm handing out later in the show was supposed to be her life.

826
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:22,870
It's kind of been around. Feels like something.

827
01:27:23,220 --> 01:27:26,960
Yeah. Yeah. It's kind of like.

828
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:31,630
Yeah, I've seen her.

829
01:27:32,750 --> 01:27:36,140
All right. All right. It's 1030.

830
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:40,040
Got a lot of stuff to cover. If we don't get through it all that we don't get through it all.

831
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:46,460
But next, I'm going to we're going to talk about varicella.

832
01:27:46,790 --> 01:27:53,940
So. So this would fall into the chicken pox and the the shingles and disseminated shingles bucket.

833
01:27:54,530 --> 01:28:03,260
So varicella is a acute viral disease that is usually sudden onset of fever and a skin rash for chickenpox.

834
01:28:03,710 --> 01:28:08,750
The organism is varicella zoster virus. The method of spread is really two.

835
01:28:08,780 --> 01:28:12,469
It says three technically up here, but really it falls into two buckets.

836
01:28:12,470 --> 01:28:16,790
And then that kind of that goes to how we isolate for them.

837
01:28:16,820 --> 01:28:18,410
The first is contact.

838
01:28:18,770 --> 01:28:29,750
So that would be indirect contact with secretions from vesicles or or touching of the rash or anything like that without wearing the appropriate PPE.

839
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:35,600
And then the second is droplet or airborne spread of the respiratory tract.

840
01:28:35,990 --> 01:28:42,930
And because there is the airborne component, you always sort of default to the to the more stringent.

841
01:28:42,950 --> 01:28:48,439
So somebody that has either chickenpox or disseminated shingles would be isolated with

842
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:54,470
both respiratory isolation and also contact precautions until the lesions are crusted.

843
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,490
So the incubation period is 10 to 21 days.

844
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:08,900
It's commonly 14 to 16, the period of community ability 24 hours before the development of rash and until the lesions have completely crusted over.

845
01:29:09,380 --> 01:29:14,090
So this by this right here, this 24 hours before the development of rash,

846
01:29:14,090 --> 01:29:22,459
this is where then things can be a little bit dicey because people may not have the rash yet and are spreading virus.

847
01:29:22,460 --> 01:29:30,200
So maybe going to places that, you know, they or health care workers wouldn't necessarily know about that susceptibility is

848
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:34,279
people that have either not had the disease or have not been properly vaccinated.

849
01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:36,290
That is who we consider to be susceptible.

850
01:29:36,680 --> 01:29:46,040
So in general, the people that are considered immune have either a history of disease documentation of two vaccine doses or evidence on serology.

851
01:29:48,970 --> 01:29:55,510
Now shingles. So this is the local manifestation of reactivation of latent varicella infection.

852
01:29:55,870 --> 01:30:04,690
So once you've had chickenpox, then you are you are eligible to have potentially shingles.

853
01:30:05,230 --> 01:30:10,600
And when shingles are localized, we don't worry about them so much.

854
01:30:10,870 --> 01:30:14,080
Certainly you wouldn't want to have direct contact with the vesicle fluid.

855
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:21,310
But where we worry about it and where we see it quite frequently in the hospital is when you have somebody that has disseminated shingles.

856
01:30:21,610 --> 01:30:28,740
And so what we call disseminated shingles is someone that has it spreads basically for.

857
01:30:29,140 --> 01:30:30,280
I'll show you the picture first.

858
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:37,820
For more contiguous dermatology so far, more dermatology on top of each other or two or more dimmer tones on the body.

859
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:39,800
So it's kind of like spotty all over.

860
01:30:40,210 --> 01:30:50,440
When you have disseminated shingles, that is when you need to be into respiratory isolation and contact precautions.

861
01:30:50,710 --> 01:30:53,920
Disseminated shingles are probably not.

862
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:57,610
Number two. To covered is the one that we work up the most.

863
01:30:57,610 --> 01:31:02,290
But then there are a lot of disseminated shingles that we that we see.

864
01:31:03,430 --> 01:31:07,750
We do both laboratory confirmation and then clinical diagnosis.

865
01:31:09,670 --> 01:31:18,040
And a person that would have a exposure to either chickenpox or disseminated shingles would be somebody who is susceptible.

866
01:31:18,430 --> 01:31:23,139
So we talked about what the criteria already are to to decide whether you're susceptible and are in

867
01:31:23,140 --> 01:31:29,320
close proximity for at least 10 minutes with somebody who is contagious unless you are wearing a mask.

868
01:31:29,350 --> 01:31:36,879
So if you're wearing a mask, then you're good. The other bucket that would put you exposed would be that if you are susceptible and

869
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:40,960
you have direct contact with secretions from lesions and you're not wearing gloves.

870
01:31:42,310 --> 01:31:44,710
So when we look at staff exposures,

871
01:31:46,450 --> 01:31:56,109
the first thing that we do is if somebody meets criteria so that 10 minutes without wearing the mask or contact with the lesions,

872
01:31:56,110 --> 01:32:04,629
the first thing is verifying immune status. And this is a lot of work for occupational health because if you have a patient

873
01:32:04,630 --> 01:32:12,010
that comes in and is not isolated appropriately for for a certain period of time,

874
01:32:12,010 --> 01:32:18,579
let's say days and the patient's setting, I mean, these are like this can get to be like like a hundred people sometimes that have enter.

875
01:32:18,580 --> 01:32:22,270
You'd be so surprised the number of people that are documented to have cared

876
01:32:22,270 --> 01:32:26,790
for in and out of the patient room that we have to check immune status on.

877
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:31,840
And I mean, I would say the vast majority of the time, Emily, I mean,

878
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:39,010
do you guys very frequently identify people that fall into the susceptible category for for chickenpox?

879
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:45,220
No, that doesn't happen very often. What happens a lot, though, is we find that there's no documentation.

880
01:32:45,340 --> 01:32:49,180
Oh, slip through the cracks. Yeah, who knows?

881
01:32:49,220 --> 01:32:56,200
Yeah. So then that's just even more work then for you that need to sort that piece out, come in and, you know, check their titer and stuff.

882
01:32:56,590 --> 01:33:01,450
So it does happen. But I don't I think it's pretty rare to find someone who's truly.

883
01:33:01,450 --> 01:33:06,460
Yeah. Susceptible because the vast majority of people have either been vaccinated.

884
01:33:06,550 --> 01:33:08,520
Yeah. Yeah, I can.

885
01:33:08,700 --> 01:33:15,130
You know, just last night, I was trying to look for a way to stop doing some of these exposure workups for staff just because it is.

886
01:33:15,550 --> 01:33:23,470
I think we we do see a fair number of them. There are a lot of people that end up getting locked up and notified and it's just exposure

887
01:33:23,470 --> 01:33:27,070
notifications constantly sometimes to some of these staff and then they're immune.

888
01:33:27,070 --> 01:33:35,800
But we don't know that off the bat. If somebody happens to be susceptible, they have to be off work from 10 to 21 days after their exposure.

889
01:33:36,130 --> 01:33:39,310
Can anybody think of why it's 10 to 21 days?

890
01:33:43,330 --> 01:33:46,200
That's the intuition. Very good. Yeah.

891
01:33:46,570 --> 01:33:54,940
So we have to take the incubation period for the disease and say, when can you possibly be your first date and extend it all the way out?

892
01:33:54,970 --> 01:33:58,330
And so that is where the 10 to 21 days comes from.

893
01:33:58,630 --> 01:34:03,310
If you happen to have active infection, then you have to be off work until your vesicles are dry and crusted.

894
01:34:04,450 --> 01:34:11,890
And so just sort of the important piece is that if you have already had if you are immune, you do not you are not considered exposed.

895
01:34:12,310 --> 01:34:17,950
And in the old days, pre-COVID, you wouldn't even need to wear a mask inside of the room if they were in respiratory isolation.

896
01:34:18,190 --> 01:34:22,600
Now, with universal masking, everybody is at least wearing a regular mask anyways.

897
01:34:23,590 --> 01:34:26,830
The more dicey piece is the roommate piece.

898
01:34:27,340 --> 01:34:33,760
If they are sharing a room and they're in a semi-private, if they are almost all the time,

899
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:40,480
unless they were literally in there for a couple of minutes, we consider the roommate to be exposed and also waiting rooms.

900
01:34:40,520 --> 01:34:52,450
My most horrifying exposure workout that I can remember that I ever had to do was a person that had like truly disseminated shingles.

901
01:34:52,470 --> 01:34:57,500
Not one of those. It's like maybe it is it's like was truly disseminated and sat inside of the cancer center,

902
01:34:57,520 --> 01:35:03,249
one of the cancer center waiting rooms for like an hour and a half with a bunch of an entire room filled with.

903
01:35:03,250 --> 01:35:07,540
It was, of course, like the biggest waiting room and it's, you know, filled with immunocompromised people.

904
01:35:07,540 --> 01:35:14,090
And so those are the people that are really the highest risk. And we ended up having to contact the physicians for like, you know,

905
01:35:14,140 --> 01:35:24,250
45 patients that then may have then gone on and offered ah, ah, prophylaxis, which is, which is very zagg which I'll get to.

906
01:35:26,910 --> 01:35:31,590
Okay. So let's do a case study. Okay. So, Madeleine, she's seven.

907
01:35:32,070 --> 01:35:40,800
She presents to the Ed with a fever and a rash. Her vaccination history shows that her parents have declined all the vaccines on her behalf.

908
01:35:41,790 --> 01:35:49,710
She is triaged in the Ed. The ed, though, is they immediately suspect chicken pox upon seeing her rash.

909
01:35:50,100 --> 01:35:53,190
So she skips the waiting room, which is great. She goes in.

910
01:35:53,200 --> 01:35:59,249
She's placed into both respiratory isolation and contact precautions in the staff that are already immune.

911
01:35:59,250 --> 01:36:05,570
Enter the room and they're not wearing a mask. The non immune staff enter the room wearing masks.

912
01:36:05,580 --> 01:36:13,680
So this is like I mentioned, this is compliant with what we won't allow test our son and they are later positive for varicella zoster virus.

913
01:36:14,550 --> 01:36:22,860
Do we need to do anything here or did everybody do everything correctly? Seems mostly good.

914
01:36:22,980 --> 01:36:26,580
I would think. Yeah. Yeah, they did exactly what they did.

915
01:36:26,580 --> 01:36:32,819
They. They trashed her appropriately. They put her in the room like they were supposed to.

916
01:36:32,820 --> 01:36:36,840
And unlike the protesters exposure, they ordered the isolation appropriately.

917
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:44,069
Everybody wear the mask that they should wear. The patient skipped the waiting room and so there were no patient exposures either.

918
01:36:44,070 --> 01:36:50,040
So that was that was an easy one. The second one, spoiler alert is not going to go quite as well.

919
01:36:51,060 --> 01:36:56,970
On Monday, Lucas, who's three, admits to the general care floor with a fever and dehydration.

920
01:36:57,510 --> 01:37:01,709
He is this is back in the really old days before we had the hospital with the private rooms.

921
01:37:01,710 --> 01:37:04,830
He's placed in a separate semi-private room with another patient.

922
01:37:05,700 --> 01:37:08,760
So this is on Monday and Tuesday.

923
01:37:09,150 --> 01:37:15,180
The medical team identifies a rash and they consult dermatology who suspects that are chickenpox.

924
01:37:16,940 --> 01:37:20,870
So we'll go through these same questions that we went through for the purchasers.

925
01:37:21,320 --> 01:37:25,700
What do you think the first step is? One Sturm says, Hey, I think this is chicken pox.

926
01:37:30,060 --> 01:37:33,150
Yes, exactly. So you want to sort of you want to stop?

927
01:37:34,740 --> 01:37:38,280
I'm going to stop right there. Get them isolated to prevent future exposures.

928
01:37:38,550 --> 01:37:42,690
And then and after you get to do that, then you can deal with all the exposures that have happened.

929
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:48,900
Now, this is dicey because he's in he's in a shared room.

930
01:37:49,110 --> 01:37:55,829
And so he needs a negative pressure isolation room. And not all rooms in the hospital are negative pressure isolation rooms.

931
01:37:55,830 --> 01:37:58,709
And the hospital is bursting at the seams all the time.

932
01:37:58,710 --> 01:38:05,870
And so sometimes the you know, there's a lot of bed moving that has to happen to get Lucas into this negative pressure,

933
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:11,040
pressure isolation room that he needs. The most important thing is, is get the roommate out.

934
01:38:11,580 --> 01:38:16,530
And if you if you can't get him into the negative pressure isolation room,

935
01:38:16,530 --> 01:38:19,170
let's say they're not going to be able to move another patient for an hour or so.

936
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:25,080
Then you just make sure that the door is closed, the sign is up that people are wearing what they're supposed to be wearing to enter the room.

937
01:38:27,240 --> 01:38:30,870
The next would be determining the duration of contagiousness.

938
01:38:34,770 --> 01:38:38,730
Yes. He was contagious on Monday. Yes.

939
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:39,960
Very good. Yes.

940
01:38:40,740 --> 01:38:51,510
So because it was your contagious for 24 hours prior to fever onset and until the lesions are crusted, when he showed up, he had already had a fever.

941
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:57,329
And so he was contagious as soon as he as soon as he showed up.

942
01:38:57,330 --> 01:39:01,140
And so in terms of looking at staff and patient exposures,

943
01:39:01,590 --> 01:39:09,720
while we have the problem where he's not only was in a room and staff were caring him for him,

944
01:39:09,750 --> 01:39:17,250
not in hospital isolation, he also had the the patient exposure as well, which was who his his roommate was.

945
01:39:17,260 --> 01:39:24,450
And so the way that this works is was similar is for the first is that is that

946
01:39:24,450 --> 01:39:29,370
we identify staff that would have entered the room and possibly that that may

947
01:39:29,370 --> 01:39:35,099
be susceptible and we have to determine there we have to determine their immune

948
01:39:35,100 --> 01:39:39,960
status and they would then follow up for us if they were to need prophylaxis.

949
01:39:40,200 --> 01:39:47,129
There are certain susceptible people that would be offered that would be offered our prophylaxis,

950
01:39:47,130 --> 01:39:52,920
which is very sick, and we would do this for when we do our patient evaluation as well.

951
01:39:53,250 --> 01:39:59,180
And these would typically be not immune pregnant women, somebody that's immunocompromised.

952
01:39:59,940 --> 01:40:03,420
Sure, there are a couple other people that fit into the bucket as well.

953
01:40:03,720 --> 01:40:06,870
And so, like I mentioned before,

954
01:40:06,870 --> 01:40:15,510
OHSU is really good at sort of streamlining the processes of sort of sorting out who may not be immune and then kind of taking it from there.

955
01:40:16,380 --> 01:40:19,140
On our end, we deal with the patient exposure piece.

956
01:40:19,170 --> 01:40:30,149
And so in this situation, I would call the, you know, the the physician for the exposed patient and I would disclose the exposure to them.

957
01:40:30,150 --> 01:40:38,219
And then they would assess based on sort of the patient's, you know, why the patient was there, if they were immuno compromised,

958
01:40:38,220 --> 01:40:45,930
etc., and sort of what the next steps would be in terms of symptom monitoring versus offering exposure prophylaxis.

959
01:40:47,780 --> 01:40:53,000
And then the last piece, we always obviously notify public health.

960
01:40:53,630 --> 01:40:59,540
Now, are there any other things? And this is kind of this is not the easiest questions I want.

961
01:40:59,540 --> 01:41:05,560
I won't make you look at it for too long. But are there any special considerations for that patient that was exposed?

962
01:41:05,570 --> 01:41:10,969
So we we talked about well, okay, so we'll talk to their physician and we'll sort of see,

963
01:41:10,970 --> 01:41:14,060
you know, and then they'll decide based on if they if they need anything.

964
01:41:14,060 --> 01:41:19,130
But let's say this patient, we think is going to be admitted for a long period of time.

965
01:41:20,390 --> 01:41:26,180
Would we want them just sitting inside of a regular room once they had the incubation

966
01:41:26,180 --> 01:41:36,559
period so that 10 to 21 days we would not so we would isolate once they had day ten,

967
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:42,320
if they were still in the hospital, we would put them into respiratory isolation from date 10 to 21,

968
01:41:42,650 --> 01:41:46,879
just so that it doesn't turn into the cyclical exposure on top of exposure.

969
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:58,280
So once they hit that daytime mark, they would be put in, and then that way we would be reasonably assured that if they did go on to develop disease,

970
01:41:58,580 --> 01:42:01,820
that they would be isolated and we wouldn't have any future exposures.

971
01:42:04,270 --> 01:42:08,830
So thinking about some of the reasons that may have contributed to the to the exposure.

972
01:42:09,450 --> 01:42:13,180
Well, the initial symptoms were fever and dehydration and so vague.

973
01:42:13,570 --> 01:42:20,979
Most of the time, this the symptoms are vague is one of the root cause that we always find.

974
01:42:20,980 --> 01:42:28,600
And if, you know, people just don't it doesn't know it looks like any other you know, everybody comes to the E.R. for a fever right now.

975
01:42:28,600 --> 01:42:38,350
So and then that would be the only that would that would be sort of the main root cause for for that.

976
01:42:39,430 --> 01:42:43,780
Does anybody have any questions on varicella before we move on to TV? All right.

977
01:42:43,930 --> 01:42:53,350
We're I've got time, right? 1045 okay. So TB it's caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, it is spread by airborne transmission.

978
01:42:54,160 --> 01:42:59,830
And so somebody that has TB is placed into respiratory isolation.

979
01:42:59,830 --> 01:43:07,810
So this would be a negative pressure isolation room and this would be wearing an N95 mask or a paper.

980
01:43:09,570 --> 01:43:17,940
We determine infectiousness based on the burden of acid, fast bacilli and smear, and then also symptoms as well.

981
01:43:18,390 --> 01:43:25,410
So this diagram here is so if you can see this lady, I swear this looks like a like a screaming cat.

982
01:43:25,740 --> 01:43:38,040
Well, this is actually her. This is her TB. Who then goes and gives the TB to whoever this this this child person is small, small, adult, whatever.

983
01:43:39,300 --> 01:43:46,410
And within 6 to 8 weeks, there is a skin test conversion.

984
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:50,880
And this stage is called primary primary tuberculosis.

985
01:43:50,970 --> 01:43:54,300
There's spontaneous healing of the infection in six months.

986
01:43:54,690 --> 01:43:57,860
And then there is the stage that's called latent tuberculosis.

987
01:43:57,870 --> 01:44:01,769
And once you're in latent tuberculosis, there are three pathways.

988
01:44:01,770 --> 01:44:08,820
You can take 5% progress within two years, 5% progress after two years.

989
01:44:09,330 --> 01:44:14,330
And if you have a current HIV infection, the progression is 10% each year.

990
01:44:14,340 --> 01:44:16,110
So it is quite a bit higher.

991
01:44:19,020 --> 01:44:27,300
So for the exposure evaluation for this, there is a 80 year old Armenian man who's admitted to our hospital for a pneumonia.

992
01:44:27,960 --> 01:44:32,850
He's treated with antibiotics but does not appear to be improving like they would have expected.

993
01:44:33,930 --> 01:44:39,080
A infectious disease doctor notes that while his chest x ray doesn't look great,

994
01:44:39,090 --> 01:44:44,250
and when we looked at the chest x ray from his last admission, it looks very similar to that.

995
01:44:44,700 --> 01:44:52,920
There's not been any kind of normal chest x ray in between. So this is not this is not really a new a new finding on the chest x ray.

996
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:57,510
He has a known positive skin test, tuberculin skin test.

997
01:44:57,840 --> 01:45:05,340
And when they send a a sputum for culture to the lab, it shows numerous acid.

998
01:45:05,340 --> 01:45:08,729
Fast bacilli now acid fast bacilli.

999
01:45:08,730 --> 01:45:13,540
Being on a smear is not like a home run for TB by any means.

1000
01:45:13,560 --> 01:45:20,070
There are many other atypical mycobacterium that most of the time end up being.

1001
01:45:20,070 --> 01:45:27,810
We get I probably get at least two probably on average to ask positive.

1002
01:45:29,010 --> 01:45:34,800
Positive AFB is a day and only a very small number of them actually end up being TB.

1003
01:45:34,810 --> 01:45:37,650
So that alone is not enough to say that he has TB.

1004
01:45:38,070 --> 01:45:45,030
What is enough to say that he has TB is that they sent a PCR and two days later it's confirmed to be TB.

1005
01:45:45,630 --> 01:45:54,870
And when they look at his his symptoms, he's been admitted with similar symptoms three times over the past four months,

1006
01:45:54,870 --> 01:45:59,790
which is a big bummer, but that five months ago he did have a normal chest X-ray.

1007
01:46:00,810 --> 01:46:06,299
So as we go through the questions, we know what the answer to this one.

1008
01:46:06,300 --> 01:46:07,890
What is the what's the first thing we're doing here?

1009
01:46:08,940 --> 01:46:18,299
Yeah, we're getting him into respiratory isolation and we're making sure we usually with for most of our rule out TB patients too,

1010
01:46:18,300 --> 01:46:23,370
we have a we have a discussion with the appropriate hospital epidemiologist as well.

1011
01:46:23,700 --> 01:46:31,230
And the next piece would be determining his duration of contagiousness.

1012
01:46:31,800 --> 01:46:40,800
So we know that he had a negative chest X-ray five months ago, but he's been admitted with similar symptoms three times over the past four months.

1013
01:46:41,460 --> 01:46:51,480
So that based on knowing that he's a confirmed positive, then we would we would really want to look at those three hospitalizations,

1014
01:46:51,480 --> 01:46:58,230
which, depending on how long he could be hospitalized for, could be so very, very, very many people.

1015
01:47:00,030 --> 01:47:03,330
Now in terms of determining sort of how infectious he is,

1016
01:47:03,720 --> 01:47:11,400
every TB exposure we work up is a little bit different because some of them are negative and smear,

1017
01:47:11,490 --> 01:47:20,610
so they'll send it in the spirit negative, but then they culture it and and then sometime along, while it's said for culture, then it grows.

1018
01:47:20,610 --> 01:47:25,470
AFB somebody that's negative on smear but positive on culture.

1019
01:47:25,860 --> 01:47:33,000
What we would think of as being less contagious is somebody who has like numerous AFB on their smear.

1020
01:47:33,570 --> 01:47:37,170
So we would take the the smear positive negative piece.

1021
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:45,150
We would also take his symptoms or in this situation it's a him, but we would take the patient's symptoms.

1022
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:51,570
Are they coughing? If they're not coughing, if there's a scenario by some chance they happen to not be coughing,

1023
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:58,620
well, then that could be helpful in terms of that, they're maybe not spreading it as much.

1024
01:47:59,130 --> 01:48:06,209
For this scenario, if he's positive, if beyond smear and coughing, we set up exposure criteria.

1025
01:48:06,210 --> 01:48:16,230
And usually it's something along the lines of like 10 minutes of face to face contact or 10 minutes within the room without wearing an N95 mask.

1026
01:48:16,590 --> 01:48:22,559
This is one of the exposures to wear that the type of mask matters.

1027
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:32,340
And so even though we have universal masking for the health care workers because they're not wearing the appropriate type of mask,

1028
01:48:32,760 --> 01:48:40,229
they these would be a whole bucket of people that we would have to try to identify for exposure, evaluation.

1029
01:48:40,230 --> 01:48:48,240
And so what that looks like is very similar to when we we look for the staff and also for

1030
01:48:48,240 --> 01:48:54,300
the possible any patient exposures is that we gather who we think may have been exposed.

1031
01:48:54,780 --> 01:49:04,379
And then occupational health has this really painful process then where they have to contact everybody because.

1032
01:49:04,380 --> 01:49:08,760
So here's the problem with exposures and this has been really compounded in the COVID world,

1033
01:49:08,760 --> 01:49:14,370
is that we send out so many exposure notifications for COVID,

1034
01:49:14,790 --> 01:49:20,340
so many that I'm sure I send out some to the same people, often three in a day sometimes.

1035
01:49:20,670 --> 01:49:26,550
And so I think people have gotten so sick of seeing the infection prevention emails,

1036
01:49:26,730 --> 01:49:31,020
exposure notification that then they're not even looking at the ones that are probably legit,

1037
01:49:31,020 --> 01:49:36,599
like, you know, the TB where you would definitely need to look at that and say, Hey, I care for this patient.

1038
01:49:36,600 --> 01:49:44,400
Do I meet the exposure criteria, which, let's say for this one has been set at 10 minutes of face to face contact without wearing a 995 mask.

1039
01:49:44,820 --> 01:49:49,500
And so many times occupational health actually like actually sort of hunt the people down.

1040
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:54,180
And we just sort of assume then that they've met exposure criteria.

1041
01:49:54,180 --> 01:50:02,790
If they can't if they can't remember, and then they'll do baseline testing and then follow up testing to see if there are any conversions.

1042
01:50:02,790 --> 01:50:09,179
So that would be somebody that would be I mean, do we do do do skin tests or just kind of your hands for that testing?

1043
01:50:09,180 --> 01:50:12,920
Now, we've mostly been doing quantum on.

1044
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:17,040
Okay. Because we're. For a couple of different issues.

1045
01:50:17,340 --> 01:50:20,700
For a while there was a shortage of skin testing solution.

1046
01:50:20,700 --> 01:50:24,180
And also we've just been trying to keep foot traffic out of.

1047
01:50:24,570 --> 01:50:29,670
Yeah. Oh, right. And you can just order that, can't you? Oh, yeah, that's great.

1048
01:50:29,880 --> 01:50:34,200
And for convenience, they have to come back and get it ready for you.

1049
01:50:34,860 --> 01:50:36,479
Yeah. So that's. Yeah, that's great.

1050
01:50:36,480 --> 01:50:43,170
So that when you have the quantifier on, which is the blood test, it would sort of detect that you can just walk into any lab and have that done,

1051
01:50:43,170 --> 01:50:48,900
whereas the skin test, would that need to be placed in occupational health and then somebody would need to read it at the appropriate time after.

1052
01:50:49,830 --> 01:50:59,700
And so and so that's how the process would work for would work for the staff if there were exposed patients,

1053
01:51:00,090 --> 01:51:04,829
depending on whether they were inpatients or outpatients,

1054
01:51:04,830 --> 01:51:12,360
would sort of depend on the route that we would use, whether we would contact their physician to have to set up sort of the,

1055
01:51:12,360 --> 01:51:20,759
you know, that exposure testing at the appropriate time versus we work with a group that's called patient relations and Clinical Risk Management,

1056
01:51:20,760 --> 01:51:27,899
and they help us with anybody that is discharged to help shore to make sure that they get the appropriate follow up as needed.

1057
01:51:27,900 --> 01:51:32,790
And then obviously to the the the communication to the leadership.

1058
01:51:37,140 --> 01:51:41,450
I think we've talked about most of this, but it's always important to remember,

1059
01:51:41,630 --> 01:51:45,690
to remember, to look for all the places that may not be completely apparent.

1060
01:51:46,980 --> 01:51:51,600
And it's easy to figure out who the primary nurse was, who the primary doctor was.

1061
01:51:51,600 --> 01:52:00,059
But there are some there are some places they may go where there may not be a note apparent and so important to look for,

1062
01:52:00,060 --> 01:52:03,780
like, did they go to radiology for something? Did they go to a blood draw station?

1063
01:52:04,440 --> 01:52:08,669
Don't forget about the people that may be stacking the room as well.

1064
01:52:08,670 --> 01:52:15,930
And so to make sure that we capture anybody that may that may require testing based on exposure.

1065
01:52:19,310 --> 01:52:25,820
Okay. And we went through that. So the final steps here would be to write the report and then perform the root cause analysis.

1066
01:52:27,380 --> 01:52:30,970
We have 5 minutes and Kerry is not here yet. So I'm just going to run through.

1067
01:52:30,970 --> 01:52:34,390
We just have one more pertussis. I wasn't sure if we were going to get to this one.

1068
01:52:34,390 --> 01:52:43,480
So kind of like trying to go back to the pertussis and this is what I said, which is my least favorite, which is a positive health care worker.

1069
01:52:43,930 --> 01:52:50,650
So on June 20th, pediatric resident Sarah is found to be lab positive for pertussis and has been working while she's sick.

1070
01:52:51,820 --> 01:52:57,910
And remember, these are the days pre-COVID so she wouldn't Sarah wouldn't be coming to work wearing a mask every day.

1071
01:52:58,720 --> 01:53:04,330
So she goes and sees patients in clinic. Initially on six four and six five.

1072
01:53:05,200 --> 01:53:12,729
She reports that she wasn't wearing a mask during any of her any of her clinic visits there and that she tested a patient for pertussis.

1073
01:53:12,730 --> 01:53:19,990
So during one of these clinic days is probably when Sarah got pertussis on the ninth,

1074
01:53:19,990 --> 01:53:24,220
she started experiencing a runny nose and congestion, but she just thought it was her allergies.

1075
01:53:24,640 --> 01:53:27,760
So she completed her shifts on June 9th and June 10th.

1076
01:53:28,090 --> 01:53:36,309
And remember, we talked about that first two weeks stage where you are most infectious, but your symptoms are also the most nonspecific.

1077
01:53:36,310 --> 01:53:39,580
So this could be really anything allergies, a mild cold.

1078
01:53:40,510 --> 01:53:47,500
Unfortunately, on the 11th, she starts her rotation to the neonatal ICU, which is probably the worst place that Sarah could have gone.

1079
01:53:48,670 --> 01:53:53,760
And she was also in charge of five other residents on the 12th of June.

1080
01:53:53,770 --> 01:53:56,979
She develops a cough. She still thinks, oh, it's just allergies.

1081
01:53:56,980 --> 01:54:02,410
So let me see a patients without wearing a mask anymore. Well, she never she never started.

1082
01:54:02,410 --> 01:54:05,890
So she's still is not clear she's still continuing not to wear a mask.

1083
01:54:06,520 --> 01:54:14,050
Her cough continues to worsen. And so on the 19th, when she arrives to talk health, I mean, to her shift, she goes to act health instead.

1084
01:54:14,620 --> 01:54:20,170
So here it's like a timeline sort of of what she sees the patients on the fourth and the fifth.

1085
01:54:20,980 --> 01:54:30,280
She develops the symptoms on the ninth and the 10th. So so she has this Nikki rotation where she's in charge of five residents and a bunch of babies.

1086
01:54:31,660 --> 01:54:35,680
And she sees patients on the ninth and the 10th, and she's not wearing a mask.

1087
01:54:37,930 --> 01:54:41,140
And on the 12th, here is where she starts coughing because she's not.

1088
01:54:41,440 --> 01:54:49,900
So she's caring basically for patients from June 9th until June 19th for a full ten days before her cough gets worse.

1089
01:54:50,410 --> 01:54:55,600
And the highest risk patients that she could possibly be caring for neonates in the ICU.

1090
01:54:56,350 --> 01:55:02,679
So as we go through, you know, when before when we were talking about what is our first step?

1091
01:55:02,680 --> 01:55:05,890
Well, the first step for if it's a positive patient is to make sure they're isolated,

1092
01:55:06,370 --> 01:55:14,650
for if it is a positive staff member, the first thing that you want to do is make sure that they are not working.

1093
01:55:15,340 --> 01:55:21,700
And so this can be done by either actually the most efficiently is probably to just call the employee themselves yourself.

1094
01:55:22,270 --> 01:55:30,429
You can also can also work with occupational health, but we want to make sure that she's not not at work in terms of determining her

1095
01:55:30,430 --> 01:55:38,800
duration of contagiousness because she was her symptom onset was on the ninth,

1096
01:55:39,850 --> 01:55:43,479
her completion of treatment would be on the 25th.

1097
01:55:43,480 --> 01:55:50,770
And so she was likely exposed during her when she was caring for the patients on the fourth or the fifth.

1098
01:55:51,850 --> 01:55:56,950
But when we want to think about the the patient and the staff exposures,

1099
01:55:57,280 --> 01:56:06,009
this would be all of the all of the the clinic visit here the Nikki rotation the

1100
01:56:06,010 --> 01:56:09,579
other piece to that's that's difficult about when you have a positive staff member

1101
01:56:09,580 --> 01:56:16,510
is that many times when staff are in this is even the case now with COVID where

1102
01:56:16,510 --> 01:56:21,399
we have universal masking people are shoved into rooms where they're team rooms,

1103
01:56:21,400 --> 01:56:24,790
where they've got computers all shoved together and everybody's on top of each other.

1104
01:56:24,790 --> 01:56:27,309
And this is where they eat lunch together and all of these things.

1105
01:56:27,310 --> 01:56:33,810
So a lot of times you spend a fair amount of the time with the group that in this case, you know, the.

1106
01:56:33,860 --> 01:56:43,550
Residents that she's in charge of. And so there would be significant exposures to both staff and to patients.

1107
01:56:44,540 --> 01:56:46,100
When you have a positive health care worker.

1108
01:56:49,310 --> 01:56:57,320
So we would do the same process that we would do as we've talked about for the other exposures as just going through each of the clinic visits.

1109
01:56:57,650 --> 01:57:02,750
The clinic visits will be the easiest ones to try to determine was well,

1110
01:57:02,750 --> 01:57:09,500
the good news for the clinic is that Sarah didn't sit in a waiting room because she was the patient, she was the person taking care of the patients.

1111
01:57:09,500 --> 01:57:14,540
But then you would have to look to see that not all of the patients that she cared for during those

1112
01:57:14,540 --> 01:57:18,620
clinic visits and then all the staff that would have been working in the clinic in that time.

1113
01:57:20,180 --> 01:57:29,030
And the same would obviously be the case for her when she was caring for patients in the neonatal ICU, but on just a much, much larger scale,

1114
01:57:29,510 --> 01:57:37,639
because you would you would not only need to worry about the shifts that she took while she was in the ICU and the people that are

1115
01:57:37,640 --> 01:57:47,360
there also possibly the other the other employees she may have exposed in in part of her work that is not associated with clinic

1116
01:57:47,360 --> 01:57:57,349
you so are there residents that maybe they have conferences together or social type situations and we would really want to be really

1117
01:57:57,350 --> 01:58:07,069
thoughtful about about making sure that we captured everyone that would possibly be exposed for for an organism like pertussis,

1118
01:58:07,070 --> 01:58:12,980
when many of the health care workers may be people caring for four tiny people that are at risk.

1119
01:58:16,240 --> 01:58:18,670
Okay. So I think we've gone through most of this.

1120
01:58:19,260 --> 01:58:30,489
Um, and just for this as well, if there's anybody that is any of the patients that are admitted that would have been exposed to Sarah.

1121
01:58:30,490 --> 01:58:35,860
So if, you know, if Sarah was the resident for let's say ten patients while she was in the nick,

1122
01:58:35,860 --> 01:58:42,159
you that would be ten patients that would need to that would need to be put into droplet

1123
01:58:42,160 --> 01:58:47,950
precautions from the start of the incubation period until when the prophylaxis has been completed.

1124
01:58:48,640 --> 01:58:54,910
So it would be potentially a large burden of patients that would require isolation from the exposure.

1125
01:58:57,680 --> 01:59:05,059
So in terms of the root cause for this it would it's the to the first like it's been the case for all of them.

1126
01:59:05,060 --> 01:59:08,480
The symptoms were vague. She was mistaking them for allergies.

1127
01:59:08,990 --> 01:59:14,420
And then there are some process failures which, you know,

1128
01:59:14,420 --> 01:59:22,610
this presentation was pre-COVID times staff with mild respiratory illnesses are allowed to work with the with the use of a mask.

1129
01:59:22,610 --> 01:59:28,099
Well, I guess that's not this was this I guess is sort of probably still the case.

1130
01:59:28,100 --> 01:59:31,370
Only now you just have to wear a mask all of the time.

1131
01:59:32,030 --> 01:59:33,889
Before I guess you would just wear the mask.

1132
01:59:33,890 --> 01:59:40,190
If you if you just had sort of a mild cold, we wouldn't be able to have everybody stay home every time somebody nose was running.

1133
01:59:42,230 --> 01:59:48,560
And then the other piece that's a process failure is that she she tested a patient for pertussis.

1134
01:59:48,860 --> 01:59:54,320
And so right there, if you're going to say I'm suspicious enough that I'm going to test somebody for pertussis,

1135
01:59:54,710 --> 02:00:00,500
you should absolutely be putting a mask on and eye protection and wearing the appropriate PPE to protect yourself.

1136
02:00:00,500 --> 02:00:06,800
If you think that if you think that the patient that you're caring for may potentially have pertussis.

1137
02:00:09,010 --> 02:00:16,629
Okay. Are there any questions on this or anything any of the any not just this any of

1138
02:00:16,630 --> 02:00:21,460
the other previous case studies that we went through or exposures in general?

1139
02:00:22,960 --> 02:00:26,410
No. Okay. All right. Well, great.

1140
02:00:26,440 --> 02:00:29,319
Okay. So this. Okay. So this worked out well then, because I started a little early.

1141
02:00:29,320 --> 02:00:34,690
But Carrie, I think is coming out 1115 and I think I started about 10 minutes early, so we would have been fine anyways.

1142
02:00:34,720 --> 02:00:42,790
Oh, good. Okay. Perfect. Okay, great. Next is your PPE video, so I want everybody to get really excited for that.

1143
02:00:48,760 --> 02:00:51,990
So just access out and only. Yeah, you can access out. Okay, cool.

1144
02:00:52,730 --> 02:00:57,910
Okay. Okay. Great.

1145
02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:10,540
Meeting with her here, you know? Yeah. Well, although you don't fact that they got the brief in 2013 because she was out and she was like,

1146
02:01:10,540 --> 02:01:16,780
Oh, yeah, they have a break after your talk so that I'm coming out of 15 so that maybe that's okay.

1147
02:01:17,830 --> 02:01:22,510
And so my bottle was really good. So I wanted to say good luck.

1148
02:01:23,410 --> 02:01:26,680
Thank you to you. All right.

1149
02:01:26,680 --> 02:01:34,960
Well, I think we're waiting for our next presenter to show up, so feel free if you have to go use the bathroom or whatever.

1150
02:01:36,010 --> 02:01:39,640
Just be back here. I like 11, ten or so.

1151
02:01:39,940 --> 02:01:43,390
I think I was.

1152
02:01:43,690 --> 02:01:50,530
I think the second part is like it's like, okay, I think I was taking the actual like the practice and Ramona,

1153
02:01:50,620 --> 02:01:59,229
I was like it was like like on the break and then embraces to wardrobe and then like that during the actual exam.

1154
02:01:59,230 --> 02:02:10,800
It's like you get to walk, but you have to like you have to like press the table and you have to book it and you got to go through them all.

1155
02:02:11,070 --> 02:02:22,180
Do everything feels like that's just like walking like every time you walk into the has a because there is and

1156
02:02:22,220 --> 02:02:31,020
they're going to do a one time like in the beginning they said like well I'm going to do this level of walking which,

1157
02:02:31,030 --> 02:02:38,030
you know, if, when there's like, yeah, exactly. She wasn't always one.

1158
02:02:38,380 --> 02:02:44,210
I feel like we have everything in life that will make people.

1159
02:02:45,780 --> 02:02:46,930
And be less physical.

1160
02:02:47,230 --> 02:02:59,380
You know, I don't want to say easy, but I think it was difficult this year and, you know, it was just for real, which isn't as good as the hearing.

1161
02:02:59,830 --> 02:03:06,900
I mean, as hard as I understand, like people can still be like, you have a right.

1162
02:03:08,720 --> 02:03:27,220
As he referred to the Senate as an unfit. Well, I was I was so scared out of there that I just thought Christianity might be different.

1163
02:03:27,850 --> 02:03:39,070
I think that. I think it's something. Every so often.

1164
02:03:39,130 --> 02:03:43,280
And I really thought we had. Barrett.

1165
02:03:43,880 --> 02:03:47,840
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1166
02:03:48,570 --> 02:03:52,330
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

1167
02:03:52,460 --> 02:03:57,820
You should just stick it in your hair. I like that idea.

1168
02:03:59,330 --> 02:04:03,770
Yeah. Oh, perfect. Okay. Yeah, I know.

1169
02:04:04,050 --> 02:04:23,130
It's nice to see, you know, a lot of people have failed to feel this way.

1170
02:04:23,630 --> 02:04:27,060
All right, so hold on. Yeah, I know.

1171
02:04:27,410 --> 02:04:32,790
There's this level of, like. We're turning.

1172
02:04:34,200 --> 02:04:40,860
Like, I have no idea. Like, they can make arrests like this.

1173
02:04:41,250 --> 02:04:45,930
That's how they did it. Otherwise. And then you just pass it.

1174
02:04:46,440 --> 02:04:52,220
Like in New York, you get a chance to wait for them get back.

1175
02:04:52,980 --> 02:04:56,760
And I think for her murder, which.

1176
02:04:58,880 --> 02:05:02,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1177
02:05:03,200 --> 02:05:07,840
I think that's what I think this is a good thing.

1178
02:05:08,890 --> 02:05:16,040
So if people really want to see it.

1179
02:05:16,370 --> 02:05:23,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that would be great.

1180
02:05:29,130 --> 02:05:33,170
But even like I don't like a lot of pictures there is they're like.

1181
02:05:36,780 --> 02:05:47,450
When you know that, I just think you are the bad guy here.

1182
02:05:47,550 --> 02:05:53,450
With that, yes. Oh, yeah. I think there should be some. Yeah, you can go on your word.

1183
02:05:53,830 --> 02:05:57,560
Okay, so here we are.

1184
02:05:59,100 --> 02:06:04,570
We can finish on the job. Really? Yeah. Yeah. I don't think you should introduce yourself to everyone.

1185
02:06:04,590 --> 02:06:10,500
I well, hi, everyone. I think we're going to go ahead and get started with your last lecture for the day.

1186
02:06:11,610 --> 02:06:15,510
So my name is Carrie. I'm one of the infection prevention ists over at Michigan Medicine.

1187
02:06:16,620 --> 02:06:20,010
Hey, Rick, I see a couple of familiar faces from our interns this summer.

1188
02:06:21,060 --> 02:06:25,080
And so you guys have been talking you talked about health today.

1189
02:06:25,080 --> 02:06:27,330
You talked about communicable disease exposures.

1190
02:06:27,990 --> 02:06:35,790
And so we're going to end today talking about one of the tools that we use to help protect our staff from exposures in the health care system,

1191
02:06:36,720 --> 02:06:44,370
and that is personal protective equipment. So you're probably going to learn more than you ever wanted to know about about this topic.

1192
02:06:45,480 --> 02:06:47,670
Hopefully, hopefully, you know, some of it already.

1193
02:06:49,320 --> 02:06:57,540
So personal protective equipment or what is commonly known as PPE, it's kind of a mouthful to say the whole thing.

1194
02:06:57,540 --> 02:07:05,670
So everyone always just says PPE. So there are a number of different types of PPE that are used in the health care system.

1195
02:07:06,120 --> 02:07:12,240
And then there are two kind of main indications that we use for PPE from an infection prevention standpoint.

1196
02:07:12,870 --> 02:07:15,330
The first falls under our standard precautions policy,

1197
02:07:15,930 --> 02:07:22,080
and that is that appropriate PPE barrier shall be used for contact or potential contact with body substances,

1198
02:07:22,590 --> 02:07:25,740
not attach skin or potentially contaminated items.

1199
02:07:26,160 --> 02:07:32,790
And the specific types of PPE that you do use under under this indication will depend on

1200
02:07:32,790 --> 02:07:38,310
what type of task is being performed and the potential for contact with body fluids.

1201
02:07:39,810 --> 02:07:43,709
So under standard precautions, we make a general assumption.

1202
02:07:43,710 --> 02:07:48,390
So regardless of if a patient has been diagnosed with a specific type of infection or not,

1203
02:07:49,800 --> 02:07:53,100
we make the assumption that all body fluids could potentially be infectious.

1204
02:07:53,430 --> 02:07:57,839
Right? So you always want to make sure that you have your PPE barriers and if there's

1205
02:07:57,840 --> 02:08:01,530
that potential for contact to protect yourself as the health care worker.

1206
02:08:01,530 --> 02:08:05,310
And so that's kind of what this indication for PPE covers.

1207
02:08:06,360 --> 02:08:16,260
The second indication for use of PPE from an infection prevention standpoint is for caring for patients and transmission based precautions.

1208
02:08:17,370 --> 02:08:23,790
So appropriate PPE barriers shall be used when caring for patients who are in our transmission based precautions and in

1209
02:08:23,800 --> 02:08:30,360
the specific type of PPE that you use for those precautions is going to depend on what type of precautions they're in,

1210
02:08:30,360 --> 02:08:35,340
and that's going to depend on what we know about how the organism is being transmitted.

1211
02:08:36,060 --> 02:08:44,880
Okay. So we're going to go through in this segment, we'll go through each indication for PPE use and kind of talk a little bit more about the details.

1212
02:08:45,850 --> 02:08:50,700
Then I'm going to finish up talking a little bit about donning and doffing PPE.

1213
02:08:51,510 --> 02:08:54,810
Can you guys hear me? Okay? Okay, perfect.

1214
02:08:57,510 --> 02:09:00,750
So starting with PPE, use under standard precautions.

1215
02:09:01,500 --> 02:09:07,229
So to go through this, I'm just going to go through some of the common types of PPE that are used in the health care settings.

1216
02:09:07,230 --> 02:09:14,760
So starting with gloves. Right. And gloves are probably the most common type of PPE that gets used over in the hospital.

1217
02:09:15,660 --> 02:09:17,220
When should you be wearing gloves?

1218
02:09:17,340 --> 02:09:26,130
So indication for use when it can reasonably be reasonably anticipated that you as the employee may have direct contact with body substances,

1219
02:09:26,340 --> 02:09:31,980
mucous membranes, not skin open wounds or items potentially contaminated with fatty substances.

1220
02:09:32,520 --> 02:09:39,360
Okay. So again, any potential contact with body fluids during your task and you want to make sure that you put your gloves on.

1221
02:09:40,300 --> 02:09:45,150
And there are a couple of different types of blood types.

1222
02:09:45,150 --> 02:09:52,590
Probably most common are just the clean standard gloves that are kind of everywhere in patient rooms and other units.

1223
02:09:53,340 --> 02:10:01,290
These can be used for most routine tasks and they can be done with with your clean, clean hands pretty easily.

1224
02:10:01,620 --> 02:10:11,580
I'm just putting them on. If you are going to be doing the sterile or aseptic procedure, we do have sterile gloves available.

1225
02:10:12,930 --> 02:10:16,500
And so with sterile gloves, right, if you're thinking about putting them on,

1226
02:10:17,010 --> 02:10:23,340
a little bit of extra care needs to be taken to make sure that you maintain the outside of the glove being sterile.

1227
02:10:24,690 --> 02:10:28,830
It's a little hard to see in this picture here, but your glass would be come in there sterile wrapping.

1228
02:10:28,950 --> 02:10:35,610
You don't package them in. They're actually folded at the cuff to again, help it help you with getting your hand in glove.

1229
02:10:35,820 --> 02:10:39,870
While maintaining the sterile outer surface of of your glove.

1230
02:10:40,320 --> 02:10:43,800
Okay. Those are again used for during aseptic procedures.

1231
02:10:45,240 --> 02:10:51,030
And then as a reminder, we always have to remind health care workers that gloves are not a surrogate for hand hygiene.

1232
02:10:51,660 --> 02:10:57,780
You always need to be performing hand hygiene before you put your gloves on or before you put out any PPE for that matter.

1233
02:11:00,760 --> 02:11:03,610
Okay. And feel free.

1234
02:11:03,610 --> 02:11:10,810
If you guys think of any questions throughout this presentation, just feel free to raise your hand or shut them out as we go through this.

1235
02:11:12,640 --> 02:11:17,440
So the second type of PPE that is commonly used are gowns.

1236
02:11:18,040 --> 02:11:22,989
So indication for use of gowns would be to protect your skin and clothing during procedures

1237
02:11:22,990 --> 02:11:28,150
or activities if there's a reasonable anticipation of contact with blood or bodily fluids.

1238
02:11:28,180 --> 02:11:34,060
Right. So if you're doing a task or there may be your is is expected to be a bit more body fluids involved in that task.

1239
02:11:34,690 --> 02:11:38,740
In addition to your gloves, you'd probably want to be wearing your gown as well.

1240
02:11:39,550 --> 02:11:44,320
And the yellow concern in the picture here is one of our is our isolation gown.

1241
02:11:44,860 --> 02:11:53,050
So these are mildly fluid resistant and they are appropriate for for most for most tasks.

1242
02:11:53,320 --> 02:11:56,290
And when you're caring for patients in transmission based precautions,

1243
02:11:56,890 --> 02:12:01,750
that is the appropriate type of gown to wear when going into that patient's room for care.

1244
02:12:02,590 --> 02:12:08,890
Additionally, if you're going to be doing a splash generating procedure or task, the isolation gun is also appropriate.

1245
02:12:09,490 --> 02:12:13,780
And we also have procedure gowns and these are a bit more fluid resistance.

1246
02:12:13,780 --> 02:12:18,490
They're either fluid resistant or fluid impermeable. So if you are doing a task,

1247
02:12:18,640 --> 02:12:25,630
I'm or let's say you're in the O.R. where there's going to be a lot of a lot more body fluids expected during during your task,

1248
02:12:26,260 --> 02:12:32,080
you may want to use the procedure gown so that you have a little bit more of that fluid resistance as a barrier.

1249
02:12:36,220 --> 02:12:38,050
Next is eye protection.

1250
02:12:38,770 --> 02:12:47,620
So eye protection is used when there is reasonable potential for splashes or droplets and sprays of blood or respiratory secretions

1251
02:12:48,330 --> 02:12:55,690
or other bodily fluids that can occur while you're doing a task or if you're performing an aerosol generating procedure.

1252
02:12:57,550 --> 02:13:02,560
So generally with when it comes to eye protection as well as when it comes to masks, right.

1253
02:13:02,560 --> 02:13:09,340
So we're trying to protect the mucous membranes on our face from exposure to droplets or aerosols in our eyes.

1254
02:13:09,520 --> 02:13:15,070
We do have mucous membranes. So eye protection is important during some of these types of tasks.

1255
02:13:16,270 --> 02:13:24,850
Eye protection types. Most commonly you will see the goggles that staff can put on some.

1256
02:13:25,850 --> 02:13:29,080
We do have the use of face shields as well.

1257
02:13:29,920 --> 02:13:36,400
Sometimes you can't really see in the picture at the bottom. But again, because oftentimes mask and eye protection go together.

1258
02:13:36,580 --> 02:13:43,960
And we do. Masks are available with an attached eye shield so that you can get all of that PPE in one go.

1259
02:13:44,830 --> 02:13:49,540
And then I think this was new from the pandemic.

1260
02:13:49,900 --> 02:13:57,370
We also have eyeglass side shields. So in general, we say that glasses alone are not considered adequate eye protection.

1261
02:13:57,820 --> 02:14:06,460
Right. Because you have all these gaps at the side where you could still potentially have exposure to those mucous membranes.

1262
02:14:07,060 --> 02:14:13,000
But we did during the pandemic, these plastic eye shields that can kind of go over the sides of your glasses.

1263
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:17,020
And so then you have protection from the front and from the sides as well.

1264
02:14:19,020 --> 02:14:23,900
Okay. Masks and respirators.

1265
02:14:24,830 --> 02:14:28,070
So masks. Indication for use of masks.

1266
02:14:28,500 --> 02:14:31,969
And this first bullet here is exactly the same as eye protection. Right.

1267
02:14:31,970 --> 02:14:37,730
So, again, when we're doing a procedure and there's anticipation for droplets or sprays.

1268
02:14:38,810 --> 02:14:43,670
We want to make sure that you have your mask on to protect your nose and mouth from any exposures.

1269
02:14:45,140 --> 02:14:55,129
Additionally, during some aseptic procedures, health care workers and also the patients themselves may put on a mask as a barrier

1270
02:14:55,130 --> 02:15:00,330
to prevent themselves from breathing onto that aseptic feel that they're working on.

1271
02:15:00,330 --> 02:15:06,530
And so they want to protect the patient from pathogens that could be carried in their mouth or nose and expelled during breathing.

1272
02:15:06,530 --> 02:15:09,710
So they wear a mask during that type of task.

1273
02:15:12,300 --> 02:15:18,060
Masks can also vary by level of protection. I think, as everyone kind of learned over the last couple of years, right,

1274
02:15:18,060 --> 02:15:25,650
the amount of filtration and protection that you get from a cloth mask differs from what you would get from one of the medical grade masks.

1275
02:15:26,520 --> 02:15:33,390
Masks can also vary by level of fluid resistance. So we have our medical masks in the health care setting.

1276
02:15:33,630 --> 02:15:40,530
And then when you go into some of our procedural settings, they also have surgical masks which have a higher level of fluid resistance because again,

1277
02:15:40,530 --> 02:15:48,510
we're anticipating a lot more splashes, a lot more body contact with body fluids, and we want slightly more fluid resistant resistance in those areas.

1278
02:15:51,060 --> 02:15:53,220
And then there are respirators.

1279
02:15:54,180 --> 02:16:05,160
And so respirators are used when there is a reasonable potential to be exposed to an infectious agent that's transmitted on aerosol droplets.

1280
02:16:05,880 --> 02:16:09,000
And we also will use respirators during certain procedures.

1281
02:16:09,570 --> 02:16:13,979
So for a bleeding infected tissue, again, it's aerosol generating.

1282
02:16:13,980 --> 02:16:22,770
So we would use your respirator in that setting to provide a higher level of protection types of respirators that are available.

1283
02:16:23,430 --> 02:16:29,550
So the three pictures at the top of the teal mask and then the kind of the duckbill masks are N95 masks.

1284
02:16:30,450 --> 02:16:34,470
These do require fit testing. So before you use them,

1285
02:16:35,490 --> 02:16:41,819
you need to go to occupational health and they take you through the fit testing process to make sure that you are wearing the mask appropriately and

1286
02:16:41,820 --> 02:16:50,190
it is providing the maximum level of protection if you are not fit tested or if you fail at testing and you still require the use of a respirator.

1287
02:16:50,580 --> 02:16:56,130
And there is also what is called a Pepper fan that stands for powered air purifying respirator.

1288
02:16:56,700 --> 02:17:00,569
So that's kind of you can see in the picture here, she has a hood over her face,

1289
02:17:00,570 --> 02:17:08,130
which is connected to an air tube that goes down to your air purifying respirator that you actually wear around your waist.

1290
02:17:08,850 --> 02:17:18,629
Okay. So those are kind of the probably most common types of PPE that you will see

1291
02:17:18,630 --> 02:17:23,860
in the health care setting for that are used for routine use with all PPE.

1292
02:17:23,880 --> 02:17:30,270
If it is damaged, it should be changed. It seems kind of obvious your PPE is being used as a barrier to protect you,

1293
02:17:30,960 --> 02:17:37,110
so if it is damaged, it can't provide that level of protection at the front of your PPE.

1294
02:17:37,110 --> 02:17:42,840
So once you have your PPE on the front of your gown, gloves is considered contaminated after use.

1295
02:17:43,380 --> 02:17:45,210
And that's an important point to remember,

1296
02:17:46,470 --> 02:17:54,900
especially when we start talking about taking off your PPE because you want to make sure that you avoid contamination during that process.

1297
02:17:55,950 --> 02:18:00,000
And then also all PPE should be removed upon leaving the patient care area.

1298
02:18:00,900 --> 02:18:06,270
We don't want to have health care workers wearing their PPE out into the hallways or into another patient room,

1299
02:18:06,900 --> 02:18:13,830
because again, our PPE is contaminated after use and we don't want to be contaminating the environment or other patients.

1300
02:18:16,650 --> 02:18:19,950
Are there any questions at all at this point?

1301
02:18:23,090 --> 02:18:27,230
Okay. So what PPE would you use at this table?

1302
02:18:28,220 --> 02:18:31,400
Is from our infection prevention standard precautions policy.

1303
02:18:32,450 --> 02:18:37,190
And it just provides some examples of different tests that are performed in the health care setting

1304
02:18:37,700 --> 02:18:43,730
and recommended PPE again based on the potential for contact with body fluids during the task.

1305
02:18:44,780 --> 02:18:46,640
So just as a few examples to go over,

1306
02:18:47,660 --> 02:18:54,980
what say you were going into the room of a patient and this is a patient who was not in any precautions to draw blood from their vein.

1307
02:18:55,190 --> 02:18:59,569
Right. Some potential for contact with body fluids and blood.

1308
02:18:59,570 --> 02:19:03,080
So you want to make sure. We would recommend gloves when you're going in,

1309
02:19:03,350 --> 02:19:14,300
when you go to do that task versus if you were going into the patient room to clean up and an incontinent patient who was an adult with diarrhea,

1310
02:19:14,990 --> 02:19:17,600
a lot more body fluids involved in that task.

1311
02:19:18,380 --> 02:19:27,410
So in addition to gloves, probably a good idea to have a gown on as well versus let's say you're going into the room to irrigate a wound.

1312
02:19:27,740 --> 02:19:33,230
Right. So again, a lot more body fluids anticipated during this task as well as potential for splashing.

1313
02:19:34,790 --> 02:19:36,590
So you'd have your gloves, your gown.

1314
02:19:37,070 --> 02:19:42,230
And then because of that splashing risk, it's also recommended that you'd have your mask and eye protection as well.

1315
02:19:43,190 --> 02:19:46,450
Okay. Makes sense. Perfect.

1316
02:19:48,630 --> 02:19:53,160
Okay. So that is PPE use under standard precautions.

1317
02:19:53,370 --> 02:19:57,930
Again, it's task based and based on anticipated contact with body fluids.

1318
02:19:58,950 --> 02:20:06,480
The second indication for use of PPE is when caring for patients who are in transmission based precautions.

1319
02:20:08,670 --> 02:20:13,620
So our transmission based precautions are used in addition to standard precautions when

1320
02:20:13,620 --> 02:20:18,300
we have a patient who has a known or suspected infection with a communicable disease.

1321
02:20:18,900 --> 02:20:22,260
And then the type of precaution that is being used is based on the epidemiology

1322
02:20:22,260 --> 02:20:26,790
of the organism and how we know and what we know about how it is transmitted.

1323
02:20:27,060 --> 02:20:30,840
Now, have you guys talked about our transmission based precautions before?

1324
02:20:31,020 --> 02:20:36,510
Okay. I see some that so this will be a bit of a review for you guys, which is good.

1325
02:20:39,330 --> 02:20:41,280
So contact precautions and contact precautions.

1326
02:20:41,280 --> 02:20:48,690
Diarrhea patients are placed in this precaution because they have an infection with an organism that is spread through contact.

1327
02:20:48,780 --> 02:20:56,070
Right. So this is oftentimes include some of our drug resistant bacteria, c diff norovirus.

1328
02:20:57,210 --> 02:21:04,710
These organisms survive in the environment. They can survive on surfaces, get picked up on your hands, get contaminated equipment,

1329
02:21:04,860 --> 02:21:10,830
and then can be taken out of that space and potentially transferred to other areas.

1330
02:21:11,670 --> 02:21:18,209
So PPE requirements for patients, for caring for patients and contact precautions or contact precautions.

1331
02:21:18,210 --> 02:21:23,730
D On our signs, we list all of the instructions as well as the recommended PPE.

1332
02:21:23,730 --> 02:21:27,510
And so you can see here gloves on entry as well as gown on entry for both.

1333
02:21:32,740 --> 02:21:39,580
For droplet precautions. So this is patients with infections, with organisms that are spread on large droplets.

1334
02:21:39,580 --> 02:21:44,230
So when you're coughing and sneezing or even when you're talking, you expel droplets.

1335
02:21:45,400 --> 02:21:46,030
These are heavy.

1336
02:21:46,030 --> 02:21:51,970
So they don't travel very far and then they can fall to a surface and then they can survive on that surface for a short period of time.

1337
02:21:53,620 --> 02:22:04,840
So things like our seasonal respiratory viruses, blue rhino, enterovirus, pertussis, all fall under droplet precautions and then recommended PPE.

1338
02:22:05,380 --> 02:22:10,270
So gown and gloves again to protect yourself from any contamination in the environment.

1339
02:22:10,840 --> 02:22:15,180
And then because we have droplets involved, you want to have your mask and eye protection as well.

1340
02:22:19,810 --> 02:22:26,170
Airborne precautions. So certain organisms are spread on smaller droplets or smaller aerosols.

1341
02:22:26,770 --> 02:22:31,930
These are smaller than what we would do. Organisms spread through droplet precautions.

1342
02:22:32,740 --> 02:22:39,790
And these aerosols, if they're light, they can get picked up on air currents and they can travel for long distances before they fall to a surface.

1343
02:22:39,790 --> 02:22:49,990
And when they fall to a surface, they don't survive for very long. So patients with measles varicella or chickenpox or pulmonary TB,

1344
02:22:50,110 --> 02:22:57,849
these are all types of infections that would require patients to be in airborne precautions and PPE use under airborne precautions.

1345
02:22:57,850 --> 02:23:01,239
As you can see on the side here is just your respirator.

1346
02:23:01,240 --> 02:23:09,490
Right. So the N95 mask or the pepper, again, because we don't expect a lot of environmental contamination in the room.

1347
02:23:09,490 --> 02:23:14,770
We don't require gown and gloves in this setting, but we do require the respirator.

1348
02:23:15,670 --> 02:23:18,850
And then additionally, we actually require environmental controls.

1349
02:23:18,970 --> 02:23:23,140
So we have the patient in that negative pressure space to help prevent transmission.

1350
02:23:25,720 --> 02:23:28,240
And then lastly, are special pathogens precautions.

1351
02:23:28,840 --> 02:23:37,000
So this type of precautions is designed to protect the employee from exposure to both droplets and aerosols that could be in the air,

1352
02:23:37,510 --> 02:23:40,330
as well as any potential contamination on surfaces in the room.

1353
02:23:42,370 --> 02:23:48,880
This precaution is designed for more novel organisms where we have a little bit less information on spread.

1354
02:23:50,140 --> 02:23:58,240
And so this is what we currently are using for COVID 19, as well as monkeypox patients who have monkeypox infection.

1355
02:24:00,250 --> 02:24:05,310
And so with this, you can see that we use all the PPE, right?

1356
02:24:05,350 --> 02:24:10,629
So we have our gown and gloves to again, protect from any contamination in the room, our eye protection.

1357
02:24:10,630 --> 02:24:13,720
And then we use the respirator. So the 95 mask or pepper?

1358
02:24:15,400 --> 02:24:19,480
Well, in that space. Okay, that all sound familiar?

1359
02:24:20,350 --> 02:24:24,340
Perfect. Okay. Okay.

1360
02:24:24,880 --> 02:24:30,310
So that was just our quick overview then of PPE use for transmission based precautions.

1361
02:24:31,180 --> 02:24:36,340
For the last few minutes, I'm going to talk about donning and doffing PPE.

1362
02:24:37,300 --> 02:24:42,520
So the way that you put on your PPE and take your PPE off actually does matter.

1363
02:24:44,320 --> 02:24:49,780
And why does it matter? Well, there are a number of studies that show that not all health care workers take off their

1364
02:24:49,780 --> 02:24:55,509
PPE correctly and then they can self contaminate themselves during that doffing process.

1365
02:24:55,510 --> 02:24:59,590
So remember we said the outside of your PPE is considered contaminated after use,

1366
02:25:00,370 --> 02:25:07,600
so that if you're not careful when you're taking off your PPE, you could then expose yourself through touching those contaminated surfaces.

1367
02:25:08,260 --> 02:25:14,530
During the doffing process, poor technique can be can result in health care worker exposure to infectious agents.

1368
02:25:15,790 --> 02:25:18,729
And if you have proper training and you do proper donning and doffing,

1369
02:25:18,730 --> 02:25:27,040
you can help prevent exposure through self contamination to yourself as well as preventing exposures to the patient and his and the environment.

1370
02:25:30,010 --> 02:25:33,750
So exposures do result when health care workers doff their PPE incorrectly.

1371
02:25:33,760 --> 02:25:39,460
So in the early 2000s during the SARS outbreak and then the early 20 tens during the Ebola outbreak,

1372
02:25:40,090 --> 02:25:47,020
there were reports of health care workers who contracted both arms and Ebola in the absence of any known gaps in PPE use.

1373
02:25:47,020 --> 02:25:51,850
So these are health care workers who had all of the recommended PPE while they were caring for the patient.

1374
02:25:52,090 --> 02:25:57,010
And the patient was the patients were in appropriate environmental controls.

1375
02:25:57,010 --> 02:26:04,329
They were in their negative pressure as required. And these health care workers still ended up contracting the illnesses.

1376
02:26:04,330 --> 02:26:14,230
So there's thought that they likely could have contaminated themselves during the doffing process and in this study at the bottom here.

1377
02:26:14,530 --> 02:26:19,280
So these researchers observe health care workers leaving contact precautions rooms.

1378
02:26:19,280 --> 02:26:25,689
So they were contact precautions rooms of patients caring for caring for patients with Mersa or very infection.

1379
02:26:25,690 --> 02:26:32,589
And so what they did is they observed the health care workers remove their PPE and then they collected some cultures out there on their clothes,

1380
02:26:32,590 --> 02:26:42,070
on their hands after doffing. And what they found was that, one, a lot of health care workers did not remove their PPE correctly.

1381
02:26:42,550 --> 02:26:48,580
And then too, they did not remove it. They made errors and they were more likely to have positive cultures identified.

1382
02:26:48,580 --> 02:26:56,650
So so it really does matter how you're taking off your PPE to help prevent those exposures.

1383
02:26:58,540 --> 02:27:01,720
Okay. So my next two slides here.

1384
02:27:02,230 --> 02:27:11,650
So this poster outlines the steps for donning PPE and then this poster starring yours truly goes over the steps for doffing PPE.

1385
02:27:12,430 --> 02:27:15,700
And both of these were it's full PPE.

1386
02:27:15,700 --> 02:27:19,420
So our gown, our mask, respirator, eye protection and gloves.

1387
02:27:20,320 --> 02:27:23,649
And so if you guys have slides off, you can feel free to follow along.

1388
02:27:23,650 --> 02:27:28,809
I actually have a couple videos that will go through.

1389
02:27:28,810 --> 02:27:39,370
So these again are videos of PPE donning and doffing for our special pathogens, PPE that we put together during the pandemic.

1390
02:27:40,570 --> 02:27:44,530
Follow these steps when donning PPE or special pathogen precautions.

1391
02:27:46,600 --> 02:27:55,450
Step one Gather your PPE supplies, which includes the gown, gloves and 95 respirator and eye protection.

1392
02:27:59,130 --> 02:28:09,630
If you have long hair type and. Next perform hand hygiene.

1393
02:28:13,310 --> 02:28:17,280
Yeah. So before any PPE, darling, you always want to make sure that you wash your hands.

1394
02:28:17,940 --> 02:28:30,649
That's an important step. So you can see our isolation gowns.

1395
02:28:30,650 --> 02:28:35,060
She had the loop so she could just kind of stick it over her head and doesn't have to tie anything in the backpack.

1396
02:28:35,270 --> 02:28:40,999
But it does some for the thumb. Yep. So it does have that tie in the back and that's important as well to tie your gown

1397
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:50,000
so that it's not kind of flapping over the patient while you're in that space. And then the thumb holes help keep that gown over your arms.

1398
02:28:50,690 --> 02:28:58,550
That's done a 95 respirator by placing the respirator in the palm of your hand with both straps dangling beneath.

1399
02:29:03,750 --> 02:29:07,800
And sugar respirator is fitting properly by performing a user seal check.

1400
02:29:11,310 --> 02:29:19,540
Don I hypertension. Lastly, Don, your gloves.

1401
02:29:32,910 --> 02:29:37,320
And now she is ready for patient care. Yep.

1402
02:29:37,380 --> 02:29:45,240
So these steps here again, when you don your PPE appropriately, like I said, it's tighter on the back.

1403
02:29:45,240 --> 02:29:53,260
Right. So there's less chance of your PPE falling off while you're doing patient care gown first, followed by the gloves.

1404
02:29:53,300 --> 02:29:59,520
Right now we have that thumb pull that's helping keep our gown up in the gloves are covering your wrist so that there's no exposure to your arm.

1405
02:30:00,630 --> 02:30:07,980
So those steps kind of ensure that you have your protection while you before you go into the patient room.

1406
02:30:09,690 --> 02:30:15,670
Now, we will do doffing. When doffing personal protective equipment.

1407
02:30:15,970 --> 02:30:19,570
Please remember that your PPE can potentially be contaminated,

1408
02:30:19,870 --> 02:30:26,140
so care must be taken during the doffing process in the empty room or just outside a patient room.

1409
02:30:26,200 --> 02:30:35,770
There's no room. It's available. Take off gown and gloves together by pulling down, forward, rolling down and removing gloves at the same time.

1410
02:30:36,940 --> 02:30:42,490
I'm just going to pause really quickly here. So she had sat in the anteroom or outside of the patient room.

1411
02:30:43,960 --> 02:30:47,110
We ended up moving those two gown and gloves off in the patient room.

1412
02:30:48,040 --> 02:30:55,480
So there was no ante room available. Rather than taking everything into the hallway to take off your PPE, gown and gloves would come off in the room.

1413
02:30:56,590 --> 02:30:59,800
Okay. And so you'll watch her as she is pulling away her garments.

1414
02:31:00,340 --> 02:31:06,610
I think this step is also important. Right. So you want to make sure that you are avoiding contamination from the outside of that gown.

1415
02:31:06,610 --> 02:31:14,320
So she's going to be pulling it away from herself and wrapping it in such a way so that as she's wrapping it,

1416
02:31:14,470 --> 02:31:19,870
the inside of the gown is now kind of on the outer edge of the ball that that you're creating.

1417
02:31:19,870 --> 02:31:27,170
Right. And that's going to help protect keep all the contamination within so that you keep yourself free from exposures.

1418
02:31:27,490 --> 02:31:34,370
Do not touch the outside of the gown. And then back tears easily away.

1419
02:31:41,900 --> 02:31:45,590
Right. And so she was able to get her gloves off and now she's folding the parts that she's touching with.

1420
02:31:45,590 --> 02:31:50,030
Her bare hands are the inner part of the gown. Right. So she's not contaminating herself.

1421
02:31:51,800 --> 02:31:59,210
And so at this point, if you're in the patient room, you leave the space and then for from hand hygiene, then move on.

1422
02:32:01,220 --> 02:32:05,210
Next, remove your eye protection by grabbing the sides and not the front.

1423
02:32:12,690 --> 02:32:27,100
Next perform hand hygiene. Remove that 95 respirator by grabbing the straps and pulling forward.

1424
02:32:29,430 --> 02:32:42,810
Do not touch the front of the mask. Lastly, perform hand hygiene.

1425
02:32:48,060 --> 02:33:01,420
Oh. Okay. Okay.

1426
02:33:02,170 --> 02:33:06,640
So in the video, right, with eye protection and mask, it said eye protection.

1427
02:33:06,760 --> 02:33:11,049
You're holding the sides of the mask or aside for eye protection at the front. Same with the mask, right?

1428
02:33:11,050 --> 02:33:19,600
You're pulling from the straps and not the front. Why do you think that is? Yeah.

1429
02:33:20,030 --> 02:33:23,050
So before I'm terminated. Mm hmm.

1430
02:33:23,470 --> 02:33:29,470
Yep, that's exactly right. Yeah. So the front of your eye protection, as well as your mask, are considered contaminated.

1431
02:33:29,470 --> 02:33:35,890
So you want to avoid touching that as well, especially everything around your face, where you've a lot of mucous membranes around your face.

1432
02:33:35,890 --> 02:33:40,000
And if you're, you know, grabbing from the front, you're right there by your eyes.

1433
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:44,890
Right. So it's going to be probably a lot more likely that you might accidentally touch your eyes.

1434
02:33:45,610 --> 02:33:49,420
And then same with your mask. If you're holding your mask now, your eyes are all unprotected.

1435
02:33:50,050 --> 02:33:54,550
You're very close right to that space. So just a little bit more risky.

1436
02:33:55,540 --> 02:34:01,930
Okay. And then the number of hand hygiene steps again to make sure that we are always starting with clean hands.

1437
02:34:02,560 --> 02:34:07,780
So going and gloves came off, left the room clean hands before you take off your eye protection,

1438
02:34:08,740 --> 02:34:12,400
clean hands again to make sure you have clean hands before you removed your mask.

1439
02:34:12,880 --> 02:34:16,370
Okay. And so this was all the PPE, right?

1440
02:34:16,380 --> 02:34:21,810
So if you were just in contact precautions, you could follow the same process just with the kind of gloves, right.

1441
02:34:21,810 --> 02:34:25,630
Because you wouldn't have your mask and eye protection on. Okay.

1442
02:34:26,220 --> 02:34:31,560
Are there any questions about anything that we have gone over today?

1443
02:34:31,710 --> 02:34:36,990
That is all I have for you. And I love this comic. I thought it was perfect in time for how you felt.

1444
02:34:36,990 --> 02:34:44,010
With that it may have changed or something like that. So you guys consider like protection and respirators?

1445
02:34:44,240 --> 02:34:49,170
Single use? Yes. Yep. At this point, it is single use, but that's a great point.

1446
02:34:49,170 --> 02:34:52,470
Right. So during the pandemic, when resources were a lot limited,

1447
02:34:53,640 --> 02:34:59,670
we actually did come up with ways that we actually have a whole another set of posters and videos on how to reuse your mask.

1448
02:34:59,680 --> 02:35:05,100
Right? How to safely take that off, store it in a paper bag and that you can reuse it.

1449
02:35:05,110 --> 02:35:10,379
Yeah, we did a couple of things. One is we had for when we had like a dedicated COVID unit,

1450
02:35:10,380 --> 02:35:16,830
we'd have people basically just keep their mask on for sort of as long as they could tolerate.

1451
02:35:18,270 --> 02:35:25,319
And then once we got away from the dedicated COVID unit, we actually for a while we were actually reprocessing.

1452
02:35:25,320 --> 02:35:29,430
That is only five days we had I forget what they were like, some U.V., I think.

1453
02:35:29,430 --> 02:35:35,219
Yeah, yeah. But at some point we during the pandemic we switched.

1454
02:35:35,220 --> 02:35:38,490
So we used to use three, um, and 95 masks.

1455
02:35:38,490 --> 02:35:44,129
We switched over to Halyard a brand which had a much better kind of support.

1456
02:35:44,130 --> 02:35:46,170
So we haven't had any issues for a long time.

1457
02:35:46,170 --> 02:35:54,350
So right now it's just you just use it and toss it, which is obviously much more ideal from from many perspectives.

1458
02:35:54,540 --> 02:35:58,860
That's pretty much waste, but that's a whole another. It's a whole other topic with PPE.

1459
02:36:00,030 --> 02:36:04,560
But yeah, that was a huge issue early on was we didn't have enough and 95 minutes.

1460
02:36:05,020 --> 02:36:10,110
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Okay. Well, if there are no more questions, I think.

1461
02:36:10,500 --> 02:36:15,090
All right, great. I'm Di Roy. Yeah, I'll be up here if you need anything otherwise.

1462
02:36:15,090 --> 02:36:20,620
Have a great weekend. Thanks, Carrie. Yeah, yeah.

1463
02:36:21,300 --> 02:36:24,780
I'm just going to. I got to turn off the recording here.

1464
02:36:25,860 --> 02:36:28,110
Thanks for coming over today. The problem.
