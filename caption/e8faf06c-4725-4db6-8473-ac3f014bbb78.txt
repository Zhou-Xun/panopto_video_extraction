1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:05,138
In this session we'll talk about linkage disequilibrium blocks and

2
00:00:05,138 --> 00:00:07,296
haplotype reference panels.

3
00:00:07,296 --> 00:00:10,667
Learning objectives are to define haplotype blocks or

4
00:00:10,667 --> 00:00:15,145
LD blocks, and describe how they are distributed across chromosomes.

5
00:00:15,145 --> 00:00:19,874
To articulate how LD blocks allow researchers to capture information

6
00:00:19,874 --> 00:00:23,972
across the genome by genotyping only a small number of SNPs.

7
00:00:23,972 --> 00:00:28,585
And to describe the purpose of haplotype reference panels and

8
00:00:28,585 --> 00:00:30,688
list the features of a few examples.

9
00:00:31,345 --> 00:00:36,551
Haplotype blocks, or LD blocks, are regions of low recombination

10
00:00:36,551 --> 00:00:42,240
in the genome and they're punctuated by regions of high recombination.

11
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:47,258
So what we see if we look along the genome we have these regions,

12
00:00:47,258 --> 00:00:52,950
these haplotype blocks where you actually get conserved haplotype.

13
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:59,220
So let's say that you've got four snips in a row and some part of the chromosome.

14
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,849
You've got a snip that can have either an A or G allele, a snip that can have a C or

15
00:01:03,849 --> 00:01:06,960
an A, snip that can have TC or a snip that can have AC.

16
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,958
So what you find when you look in the population is you find chromosomes

17
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:16,967
that have A at snip one, C at snip two, T at snip three, A at snip four.

18
00:01:16,967 --> 00:01:21,669
And you find chromosomes that have G at snip one,

19
00:01:21,669 --> 00:01:25,240
A at snip two, C at snip three, etc.

20
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:31,054
And so if you look at the allele present on the chromosome at snip one,

21
00:01:31,054 --> 00:01:35,967
then you can predict what the person will have at snip two,

22
00:01:35,967 --> 00:01:38,791
at snip three, and at snip four.

23
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:43,432
These are conserved halfway types, and

24
00:01:43,432 --> 00:01:48,601
you don't see a lot of chromosomes that have mixed those.

25
00:01:48,601 --> 00:01:55,845
So you don't really see chromosomes very often have A, C, C, C, right?

26
00:01:55,845 --> 00:01:59,018
Remember we talked about haplotype and populations and

27
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:02,662
a lot of times you see less variation than what you would expect if

28
00:02:02,662 --> 00:02:05,505
there was recombination everywhere all the time.

29
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:10,111
So you'll have these conserved haplotypes then you'll have a spot in the genome that

30
00:02:10,111 --> 00:02:14,443
re-combines a lot, and then on the other side you'll have another conserved set

31
00:02:14,443 --> 00:02:16,698
of haplotypes or another LD block.

32
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:21,160
Imagine that this is a chromosome, this is one arm of the chromosome and

33
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,891
you go along the chromosome.

34
00:02:22,891 --> 00:02:24,137
Here's the centromere and

35
00:02:24,137 --> 00:02:27,860
then there's the other arm of the chromosome going after that.

36
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:32,145
What I want to just show you is that you have these LD blocks or

37
00:02:32,145 --> 00:02:34,050
these haplotype blocks.

38
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,940
Then you have a recombination hotspots, then you'll have another block,

39
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,810
then another hot spot, etc.

40
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:44,249
And so what you see is you've got this area that is where the alleles

41
00:02:44,249 --> 00:02:47,680
are really strongly correlated with one another.

42
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,750
But the alleles in this haplotype block are not correlated with the alleles in

43
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:58,441
the next haplotype block because they're separated by that recombination hotspots.

44
00:02:58,533 --> 00:03:03,141
The LD blocks as I said have limited haplotype diversity.

45
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:07,615
So there's just a few haplotype that most chromosomes have if you look at them.

46
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,585
So the average size of the haplotype block in African ancestry chromosomes is about

47
00:03:13,585 --> 00:03:19,190
8 kilobases and it's about 22 kilobases in European ancestry chromosomes.

48
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:23,290
And remember that goes back to what we talked about before,

49
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:27,554
where in African ancestry you had a lot more generations, and

50
00:03:27,554 --> 00:03:32,980
all of those generations broke up any alleles that were strongly correlated.

51
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:37,313
And so the haplotype blocks tend to be smaller.

52
00:03:37,313 --> 00:03:42,385
And in European ancestry recall that that population started from a group

53
00:03:42,385 --> 00:03:47,560
that migrated out of Africa and didn't have the same amount of diversity.

54
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,001
And so their correlations among the alleles right next to each other

55
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:57,400
on the chromosomes there are longer haplotype blocks because

56
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,291
there's been less time to break those haplotypes up over time.

57
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:05,990
If we look at snips on a chromosome and

58
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:09,654
we look at our metrics of linkage disequilibrium,

59
00:04:09,654 --> 00:04:14,129
how do the LD blocks really look when you go across a chromosome?

60
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,661
On the top here is the r squared value for pairs of snips, and

61
00:04:18,661 --> 00:04:23,567
on the bottom is the D prime value for those same pairs of snips, and

62
00:04:23,567 --> 00:04:27,361
you've got snips growing across the middle here.

63
00:04:27,361 --> 00:04:29,881
This is snip one, snip two, snip three,

64
00:04:29,881 --> 00:04:33,193
snip four all of these are snips along the chromosome.

65
00:04:33,193 --> 00:04:38,771
And each of these squares represents the value of the r squared or

66
00:04:38,771 --> 00:04:43,320
the value of the D prime for that pair of snips.

67
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,932
And the lighter colors are low linkage disequilibrium and

68
00:04:47,932 --> 00:04:52,380
the darker colors are higher linkage disequilibrium.

69
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:56,920
So what you can see is actually we have two haplotype blocks here.

70
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:01,485
This is the recombination hotspots between these two snips, and

71
00:05:01,485 --> 00:05:04,971
this group is in strong linkage disequilibrium.

72
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:08,560
This is a haplotype block and this is a haplotype block.

73
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,623
But you see that there's almost no correlation between snips and

74
00:05:11,623 --> 00:05:12,521
those two blocks.

75
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:14,480
You see how this part is all white here, and

76
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,101
that's because there's the recombination hotspots.

77
00:05:17,101 --> 00:05:22,044
So if we know information about someone's alleles at one of these snips,

78
00:05:22,044 --> 00:05:26,850
it gives us information about their alleles and all these other snips.

79
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:31,101
But it gives us no information about the alleles on this side

80
00:05:31,101 --> 00:05:34,130
of the recombination hotspots.

81
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:35,780
Same thing here.

82
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:39,725
If I know you're alleles this snip it might give me information about all

83
00:05:39,725 --> 00:05:42,330
of the snips that it's LD block or some of them.

84
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:46,867
But it gives me very little information about snips on the other side of that

85
00:05:46,867 --> 00:05:48,349
recombination hotspots.

86
00:05:48,534 --> 00:05:54,964
I want to also give you an example of the LD blocks on a particular chromosome.

87
00:05:54,964 --> 00:05:59,633
So this research was on chromosome 5q31.

88
00:05:59,633 --> 00:06:03,107
There was a gene there that was identified for Crohn's disease and

89
00:06:03,107 --> 00:06:06,591
the researchers at the time went in and tried to look at the region.

90
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:09,340
It was about 500 kilobases.

91
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:12,031
They used 103 common snip markers.

92
00:06:12,031 --> 00:06:17,421
So we're talking about snips with minor allele frequency greater than 5%,

93
00:06:17,421 --> 00:06:21,269
which was about one snip per 5 kb along the chromosome.

94
00:06:21,269 --> 00:06:25,655
And they looked at 129 trios, which means two parents and

95
00:06:25,655 --> 00:06:28,927
a child from European derived populations.

96
00:06:28,927 --> 00:06:28,945
Looking at the linkage disequilibrium blocks on chromosome 5q31,

97
00:06:35,448 --> 00:06:39,810
what we actually see is here is the chromosome.

98
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:43,180
Each of these hash marks represent the 50 kb region.

99
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:46,076
Here are the genes and you can see the genes,

100
00:06:46,076 --> 00:06:49,921
these are actually genes going in the forward direction.

101
00:06:49,921 --> 00:06:52,480
These are going in the opposite direction along the chromosome.

102
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,600
Here in the red is where all of the snips are.

103
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:02,760
Okay, then what you have is you actually have them divided into haplotype blocks.

104
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:08,040
So here's all the first one, two, three, four, five, six, seven snips, okay?

105
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:12,485
Here are the two different haplotype that are actually seen in

106
00:07:12,485 --> 00:07:15,665
the majority of chromosomes in this study.

107
00:07:15,665 --> 00:07:20,721
So you either have at those first seven or

108
00:07:20,721 --> 00:07:25,479
eight SNPs, GGA CAA CC haplotype, or

109
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:29,365
you have AA TT CG TG haplotype.

110
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:34,975
We don't actually see a lot of other combinations than those two haplotype for

111
00:07:34,975 --> 00:07:36,345
these eight SNPs.

112
00:07:36,345 --> 00:07:40,435
Then there's a recombination hotspots where the probability of

113
00:07:40,435 --> 00:07:42,524
recombination is about 6%.

114
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,991
Then you see another set of

115
00:07:46,537 --> 00:07:51,870
haplotype blocks, ATT ACG CCC AA.

116
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:56,580
Then the probability of recombining meaning somebody who has this

117
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:00,113
haplotype could either be this in the next block,

118
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:05,431
this one in the next block, or this one in the next block, is about 40%.

119
00:08:05,431 --> 00:08:10,452
So what you see is you've got these independent haplotype blocks

120
00:08:10,452 --> 00:08:15,310
where you've got only two or three or four common haplotypes.

121
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:18,680
And then the probability of switching between,

122
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:23,960
say you are the red haplotype here, now you're the green down here is 6%.

123
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:29,421
And then in this hotspot it's 40%, and in this hot spot it's 33%, right?

124
00:08:29,421 --> 00:08:34,281
So historically, [COUGH] there's been a lot of recombination in these hotspots.

125
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:38,070
Some of the blocks are quite big.

126
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:43,950
So here's block seven, it's 92 kb and it's got quite a few SNPs in it.

127
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:47,216
And so if you know somebody's genotype at one of these SNPs,

128
00:08:47,216 --> 00:08:51,607
you can pretty well predict their genotype at all of the SNPs around them.

129
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:57,522
The block size here, you can see is between 3 kb and 92 kb, and these common

130
00:08:57,522 --> 00:09:03,620
haplotype that are listed here are observed between 90 and 98% of the time.

131
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:08,198
So you could even imagine how many possible haplotypes could exist for

132
00:09:08,198 --> 00:09:12,852
block seven, but we only really see about four of them because just this

133
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:18,304
region historically, over time there has been very little recombination.

134
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:24,110
Well, why do we really care about haplotype blocks?

135
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:29,189
One really important reason why we care about haplotype blocks is that if we

136
00:09:29,189 --> 00:09:34,588
know that there are certain SNPs where the alleles are correlated with the other

137
00:09:34,588 --> 00:09:39,744
alleles around them, we actually only have to measure one of the SNPs in that

138
00:09:39,744 --> 00:09:44,451
haplotype block to be able to infer the genotypes of all the other SNPs.

139
00:09:44,607 --> 00:09:50,206
Here we're looking at 147 common SNPs, and the SNPs,

140
00:09:50,206 --> 00:09:56,046
this is the location along the chromosome here on the Y axis.

141
00:09:56,046 --> 00:10:01,543
And the SNPs are given by each of these little dots

142
00:10:01,543 --> 00:10:06,840
basically where it could be blue or yellow.

143
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:13,020
And then along the Y axis here will say are the different samples.

144
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:17,943
This first column of boxes is person one, the second column

145
00:10:17,943 --> 00:10:22,754
of boxes is person two, the third column is person three.

146
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:26,946
It's color coded so that the blue boxes are the major allele and

147
00:10:26,946 --> 00:10:31,370
the yellow boxes are the minor allele for that SNP of interest.

148
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:34,930
These black lines are delineating haplotype blocks.

149
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:38,910
So these snips right here are a haplotype block.

150
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:42,810
These snips right here are a haplotype block and these are a haplotype block.

151
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:46,521
And the black lines are where recombination has happened historically.

152
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,803
So if we look at this one, haplotype block here,

153
00:10:51,803 --> 00:10:55,340
it's 26 snips spanning about 19 kb.

154
00:10:55,340 --> 00:11:02,200
And these are people who had the most the seven most common haplotype.

155
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:07,202
So haplotype 1234567 for these 26

156
00:11:07,202 --> 00:11:13,300
snips there were five people that had haplotype one.

157
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,839
There were four people that had haplotype two for example, and

158
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:20,470
four that had haplotype three and four that had haplotype four.

159
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:24,142
So if you look at this at this first snip,

160
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:29,328
everybody in haplotype block one and four had a minor alil

161
00:11:29,328 --> 00:11:34,970
everybody in haplotype block two and three had a major lille.

162
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:37,339
Then look at the second snip blocks one and

163
00:11:37,339 --> 00:11:41,150
two had the major lille blocks three and four had the minor allele.

164
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:44,490
So if you genotype only these two snips and

165
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:49,261
you saw someone with a yellow snip one and a blue at snip two,

166
00:11:49,261 --> 00:11:54,700
you could infer all the rest of their genotype that all of these other

167
00:11:54,700 --> 00:12:00,260
snips most of the time and same thing for these other two hippo types.

168
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:04,082
You would have some error because there are a few other haplotype in

169
00:12:04,082 --> 00:12:07,031
the population but the error is very, very small.

170
00:12:07,031 --> 00:12:11,965
You'd be right for almost every snip and that's kind of the point is that these

171
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:16,598
two snips are what we call tag snips, if you genotype them and you know what

172
00:12:16,598 --> 00:12:21,270
someone has, it tags the variation in all of these other snips around it.

173
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:26,286
So you don't have to measure all of the snips, you just have to measure these two.

174
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:33,340
So we see how the work of genotyping can be reduced by considering Hepple types.

175
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:38,069
So what people did was that they started to develop what's known as

176
00:12:38,069 --> 00:12:40,280
haplotype reference panels.

177
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:45,046
And the purpose of these is to catalog the DNA sequence variation across

178
00:12:45,046 --> 00:12:49,812
the genome and determine how the variants are distributed among people

179
00:12:49,812 --> 00:12:52,617
within populations and among populations.

180
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:57,424
This will allow us to be able to efficiently choose tag snips that identify

181
00:12:57,424 --> 00:12:59,810
common haplotype in the population.

182
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:05,740
And then once that's done, the data can be made publicly available for researchers.

183
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,856
So we can just genotype a few steps and

184
00:13:07,856 --> 00:13:11,517
then be able to know the genotype of the snips around them.

185
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:15,840
The first major reference panel is called hat map phase two.

186
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:22,580
This is 270 individuals genotype from four different representative populations.

187
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:27,156
So you had 30 trios from the Yoruban population of Nigeria,

188
00:13:27,156 --> 00:13:32,886
30 trios from the US with European origin and they were selected from Utah.

189
00:13:32,886 --> 00:13:35,175
These are called the sef Europeans.

190
00:13:35,175 --> 00:13:39,656
45 unrelated japanese individuals from Tokyo japan and

191
00:13:39,656 --> 00:13:44,910
45 unrelated han chinese individuals from Beijing china.

192
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:49,767
These groups were selected because they were

193
00:13:49,767 --> 00:13:54,878
the best representation we had in terms of major

194
00:13:54,878 --> 00:14:00,150
ancestry from africa, europe japan and china.

195
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:05,490
So what they wanted to do was they just used these individuals,

196
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:10,965
they Jenna typed 3.1 million snips in all of these people.

197
00:14:10,965 --> 00:14:15,826
And they found that 500,000 snips captured most of the common

198
00:14:15,826 --> 00:14:21,189
variants in most of the populations and that you actually needed one million

199
00:14:21,189 --> 00:14:27,210
tag snips to capture most common variants in the European population.

200
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:32,346
So the population from africa, you actually need more tag snips to capture

201
00:14:32,346 --> 00:14:38,700
most of the common variants from that population because it's more diverse.

202
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:42,050
Next was the 1000 genomes project.

203
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:45,241
And this used sequencing technology instead of genotyping.

204
00:14:45,241 --> 00:14:50,003
So sequencing means your DNA measuring the DNA base at every single

205
00:14:50,003 --> 00:14:51,890
base in the human genome.

206
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:56,695
And so they determined happily types for the common variants or snips and

207
00:14:56,695 --> 00:15:01,270
more rare variants across the genome of about 2500 people.

208
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:05,756
And they wanted to identify any genetic variants that have frequencies of at

209
00:15:05,756 --> 00:15:09,140
least 1% in the populations that they were looking at.

210
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:13,817
And they tried to choose different populations from East Asian,

211
00:15:13,817 --> 00:15:17,920
South Asian African, European and American ancestry.

212
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,830
So they did a little bit better job of capturing population diversity.

213
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:25,333
They also had a much bigger sample and

214
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:29,545
they identified tens of millions of genetic variants.

215
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:34,475
The most recent reference panels include the haplotype

216
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:37,240
reference consortium or the HRC.

217
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,200
And the top made reference panel.

218
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,850
So HRC is about 32,000 people.

219
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:47,338
It includes data from the 1000 genomes project as well as some haplotype from

220
00:15:47,338 --> 00:15:49,790
people with primarily european ancestry.

221
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:54,340
So this was one of the best reference panels for european ancestry.

222
00:15:54,340 --> 00:16:00,681
The National Heart, lung and blood Institute has transcript Mix for

223
00:16:00,681 --> 00:16:04,610
precision Medicine, Top Med Initiative.

224
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:09,460
This includes now over 100,000 people from multiple ethnic groups and

225
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:12,560
it's identified over 308 million variants.

226
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,969
And so these haplotype panels have really expanded in the last 10 years and

227
00:16:17,969 --> 00:16:22,701
they are doing a better job of capturing diversity from a variety of

228
00:16:22,701 --> 00:16:25,680
different ancestral groups.

229
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,596
We can also use them to look at linkage disequilibrium for

230
00:16:29,596 --> 00:16:32,461
both common variants and rare variants.
