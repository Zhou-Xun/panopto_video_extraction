00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:07,600
Welcome to Epit 634 as module on the S.A.S. model.

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:15,510
In this module, I will introduce the S.A.S. model where susceptible individuals are infected through contact with those that are infectious.

3
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,200
When the infectious recovery cover,

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:25,270
they move back to the central state and therefore there is no conferred immunity in this model to learning objectives of this

5
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:35,610
module are to one analyze and S.A.S. transmission model and to identify the dynamic properties of an SARS transmission model.

6
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:43,510
The S.A.S. model has two state variables. The fraction of people susceptible and the fraction of people infectious.

7
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:51,910
These state variables increase or decrease over time based on the values of the rate parameters.

8
00:00:51,910 --> 00:01:06,740
There are three parameters in the SARS model. The first is the birth and death rate parameter, which is which are assumed to be equal in this model.

9
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:12,820
We make this simplifying assumption to model the population that remains constant.

10
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:21,730
To remodel a population that remains constant, one over the death rate is equal to the mean life expectancy often measured in years.

11
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:26,960
The second parameter is the recovery rate, where one over the recovery rate is equal to the meantime.

12
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:34,330
Some was his infectious. These two parameters both have units of per time.

13
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:45,610
The third parameter is the transmission rate parameter of data Beda has units of number of new infections per susceptible per time.

14
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:57,640
As we've talked about before, each equation for the ISIS model describes the forces that cause a state variable to increase or decrease.

15
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:05,770
So we have the birth rate parameter MUE. This is a per capita birth rate as used in the population growth models.

16
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:12,460
Normally this means that the growth parameter is multiplied by the current population size.

17
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:20,680
Since people in both the S and ICE date can give rise to new births and all new born children are born into sepals date,

18
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:29,080
we'd expect that new should be multiplied multiplied by X plus high, since the units of asinine are fractions in this model.

19
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:36,400
And since we are modeling a closed population where births equals death s plus I equals one.

20
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,130
The death rate, on the other hand, that death rate parameter, on the other hand,

21
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:48,220
is multiplied by one state variable, depending on the equation, either S or I.

22
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:57,220
Likewise, the recovery rate parameter that has units of per time is multiplied by the eyes state variable.

23
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:06,840
Finally, the transmission rate parameter is part of the mass action term where s is multiplied by the eyes date.

24
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:18,310
There's also always assumptions that go into models here we are assuming that the population stays constant, so the birth to that birth equals deaths.

25
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:21,530
We are also assuming that populations are homogeneous.

26
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:28,010
Therefore, there are no distinctions between the individuals except with respect to our state variables.

27
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:35,900
That is whether someone is susceptible or infectious. Lastly, we assume that we have a close population.

28
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:42,770
Population is constant with anybody entering into the population equaling those that leave.

29
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:48,980
That is, the birth rate is equal to the death rate.

30
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:55,190
Although we are using fractions in this model, you will find that many models use numbers to some degree.

31
00:03:55,190 --> 00:04:05,270
This is a personal preference. We will see later that in the course, later in this course that there are times we're using numbers makes more sense.

32
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:16,520
So in this slide, I would I want to provide you with a way to convert fractions to numbers and show how that will change the equations.

33
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:28,150
First, let's define arsenide as variables in units of fractions and seven and I seven as units as variables with the units of numbers.

34
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:38,240
So to convert between the two, we simply multiply cast by the total number, the total population, and that converts from fractions to numbers.

35
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:44,780
Then s seven plus seven equals and the total population.

36
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:51,720
So now let's replace arsenide with S7 and I seven.

37
00:04:51,720 --> 00:05:00,840
That means that anytime you use an S and S in the upper right hand equation, we substituted with S seven divided by N.

38
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:06,210
We do the same with high and we wind up with these equations.

39
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:16,190
If we multiply every term by N, we then get a simplified set of equations.

40
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:24,530
We see that now Beit is equal to battle over any and all of the other parameters remain the same.

41
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:33,460
We also see that the birthrate term MUE is now multiplied by.

42
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:38,380
So now we are ready to analyze this model by conducting our steady state analysis.

43
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:50,910
Our first step is to calculate the null clients. The s no clines are conditions where DST equals zero.

44
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:57,960
When we do the algebra on the on the upper right hand equation, we get one condition.

45
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:11,820
Which is a monotonically decreasing function that with increasing I the I know Clines conditions where DADT equals zero results in two conditions.

46
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:16,800
One is a vertical line along the X axis, I equals zero.

47
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:24,400
And the other is a horizontal line, a constant value of S.

48
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:31,180
So these are there these are no lines. The conditions were one of the state variables is not changing.

49
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:42,430
Next, let's plot the know clients to see where they intersect, indicating conditions where both DST and DADT equals zero.

50
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:49,180
The solid yellow line. In this in this graph is the Yes.

51
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:56,630
Klein and the dotted yellow line yellow lines are the I know Clines.

52
00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:03,830
The SNL Kline is monotonically decreasing. We can sketch this point by noting that I equals zero.

53
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:16,200
That ad equals zero s equals one. And as I increases to a very large value mue the term, the new terms are negligent.

54
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:27,060
And as a proximately equals Gamow over Beda, this means that the curve decreases and asymptote to a constant value that is greater than zero.

55
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:35,190
And that is also smaller than the S equals gamma plus mbewe overbaked of value.

56
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:42,810
The two know Clines consist of vertical lines on the y axis and the horizontal axis.

57
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:48,930
Here we can observe two points of intersection. One where X equals one and I equals zero.

58
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:58,290
And another where X equals Gamma plus mbewe of her PDA and eye is some value greater than zero.

59
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:06,660
These two points represent the equilibrium points. So this plot.

60
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:15,400
That uses an x y axis is called the face portrait.

61
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:24,350
So one of our own. So one of our equilibrium points. Represents elimination.

62
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:44,180
I equals zero and S equals one. The other represents an endemic condition where X equals gamma plus mbewe over beta and AI is greater than zero.

63
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:51,800
In this configuration shown in the graph, the elimination equilibrium point is unstable.

64
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,690
What do we mean by this?

65
00:08:53,690 --> 00:09:05,020
It means in a small that it means that a small introduction of infected individuals will result in a movement away from elimination.

66
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:11,570
The elimination point towards the endemic equilibrium point.

67
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:17,990
On the other hand, the endemic equilibrium point is stable. So what do we mean by this?

68
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:27,310
It means that a small increase or decrease in cases will result in a movement back to the endemic solution.

69
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:38,290
An important condition to note here is that the horizontal line as equals gamma plus new over data is less than one.

70
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:48,290
It is precisely this condition that produces a solution with the stable equilibrium point being the endemic condition.

71
00:09:48,290 --> 00:10:01,830
We can also solve for the endemic level high. Which here is equal to Beda minus new plus gamma over Beda.

72
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:06,240
What happens if Gamma plus mew over EBITA is greater than one?

73
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:13,560
Now there is only one equilibrium point representing elimination where I equals zero and X equals one.

74
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:23,540
Under this condition, this one equilibrium point is stable. How can we better understand this ratio, Gamma?

75
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:34,550
Plus, new Overbay to. The numerator Gamma Plus Mbewe represents the rate of leaving the infectious state.

76
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:40,700
You can leave the infectious state by either dying or leaving the risk group or by recovering.

77
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,550
This is represented by summing the two rates.

78
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:50,090
The denominator represents the rate of entering the infectious state, which is only through transmission.

79
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:58,880
If the rate of leaving the infectious state is greater than the rate of entering the infectious state, then the disease cannot be sustained.

80
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,130
Therefore, the pathogen is eliminated.

81
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:12,550
If the rate of leaving is greater than the rate of entering or if the ratio gamma plus me over Beda is greater than one.

82
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:19,930
So let's summarize what we have learned. The S.A.S. model has two regimes.

83
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:25,440
One, when GAMBO plus MUE is greater than zero. Greater than one.

84
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:35,350
This regime is only in this regime there's only one equilibrium point representing elimination.

85
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:41,470
The other regime is when Gamma Plus mbewe over Beda is less than one in this regime.

86
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:47,170
There are two equilibrium points. But the only but only one stable one is stable.

87
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:56,650
The elimination equilibrium point is now unstable and the endemic equilibrium point is stable.

88
00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:00,060
We take the inverse of our horizontal.

89
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:09,170
No, Klein, which is Gambo plus me over Bita, our threshold criteria now becomes the condition in which bita over Gamma.

90
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:23,140
Over Gamla plus MUE. Becomes a condition beater over Gamla plus Mew, and if this condition is greater than one, we have an endemic condition.

91
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:29,300
It is this right here. Criteria that is called the reproductive number are not.

92
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:34,010
So that when our not is greater than one, we have sustained transmission.

93
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:41,170
We'll talk a lot more about our not when we introduce other transmission models in the coming weeks.

94
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:52,180
So I want to end this module by talking about notation from the literature has code uses land there rather than data for the transmission rate.

95
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:59,460
He refers to Lambda as a contact rate and Lambda over Gamma Plus MEU is a contact number.

96
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:07,530
Most others in the literature, if you refer to Beda over Gamow plus U times N as a reproductive number,

97
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:14,610
state variables can either be represented as fractions or numbers, as we talked about earlier in this class.

98
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:24,720
We will stick with the more common notation. Beda is the transmission rate parameter bita over Gamma plus Mbewe is the reproductive number.

99
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:32,481
We'll sometimes use fractions and sometimes use numbers.
