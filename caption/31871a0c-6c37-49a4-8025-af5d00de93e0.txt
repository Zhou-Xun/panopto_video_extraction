1
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:25,030
Okay. Let's get started. Uh, I'm going to send an announcement today based on the results from our random draw.

2
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:30,800
Okay. So this is.

3
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:35,620
Tell them I populated from group 1 to 15.

4
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:47,230
If there if there is a group who needs to need to split their presentation to a separate presentation for whatever region.

5
00:00:48,230 --> 00:01:01,090
You know, each group will be splitting that slide with half and half or proportional to the number of number of members, whichever agreed upon.

6
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:07,330
Okay. So. So keep it with that in mind.

7
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:14,630
Uh. Yeah. I'll just do that right now.

8
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:19,130
Okay. And get the course started so randomize.

9
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:29,060
And this is the result. Okay. But I'm going to go in, paste and make announcements so that you can see that.

10
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,010
Okay. So I already got the message.

11
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:40,010
First aid groups goes to the one. Uh.

12
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,890
The. The. The.

13
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:54,180
The last six seven groups goes to they two and.

14
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:01,280
It's so it's a strict, you know, upper limit is 10 minutes.

15
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:08,270
So we need to keep exactly 10 minutes because the class time is exactly eight, 8 minutes.

16
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,260
And and it's going to be projected from my computer in the slide at all,

17
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:26,510
regardless whether you're doing that they want or the two presentation slides are all due by Sunday night.

18
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:33,070
So I think there might be some problems like, you know, someone,

19
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:39,950
someone could go get tested positive or that there could be a lot of different things that could be happening.

20
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:45,740
It's okay if you your group decide to not to.

21
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:53,420
So we recommend to every member, you know, stand up and present together.

22
00:02:54,170 --> 00:03:04,850
But if that's not feasible or if that's not going to be efficient, it's okay to just designate one person to present everything that's okay.

23
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:14,629
Um, yeah. In they'll be session that there will be time that students will actually will also participate in the grading.

24
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:25,430
So I'll mention that our our district how to do that by yeah when the the same

25
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:31,010
announcement before the class starts and we're going to start exactly 830.

26
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:35,110
Uh. Yeah. Next next week.

27
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:40,880
Okay. Any any questions for the final presentation?

28
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:47,010
So in the foil pilot project, obviously your final project you is at 16.

29
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:51,190
So this is just your reporting, your progress.

30
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:56,000
So in know, so it's obviously better if you finish up,

31
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:04,060
finish as much as you can and show some interesting result because this is a presentation, you know, there should be a fun part.

32
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:08,350
So if you just talk about the idea, then don't show any of the results.

33
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:17,590
That'll be a little bit boring. But, you know, this is and this will be the part of the grading based on the how you know,

34
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:29,979
how well the content was presented and how how how much, you know, challenging and was challenging.

35
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:36,639
The problem was and how well those problems are solved at the time of the presentation.

36
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:42,760
But, you know, this is not going to be required to finish everything.

37
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:52,120
So we're not going to going to be assessing the completeness based on the, you know, the your presentation content.

38
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,650
So it's okay if you're not finished some part.

39
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:04,510
You just need to say that this part is still ongoing and it's going to be included in the final, final paper.

40
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:09,160
Okay. So, you know, that's what I expect.

41
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:18,100
And if you have any other questions, feel free to let me know your questions.

42
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:31,810
Okay. So then today is probably the last didactic lecture and.

43
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:45,590
I'll just pick out the jacket. So we're going to run about 50 today.

44
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:55,400
Okay. So. And, well, I'm teaching f f key because I think it's important.

45
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:06,740
Um, there are actually these f f tr regime is famous enough that the famous YouTubers already made quite interesting, quite useful videos.

46
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:12,470
So I am just putting two examples here.

47
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:16,130
So, uh, this one is a very Tashjian.

48
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,400
Uh. A video.

49
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,790
This. So each of them are 30 minutes.

50
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:30,630
So maybe if I play, play, play each of them and you know that that'll be probably more informative in some sense,

51
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:37,679
but you can watch it at home, so I'm not going to do that. So both videos.

52
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:49,770
Excellent. I in email in my view and they they all they all emphasize the why why these are important so.

53
00:06:51,210 --> 00:07:00,780
Okay and the very touching video talk some more about the historical background why this was a timely and important and so on.

54
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:06,260
So it, it, it, it, it describes the algorithm conceptually.

55
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:13,139
So if you are if you are not very many person, try to understand how that works conceptually.

56
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:18,330
This video would be good. This video from reducible.

57
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:27,750
I think this actually has a really good visualization and all the implement, all the explanation of the algorithm.

58
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:30,749
So actually if we just watch this for 30 minutes,

59
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:36,870
I guess actually that's probably better than me doing the lecture without doing all these animations.

60
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:50,280
But I'll, I'll try, I'll try to explain and I get some more, get the benefit of the live lecture, but I strongly recommend those two videos.

61
00:07:50,790 --> 00:08:01,199
I'm not going to play that now. Okay. So now we're going to do some, some exercises and that's that's, that's all we have.

62
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:08,310
So we can we may be able to finish a little early today if that all works as planned.

63
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:16,200
Planned. So it's a beautiful and useful algorithm that is mostly widely used in the signal processing,

64
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:24,179
but also it is useful for many areas and including the statistics, statistical inference.

65
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:32,700
So especially when you need some user computation of some probability that when you deal with the very sparse data and so on,

66
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:38,969
I suspect that you are going to need something like this. So I mean,

67
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:50,670
you can use it so and there is a huge benefit of using this algorithm compared to the typical way to do this convolution or polynomial multiplication.

68
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,590
So we can talk about that.

69
00:08:52,620 --> 00:09:01,649
But I believe that, you know, I'm not and I don't have an immediate, you know, use case for your particular research interests.

70
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:08,220
But my my sense is that this is going to be useful in in many different areas.

71
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:16,169
It potentially, if you know, these are ways you could use it and how to use it, there could be a lot of different places that you can plug.

72
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:23,010
This is always the mean. So I thought this problem is taking too long, but suddenly big becomes so fast.

73
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:24,630
And that's what I'm hoping to happen.

74
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:39,599
Okay, so and we, we talked about this polynomial last time, so in last lecture we did this so that this is so, so, so straightforward.

75
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,700
So I'm going to just explain very briefly.

76
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:53,250
So, so well, FFO is not necessarily restricted to polynomial multiplication, but we're going to start with a polynomial multiplication problem.

77
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:59,790
Okay. So polynomial multiplication problem is defined this way.

78
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:06,720
So you have. So you have this polynomial.

79
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:13,450
Polynomial. Any polynomial has a list of the coefficients so you can most to send out.

80
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:19,830
The way to represent the polynomial is a represent the polynomial using coefficient representation.

81
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:32,500
Right. Okay. But then how do you evaluate the polynomial so you can evaluate the polynomial in a very naive way by just evaluating this.

82
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:40,340
This will take order of square. But if you use this wholeness role where you expand the polynomial in this recursive formula,

83
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:45,870
it it'll be because you don't need to multiply itself j multiple times that for

84
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:53,630
where it's a term this can be calculated order in order of end time complexity.

85
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:58,010
Okay, so we already learned about this before.

86
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:03,800
So here, here is the operation we want to do.

87
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:23,810
So we want to multiply polynomial. So, so what when you multiply polynomial, what, what you have is you have a zero plus a1 x plus eight to x squared,

88
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:40,399
but that's not a a and minus one X of minus one and you have b1, b2 xb2x squared B in the last one x.

89
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:45,290
So and you want to multiply it. Okay. So how do you do it.

90
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:54,830
Well, so let's plus think about the getting the term for that, getting the term for X of J.

91
00:11:55,250 --> 00:12:01,610
Okay. So let's say you want to calculate the C of G, okay.

92
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:11,000
So your term. Okay, then this, this, this is basically you can you can think about this way no matter.

93
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:17,990
So whenever I have a pair here, so you actually are, you can move this one equation one by one.

94
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:22,819
So it used to start from start this equation from it at the end and then try to move one by

95
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:33,720
one and try try to multiply each overlapping term and you keep adding them up to shift.

96
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:43,669
And that's, that's, that's how you can calculate the one way to calculate the polynomial.

97
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:48,260
So in this case what you can do is that so it it,

98
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:54,710
it's a it's a little tricky depending on the what the chain what the chain region, what the chain looks like.

99
00:12:55,280 --> 00:13:03,290
But let's say just a relatively small number, then what you have is a zero times b.J, B, J, whatever,

100
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:15,050
g's and A1 times b j minus one a two times G minus two that at the end of a j b, you know.

101
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:22,880
So you need to calculate this value, okay, to get the coefficient for the x to the g turn.

102
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:27,050
Right. So this is what it is.

103
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:34,790
Good. So, so you can, you can write the equation in this way.

104
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:43,070
There is a one, one small problem where if you write this way, if you go to K equals zero to J,

105
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:53,749
and if J becomes relatively large number so the so if it could,

106
00:13:53,750 --> 00:14:03,230
it could happen that for example, if a J is greater than M because you have a distinctive M, right?

107
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:17,990
So let's suppose they just put in and so then so so if, if J is greater than the degree of M and or M, then this could go negative, right?

108
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:27,530
So this term, this term going to be greater than n what this term could be sometimes going, you know,

109
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:33,350
so some of them could be greater than put it in RN or greater than M,

110
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:42,380
but we can consider just the expanding this as a00 times X to the and zero times x to the plus one.

111
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:48,859
So until zero times extra and plus and minus two.

112
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:56,240
Right. And this is the same zero times six to the M, zero times X to the end plus one.

113
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:07,280
So zero times X to the present minus two. So if you assume that everything not observe the zero, then this simple summation should work.

114
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:13,160
Okay, so this operation is often called convolution and we're going to get into that.

115
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:17,599
Okay, now how do we do this calculation efficiently?

116
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,380
So that's the question we're going to address today.

117
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:31,180
So. So to to understand how to do that, we need to understand what the complexity is first.

118
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:41,960
And what do you think the complexity of the calculating this. For each of term, you're doing the summation, right?

119
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:53,180
So summation can be can be done up to, you know, up to and different combinations.

120
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:58,340
So this is a lovely order when each each of a calculation order in.

121
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:03,560
But you need to do this calculation multiple times across all different end observations.

122
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:18,950
So, so the other order of so if both of them are oh degree of pn the time complexity order of n square,

123
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:26,090
if one is the order of N or the other is order of the time complex, should it be order of rn times m.

124
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,880
So, you know, this is not too slow.

125
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:38,130
This is not exponential or volume at least. But sometimes you may believe it or not.

126
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:46,010
You may want to do this kind of operation for thousands of degrees, sometimes get so or millions of points, sometimes so.

127
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:49,420
In that case, this just doesn't work anymore.

128
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:52,610
So that's that's what we're going to get into. Okay.

129
00:16:54,020 --> 00:17:06,530
So to understand how f t can solve this problem, we're going to learn about the point value representation.

130
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,940
Okay. So coefficient of representation, we learn that.

131
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:13,550
So when you have a polynomial, if you know the all the list of the point,

132
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:21,770
the coefficient of coefficient representation point of value of representation is that instead of storing

133
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:33,829
the points I can store and minus one distinct well and also for m different input and different pairs

134
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:44,630
of x and y so and different points then those are sufficient number of points to be able to construct

135
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:51,350
the RN minus one degree polynomial unless there is some redundancy in the information that is given.

136
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:57,440
Okay. So this is a call to point value of representation.

137
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:09,170
Okay. So all so then there is if you know all these points, you should be able to get the coefficient representation.

138
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:14,540
So the having having coefficient representation and the having point value of your

139
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:20,000
opinion tation doesn't matter mathematically as long as you have one or the other.

140
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:26,360
But computationally could matter so well.

141
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:31,910
So now we're talking about the getting the point value representation.

142
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,690
Okay. So, well,

143
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:47,240
if we decide to store the store some polynomial using point of our representation

144
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:52,570
right then in coefficient representation you need to store two and pairs of numbers.

145
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:58,459
Right. So I mean it's, it's unclear why we want to do that, but if we,

146
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:05,570
but we also need to do the computation, we need to calculate y you know, y1y and minus one.

147
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:12,350
All these points, right, to, in evaluating all these points is a computation already taking time.

148
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:16,640
So how much time does it take to evaluate each of them?

149
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:25,970
So evaluating each of them takes order of and operations.

150
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,990
Okay. But we need to evaluate and different points.

151
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,860
So that means that we will need to calculate.

152
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:42,170
We will need the order of and square time complexity to evaluate and different points.

153
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:45,860
Okay. So this is already time consuming.

154
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:51,140
So. Well, to convert the convert the coefficient representation.

155
00:19:51,530 --> 00:20:08,750
A zero. A one that that that a n minus one to you know, point value representation x1010x1y1x and minus one, y minus one.

156
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:12,500
So this already takes a little revised period. Right.

157
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:25,910
And so then later, if you have a point, point representation to it, so point the representation to convert to the coefficient representation.

158
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:30,170
Well, this will also take time.

159
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:36,810
So this seems like a not very efficient way to do it. But you know, this this is what is recommended now.

160
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:39,710
So let's let's think about it.

161
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:49,040
So it doesn't seem very needed to calculate this much faster than other events because the other end is already pretty efficient.

162
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:52,790
So how do we do it faster? So that that's a mystery.

163
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:56,710
But let's let's let's set it aside. Okay.

164
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:08,330
And now the other problem. If you have a point representation and try to go through point coefficient representation, how do you do it?

165
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,990
Well, we learned this then the modal matrix.

166
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:17,240
Okay. If we have a random of the matrix, you can calculate.

167
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:26,330
You can have this and you can multiply the inverse of them with the matrix and you can get the coefficient from these x y pairs.

168
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:34,040
But this is, this involves the matrix multiplication, which means that approximately takes the order of and cubic time.

169
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:38,330
So this is not the fastest way to do it.

170
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:47,390
Okay. There is a faster way to do it, which is a using Lagrangian formula.

171
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:55,450
Okay. So this formula allows us to evaluate this is the order of square.

172
00:21:55,500 --> 00:22:09,970
So how does it work? So basically the way how this works is that you so you have all this y's.

173
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:14,540
Why is an x is so you can represent a of X in this way.

174
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:25,040
Right. So because of the, the polynomial you want to have is that you want to make sure that it passes through.

175
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:35,120
These are equal the point x x x x or y zero in x one, y one and so on.

176
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:46,190
So for each of those pairs, you just want to make sure that when, when x, x, x x, you know, you want to make sure that this value is y zero.

177
00:22:46,760 --> 00:23:04,750
So to, you know, the way to ensure that is that, you know, we want to ensure that is like let's put 4xx2x here right then for all.

178
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:08,960
So this is all, all GK pairs that are not the same.

179
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:18,770
You're just multiplying them. But that and everything will cancels out if you put, put some number that is actually exactly 0x1, xx2 and so on.

180
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:31,220
So that, that means that whenever you have the value of x x equals zero, either the value will be like y zero and x one, y, y one and so on.

181
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:36,110
So it's possible to calculate this thing in a otherwise square.

182
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:42,440
The problem is that this seems like numerically very unstable because it involves a lot of multiplication.

183
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:50,149
So that that is another challenge. Okay. So so you can't.

184
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:54,800
But if you have this equation, you can expand this equation in order to ask for time.

185
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,340
So this is also a fun problem to work on.

186
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:06,650
And I'm not going to teach today, but this is this is a this is an interesting way to do it in the otherwise pure.

187
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:18,770
But we're not interested in the other curve because a just straightforward way to do this calculation from basically we have a two coefficient.

188
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:27,230
Uh coefficient representation you want you to multiply that we already have on order of garbage and we

189
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:32,600
already talked about you just need to do the go to the loop and calculate the convolution for each of them.

190
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:43,320
Right. So, uh, so, so this, this is the, uh.

191
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:53,220
So. So this is the first step for your transform algorithm to skin skin chemo, the first for you transformative rhythm.

192
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:59,920
Okay, so. Instead of.

193
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:12,320
So what? What he's trying to do is instead of doing this way, which takes a lot of insecure time, we are going to do the convert this into the point.

194
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:18,209
Point value of representation usually point to better representation.

195
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:27,380
We should think of other ways to secure time, but if we choose the point each of a point with a specific value,

196
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:32,000
there are actually complex numbers around the unit circle.

197
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:39,770
Then this you can actually evaluate this in the end lower end time complexity.

198
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:44,090
Okay. So that's that's that's the one one thing we wanted to get to.

199
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:53,210
Okay. So then so these are what is called discrete for your transform.

200
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:58,820
So, so, so it has named DFT, but it is part of the F 50.

201
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:07,520
And these once you have a point to point the representation, then now you have a two and different points.

202
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:13,700
So if you have a point y's representation so you getting getting both getting the

203
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:18,950
multiplied is super easy because you just need to multiply those each of the point.

204
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:32,390
Exit two multiplying two y values will be new y basically so so that that can be calculated in each of them can be calculated at constant time.

205
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:36,320
So this is the order of end time complexity.

206
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:46,970
Okay. And after that, if you have this point value representation in this particular angles of the unit circle,

207
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:57,710
then you can convert, convert them back to the coefficient representation also in the low end, low end time complex.

208
00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:04,069
So, well, so some of you might say what's the difference between that and low end and security?

209
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:11,040
Isn't it like trivial? We actually did this comparison in the sorting arboretum.

210
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:14,360
So you compare the merges sort and insertion sort.

211
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:22,069
And the other kind of sorting was insertion sort takes the end secured and merges sort of takes an end.

212
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:26,180
And we try tried with very large input and there's a huge difference.

213
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:33,650
So and low end is almost linear because Logan is very, very, you know, they're rapidly, rapidly decreasing.

214
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:37,520
So so it's almost different.

215
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:42,139
So it's not quite linear about the almost linear versus quadratic.

216
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:47,690
So it's actually very big difference with the simple set in size is very large.

217
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:58,459
Okay, so this is this is what we are going to do. So this looks like a detour, but this is a much faster way to go through than going this way.

218
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:04,700
That's why we are going through through this detour. Okay. Okay.

219
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:13,040
So the rest of it is quite, quite the math. But there is a the key parties requires the divide and conquer equations.

220
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:20,660
So. Okay. So I guess many of you are familiar with the complex root of unity already.

221
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:31,730
So when you have a unit circle, you can divide a unit circle into arbitrary pieces like this, usually by the power of two.

222
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:35,809
Is a is a good way to do so. In this case, it divides.

223
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:39,350
The unit angle is eight different angles.

224
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:47,810
Then each of them becomes and the root of unity means that meaning that each of these point on the unit circle,

225
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:53,960
if you take the A power eight, then they all become one, right?

226
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:59,330
So and you can do with any kind of PN in the similar way.

227
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:07,510
So when you have this, there is a some interesting fact about these complex opportunities.

228
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:25,310
So first, if you have any any route unity, if you want if you take Apollo RD, okay, that's that's also the route of the end.

229
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:29,860
But what it means is that. So, for example.

230
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:34,970
So this all of these values, all of these eight values.

231
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:41,750
Let's say you want to. Well, let me let me show.

232
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:45,530
Show, show. In the board.

233
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,540
So let's talk about.

234
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:02,660
Maybe start with to start with two.

235
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:10,620
Then you have this at this point at this point, right to point this this is a solution two points.

236
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:20,570
A solution of equals one. Right. But let's divide, divide, divide the two for now then.

237
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:27,810
Well, there is a new, new solution, but the existing solution still is the solution for the next to the four equal one.

238
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:32,879
Right. So the for this one, this is the first.

239
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:42,270
First, this is basically a solution. A solution, you know, and one and in this case, the solution, you know, and two.

240
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,520
And there is a there's a solution. One is solution.

241
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:54,270
Solution three exist. And if you make a divide more, then be these values.

242
00:30:54,270 --> 00:31:01,680
Now. Now, the oldest proposal written 10123 is a solution.

243
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:05,670
Is the solution for this a bigger problem?

244
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:14,970
And in the case that you know the solution because solutions you know for this problem solution one becomes solution to this problem.

245
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:20,070
Solution for solution six and so on. So that this always happens.

246
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:27,299
So this is why you're trying to say if it's okay solution in the in in the exit to the end

247
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:34,380
equal one problem then this is a decade solution in the X to the the and equal one problem.

248
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,160
Okay. So that that's one. Yeah. Sorry.

249
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:49,900
This is a11 fact. And the other fact is that, well, you know, this one, when it's an even number, this one is always solution.

250
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:58,090
Right. And this with this is always when there's a two and different number, this is always a solution.

251
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:06,380
So in a. So have.

252
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:14,240
So there are two dilemmas that we're going to use. So having lemma is that if and equal even the squares of.

253
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,810
So. So.

254
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:27,160
So if you if you take the scherzo or dissolution.

255
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:31,420
Okay. If you. So let's start with that.

256
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:35,400
So if you take the square of it, it stays here. Right.

257
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:39,490
This becomes a solution. So this becomes a solution.

258
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:47,530
What I was trying to do is that I'm going to take I'm going to square all the solution

259
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:56,880
of X eight equal N that becomes a solution that also becomes solution of X or equal.

260
00:32:56,890 --> 00:33:01,090
And because you were just trying to do to this.

261
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:07,120
So this one is the one if you take a spirit, it stays here.

262
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:11,679
If you take a square, it goes here. If you take the sphere.

263
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:15,220
Because here if you take the sphere of it, it goes here.

264
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:19,960
Okay. So if you take the square, it always lands here.

265
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:30,480
They become the it. If you take the square of this solution, it be always a solution of these have problems.

266
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:40,930
Okay. So this this is this is a this is important lemma to enable the divide and conquer language, basically.

267
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:46,149
And summation lemma is it's a relatively trivial.

268
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:53,290
But basically if you add all of them that the if you add all of them, it should add up to zero.

269
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:58,630
Okay. So so that's that.

270
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:14,299
Okay. Okay. So, so with that, the first thing we want to try is converting this point, this coefficient representation into a point of representation.

271
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:21,230
But those point variable representation is using these specific values of these omegas.

272
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:30,500
Okay. So, so we're going to, we're going to use these, these values to evaluate.

273
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:34,280
Then obviously we are going to be able to calculate this, right?

274
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,459
So we just need to calculate this. This is a complex number.

275
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:41,570
So it's a little complicated to calculate, but there is nothing wrong with it.

276
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:47,390
So, so we can store these values of y based on this.

277
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:55,850
And those values of y is called the f t of these coefficient representation.

278
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:00,740
Okay. So DFT is not an algorithm, therefore it is a representation.

279
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:09,140
So the representation is basically what we are doing is converting these

280
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:13,910
coefficient representation into point value representation that looks like this.

281
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:19,340
And we don't need an x value because the x values always DeepMind like this way.

282
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:26,360
Okay. Okay. So DFT is a specific instance of point value representation of a of x, okay.

283
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:28,940
Where the x values are predetermined.

284
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:48,080
Okay then this is the F of t, f of t is basically an algorithm that you can calculate the DFT in a and log in time complexity.

285
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:56,200
So how do we do it? Okay. So, um.

286
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:12,980
So if this is a recursive version of 50, so is a recursive 50.

287
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:23,300
Right. And this a divide and conquer algorithm. So what it does is that it takes it runs FFP twice for the half of the problem.

288
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:29,270
How do I. How do I divide the half of the problem? Well, I divide the problem into this way.

289
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:36,770
So if you have like let's say you you have eight different angles to to go through.

290
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:44,480
And I take all the even numbers here and I take all the odd numbers here.

291
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:48,140
Okay. So so that's how I divide it.

292
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:54,290
And the here the intuition is there.

293
00:36:54,530 --> 00:37:03,630
If you just multiply, w move. So multiply over here, then if it's shifted, that is exactly overlap.

294
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:09,800
So you can use some of the calculations so that that is the that is the intuition here.

295
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:21,410
Okay. So once you cut so basically you do this and assume that you already so when whenever you work with a divide and conquer with them,

296
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:33,770
you basically assume that, oh, even though I don't have a media solution, I can pretend that I have a 0.3 representing DFT of this coefficient.

297
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:39,140
I have a DFT of this coefficient and now I have to to sort of a points.

298
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:43,730
Right. I have a y value that correspond to this and labor in the correspond to this.

299
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:50,540
And I need to calculate the Y value for, for all these, all these eight points, basically.

300
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:58,120
Good. So I have a four values in this in this example over four values of y calculated.

301
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:05,020
I have one of the four values of y calculated. How do I how do I get the value?

302
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:08,540
Value for all all eight.

303
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:17,830
Okay. So this is how you do it. So well, let's go through 0020123440123.

304
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:26,590
What I'm going to do is that well, the first one I'm going to do is that I'm going to multiply this and I multiply the first solution here.

305
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:30,800
So I'm going to multiply this and a B solution together.

306
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:34,700
Then it'll make the first one.

307
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:40,040
Right. And I'm going to I'm going to I'm sorry,

308
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:56,840
I'm going to add so and this so so basically how this works is that you would have a solution for you have a solution for these two problems, right?

309
00:38:56,930 --> 00:39:06,080
So here. Okay. And so did you have a solution for these two separately?

310
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:09,830
So this is a from calculate from different coefficient.

311
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:16,100
So it must have. So you're evaluating different, different points.

312
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:19,450
But there's a y y you know,

313
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:36,830
y1y2 like three you have and you have ayy1 way to a three you have and this one is coming from a and a this is coming from B and what,

314
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:49,460
what, what this is doing is basically I, if I, if I, if I just add in a fifth this five omega,

315
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:55,340
then I'm going to basically get the value value for this one.

316
00:39:56,050 --> 00:40:03,740
Okay. And and I can also get the value for this one.

317
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:12,530
Okay. So I'm getting this one and this is one because these are symmetric that the reason this is symmetric is if this is omega,

318
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:17,720
this is negative omega because this is always hundred. So you're using this half lemma.

319
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:33,200
Okay. So, so if anything, even the squares of a and complex root are always the the the root the the root for the smaller problem.

320
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:48,440
Right. So you can you have so so you have the so you have a solution for this and that if you adjust it instead of instead of the adding,

321
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:55,430
instead of adding the W y of k of one, if you subtract them, if basically it does the quantity,

322
00:40:55,430 --> 00:41:02,780
the 80 degree, the rotation and you you have the value for.

323
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:07,330
For the other side. So you keep doing keep doing this.

324
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:10,690
So for the white one, actually.

325
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:15,950
So what it does. Sorry. What it does is.

326
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:25,120
Yeah. So if you the first one is a Y, you know, a plus W I do.

327
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:37,450
B and a second, second thing is a y, you know, B and awwy1b.

328
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,730
But why? Why, why what?

329
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:59,220
Why would a good why would be okay so if you if you calculate each of them this will be the solution for the scene.

330
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:06,630
So this is a solution for days and days.

331
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:17,630
Right. You know, if you if you as the first solution will become the solution for four days and this and that,

332
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:22,490
the third one be a solution for this and this important one, be a solution for this and this.

333
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:25,860
Okay. So, so that.

334
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:37,680
Yeah. Then that's, that's all because these have have having them where the solution for solution to have problem can be just,

335
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:45,660
you know, if you, if you basically multiply to it becomes the solution for these these four problems.

336
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:52,410
So you're just taking, taking it back so you're doing so this this was ay3.

337
00:42:52,500 --> 00:43:00,290
The Y three can if you have have them, then it goes to here is one goes to here and so on.

338
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:06,810
So it's a it's a little complicated to explain how that how they work without doing the visualization.

339
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:14,880
So that that's why I think that YouTube video would be very helpful to understand how exactly works.

340
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:19,530
But this is this is the combination part, basically.

341
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:32,760
Okay. So then, uh, so, so once you have this, this part, then this combination part is the order of end, right?

342
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:35,520
So if you think about the time complexity here,

343
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:47,590
then the time complexity of the KN is that your you are doing the over to problem solving the and over to problem and

344
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:57,090
you are solving order of M because this calculation is just a single loop order of and from order of and complexity.

345
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:01,800
So then the time, time complexity is the order of.

346
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:06,270
And again, if you remember how we do the through the time, time,

347
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:11,880
complex calculation in different cases, we learn this at the end of the divide and conquer algorithm.

348
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:18,180
So it's a basically these are the same it's same kind of algorithm that the board is sorted out.

349
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:28,919
So if you have a half and half and if you multiply, if you merge them together, it becomes you can merge them together in a linear time.

350
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:33,880
So it's exactly same problem. Okay. So.

351
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:39,420
So that's the that's the FFO algorithm. So FFO algorithm again.

352
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:51,760
So, you know, in a nutshell, it it kind of it well, it explains or it has a specific algorithm to convert this point,

353
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:58,749
this coefficient representation into point value representation in a specific w

354
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:04,360
so it's a discrete appropriate transform calculation in the analog and time.

355
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:12,130
And this, this only works actually when your input is a power of the power of two.

356
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:19,870
So in a if you have an input that is not a part of two, you need to expend that to become a power of two.

357
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:34,659
So. Well, now if you go back here, well now I get what this part is being done because now we learn that,

358
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:42,280
oh, this can be done with the DFT and we can do this calculation in the order of and Logan time.

359
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:48,730
Okay, I get that. Okay. But once you do this, how do we do?

360
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:53,350
How do we calculate them back? Okay, that's another problem, right?

361
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,920
So but that that problem is actually not that hard.

362
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:02,470
So this is a blend of all the metrics for DFT, okay.

363
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:11,860
If you look at this. So instead of instead of having x1x2 and X seven, X or Y minus one, we just have just a W of end here.

364
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:18,010
Okay. So that yeah, this is exactly the mode matrix.

365
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:27,400
Okay. So, and there's a lot of w when that you see interesting effect here is that this random what

366
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:33,219
the matrix is looks very symmetric and if you take the if you want to take the inverse,

367
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:38,830
what, what you need to do is just you know, you don't actually need to do that.

368
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:49,960
And to the cubic calculation, just you actually can, you have the, uh, the inverse matrix if you just do the,

369
00:46:50,890 --> 00:47:01,210
the take the inverse of each of the element in this way and you just need to multiply one over end to make it, make it identity matrix.

370
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:07,210
Okay, so which means that you just need to do this calculation for each of them.

371
00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:11,830
What you, what you need to calculate is just this simple, simple, this value.

372
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:12,370
Okay.

373
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:35,410
So, uh, well, so in this particular case, right, so this is also kind of DFT unless, unless, if you well and so except for this, this negative value.

374
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:43,570
So if you consider this a W and a negative one value, if you replace them to another new W of N,

375
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:50,470
right, then this becomes exactly DFT problem and you need to multiply one over N at the end.

376
00:47:50,830 --> 00:47:57,820
So that's, that's how this works. Okay. So you just need to apply for this one.

377
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:07,240
You can apply another part of the f of t r way then to multiply that to convert them into the DFT.

378
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:12,080
But just making sure that you have after after running this over you,

379
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:20,649
you multiply by one over n and make make sure that the replaced w of n2w of and w of n negative.

380
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:32,020
But this one is sort of not is it is kind of trivial because, you know, instead, instead of using this angle, you're basically using this angle.

381
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:41,020
So it is actually still everything works in the same way because you just change the direction from one way to the other.

382
00:48:44,770 --> 00:48:55,390
So, so going back here, so this part took a long time to understand how this, how the dividing can be used.

383
00:48:55,810 --> 00:49:05,080
But surprisingly, these are what can be also used to convert them back from the point of value representation to the coefficient representation,

384
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:08,620
which is actually very interesting part.

385
00:49:14,610 --> 00:49:20,310
So. So when you have.

386
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:31,770
Now we're going to point to the competitive. Okay. So when you have a C any any pairs of vector.

387
00:49:31,950 --> 00:49:37,740
Right. So you have a pair of vector of A and vector B again.

388
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:42,480
And with 88081883.

389
00:49:43,170 --> 00:49:47,460
Okay. And B, you know, B1, b2, b3.

390
00:49:48,450 --> 00:50:02,540
So a lot of cases you have this this case, basically, I want to cut, I would add a, B, you know, A1, B1 A to B to A3 three.

391
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:11,790
And I want to shift them once. Okay. So A1 82838881828330.

392
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:16,380
You want me to be three? I want to multiply them again.

393
00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:22,890
So this is, you know, a, it'll B one A1 be 28338.

394
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:30,570
And this is you get so many cases, you can't you keep calculating them, adding them.

395
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:40,110
Okay. So if you add them in together for all a possible shift, this becomes basically this kind of form.

396
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:46,680
Okay. And this kind of form is exactly the same formula we just looked at in the beginning.

397
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:56,670
This is actually the coefficient of the coefficient of two polynomial multiplication of two polynomials.

398
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:06,540
Right. So this is not just so this operation, when you have a two vectors and try to create a sweep through it,

399
00:51:06,690 --> 00:51:18,030
sweep through each of them and the sum some the older, all the pairwise multiplication and some sum them all.

400
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:24,780
So as a result, you will get a vector, larger vector, or you can, you can have a same size of vector.

401
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:33,950
So this operation is called a convolution. It may be some of some of you are familiar with a convolution in the deep neural network.

402
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,720
The convolution word is used a lot. Okay.

403
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:47,700
So in usually in a in the deep convolutional network, those convolution layer is very, very small, like usually three by three or five by five.

404
00:51:48,270 --> 00:51:55,740
So in that case, you don't need this kind of algorithm because a tiny complex is not that are not that large.

405
00:51:56,250 --> 00:52:06,030
But if you need to convoluted very large images or larger vectors or large amount of signals, these are these kind of operation is very, very useful.

406
00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:09,780
You know, used a lot, not just a polynomial multiplication.

407
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:19,350
Okay. So to do that now, because we have we have this routine.

408
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:25,290
So even though you you may not have understood how effective it actually worked,

409
00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:36,270
if you know that I can convert these, I can convert this coefficient representation to point the representation.

410
00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:45,200
And I can convert another in a vector as a, as a point of value.

411
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:48,420
The representation you already made to this step.

412
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:53,430
You need to multiply these two. To get to this step.

413
00:52:54,810 --> 00:52:58,049
And so multiply and convert them.

414
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:14,290
Convert them back. Okay. And this is how you can instead of doing this way, you can't you go this this route.

415
00:53:14,290 --> 00:53:17,290
But this is not a detour. This was actually a shortcut.

416
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:27,190
This way is faster. And and that's that's what this this convolution theorem says.

417
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:33,129
So you can do this calculation this way. And because of there's each step can be calculated.

418
00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:42,460
And again, you can cut all this step in and no one time complexity, which can make a huge difference in a large province.

419
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:52,370
Okay. So. So it's a it's a it's a really great thing.

420
00:53:52,370 --> 00:53:59,560
If you understood the all the details of their algorithm that that's really good and that that's what that's what I'm hoping for.

421
00:53:59,930 --> 00:54:07,760
But even if you do not understand some of the details, if you understand this, okay, I can.

422
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:12,690
So I have a few vectors I need to do the convolution operation.

423
00:54:12,730 --> 00:54:17,750
Operation. And sometimes it could take a really long if the vector is very long.

424
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:21,980
But I can use this only to make the conversion faster.

425
00:54:22,310 --> 00:54:30,860
That's what I exactly wanted you to learn. And that's the that's the today's example we're going to go through.

426
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:35,780
Okay. So let's go through this.

427
00:54:42,010 --> 00:54:46,690
So I hope that you still remembers.

428
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:55,740
Uh, why is that? Okay. I think I had.

429
00:54:55,770 --> 00:55:06,060
Okay. So we're going to revisit the problem in the we cover the homework to in homework to the problem with this.

430
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:15,060
Right. So you have X or Y follows up on only distribution and then each of them has a play which is given number.

431
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:25,440
Then what I'm interested in is to get the P probably mass function of Y, which is the which is a summation of X value.

432
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:29,520
So that value can have a02 and different,

433
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:39,420
so value from zero to N and the requirement is to calculate the order of insecure time complex solution using the dividing line.

434
00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:43,770
Right. And then if you check the solution.

435
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:47,460
But this was a solution. Okay, so.

436
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:59,500
So how how do how do you do it? Well, you have you have this vector of a binomial probability, right?

437
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:05,590
So if the vector is very small, so this is divide and conquer, you need to have a terminating condition.

438
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:13,440
So at the terminating condition, you have, uh, just a single number, single one, but only variable then.

439
00:56:13,450 --> 00:56:17,260
Well, the PMF is as so easy to calculate like this,

440
00:56:18,490 --> 00:56:25,630
but you can calculate these probabilities using the divide and conquer wisdom if the end is greater than one.

441
00:56:26,170 --> 00:56:31,600
How do you do it? Well, let's pick a midpoint and divide them into two different pieces.

442
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:36,430
And the less, let's say the length is and one and axes and two.

443
00:56:37,090 --> 00:56:44,800
Then here the. So basically what you have is that you have two values, right?

444
00:56:45,160 --> 00:57:00,390
You have. So in this case, let's say, you know, 818283 and B, you know, B1, B2, B3, let's say that each of them has a side to side of four.

445
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:14,250
Okay. Then what we need to do is to find to rate the multiplication, pairwise multiplication like this.

446
00:57:14,490 --> 00:57:27,390
Okay. Okay.

447
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:45,570
So you calculate all these, uh, uh, modifications to A to B, two pages to page 3813883.

448
00:57:47,290 --> 00:57:51,350
Then you need to come up with the seven different numbers.

449
00:57:51,370 --> 00:57:56,380
How do you get the seven different numbers? So. Well, this this is the probability.

450
00:57:56,470 --> 00:58:05,770
This is the probability that X equals zero. Right. These two you need to add them to becomes XY to get the problem, get the program.

451
00:58:05,770 --> 00:58:09,760
Economics equal to this is a probability of x equals three.

452
00:58:10,930 --> 00:58:19,600
Oh, sorry. It's a dual one, two and x equals three, four, five and six.

453
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:25,000
So you need to add these and make each of them element as a vector.

454
00:58:25,270 --> 00:58:30,310
So that's what you need to do. But this is exactly what convolution operation does.

455
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:40,320
Okay. So in, in the solution, we were not expecting to re-implement this to 50.

456
00:58:40,330 --> 00:58:45,080
So what I the solution I gave is to calculate this matrix.

457
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:48,340
So calculus. Exactly. Calculate this matrix. Exactly.

458
00:58:48,730 --> 00:58:51,879
One. One is what is stored in the column.

459
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:58,600
First order one is a stored in a row. First order. If you multiply them, you're going to get exactly get this matrix.

460
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:08,980
And what this will do is just to do this operation using the W w is not the pretty way to do it, but it's okay in this case.

461
00:59:09,790 --> 00:59:13,240
So that's how this was implemented.

462
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:23,680
Okay. And if you look at in this particular example, this was the number if you have larger value.

463
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:33,220
So we care about the mostly the time this took about the 2.8 seconds and this one took a lot longer.

464
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:47,710
Okay. But what I what I wanted to say is that triangulating this, because this is exactly the definition of a convolution operation,

465
00:59:48,310 --> 00:59:52,870
you can use a combo function, which is an actual default package instead package.

466
00:59:53,470 --> 00:59:58,270
So you still could not use this because a base package was only allowed.

467
00:59:58,510 --> 01:00:05,350
But you if if the static stat package is allowed, then you can.

468
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:07,750
So all the other part is same.

469
01:00:08,050 --> 01:00:22,180
What we did is we just instead of doing instead of I'm sorry, instead of implementing this part using using the matrix, multiplication and loop,

470
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:32,110
what we we can do is that we are just going to use this convoke function, control function, these kind of leading the vector multiplication this way.

471
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:37,790
Okay. And the combo function has a, has a different options if you wanted to expand.

472
01:00:37,810 --> 01:00:43,270
So I have a size of four sides of four. Then if you do the convolution, you can get up to size of seven.

473
01:00:44,110 --> 01:00:50,740
So. So that's, that's an open type if you want to trim the all the other.

474
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:59,709
And part of that will be zero zero in either A of A or B, then you can you can have a different option.

475
01:00:59,710 --> 01:01:03,610
I want to keep the size is the same and you get all the all the rest of the part.

476
01:01:03,610 --> 01:01:11,440
You can do that, too. So there are different ways to do the convolution, but in this case, doing open convolution is what we want to do.

477
01:01:11,860 --> 01:01:19,240
So, yeah, we can just do this. Well, this is a much simpler code that's already very good.

478
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:26,170
How fast did it become? So remember that this took about 2.8 seconds and 12 seconds in this case.

479
01:01:27,130 --> 01:01:32,680
So if you look at this example, I'm just showing that the result is exactly the same.

480
01:01:32,950 --> 01:01:46,510
Okay. That's a good thing. And if you work with a size of 5000, well, instead of 2.8 seconds, 0.15 00.1 5 seconds.

481
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:55,360
So this is this is great. And if you have double the size, it's almost just the only double digit 0.3 seconds.

482
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:59,229
So it's a huge improvement in terms of the time complexity.

483
01:01:59,230 --> 01:02:03,490
And you can imagine that they are one one becomes feasible to calculate it.

484
01:02:03,490 --> 01:02:08,470
The size becomes like millions, but the other in this algorithm is not going to work.

485
01:02:09,970 --> 01:02:13,720
So and this is just a showing that the results are the same.

486
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:22,450
So B1 B2 is a stored in. If you if you take the all the absolute differences isn't doing the summation.

487
01:02:22,450 --> 01:02:24,760
The difference is a order of 10 to 13,

488
01:02:25,150 --> 01:02:35,410
which is a reasonable difference in the understanding that the numerical precision is the order of 10 to 16 and you're adding thousands of points.

489
01:02:35,410 --> 01:02:39,610
So it could it could go up to 10 to 13. Okay.

490
01:02:40,270 --> 01:02:43,690
So that's all I have today.

491
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:49,650
So in terms of the lecture material. So.

492
01:02:50,530 --> 01:02:59,410
Okay. And and I can yeah, I mean, this is the summary slide.

493
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:06,730
Basically, this is this convolution theorem is a very, very useful part of these.

494
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:13,480
Uh, so. So if you if you want.

495
01:03:13,490 --> 01:03:17,690
If someone asked me to pick, what's the. What's the most interesting?

496
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:21,770
Uh, I would imagine you would recommend to learn.

497
01:03:22,310 --> 01:03:33,950
To learn a divide and conquer radicalism. Then maybe I would say a problem for you if you are a beginner, but if you wanted to get the really very,

498
01:03:34,460 --> 01:03:40,520
you know, the best of it mean this is going to be kind of summit of these divide and conquer wisdom, I would say.

499
01:03:41,030 --> 01:03:45,880
And the the the core core part or part of the wisdom is base.

500
01:03:46,010 --> 01:03:50,510
And the DFT can be calculated in using the divide and conquer way.

501
01:03:51,230 --> 01:03:59,360
And I don't feel like I have explained very well how this works, but that that YouTube video should explain a lot better, actually.

502
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:11,030
And and so this, you know, these convolution operations, it it happens a lot if you give away the exact values.

503
01:04:11,030 --> 01:04:17,479
So if you don't want to deal with that. So these are if you have a permit to pepper you, you will always have these kind of problems.

504
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:21,770
So I think it'll be very, very useful, especially there is a lot of sparse data.

505
01:04:21,770 --> 01:04:28,580
You need to have exact probability to get the to get to model the sports about sports data.

506
01:04:29,150 --> 01:04:40,570
And if you wanted to play with those a probability distribution, you can use this as a, as a very fast way to calculate, uh, the, the distribution.

507
01:04:40,570 --> 01:04:45,350
And I didn't, I don't have time to explain like how, what else this could be useful.

508
01:04:45,350 --> 01:04:50,989
But when you, when you work with this like console corner functions, if you,

509
01:04:50,990 --> 01:04:55,460
if your column for which they have a specific form of the function of between the distances,

510
01:04:55,910 --> 01:05:06,680
then this FFO like algorithm can be actually used to make make the computation much faster and without losing, without losing accuracy practically.

511
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:14,840
So there's a lot of interesting development I'm seeing recently coming up in different areas of statistics.

512
01:05:15,020 --> 01:05:18,470
So I think this could be useful in your future research too.

513
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:22,400
Okay, so that's all I have to say.

514
01:05:22,790 --> 01:05:30,110
I'm happy to use the rest of the time for, uh, for the Q&A session.

515
01:05:30,650 --> 01:05:34,130
Uh, but I'll just close electric.
