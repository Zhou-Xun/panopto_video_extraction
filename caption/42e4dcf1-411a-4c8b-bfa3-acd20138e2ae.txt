1
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,685
Hey, this is Matthew Zawistowski.

2
00:00:11,685 --> 00:00:14,550
Back to talk longitudinal
data analysis.

3
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,190
In this lecture, we'll
take our first shot at

4
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,415
a formal statistical analysis
of longitudinal data.

5
00:00:20,415 --> 00:00:23,010
We'll use something
that you might already

6
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,175
even be familiar with,
the paired t-test.

7
00:00:26,175 --> 00:00:28,130
Up to now, we've introduced

8
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:30,620
techniques for visual
representation of

9
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:33,350
longitudinal data and
descriptive statistics

10
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:34,915
to summarize the data.

11
00:00:34,915 --> 00:00:36,810
In this lecture we'll show

12
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,930
a statistical method for formally

13
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:41,090
accomplishing the first
goal of determining

14
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,640
if the outcome changes over time.

15
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,874
We'll use the paired t-test,

16
00:00:45,874 --> 00:00:47,810
a simple test for change in

17
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:51,620
paired data that accounts
for correlated outcomes.

18
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:55,940
Let's do a quick review of
t-tests before we dive in.

19
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,430
You probably remember
that there are

20
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:01,745
one-sample t-tests and
two-sample t-tests.

21
00:01:01,745 --> 00:01:03,439
As the names imply,

22
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:06,170
these different methods
are related but are

23
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,040
applied to different types
of data in questions.

24
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,240
The one-sample t-test is

25
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,550
a statistical test
for the equality of

26
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:14,990
a population mean in

27
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:16,700
a single population to

28
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,835
some pre-specified
value called Mu naught.

29
00:01:19,835 --> 00:01:21,710
In the example shown,

30
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:24,320
we might be looking
at ages of onset for

31
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,480
a particular disease
and testing if

32
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,765
the mean age of onset
is 25 years old.

33
00:01:29,765 --> 00:01:33,065
The two-sample t-test
is a statistical method

34
00:01:33,065 --> 00:01:36,280
for the equality of means in
two different populations.

35
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,260
For example, we might be
looking at the ages of

36
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:42,455
onset for a particular
disease in men versus women,

37
00:01:42,455 --> 00:01:44,240
and formally testing if

38
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,525
there's a difference
between the two groups.

39
00:01:46,525 --> 00:01:47,880
A key assumption for

40
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,820
the two-sample t-test is
that all the measurements,

41
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,100
both within the groups and

42
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,739
between the groups
are independent.

43
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:57,320
The paired t-test is

44
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,325
the third member in
the family of t-test.

45
00:02:00,325 --> 00:02:03,320
Like the setup for the
two-sample t-test,

46
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,585
we have two groups
of measurements.

47
00:02:05,585 --> 00:02:07,340
But in this situation,

48
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,590
there is a natural matching or

49
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,330
pairing between measurements in

50
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,780
the first group and
the second group.

51
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:17,435
Put another way, we can
use a line to connect

52
00:02:17,435 --> 00:02:19,520
each measurement in
the first group with

53
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,070
the corresponding measurement
in the second group.

54
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:24,350
We can imagine numerous scenarios

55
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,880
in which this might occur.

56
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,010
For example, the two groups

57
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,720
have measurements
might correspond

58
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,240
to blood pressure
measurements taken

59
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,365
on patients before and after
a new prescription drug,

60
00:02:35,365 --> 00:02:37,580
levels of a chemical
contaminants in

61
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:41,030
drinking water before and
after a filtering process,

62
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:44,395
or the heights of children
at ages two and three.

63
00:02:44,395 --> 00:02:46,820
In each case, the outcomes are

64
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,140
correlated because

65
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,785
the paired measurements
are not independent.

66
00:02:50,785 --> 00:02:52,985
Remember that repeated measure,

67
00:02:52,985 --> 00:02:56,660
longitudinal data also
contains correlated outcomes.

68
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:00,110
Let's see how the paired
t-test is used and think

69
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,790
about how it might
be applied more

70
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:04,645
generally to longitudinal data.

71
00:03:04,645 --> 00:03:06,940
The paired t-test is

72
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:09,250
specifically designed
to look for a change in

73
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,080
means between groups with

74
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,330
correlated or paired
measurements.

75
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:16,990
The way it handles correlation
is to simply remove it.

76
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,180
This is done by
computing the difference

77
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,770
between each set of
paired measurements.

78
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:24,820
For example, if we
imagine the paired data

79
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:28,135
being heights of children
at ages two and three,

80
00:03:28,135 --> 00:03:30,460
the difference between
these measurements is

81
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,710
the change in height over
the one-year period.

82
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:36,460
Note that these
differences are now

83
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:39,700
a single set of
independent outcomes.

84
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,110
We compute the mean and

85
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,525
standard deviation of
the differences and

86
00:03:43,525 --> 00:03:44,980
enter them into a formula for

87
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,630
the paired t-test as shown here.

88
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:51,305
The paired t-test is a
formal statistical test

89
00:03:51,305 --> 00:03:52,865
of the null hypotheses

90
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:54,770
that the mean difference
in measurements,

91
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:57,355
called Mu_diff is equal to zero.

92
00:03:57,355 --> 00:03:59,420
The corresponding p value for

93
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,060
the paired t-test is
determined by comparing

94
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,620
the test statistic to

95
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:07,115
the t distribution with n
minus one degrees of freedom,

96
00:04:07,115 --> 00:04:08,450
where n is the number of

97
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,495
samples with paired measurements.

98
00:04:10,495 --> 00:04:14,105
If the p-value is below a
pre-specified Alpha level,

99
00:04:14,105 --> 00:04:15,800
for example five percent,

100
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,240
then we would reject the null

101
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,310
hypotheses that the
mean difference is

102
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,900
zero in favor of

103
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,970
the alternative hypotheses that

104
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,635
the mean difference is non-zero,

105
00:04:24,635 --> 00:04:26,360
meaning there is evidence of

106
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,900
a change in the
paired measurements.

107
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,600
The key idea in the
paired t-test is that by

108
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,804
subtracting the paired dependent

109
00:04:34,804 --> 00:04:36,515
outcomes from the two groups,

110
00:04:36,515 --> 00:04:39,305
we actually create
a single group of

111
00:04:39,305 --> 00:04:43,195
independent outcomes with
one measurement per sample.

112
00:04:43,195 --> 00:04:45,290
Now let's think about how we can

113
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,970
apply the paired t-test to

114
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,980
longitudinal data to test

115
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,505
for a change in the
outcome over time.

116
00:04:51,505 --> 00:04:54,410
Remember that longitudinal
data contains

117
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:56,630
correlated outcomes
that we visualize

118
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,300
as being connected
by lines over time.

119
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,460
If we are interested
in determining

120
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,680
whether the outcome
changed over time,

121
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,604
we could just look at the
first and last measurements,

122
00:05:06,604 --> 00:05:10,280
ignoring all intermediate
measurements of the outcome.

123
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,560
By doing this, we
have essentially

124
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,380
created paired data from
our longitudinal data,

125
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,030
consisting of the measurements of

126
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:20,000
the outcome at the first
and last time points.

127
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,950
This is precisely
the scenario that

128
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:24,620
the paired t-test
is designed for.

129
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,140
Applying the paired t-test to

130
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,540
longitudinal repeated
measures data is

131
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:32,510
a valid analysis that
is simple to apply,

132
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:35,239
accounts for the correlation
among the outcomes,

133
00:05:35,239 --> 00:05:37,129
and provides a formal hypotheses

134
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:39,895
testing framework for
evaluating the change.

135
00:05:39,895 --> 00:05:43,565
There are however, several
drawbacks to this analysis.

136
00:05:43,565 --> 00:05:45,725
First and most problematic,

137
00:05:45,725 --> 00:05:47,675
by using only two time points,

138
00:05:47,675 --> 00:05:50,360
we are potentially throwing
out a lot of data.

139
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,190
Think about how much
effort might have

140
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,810
gone into collecting that data,

141
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,880
and we are just tossing it aside.

142
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:59,375
The paired t-test is also
not a statistical model.

143
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,700
It does not specify
a pattern for how

144
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,040
the outcome changes over time.

145
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,630
For example, in a linear
or quadratic fashion.

146
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,860
Finally, the paired t-test

147
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,840
does not allow us to
account for potential

148
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,865
confounding variables that might

149
00:06:13,865 --> 00:06:16,115
alter the interpretation
of the data.

150
00:06:16,115 --> 00:06:18,380
Still, a closer inspection of

151
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,320
the paired t-test is valuable
for understanding how

152
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,950
it handles correlated data
and building intuition for

153
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:27,260
statistical models
of longitudinal data

154
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,635
that we will encounter later.

155
00:06:29,635 --> 00:06:32,750
Let's take a closer look
at the math involved in

156
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,855
the two-sample t-test
and the paired t-test.

157
00:06:35,855 --> 00:06:39,080
First, let's consider
the t-statistic

158
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,825
for the two-sample t-test.

159
00:06:40,825 --> 00:06:42,500
In the numerator, we have

160
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,080
the difference between the
sample means in each group.

161
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,700
In the denominator, we have

162
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,574
the standard error
of this quantity,

163
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:51,800
which simplifies to the
quantity shown and involves

164
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,495
the estimated variances and
sample sizes for each group.

165
00:06:55,495 --> 00:06:57,555
Remember the denominator here.

166
00:06:57,555 --> 00:07:01,505
That is what's going to
change for the paired t-test.

167
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:05,224
Here's the t-statistic
for the paired t-test.

168
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:08,480
Note that by simple
arithmetic, the numerator,

169
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,715
which starts as the mean
of the differences,

170
00:07:10,715 --> 00:07:13,355
is actually equal to the
difference of the means.

171
00:07:13,355 --> 00:07:14,990
This is the exact same as

172
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:18,100
the numerator for the
two-sample t-test.

173
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,645
But the denominator is different.

174
00:07:20,645 --> 00:07:22,010
The quantity is still

175
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,930
the standard error
of the numerator,

176
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,235
but as you can see,

177
00:07:25,235 --> 00:07:27,380
the standard error now
includes a term for

178
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,300
the covariance between
the measurements

179
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,160
in the two groups.

180
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,740
A direct comparison shows

181
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,215
how the two test
statistics differ.

182
00:07:36,215 --> 00:07:38,960
Remember that the
two-sample t-test

183
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,515
assumes independent observations.

184
00:07:41,515 --> 00:07:45,410
If you were to apply the
two-sample t-test to pair data,

185
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:47,030
you would essentially be ignoring

186
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:49,505
the correlation between
the paired outcomes.

187
00:07:49,505 --> 00:07:51,740
You would be making
a faulty assumption

188
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,125
and your analysis
would not be valid.

189
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:57,875
This is analogous to applying
standard linear regression,

190
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:01,655
which assumes independent
outcomes to longitudinal data,

191
00:08:01,655 --> 00:08:03,895
which contains
correlated outcomes.

192
00:08:03,895 --> 00:08:07,040
The strength and direction
of the covariance will

193
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,340
decide the actual effect of
ignoring the correlation.

194
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,010
That is, whether you
increase your chance

195
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:16,390
of committing a type
one or type two error.

196
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,920
In this lecture, we introduced

197
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,630
a fairly straightforward
technique

198
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:24,805
for analyzing longitudinal
data using the paired t-test.

199
00:08:24,805 --> 00:08:27,605
By reducing the
repeated measures data

200
00:08:27,605 --> 00:08:29,510
down to two time points,

201
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:33,110
we can apply the paired
t-test to formally test for

202
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,730
a change in the outcome over

203
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:37,600
time while accounting
for correlation.

204
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,940
The key idea is
that as opposed to

205
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:44,495
the two-sample t-test which
assumes independent outcomes,

206
00:08:44,495 --> 00:08:46,910
the paired t-test
includes a term for

207
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:49,430
the covariance of the
paired measurements.

208
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:52,430
That is, the strength of
the relationship between

209
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,140
the paired data points is

210
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:57,020
properly accounted
for in the analysis.

211
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:00,049
The paired t-test is
likely too simplistic

212
00:09:00,049 --> 00:09:02,945
to use in most longitudinal
data analyses.

213
00:09:02,945 --> 00:09:04,190
But it does provide

214
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:06,020
some excellent intuition for

215
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,345
the impact of
ignoring correlation,

216
00:09:08,345 --> 00:09:10,880
and also for how correlation
will be accounted

217
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,752
for in subsequent
models we discuss.
