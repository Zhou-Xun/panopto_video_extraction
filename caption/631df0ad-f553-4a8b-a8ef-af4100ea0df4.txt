1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:10,859
Okay. When we come back, we're going to have a little bit of greens housekeeping.

2
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,630
And I want to just make sure that. If so.

3
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,000
Any the one we have at the end of the year.

4
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:26,950
There's a policy challenge which you may have noticed is a big assignment between groups.

5
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:31,480
I just wanted to let you know that we have something here and that you can start to sign up.

6
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:39,100
So where is this? If you go to campus and you go to the people tab, one can.

7
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,210
You'll get this page as there are going to be more.

8
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:53,969
And then if you go on the policy challenge groups, they're not glamorously named or anything.

9
00:00:53,970 --> 00:01:00,180
I think you can change a name after the fact or we can help you change it, but sign up for a policy group.

10
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:08,730
I would recommend five or maximum six people to a group figure out really even because

11
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:14,320
it's so clean up in the public that it's not going to work if you have a design.

12
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,950
We also are going to have this happen.

13
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,030
Have you assigned any of your group and assign roles within your group?

14
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,790
When I say that doesn't mean I do more work.

15
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:35,760
It seems you have somebody who is responsible for the final policy submission and to the end of the service and the end of the semester,

16
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,669
we're going to have four weeks of conflict with myself and John and Scott here,

17
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:49,430
and we're going to be working with you a bit more one on one, which is not great, but you can produce whatever you like.

18
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:53,040
So this is where we can see how we're trying to get you first time,

19
00:01:53,040 --> 00:02:02,340
because I want good quality time to get a lot more opportunities for students, but still people have to suffer most.

20
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:12,120
That's all for now. So think about these groups. Think about what you want to do for the policy time do not have to submit.

21
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,159
You have to submit an idea of what you'll be doing as a group.

22
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,750
Then from November, that's not a couple weeks, not too long after the second policy.

23
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:26,790
Now I just want to put this in springs so that little amount is okay.

24
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:35,230
The other thing. I had quite a few questions about policy number two.

25
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:41,440
There's a couple of things I would highlight everybody is that if you have a one on one conversations with everybody.

26
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:50,460
Big one. So number one, the targeting in this environment is really about, well, positive.

27
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,890
You can't get wrong. So you're targeting a regulatory agency.

28
00:02:54,700 --> 00:03:03,070
We put out those two opportunities for public comments, and so at least you can get in trouble.

29
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:08,080
But what that means is you have to pay attention to what you're asking them to do.

30
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:17,320
You're responding to that opportunity for comment because you want to propose anything that's outside of that agency's ability to act.

31
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:25,370
So you might want to recommend a big public education campaign, for example.

32
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:29,680
Or if you're writing to the FDA, that's not what the FDA has authority to do.

33
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:35,810
So you have to think about that in the framing of targets for that second post.

34
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:45,070
The second thing is, I think that if you kind of look at the call for public comment, it's very these options have really long and really known.

35
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:54,550
And the agency's asking for quite a lot of advice from a lot of different issues that are related to the topic at hand.

36
00:03:54,700 --> 00:04:00,400
So don't feel like you have to capture everything that they're asking you to do.

37
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:09,220
So I think for a lot of you who make more sense to pick one or maybe a very small number of points to respond to.

38
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:18,140
So, for example, if you would just talk, give the people the definition of healthy that day.

39
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:22,839
This you might choose to think more about fruits and vegetables.

40
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:27,690
We might choose to think more about the saturated fats opt for you could be selected.

41
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:34,660
You've got that. And I think that's going to produce more protein and a lot of ways to use the template that

42
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:41,400
we provide is the one you want to make will come out slightly differently to your plans.

43
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:49,780
More detailed, more granular requests for information, but you still can't make an argument.

44
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,980
It's time to advocate for them to change the rule in some way.

45
00:04:53,530 --> 00:05:00,690
You can, for example, be focusing on saturated fats, get some evidence around why you think they are effective,

46
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:15,270
maybe give them some argument about what the proposed rule should be changed in this way, or maybe support the agency proposal in this way.

47
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:20,060
Here are some things that they should avoid doing that you should avoid information, speculation.

48
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:26,280
Okay. And just to give the counter all documents, authors and.

49
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:32,400
Does anybody have any further questions? Some general things. I just.

50
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:40,720
Okay. Now, let's get rid of some of this immediately.

51
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:46,400
From 1130 to 1, so we make it up.

52
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:50,380
So if you have any questions to talk about, do come up to us.

53
00:05:52,460 --> 00:06:00,180
Okay. So today we're going to continue talking about implementation.

54
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:08,550
And we have a special guest who is doing his thing and so pleasing has two hats in the university.

55
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:15,180
And she's the manager of the Smokefree Violence Law Project, which is at the University of Michigan.

56
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:21,300
They do a lot of corruption with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.

57
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:31,710
And so she's been doing a lot in that role to try and advocate for the charter control laws in the state of Michigan especially.

58
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,570
She's been working with the State Department to do a lot of these advocacy groups around the state.

59
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:42,390
And she's going to talk a little bit about those experiences and maybe some questions about that.

60
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:49,590
And so she she drove to the decision in a lot of policy briefs and that kind of thing.

61
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:56,220
So she will hear more about how that works versus she just considered building a program.

62
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:01,710
And that's a decision that she working on cigaret regulation as well.

63
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:09,300
So she's in that work, been doing some different visits to different retailers in Detroit, Indianapolis,

64
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:15,060
with young people from those areas going into stores,

65
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:22,050
trying to see what the retail environment is like from what products as people get off the streets.

66
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:28,149
So I mean, we tend to do a bit of back and forth.

67
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:33,750
So I apologize in advance for interrupting you about which, you know, I would do that.

68
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,800
So you take this case and I'll take it to you. Okay, that sounds great.

69
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:42,720
So you may know I have a lot of clients because I was having trouble hearing them now.

70
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:48,630
And you may not get through them because Holly will program some important points as we go on talking about it.

71
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:53,100
So, yes, thank you for the wonderful introduction and pretty much overview.

72
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:57,670
We're going to talk a little bit about me and my experience to watch battered women implementation lessons.

73
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,979
So if you read the white paper that we wrote, that talks a lot about that.

74
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:05,660
So we'll talk about that project and then kind of policy and action.

75
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:09,420
So what have I learned since that project? And then discussion.

76
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:18,249
If we don't do it right, we'll do it again. So tobacco is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States right now.

77
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:24,819
It's also the largest cause of preventable death. So I think there's kind of like this kind of thing is like, oh, tobacco is dying out.

78
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:29,170
It's going away. Unfortunately for people who are still smoking, it's really hard for them to quit.

79
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:32,319
And it is still driving a lot of these issues.

80
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,660
And this image here shows you just like smoking affects all of your body.

81
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:42,189
It's pretty unfortunate. Smoking has one more significant degree about e-cigarettes and other emerging products.

82
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:46,690
Now, that's caused a challenge, too, because now that there's more products coming out of the market,

83
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,800
it means that they may switch from smoking to another product.

84
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,070
And we don't quite know what the results are going to be yet.

85
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:59,260
An important kind of educational piece is that nicotine does not cause cancer itself.

86
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:03,670
It is the other things in the cigaret or the e-cigarette or other tobacco products.

87
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:13,360
This is really commonly misunderstood. Even about 50% of doctors think that nicotine causes cancer based on education they have gotten in.

88
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,659
The general public also is quite confused about this because when you think of smoking,

89
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:21,100
we think of e-cigarettes, nicotine, but that's not actually the part that harms it.

90
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:26,890
So that's why when you talk about switching to different products, you can get a lot of benefit from that potentially.

91
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:36,430
So maybe I put some information on there, like what early evidence has shown about like respiratory infections, etc.

92
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:44,350
We don't know the whole idea of smoking. We have hundreds of years, like by 50 years of data.

93
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:51,280
And for vaping, it's so new. It started out pretty much in 2010, got popular in 2015, 2016.

94
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:56,769
So we're really not that far down the road yet. So we don't have any long term kind of information.

95
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:04,720
We only have information about like if you if it makes your asthma worse or some of those kind of quicker things that you would be able to see.

96
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:13,390
But when compared to Cigarets, a lot of the evidence is showing that vaping is less harmful just because there's a lot less toxins in it,

97
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,830
a lot less hidden metals, etc.

98
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:24,980
So something else I want to talk about is in 2019, the e-cigarette or vaping product use associated lung injury that was happening evali.

99
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,930
That was right before the pandemic. And you can see here on the chart like the timeline of it.

100
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:34,130
So that was really scary. It was really scary because it's like, is FDA protecting us?

101
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,030
What is going on?

102
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:45,000
And they suspect that it's vitamin E acetate, which they found a lot of the cases were actually THC vapes and not that liquid can activate.

103
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:51,259
So it's like it's very confusing and it was confusing for the general public.

104
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:55,130
It was still confusing for public health experts.

105
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,079
But that's what we're trying to do is see like what actually was the effect of that.

106
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:04,040
So there are still papers coming out about this just because we didn't know exactly what caused it.

107
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:10,249
And it may be that one bad part of the product or perhaps there's larger issues.

108
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:15,200
So this is clearly an ongoing issue. Yeah. So I think that's really great.

109
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,650
So I'm going to my gosh.

110
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:23,450
Okay. So I think that is a really important one.

111
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,820
35 Yeah,

112
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:35,180
I know that for be embarrassing to be everything about it because people in other countries are very interested in why a lot of young men dying.

113
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:40,790
It is a lot of people who are very healthy and healthy for cardiovascular health.

114
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:50,150
But nevertheless, all these based products were going to be are in some cases dying.

115
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:53,330
So it was quite scary.

116
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:58,300
The CDC calls that this is an incremental patient pressure.

117
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:10,940
You're not worried so much about possible ozone manipulation is what happens consequences us in this case the relevant agencies have to

118
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:19,160
try to figure out how to this is the FDA and trying to figure out how to regulate or that's how to track down the source of this issue.

119
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:25,760
So the just even a relatively small amount of noncompliance with the law,

120
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:35,200
I think you mentioned before this was of it was for a large number of reporters, probably schools like mine in this conflict of the garage business.

121
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,940
Yeah. So there were these two brothers that lived in a condo together.

122
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:45,769
And at the time when you could buy packaging for like they vapes and then you make the product and then you sell it.

123
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:52,130
So there was like no regulatory process for that and they were just selling it out of their house and then maybe millions of these things.

124
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,510
And they were pretty fast and they pretty much. Yeah, yeah.

125
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:59,830
Right. And it seemed like it just seemed like something else.

126
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:13,040
And yes, I agree. But like a small lack of regulation really, because the scary stuff happened at the U.S. agency for a number of weeks.

127
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:18,349
And so these are just still unclear what the causes were.

128
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:22,930
But part of the activity at this point is this is to us.

129
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:30,830
Yeah. Yeah. And the CDC. So CDC is the one who has been taking health information like they would take the reports of who had evali.

130
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,850
So FDA is working very closely together to track this.

131
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:42,890
It makes it really difficult if you're not aware THC cannabis, you can't research it at the federal level because it's federally legal.

132
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:50,750
So we like when when you have those intersections between tobacco and marijuana, which you do all the time,

133
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:54,140
especially if you're a layperson, you go to a party, you'll see both interchangeably.

134
00:13:55,580 --> 00:14:01,670
It makes it very difficult because we can't actually get the research done on the THC basis of the problem.

135
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:05,809
We can test them, but we can't really do any further research or lab studies.

136
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:15,590
It's very difficult. So that also kind of leads into tobacco and nicotine because there's even more products still coming onto the market.

137
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:20,120
So if there is a crossover between marijuana technology and tobacco technology,

138
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,810
then that's a huge problem for the FDA if they can't get the correct information.

139
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:31,040
Yeah. So how did I get into this? I am actually a graduate from the Masters program here.

140
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:38,270
Holly was my advisor and she was like, Oh, we're going to go do interviews down in Ohio about tobacco.

141
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:43,520
We want you would you like to join the team? It's not it's not your fault for doing.

142
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:47,360
I also thought that tobacco was like a dying issue, so why not there?

143
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:52,190
Let's go see. Like, this is probably the final question. People stop smoking lies.

144
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,180
There's still so many people that are smoking and I did not realize it.

145
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:59,629
And it's just horrible for health in so many ways now.

146
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:04,040
Like I've even been in conversations with people over the hospital who do research there and they're trying to get

147
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:09,860
people to stop smoking so that they can have unnecessary surgeries because nicotine impairs your ability to heal.

148
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:14,870
So it's just a massive problem that kind of just ingrained through society and.

149
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:24,590
I feel something is acceptable at some point because I know how easy it is to become a piece of population and do that.

150
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:28,570
So everything's done. We're going to wrap this up in the next ten years.

151
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,210
And so then I realize how much of an imitation person this is.

152
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,080
But you have some laws that I heard you have some validity through.

153
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:44,170
But there's also a huge problem that doesn't help people to stop smoking, you know,

154
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:55,060
in policy mechanisms like cessation programs in the U.S. and then don't prevent the products from getting to those people

155
00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:04,870
and can do some really dodgy things around the enforcement unit where they they're actually just wreaking havoc on people.

156
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:09,660
So I know there's a lot of work to be done here.

157
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:12,940
And then yeah, not even to mention the new products that are coming on.

158
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:18,399
So like if you're not aware there is a nicotine gum called Champix, which is an FDA approved product,

159
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:24,160
people get off of no traces of the drug, but there is a gun like mechanism and you can see it by a pharmacy.

160
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:31,750
But now there's also Lucy, which is a nicotine gum product that is out on general shelves and stuff separately.

161
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:37,720
So there's this interesting dichotomy between things that are going to assume pathways at the FDA for tobacco.

162
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:44,080
There is like a prescription only medication version where you're proving that this is going to help people stop smoking.

163
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,320
Well, e-cigarettes and these other products are 19 that we're like.

164
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:50,160
We're just about the products. It's less regulation.

165
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:54,400
We don't wanna go through that whole process and that's why moves and you are really punishing I'm going to go to that.

166
00:16:54,940 --> 00:17:01,180
So that's what's happening with a lot of these products. So they're creeping up and FDA is like, Wow, I guess we should probably stop that, huh?

167
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:08,050
And it just takes so long for them to do that. Yeah, it's a big problem at the edges of the market.

168
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:12,670
Yes. Analysis can help you products. In fact, we have research on all of them.

169
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:18,190
This is one where we really think that it's working for us.

170
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:23,740
It's not a cigaret. It's a plastic thing that somehow that's supposed to be better.

171
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:30,160
You see that the growth was offered quite obviously with the various vaping products.

172
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:41,350
It's really important because the FTC backs to regulate on not so much on a cautionary basis, meaning that it tries to spend up to 40,

173
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:49,960
but on a, I guess a scientific imaging test process and you don't do that, this there's not a scientific consensus.

174
00:17:50,410 --> 00:18:02,960
So you get to 33 issue, right. And FDA only got authority over Cigarets and products in 29, but that is not that long.

175
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,250
So they weren't really hard after tobacco because they have so many years of evidence.

176
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,770
They knew exactly what to do and how far they wanted to go with it.

177
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,640
They could have much further if they wanted, but they didn't tell FDA what's going on.

178
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:17,200
And then you got think around like 2000, 14,000, 15.

179
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:20,620
They're really seeing these rise in bigger products, especially in Europe.

180
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:30,100
So then they went and they had to get authority from Congress I to be able to regulate e-cigarettes and these other products that are coming out.

181
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:34,360
Okay. That's taking how many years? At least two years now.

182
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,730
People been using these things and have no guidance.

183
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:46,870
And then it was not until 2019, maybe early or late 2018, when the there's something called a pre-market tobacco application.

184
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:52,740
And that is where products that are new are supposed to go through that process.

185
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:56,889
But what they did is they said, oh, now Google and everybody has been selling to kids.

186
00:18:56,890 --> 00:19:00,219
It's not like we're just going to have to do it and you're supposed to do it before you get in the market.

187
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:04,990
But we're too late, you know. So then they're just trying to kind of right this wrong.

188
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:09,100
And it is just a very slow process and it is happening on the market.

189
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:13,569
So they're already they're trying to steal a tool, which was a problem in trying parts in 2015.

190
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:19,540
People will and this is a real human cost and it has to do so.

191
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:23,680
On the one hand, you're not regulating the products to make sure that they're safe.

192
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:28,270
Yeah. So that's a huge issue.

193
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:36,130
And then on the other hand, they're not realizing the potential benefits of some of these products for people who are heavy smokers because.

194
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:42,009
So I think this was there was a lack of some of the key.

195
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:50,319
One of the reasons why was to do so is that he ended up having these massive psychiatric problems.

196
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:55,780
And he said to us, it's that easy for factory is good.

197
00:19:56,420 --> 00:20:05,190
And so the packs, the scary images that you get if you've ever seen them on some cigaret packs in our countries that you might get the FDA.

198
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:12,160
One of those is documentaries. And so that was my last experience.

199
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:18,570
And it's difficult because some of my. He has been able to switch kind of cigaret.

200
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,840
Maybe there were some benefits, but it was difficult.

201
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:27,100
I couldn't advise you to do that without knowing that these is.

202
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:37,230
So all of this is, I think, a meditation question about what we call public safety,

203
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:43,050
also about potential of this question we would use from some people.

204
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:52,650
However, if there's one thing that we can agree on and actually the industry as well or not e-cigarettes,

205
00:20:53,310 --> 00:21:03,060
it's that young people basically express because of moving to these products, nothing is potentially harmful.

206
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:12,300
Whereas moving from 40 cigarets a day to one has led to the increase of risk for that person.

207
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:19,650
And part of the reason why about that is not that we don't know what was on hand.

208
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:25,559
So yeah, exactly. And so I just can't describe the years it's taken for FDA to deal with.

209
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:30,510
And so now the FDA has the authority and never personally regulating it and it can't properly do that.

210
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:34,770
We just don't have this information. So that makes it very difficult for the CDC or anybody else,

211
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:40,559
which is more communication pieces to actually, you know, tell smokers anything, tell the general public.

212
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:47,590
I mean, there's lots of focus on kids. So people are so hard saying like, don't do any of it, that people think it's very dangerous.

213
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:57,990
So it's it's just it it kind of has this domino fall of when the regulate when the regulatory agency cannot perform its task,

214
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,800
then you don't have the communication. You don't have the information, you don't have the products.

215
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:07,230
Yeah. Does anyone have questions about that at this point?

216
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:13,810
Because that that. Awesome.

217
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,370
Okay. All right. So here's my one focusing on that.

218
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:24,770
So this was something this is from what I did in 2019 with Holly and some of our other partners.

219
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:30,230
So it's back with my in-laws. They were lamenting the minimum age of sale to 21.

220
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:38,299
And when you're dealing with policy, minimum age of sale is different than saying, you know, you have to be this old to buy something.

221
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,450
So they're saying this is the minimum age.

222
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:49,849
You can sell toys. It's all very difficult. But the idea of this was that, you know, you're changing it,

223
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:55,429
shifting the timeline for people who are using these products and also with these laws in other countries.

224
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:59,389
And it was not just changing it from like 18 to 21.

225
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:04,280
You could also change who's enforcing the policies and who is the enforcement target.

226
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:12,080
So there was actually a lot more to these laws that came about rather than like if they're going to do this a change,

227
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:17,570
then they need to have that for that they need to have a communication and that's kind of built into the policies.

228
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:21,740
So tobacco 21, has now passed.

229
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:29,150
In 2019 it was Christmas Eve and Trump signed it, which is why people may not know that tobacco like you have to be 21 to buy it.

230
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:35,630
Of course, you guys might be in that age group saying no, but for older, younger folks, they don't even know happened.

231
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:44,000
Yeah. So that's the issue. But it is really in this is enough for this issue.

232
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:52,040
I could have said for six months even I was like, Oh, they say, Well, now on Christmas Eve, that's what I did.

233
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:58,820
So I think part of it was that the lawmakers decided this they think it wants to take credit for.

234
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:06,020
They didn't necessarily want all of the voters to know that they doing this public health measure.

235
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:15,920
It's also a bit suspicious because Jill was very pushing very much for this decision and never says that I want these issues out there.

236
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:23,480
Yeah, this is something you'll see when wading into that other companies is that they will all be like, Oh yes, we want to protect kids too.

237
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:27,600
We should definitely do this. And then the way to get rid of that, get out of my.

238
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:32,599
Good. So nothing against, like, Trump or how he did this.

239
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,600
I don't think it's maybe the worst approach for a federal approach.

240
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,489
So when he passed that, it was just like we're going to pass out 18 to 21.

241
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:44,180
And then you put it under the states to figure out how they want to enforce and do that,

242
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,220
which is fine because states are already enforcing and doing their own tobacco inspections.

243
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:54,830
Are you going to build like that? But from the sense of like a rating industry,

244
00:24:55,190 --> 00:25:00,950
that means that they now go to the states and tell them what laws they should pass and they get more control about it too.

245
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:09,020
So they didn't want a blanket at the federal level of higher restrictions because now they can go and make sure Kentucky doesn't have those rights.

246
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:16,250
And so from a to the industry point of view, there are some actors that want to see like a level playing field.

247
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:22,880
This is how, you know, your regulation. They want to see pretty much the same laws in most places.

248
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:27,980
They also obviously prefer pretty low touch over regulation.

249
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:31,940
So if they can be regulated at a higher or lower level,

250
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:40,910
they are low level and they definitely will not see the same jurisdiction that most of what they get up to is national law.

251
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:47,509
I see a lot of cities, so this is a problem for these products.

252
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:50,809
With this issue, we also want to prevent smoking.

253
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:56,390
So we're going to raise the age within our society in that county.

254
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:01,470
It's possible to do that and end up in some states passing laws.

255
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:05,950
It's not and some states really opposing states.

256
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:12,560
So it wasn't popular. But I think that's part of the reason why you were so interested in changing the national law.

257
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:23,629
If they wanted to avoid this requirement that they set and they kept at some of plenty of lobbyists and things that if, on the other hand,

258
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:30,720
you've got and they were pushing more law and they still offered some of the states that haven't yet implemented display of.

259
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:32,840
Yes.

260
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:42,000
So you can see on this map the policies are not created equally and like kind of going along with this point of what industries would want, they want.

261
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:46,320
Just across that 18 put 21 have no more.

262
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:48,930
Don't give them any more money to enforce this.

263
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:58,590
Don't change this from police enforcing it to, you know, public health folks enforcing it and and still have a purchase use possession laws,

264
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:10,840
which means that if somebody underneath 21 has a tobacco product, then they can be fined criminally for that they government process and process.

265
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:14,460
And sometimes it will go up sometimes and it's a bit invasive.

266
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:21,509
And the law at a young age, those laws are very, very,

267
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:29,430
very careful how you think about what public health should do and how we should use force and just be cool as possible.

268
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:41,130
So are quite cool if this person in possession or use fancy to do so and they exist.

269
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:44,610
You see the People's Republic of the 1994, actually.

270
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:48,840
Possibly. So it was a big push on what we talked about enforcement.

271
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:56,040
And when I look back at that debate, I worry about the kind of authoritarian nature of that little bit,

272
00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:07,390
because the intent and the ordinance that we made and certain people are being made by public health folks like you and prevent them.

273
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:14,940
Yeah. Getting put us in first place in a classic way across the country will see tobacco use their taxes.

274
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:24,990
And I worry about putting everything in front of ourselves as offensive to ask about people's issues.

275
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:29,399
So yeah, that's what you're talking about and communication. Yeah.

276
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:34,620
And thinking about the timeline again, because I think putting all these things into a time frame also helps.

277
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:39,389
So tobacco in between one really spread rapidly in sort Massachusetts because the

278
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:43,830
county health boards had the authority to say like we're just going to do this.

279
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:49,229
And then they just started doing it. And then Needham, Massachusetts is one of the first places that did it.

280
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:55,860
And what they saw is that their high school and middle school tobacco use dropped by 50%.

281
00:28:56,190 --> 00:29:01,800
So it was a big that was kind of like the big thing that really pushed other places to start doing it.

282
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:07,469
And once it started spreading in Massachusetts, then the people who are in state colleges, Massachusetts,

283
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:11,910
Kentucky, people on the northeast side, this kind of gets around to conferences or other things.

284
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:18,750
So it was really spreading. And so, you know, Massachusetts came out and like I want to say 2030.

285
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:26,129
Yeah, 23. So between 2007 and like 2013, there was like kind of, oh, that would be a nice thought.

286
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:32,340
We should make it the same age as like alcohol, but then it really start getting traction after that.

287
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:41,459
And so from 2013 to 2019 before by federal and all this happened,

288
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:47,160
like all of these policies went like wildfire that in the policy world that is super

289
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:52,410
fast like people really lash out on these policies because it made some common sense.

290
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:56,800
Right. Think there was evidence then? Yeah, but we got to be a bit careful about the evidence.

291
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:03,990
So what do they really know or have to either Massachusetts or somebody remembers it?

292
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:07,420
Oh, cool. What? How does that work for us in Massachusetts?

293
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:11,860
And all long time I was like in that area.

294
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:15,810
So I don't remember. But I know that I've I've been out there.

295
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:19,860
Is it like a suburb in Needham? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

296
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:30,600
Because I the island of the suburbs somewhere. So that one of the issues in office isn't that the city is looking at the young people in Needham

297
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:39,000
and their purchasing habits or acquisition of books was it's like you don't you like this?

298
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:42,850
It's just this, it's a suburban office.

299
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:48,630
And so people look at that as it should be extrapolate from this one study and.

300
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:55,570
I think that the state mechanisms will make tobacco company successful in other places.

301
00:30:56,020 --> 00:31:01,400
And that was another reason why we were motivated to be serious, because if you think about it,

302
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:05,770
the instrumentation that could be different in a certain sense like that, you can say,

303
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:11,549
okay, there's now a law for that, and it means that anybody who is going.

304
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:18,340
And so that could put us over. But how do you actually get to compliance enforcement, if that's reasonable?

305
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:23,200
What are the consequences of getting that wrong for music?

306
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:29,739
So for Law Order, what what are the consequences of that?

307
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:33,550
And how much does it matter if we go to 1113 this morning?

308
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:37,299
727 Okay. Yeah.

309
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:42,940
So we were talking about evidence and etc., so that that was rightly criticized like it does.

310
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:48,909
But, you know, if more places want it, you know, that's their right in authority to do so.

311
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:53,950
It kind of just started going around and this is true in Medicine Report was a really

312
00:31:53,950 --> 00:32:00,190
big deal when it came out with came out in 2015 and it showed decreased initiation,

313
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:07,809
especially among high school students. So the entire idea of this and they kind of flesh it out in this piece was to move

314
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:14,440
it from middle school and high school starting to like nearly a more college age.

315
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:22,870
So the idea being that if you can shift somebody from starting at 12 to starting at 15, that's a win because the earlier you start,

316
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:26,829
the more it can change your brain chemistry and is more likely that you will

317
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:31,090
be addicted longer and have a harder time getting away from that addiction.

318
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:36,340
So that that was the whole idea was to shift this and.

319
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:44,739
They showed it worked. And we don't have like the longer term data to see if people like stop forever or maybe

320
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:48,220
they only smoke for two years compared to when they used to smoke for five years.

321
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:56,110
So we will we'll see how it turns out. But this was a really big piece of evidence that came out and really started to support it.

322
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:02,350
And I think that given how fast these were spreading, the companies like the tobacco companies,

323
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:04,419
the making companies, kind of saw the writing on the wall.

324
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:09,370
And that's why they pushed for federal to have that power, even because this was not going to stop.

325
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:16,300
We want to make again. So it's all on there. But it says that we have a tobacco lobby.

326
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:24,210
We don't have it. We have some parts of our state law that could be used to enforce that.

327
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:28,209
That's why they consider it. But it's really not a specific tobacco.

328
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:34,750
21 legislation was introduced starting in 2017 and then of course, it's 2019 to 2022.

329
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:40,900
And this is an interesting thing you said unless this became a must pass policy.

330
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:50,710
So in Michigan, to get into line with federal policy, which is now at 21, so you do aged 18 to 21 and get rid of all the minors in there.

331
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:55,090
This. 20. Underpayment is not a minor as defined in Michigan state law.

332
00:33:56,410 --> 00:34:01,150
And since it was a must pass legislation and still is,

333
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:07,450
people are trying to put in their own personal products into it or kind of get distracted from the point

334
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:12,990
of the law is it's they're using it to target in the past because they know that this has happened.

335
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:19,360
So can you us of what it must cost, especially if it's something where in this case,

336
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:28,830
Michigan has to actually process because to comply with federal law, which says what they say.

337
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:35,440
So eventually this bill has to go through the issue that students faces in Michigan.

338
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:45,910
So it is going to hang in there. So it's an example of something that you might find in politics,

339
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:54,489
which is where each representative has incentives to add their own Senate or their own measures to do that.

340
00:34:54,490 --> 00:35:00,969
And so eventually you're weighing down this legislation so much that it is not introducing its passage passage,

341
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:04,530
which is exactly what has happened multiple times right now.

342
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:12,210
Many times they you know, it's it's every like every year and every decision, every session, every session this comes up.

343
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:19,750
So I'm working with industry, environment, Health and Human Services and I, along with Douglas, who is a lawyer here at the school.

344
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:24,279
And we do well. It's not really political.

345
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:29,220
It's more policy and legal advice to the state. So they give us the wording.

346
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:33,020
So I got to see in depth what all this said, and it was just a lot of nonsense.

347
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:39,280
I prepared an entire amount of policy that they want to pass, something that would make sense and be coded correctly.

348
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:44,740
They were like, Now it's going to take up all the pieces that like there will be no licensing.

349
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:50,740
You don't have to have a license in the state of Michigan to sell tobacco. You have to have it for alcohol and marijuana.

350
00:35:50,950 --> 00:36:03,930
So that's a really important transition. So we actually the subject of this show is so internalization that if you are an investor,

351
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:10,930
if you are setting up all those things, they don't need to be passed by the states.

352
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:14,560
That means that in our mind you have to be licensed by the state.

353
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:21,390
So it's not that complicated. You sit in a form, you pay some money every year, get your license.

354
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:27,870
And what that means is it gives the government a lever of businesses that behave badly.

355
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:33,860
So one of the greatest threats, if you're a business owner, is being a client over a business.

356
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:40,690
So if you can take away a license over time in a business, that business owner is effective.

357
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:43,719
You just want consequences.

358
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:48,730
And it is for all of the good is not necessarily the cops in the store.

359
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:54,580
And then it's actually quite a striking thing for that.

360
00:36:54,650 --> 00:37:00,850
Exactly. For the most part, when they talking about these businesses,

361
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:13,510
there are a number of factors that cause a lot of the problems that I'll say to kids and try to reach some of those businesses is really important.

362
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:18,700
But at the same time wants to protect and support businesses that are hurting.

363
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:23,570
I think especially that in a serious way,

364
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:30,920
this is a really important new thing because the retailer so you have to think about the importance of those areas

365
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:39,190
to protect them and encourage them to comply with the law without forcing them to shut down for huge profits.

366
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:43,850
Yeah. Michigan is one of seven states that doesn't have a license.

367
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:49,600
Yes, it's crazy. And we have a pretty well to and get licensing in Michigan.

368
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:53,829
We are the second worst on the Tobacco Prevention Association.

369
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:59,559
And so I hate to say it, but Michigan's not doing very good tobacco.

370
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,000
So there's been a lot of challenges.

371
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:13,160
And it's interesting because I went into Colorado, an alcoholic, a Virginia kind of person, and our state acts more like Virginia than so many places.

372
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:18,700
I can't believe that the same things are happening in Virginia where they literally have tobacco industry looming over them.

373
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:25,590
I really don't understand that. But there's just a lot of unwillingness to to do the parts.

374
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:33,460
And I think because you would have to add things like you have to add things that cost money people feel uncomfortable about.

375
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:43,210
That is something that we really don't want to do. But it was not frustrating for us to see that it's fine because I want it to go as came

376
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:51,350
along with a much bigger bunch of stuff in the legislation that can do licensing and stuff.

377
00:38:51,660 --> 00:39:01,410
Decisions. I would be in the government and included funding for enforcement of the law as public health measures.

378
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:04,470
It was kind of interesting. This was one of the things that.

379
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:14,830
I'm sorry. Yeah. The decision that it was needed to compel people were just because you were not the tax payer resources report that I was reading.

380
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:20,370
Those are things that would really make a difference and actually enhances consumption in the sense.

381
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,440
Well, yeah, exactly.

382
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:29,790
And and the things that they're regulating are things like what in the product look like now the product can't have like a marijuana product.

383
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:35,309
You can't have like something about kids because they're concerned about kids, you know, the whole thing.

384
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:41,610
And and so you also can have like images of cartoon images and things like that.

385
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:49,010
So they're they're really kindergartners, but they're not doing the same for tobacco, which is quite interesting as well as I mean,

386
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:52,290
if you I don't know if you've ever been into a dispensary,

387
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:57,960
they set up the stores the way the stores are set up with like an entry point versus where you can go in.

388
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:05,280
Tobacco isn't like that. You walk into any gas station you can. You can't hardly go anywhere without cigarets.

389
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:10,649
To be honest, it's even more accessible than alcohol.

390
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:22,350
Pretty much. Or it's just as it's wild, like places like cellphone stores, bars, pool halls, bowling alleys.

391
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,220
Any. Any other weird ones? Street vendors? Yeah.

392
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:31,950
Mobile phone sales, let's face it. So cell phones. Yes, they include kiosks in hotels.

393
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:37,910
Oh, yeah. Hotels. Yep. Strange places. Oh, and there's a chicken shop in Detroit where they sold.

394
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:39,600
Yeah, yeah. Good stuff.

395
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:46,350
But, yeah, so the state doesn't know that because it's so they every year they have to try to track down who's selling tobacco possession,

396
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:54,210
licensing, licensing. She gives you a list of the stores in your state that sell tobacco.

397
00:40:55,230 --> 00:41:01,570
One of the things in this project that we get to I was looking at require

398
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:10,139
recommendations with the that what would be and the fact that there is no one has a

399
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:17,219
statewide is three cities and Michigan doesn't have that it has some regional

400
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:24,390
lists compiled and gets updated that last year that they just spoke for quality.

401
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:36,510
So you can do Excel observations in Grand Rapids but yeah so what this is one of the complex activities is properly supervised.

402
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:48,740
I hope they send in kids who are younger than the legal age into the states with a public health official, usually a police officer as well outside.

403
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:53,980
So the idea is this is kind of this I would call it secret shopper.

404
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,850
I think it's too much. So the idea is to go in and see different ones.

405
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:03,740
And for us, if the shop does that, though, it still sells to that person.

406
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:15,320
But then the the reasons that you find all of this depends on what procedure is, whether you have an enforcement search,

407
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:22,020
which is in some of the towns or whether it's on this point, the police person gets involved.

408
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:27,370
But yeah, so that was you know, this is not an enforcement brain section, right?

409
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:31,440
Yeah. So I like trained youth, but we weren't trying to buy products.

410
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,550
We were just going in and what? Yeah. Yeah, that, that was good.

411
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,390
And kind of to go off the data point and the inspections point,

412
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:49,290
you can really tell Michigan isn't doing well because in Detroit there were 92 stores that they surveyed and 68 of them sold the children without IDs.

413
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:55,200
So even I they were just like, okay. So when people ask us like, are people selling kids?

414
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,230
Is that really happening? Oh, my God, yes, it is.

415
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:04,440
Yes. And I think an interesting point, too. So IKEA inspections have just restarted.

416
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:07,530
So we didn't know how bad it was during the pandemic because they were doing this.

417
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:12,600
They didn't it was ethical to have like youth go in and have to interact with people.

418
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:21,780
So I think there was a bit of a grace period, especially thinking about it probably wanted implementation because they weren't checking,

419
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:26,969
so they're not checking and the state has no reason to get to. Do anything.

420
00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:32,070
Why would you? And that's why this is important.

421
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:42,790
And to some extent, I think the people in support of this store knew it would be better if they were pushing this on the states.

422
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:55,380
And I think they realize that some states would care about this, do it more and be the better compliance and others would follow enforcement.

423
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:59,249
So other than FDA inspections, there's also something called signer.

424
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:09,600
So signer amendment. What that does is each state has to have their own list of places that they go.

425
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:16,380
They have to go to these places. They have to see if they can also get compliance from the retailers.

426
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:21,209
And you have to have a 20% or lower failure rate.

427
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:26,880
So they have to have 80% of stores not sell the. Right now in Michigan, that's 40%.

428
00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:36,780
So we're double our rate. So that's real bad. And what happens is if we don't get under 20% by the time that they retire this grace period,

429
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:43,950
we will lose block grant funding to mental health services, social services, public health services.

430
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:52,620
It is a huge part of the state's budget. So that's kind of like the the kind of carrot on a stick is like you get this grant money from the federal

431
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:59,879
government if you meet if you meet this and the bar is well known about that kind of mechanism in general,

432
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:02,910
that's often how the federal government supports states.

433
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:09,990
I didn't know they withhold money or they make money contingent on this.

434
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:18,650
If you have poor retail, street, tobacco control stuff, it doesn't just affect the conversation budget.

435
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:28,230
If they do that, it's this seems like people die a lot of these so opposed to just not being for it.

436
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:35,460
Absolutely. And they were down in Virginia extremely worried as well because their rates were far over 20% as well.

437
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:42,100
Because of the pandemic and other things going on. It just hasn't been a focus for the state states.

438
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:47,580
So a lot of states I feel like are going to have the unfortunate shock coming that.

439
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:52,690
So. Yeah. Looking to.

440
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:58,570
It's a wormhole. This is what happens when you've been studying this thing for years.

441
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:08,680
Yeah. So just to know in Michigan and also Ann Arbor and Genesee County before the national law had passed, actually passed ordinances.

442
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:13,870
And, you know, Ann Arbor, they're like, oh, yeah, they're all hippies. They're all those educated voters.

443
00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:16,120
Of course, they're going to do whatever the heck they're going to do, let them be.

444
00:46:16,330 --> 00:46:21,760
But then Genesee County, that's where Clinton is and has a large black and brown population.

445
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:25,330
And so then that was really a threat to the tobacco companies.

446
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:33,570
So then they issued an injunction, which means they went to court and they held that ordinance from being packet.

447
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:37,690
So so basically they were told, no, you can't do this.

448
00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:46,089
And it was preemptive. So that has gotten us into a knock on state for the state of Michigan because local localities

449
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:50,170
cannot pass this of their own court right now the way the law is written in state law.

450
00:46:50,890 --> 00:46:56,200
And so it has to be at the state level, which is much harder, in essence, state level than the local level.

451
00:46:56,410 --> 00:47:01,420
So that has really stalled progress in Michigan. I thought it was kind of interesting to see.

452
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:05,670
Being a sacrificial person,

453
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:13,490
you expect everyone to see that this place is going to be able to have it easy because the industry is active and so forth.

454
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:19,350
So there's a lot to things for the company to try get to address that as opposed to possibly the money.

455
00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:22,080
So that happens at all.

456
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:34,380
The other issue, though, locally is it was the state attorney general pushing this case and the state attorney general at the time was Circuit five,

457
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:41,550
who was the governor of New York trying to get the states and the decision was made.

458
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:51,870
I think the coordination is to support the case that they should target Tennessee County where they thought they were going to face the decision.

459
00:47:52,350 --> 00:48:04,139
And for that panel and I suppose quite interesting to go off the SEC law and it shows the challenges in the courts in that place absolutely matters,

460
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:12,180
too. So from going over to Colorado, Aspen was one of the first places that really took that going on there and ran with it.

461
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:17,940
Aspen only has six retailers in their entire city jurisdiction.

462
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:22,740
Compare that to like Detroit. There's 900 or a thousand.

463
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:26,340
I don't have an exact number because half of them are my business.

464
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:30,240
That was a problem. There wasn't. That was my business.

465
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:37,680
But yeah. So please, it really does matter. And especially over in Colorado, those valley cities are really they're only dealing with themselves.

466
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:41,400
I've been working with the Detroit Wayne Oakland Tobacco-Free Coalition,

467
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:47,550
and they're working on housing like a menthol or flavor restriction in Detroit, Wayne County.

468
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:55,350
The problem is, if you're familiar with Eight Mile in Wayne County and it borders Oakland County, people would just go across the street.

469
00:48:55,950 --> 00:49:00,720
And that's not the same thing in Colorado, a place that has not just isolated towns,

470
00:49:00,990 --> 00:49:03,270
but in the next town over means you have to like drive 20 minutes.

471
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:09,270
Whereas like if you can walk across the street and you're in a different jurisdiction, that's a huge problem and huge problem.

472
00:49:09,330 --> 00:49:18,240
That was one of the issues. In fact, one of the good experiences with the state is the neighboring jurisdictions don't do the same thing.

473
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:29,520
There are it. There was some research on what? How for someone to travel to five places some time and it's not that far.

474
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:37,740
But in that particular set of offenses, the real problem is if you can be certain that the families go and not for instance.

475
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:44,489
Yeah, I think for age. So when you're talking about under 21 like those are really price sensitive people.

476
00:49:44,490 --> 00:49:49,020
They may not have access to cars or etc. That's a lot different than like flavor.

477
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:52,070
So for 21, they're like people are not really going out of the way.

478
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:55,980
Young people who are like 18, 21 are not going out that way to get this.

479
00:49:56,190 --> 00:50:05,180
Like they'll go find other means, but they're not going to go out over publicly person, etc. I can even anecdotally say that absolutely happens.

480
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:12,110
It's much more of a thing. So we're going to tell you why some people advocate mental status.

481
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:16,310
Take it from tobacco. That's what's in the paper.

482
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:25,210
And you really had thought that this was going to be fantastic. But there's lots of reasons why you might not want Cigarets to be added.

483
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:31,770
Yes, I'm feeling that it has to be more attractive. So I'm coming for you on that?

484
00:50:32,310 --> 00:50:42,459
Yeah, people want to see that. Okay, so let's remember our version of college.

485
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:53,620
I think Governor Whitmer had some kind of ban on all this waivers because there was an even later crisis like.

486
00:50:54,100 --> 00:51:00,340
A lot of people started doing it just because they let go and read and see.

487
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:08,880
So I guess they're little fans of it. So that, yes, there are children kind of built into it when there's a company.

488
00:51:09,990 --> 00:51:14,410
Yeah. Spencer Exactly.

489
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:24,820
So on the one hand, the flags matter to the extent of their opinions to people who don't want to be active for that proposal.

490
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:30,760
Can you say that is is a thing to think about some products that it's simple,

491
00:51:30,850 --> 00:51:38,460
like if you like something so you can get it to have a seat, relax or something because they grow up as well.

492
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:43,620
Yeah. Yeah. You can get like for $0.69 of like in my old wine liquor.

493
00:51:43,990 --> 00:51:47,770
Yeah. Sorry. How am I going to. I think you know what?

494
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:52,810
I should try, but this is another reason to what?

495
00:51:53,470 --> 00:51:59,190
More science based reason for not doing this petition?

496
00:51:59,210 --> 00:52:06,090
It's a mental actually and things like so. So they, you know, everything.

497
00:52:06,810 --> 00:52:15,300
So if you on payday and you put a nickel or something like clothes in it, it actually makes it easier.

498
00:52:15,690 --> 00:52:20,300
Yeah. And the worst part is you breathe in the smoke more.

499
00:52:20,310 --> 00:52:26,000
So we do have spirits on that. So you breathe more deeply with this one product.

500
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:32,010
So this further into the lungs and doing that, which is a big product.

501
00:52:32,010 --> 00:52:49,260
So that's one of the reasons why it's so much security, just like it's like tax or something is although since the medication is both works,

502
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:54,560
what is it now that we should we care about who uses and who?

503
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:02,880
But he's not this for in American society.

504
00:53:05,830 --> 00:53:20,030
All right. Then no post is not a bit more general, but there is a long history of new products being advertised in this,

505
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:25,330
particularly targeted at African Americans in the US.

506
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:38,940
There's a long history. We can put it on the back burner in the industry for cigaret companies that spurred some move

507
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:47,250
towards advertising and targeting advertising and targeting deals of products to weaken that.

508
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:54,730
And so if in fact our research is to see which communities targeted, where the billboards were, where the special offers were.

509
00:53:55,330 --> 00:54:03,910
He was head of the national advertising, which is to say the African Americans, they try school jazz.

510
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:14,799
That was a cool thing. And so that's another reason why community activists in certain places actually said,

511
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:22,060
we want to make sure we very interested in this because they're seeing many of the products being targeted where they live.

512
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:27,100
And then there's also a targeting of LGBTQ populations.

513
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:30,750
It's actually really. Interesting.

514
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:39,000
Is that so? You know, you think these movies are flattering so this is pushing cool by kind of where you if you're interested in

515
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:46,440
the dark embrace of history of how good and healthy that's about their place in society that is about.

516
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:57,809
So it's also kind of hard because when menthol cigarets were first coming out, it was when a lot of the restrictions were coming in,

517
00:54:57,810 --> 00:55:05,580
certain general persons were coming in looking for new markets, and they kind of started saying it was healthier.

518
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:15,090
So there's still there's still people I was riding with 116 year old who was helping me with Detroit, and he's like, why?

519
00:55:15,090 --> 00:55:18,390
Why menthol? Why not? Why in environmental specifically?

520
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:21,690
And he's like, Isn't it healthier, honey? No.

521
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:24,629
Actually breathing more deeply. Like it's harder to quit.

522
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:29,810
Like it's been shown to be more attractive just because the more money, the more people smoke faster.

523
00:55:30,170 --> 00:55:35,370
So but there's still like that is common knowledge for people.

524
00:55:35,370 --> 00:55:39,490
And black and brown news is that these are obvious. Then we're getting sicker.

525
00:55:39,690 --> 00:55:44,050
I think for a lot of people like yeah, that's a huge.

526
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:48,570
How do you start looking at the definition of healthy foods?

527
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:53,880
Some people find that this is a very severe situation.

528
00:55:54,180 --> 00:56:02,550
The government's ability to regulate with tough times sounds old now, but in the fifties it was like a private cigaret.

529
00:56:02,670 --> 00:56:05,160
Relax would be good for your health.

530
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:17,370
It's not a normal socialized activity and it's now we see a lot of these health things that are unsubstantiated around new products,

531
00:56:17,370 --> 00:56:20,730
including things like heat, not burn, which is the to for that.

532
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:23,160
So is something very bad for you.

533
00:56:24,030 --> 00:56:32,330
And then there is a which could vary depending on your risk profile and the context that the data which we are concerned about,

534
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:37,920
but they're telling consumers these things are healthy. Yeah, absolutely.

535
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:41,560
And this is why the advertising speaks to what the travel.

536
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:54,299
And so through the advertising, they were also they were specifically advertising black males and hiring black workers in their factories.

537
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:57,050
And then they would tell people about that through black rises.

538
00:56:57,390 --> 00:57:06,750
So when magazines were different and it was mostly white crab and so this and this, this, this video to this day and also with other BQ,

539
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:13,230
they would they would specifically put the ads in there that would speak to those people who felt marginalized.

540
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:22,310
So yeah, and we do is we get into the system a lot of economic opportunities offered by the industry and a lot of the jobs.

541
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:23,280
Yes, yes.

542
00:57:23,310 --> 00:57:32,340
And not that like in years, people to those travel companies because they were getting a good jobs and nobody else was, which is it's messed up.

543
00:57:34,330 --> 00:57:37,460
Yeah. Do we get off on a similar thing?

544
00:57:37,830 --> 00:57:44,940
We did it. I think it was important. So I think we should talk about many things about this thing.

545
00:57:45,710 --> 00:57:53,060
This is this is kind of a short presentation. You need to see to this problem.

546
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:56,490
Yes, I know, but. Yes.

547
00:57:56,900 --> 00:58:04,600
You know, these of these you know, so this is in the white paper that we did an infographic on this so we can talk

548
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:10,629
about our experiences that we've had to advocate for some of these changes,

549
00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:16,480
which I would say we were slightly successful in changing the minds of some people,

550
00:58:17,170 --> 00:58:21,370
ultimately not really successful in pushing for the big things that we wanted, like licensing.

551
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:25,740
I think some of these in particular for white supremacist groups.

552
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:29,710
So we did more than we did.

553
00:58:30,850 --> 00:58:39,730
I said, we are going to be the center of policies that needed more time to figure out well under certain different policy changes,

554
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:43,870
how these guys would be saved, how much money you spent or lost.

555
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:54,820
And the result at the moment was overall, we thought it would be a positive thing to Michigan if implemented correctly.

556
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:58,150
You had a lot of caveats about how it should be implemented.

557
00:58:59,030 --> 00:59:05,020
And the interesting thing for policymakers as well was that the tax increases for regulating

558
00:59:05,290 --> 00:59:12,320
tobacco 61 would actually cover the revenue losses from reduced sales of CIGARET products,

559
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:15,430
which is a difference. Well,

560
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:28,670
my biggest project was we're looking we want to see an effective but comprehensive and simple enforcement and compliance at all confirming that next.

561
00:59:29,350 --> 00:59:37,360
We would argue that we need to have a civil system that generates public health education across the U.S. outreach.

562
00:59:38,110 --> 00:59:49,270
Civil fines, civil penalties. And does not involve people who are young people being prosecuted in a criminal way,

563
00:59:50,110 --> 00:59:54,910
which is the thing you failed to achieve in terms of our advocacy.

564
00:59:55,300 --> 01:00:01,990
But we made this quick. Then we also did a survey looking in conjunction with our colleagues.

565
01:00:02,230 --> 01:00:08,440
I want you to take a survey of youth across the country to see what do you think?

566
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:14,050
One, this is a crazy idea. If you can idea, how do you get it back to politics?

567
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:24,409
So there was a lot of support, interestingly enough, in that survey and a lot of people still under questioning.

568
01:00:24,410 --> 01:00:33,639
That is absolutely. Yeah. And just, you know, kind of like what the complex in the white papers for the white paper was impressive from the stage.

569
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:41,650
And, you know, like, what did you do? So this is like a what is the policy mechanism for them to ask for some information so that

570
01:00:41,650 --> 01:00:46,240
they can pay legislators and get more information because it is exactly what they want to know.

571
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:51,340
Right. Well, you know, I think they look at the modeling and what it means to them.

572
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:58,750
Yeah. And we also also accept my policy stance for entire cities, because if you don't implemented.

573
01:00:58,770 --> 01:01:02,470
So probably it's not very effective on the one hand and it could be awful on the other.

574
01:01:03,970 --> 01:01:07,940
All right. Yeah. How much do we want to.

575
01:01:07,990 --> 01:01:12,000
Let's talk about the cumbersome finger picking, okay?

576
01:01:12,810 --> 01:01:19,600
Oh, yeah. So Columbus and Cleveland were two of the larger cities that we chose to look at.

577
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:29,379
And Columbus really took a approach to this, that they wanted to do the best that they could with this policy.

578
01:01:29,380 --> 01:01:32,740
So they added on a lot of things that is more than just off putting.

579
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:36,520
So they wanted to have a grant like gold standard enforcement regime.

580
01:01:36,530 --> 01:01:44,169
And you have to remember, Columbus is also the capital of the state. So you also have to think about like where politically these these places are.

581
01:01:44,170 --> 01:01:52,660
So they wanted to have a good gold standard regime that people could then copy throughout the state.

582
01:01:53,290 --> 01:01:57,280
They had a model policy. They based on food inspection. So this was really interesting.

583
01:01:57,490 --> 01:02:02,850
So they were taking it out of the hands of law enforcement who are saying, we're too busy, we don't want to deal with this.

584
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:06,250
Also, we don't want to target people early.

585
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:11,560
And then they put it into the hands of public health because public health is at the table and willing to do that.

586
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:16,899
So they did a compliance checks with the Unitarians,

587
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:23,980
which are the people who go in and check the refrigerator temperature and the food safety example at all these different convenience shops.

588
01:02:24,220 --> 01:02:29,950
And because there is such an overlap with grocery stores, convenience stores, pharmacies, etc.,

589
01:02:30,130 --> 01:02:37,390
that sell tobacco products and also food, this is a really great way for them to kind of check in on both.

590
01:02:37,690 --> 01:02:45,580
And there was also this idea that it would be a bit less threatening because when people come in to do the dirty food inspection,

591
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:49,340
that's not a big deal. That's not the right.

592
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:53,310
The groups that are always concerned, you know, these come.

593
01:02:54,130 --> 01:02:59,420
You have to have some kind of relationship. There is a bit of that.

594
01:02:59,830 --> 01:03:08,410
And so it makes sense to try to do of somebody to convey information on how to comply with that.

595
01:03:08,710 --> 01:03:12,610
And when we're talking about like what the enforcement is to, you know,

596
01:03:12,610 --> 01:03:18,220
it's at the discretion of the enforcer who's doing it, whether they want to do a fine, whether they want to do a warning.

597
01:03:18,430 --> 01:03:22,450
So there was a lot of talk about like how many warnings you get, one warning,

598
01:03:22,450 --> 01:03:25,540
and then you get this fine and then a large amount and then a larger one.

599
01:03:25,810 --> 01:03:32,080
And then because they had a license after a certain time, you could take away the license from those retailers if they refused to comply.

600
01:03:32,290 --> 01:03:37,150
Whereas in Michigan, we have people who are upheld by the FDA five or six times and nothing is under them.

601
01:03:37,890 --> 01:03:45,220
Yeah. Then they get on the one hand that enforcement and then on the other hand taking the store to court.

602
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:55,900
Yes. Somebody who's in a relative gets to the door and then subjecting that to a criminal case

603
01:03:55,900 --> 01:04:02,740
because the owner of the business didn't give them three days of reporting requirements.

604
01:04:03,250 --> 01:04:06,760
Well, and it's crummy because they'll get pirated for selling those.

605
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:09,100
Then they'll get fired for getting a job.

606
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:20,380
So so the big thing to stop is the time that they can do stuff, particularly if it takes to actually implement this policy.

607
01:04:20,740 --> 01:04:23,170
You have to work force. You have to be trained.

608
01:04:23,650 --> 01:04:33,100
You have to have signage, which is you're probably going to try to do outreach on a regular basis with these folks who do cycle to their jobs.

609
01:04:33,610 --> 01:04:41,259
So they used to they would tell me they were very happy when they managed to get more marks come through

610
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:49,080
the training and how they so and then join this development training because this was a big PR workforce.

611
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:55,240
It requires a lot of sustained effort over time. You got to have money to do this.

612
01:04:56,080 --> 01:05:02,290
If we switch to the AP when you can see that that was. Exactly so this is the good the good in this scenario.

613
01:05:02,290 --> 01:05:06,390
Cleveland, which passed it first after seeing the failure in Cleveland,

614
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:12,850
they wanted to do better and recently took off work during passage so that depending on Stevens.

615
01:05:13,810 --> 01:05:19,030
Well if you think if you think that it's like me going off to find some kind

616
01:05:19,030 --> 01:05:25,870
of social agenda here the if I forgot that all the employee related to the

617
01:05:25,870 --> 01:05:32,800
fact of purchasing and it was secret so that it really affected the entire

618
01:05:33,010 --> 01:05:38,490
discussion said that it actually appears to ignore the difficult part for them,

619
01:05:38,710 --> 01:05:46,420
that they have a lot of grant funding to do the implementation. They did not go through all the things that have dedicated government funding,

620
01:05:46,430 --> 01:05:51,160
support this outreach, training, etc. So they were able to do some public.

621
01:05:52,210 --> 01:05:56,380
They were able to do something to not make the resources available.

622
01:05:56,710 --> 01:06:02,970
But those are some cases who are beginning events pretty regularly, obviously, because it is not renewable.

623
01:06:03,530 --> 01:06:11,470
This is what I'm certain of. And they couldn't get the licenses necessary to perform this activity.

624
01:06:11,570 --> 01:06:12,160
Simple.

625
01:06:13,420 --> 01:06:23,710
Also in this new story is that it is an investigative journalism around this, and nobody knew who was in charge and figured this is a big problem.

626
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:31,600
A journalist called up the publisher and said, yeah, we want to talk to you on that interview about this new policy.

627
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:40,590
And people said that these sorts of things and then they blew up the police and the police said, no, no, we don't enforce these proposals.

628
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:50,710
You have to go to court. So it was not clear at all who was initially who was in charge of making policy and which agency would do what.

629
01:06:51,310 --> 01:07:02,560
And so for those reasons, not only the understandings of the authority concerns and the concerns about what's really important for us is even

630
01:07:02,740 --> 01:07:10,780
basic when you compare it to the higher complex that they have to get across the scale almost to run from these issues.

631
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:18,340
And they have been. And they had access to more resources in terms of the workforce.

632
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:23,380
And, of course, this all gets back to just agency authority jurisdiction.

633
01:07:23,590 --> 01:07:28,479
I mean, that's pretty much all I'll say. If you guys are writing to the agencies next week and you're like, What can I do?

634
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:32,800
What are the things that they can do? Because that comes up all the time in this work.

635
01:07:32,950 --> 01:07:35,350
But if you want to think about implementation of it,

636
01:07:35,370 --> 01:07:42,870
because this is the kind of thing so you want to go for and how are we going to save these efforts over time, not just one?

637
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:47,650
Yeah, because you may have supported the policy houses, but you also may not have a community around.

638
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:57,069
Yeah. So during of participation projects, one of the things we have this really well-established organization,

639
01:07:57,070 --> 01:08:04,150
respected suffragette, and then it was able to really complete its association.

640
01:08:04,690 --> 01:08:09,730
You can't rely on the nonprofit sector. There has to be some government involvement.

641
01:08:10,270 --> 01:08:13,629
I'm sorry. We are done today. Thank you very much.

642
01:08:13,630 --> 01:08:23,380
She sent her desk. Prime Minister, someone has questions as to how to use it.

643
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:38,800
Yeah, I. I like. I'm not sure where.
