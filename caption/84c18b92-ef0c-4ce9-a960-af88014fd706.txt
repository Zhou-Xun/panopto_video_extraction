1
00:00:04,443 --> 00:00:13,333
I'm very happy to be able to introduce y you who today who's joining us joining us from University of Missouri,

2
00:00:13,353 --> 00:00:15,933
the Department of Statistics, where he's an assistant professor.

3
00:00:16,753 --> 00:00:20,043
Before that, he was a post-doc with and he's chairman of the University of Connecticut.

4
00:00:20,613 --> 00:00:23,793
And before that, paid his Ph.D. at Florida State University.

5
00:00:24,663 --> 00:00:33,183
So Professor, he works in basic parametric spatial point processes, causal inference, big data inference and survival analysis.

6
00:00:33,423 --> 00:00:37,463
So I'm very excited to hear more about that and to have him join us today.

7
00:00:37,503 --> 00:00:40,503
So I thought it over to you. So that's my.

8
00:00:43,013 --> 00:00:49,793
Okay. Soldiers and wives. And also, as you mentioned last month, give me a chance.

9
00:00:50,003 --> 00:00:55,703
If this confrontation and assault is not within my power to visit the campus,

10
00:00:55,703 --> 00:01:00,683
I'll be in Champaign and with my son, my old friends and some new friends.

11
00:01:01,073 --> 00:01:04,713
So they might call us about the University of Dayton.

12
00:01:05,633 --> 00:01:09,323
So an affinity was there for my public school go to.

13
00:01:09,983 --> 00:01:17,663
The first is that out of the vanishing and recently retired professor urban and he really is the student I got my name

14
00:01:17,963 --> 00:01:24,113
and gender propaganda then there was no way to settle for office and university like you should to have rock and roll.

15
00:01:24,603 --> 00:01:28,793
Well, I was like to say it's an act of genius both on my research.

16
00:01:29,513 --> 00:01:31,853
So this is the Ohio today, my box.

17
00:01:31,973 --> 00:01:41,503
So first of all, if you saw my house where all woman or why do this kind of movement and then I would start to move for next woman.

18
00:01:41,813 --> 00:01:49,553
Finally, I will come with my research. It was out of the research and my daughter was at first, you know, ambitions.

19
00:01:50,033 --> 00:01:55,253
So how does the data is very useful and out that adding this test and process

20
00:01:55,583 --> 00:02:02,393
your daily life the of because our whole assessment was made clear all new

21
00:02:02,393 --> 00:02:08,332
channels also we can help make the housing curve of the complex and also we can

22
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:13,743
have all a daily electricity usage I spoke about today why they don't ask.

23
00:02:13,763 --> 00:02:17,363
So we look at different record that is sustainable for us.

24
00:02:17,693 --> 00:02:23,003
We can have one more example that is coinciding growth, a case growth curves.

25
00:02:23,453 --> 00:02:33,593
So these are, you know, that my site is, I think five days the pulse rate occur from the March 14th to May up to June 1925.

26
00:02:34,043 --> 00:02:40,613
So that is the big bricks to accommodate and reconcile these that every day you is here.

27
00:02:41,273 --> 00:02:48,842
So I can see that just from the lot. Right. And all this not you cannot buy anything, but it is not functioning.

28
00:02:48,843 --> 00:02:54,833
Now, we can easily show that this kind of there are some clear pattern of these kind of goals red curve

29
00:02:54,983 --> 00:03:00,923
for different states so that is book is going to buy your data gives meet more information about

30
00:03:00,923 --> 00:03:08,812
these kind of this and really based on this kind of five states we can put here you see too

31
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:15,083
happens the one pattern is for the California Arizona now Texas and the other project is broader.

32
00:03:15,143 --> 00:03:19,103
European values motivated me to do some research.

33
00:03:19,373 --> 00:03:23,513
How can why does I know Nathan Houser? There's often a spatial problem.

34
00:03:25,003 --> 00:03:31,923
So you'll see the overview. The spatial data is a 3000 study that connected the from differential rappel or spatial.

35
00:03:32,803 --> 00:03:41,283
So that means we have a lot of examples like for in the case of different states also, you know, matter to point if I imagine well,

36
00:03:41,383 --> 00:03:48,763
different local stations also we have obituaries I'm sorry, an article regarding stuff you can't index all of your proceedings.

37
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:52,153
What that means is that a lot of spatial data.

38
00:03:53,053 --> 00:03:59,773
So and also based on all four of the figures we can find that three it happens among these places

39
00:04:00,103 --> 00:04:07,033
that a means class analysis is more useful if I'm asked while class and there's then some similarity

40
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:15,503
and pattern of simultaneous and also if we know in a pattern some place makers can have a lot more

41
00:04:15,523 --> 00:04:23,173
good strategy to make the decisions based on style efficient resource allocation for the CMC.

42
00:04:23,383 --> 00:04:28,273
They have similar things to control the pool, so that is almost based motivation.

43
00:04:29,183 --> 00:04:35,273
So after that. Yeah. Yeah. So that is a major question and answer it a different issue.

44
00:04:35,693 --> 00:04:41,633
How can we detect spatial clusters that all of the entire spectrum is true?

45
00:04:42,933 --> 00:04:48,963
So first I really thought this was on because you so the family are crossing you not have your topics.

46
00:04:49,233 --> 00:04:58,293
So there are a lot of people that we do the family book example if we have seen like in Matrix all this imagery between emotions,

47
00:04:58,593 --> 00:05:02,463
we can easily use the paintings. You're right because we find it.

48
00:05:03,423 --> 00:05:10,763
So that is I would love to do that in the heart. And also if we have some privacy model recapitalizing.

49
00:05:10,773 --> 00:05:15,633
Mr. Meacham over the whole approach, that is a reasonable approach.

50
00:05:16,203 --> 00:05:22,293
But well, these kind of page long view, I think they need to persist by the novel customer,

51
00:05:22,443 --> 00:05:30,883
you know or slack not all of hazard based on so that if you're a book if you not that as e-books in our that.

52
00:05:32,043 --> 00:05:35,883
So can we estimate the number of cancer simultaneously?

53
00:05:36,543 --> 00:05:40,393
So that I mean, I do not want this kind of two step approach.

54
00:05:40,803 --> 00:05:48,643
I want you to ask the number of customers and the population that is on programs, obviously.

55
00:05:50,133 --> 00:05:57,953
And also. Oh, they have especially it has also been some iteration of this kind of spatial devices.

56
00:05:58,373 --> 00:06:04,643
How can we do this thing now? So at least maybe three major browsers like all have out of.

57
00:06:05,153 --> 00:06:12,223
The first massive basal cell. But that is the business that at least we saw from the stage of the rules.

58
00:06:12,563 --> 00:06:17,453
Based on these things, we find the locals are. Does that matter?

59
00:06:17,693 --> 00:06:25,003
I call that a penalized approach. I think the people also do the work with jobs and this kind of opportunity that I guess

60
00:06:25,013 --> 00:06:29,863
pays off people as the right approach fuels nearby location with the same practice.

61
00:06:30,193 --> 00:06:40,313
So that is the organizing approach. And also the sort of post made approach is how those so as so make sure ways kind of the reasonable.

62
00:06:42,073 --> 00:06:51,383
But I still in that. What kind of special Costa Rica can we just consider local culture?

63
00:06:52,043 --> 00:06:56,073
How can we consider global? Is welcome.

64
00:06:56,783 --> 00:07:01,633
So here I want to show some examples. The first example is from the environment science.

65
00:07:01,943 --> 00:07:16,523
That is the kind of hype in the United States. So, for example, if we trace why one comes from this bigger point or a large region we lost who say,

66
00:07:17,363 --> 00:07:26,053
for example, in the north, in the northwest, we can find that last of these kind of cold kind of ice.

67
00:07:26,393 --> 00:07:29,783
And it may maybe in the salsa. It's.

68
00:07:30,413 --> 00:07:38,953
You asked that is this kind of whole. And all these people we can find a nearby location tends to be in the same place.

69
00:07:39,823 --> 00:07:44,923
So that means spatial continuum of pattern design and kind of spatial data.

70
00:07:46,153 --> 00:07:54,913
So that is the first pattern we find based on solid enamel signs and also based on some of the controls we also have.

71
00:07:54,913 --> 00:07:59,653
I think it is because I feel the median income which each state.

72
00:08:00,073 --> 00:08:05,803
So we can find the median cop in New England, a real neck in New York, Massachusetts,

73
00:08:05,923 --> 00:08:11,833
Connecticut, how we're seeing those and also where we're seeing the users, the MRI values.

74
00:08:12,343 --> 00:08:18,143
So these have a similar pattern as all Americans but the US this regions increases.

75
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:24,443
But we also can find this in New England area or east of the area.

76
00:08:24,703 --> 00:08:28,233
We have worries theme around meeting. We can point.

77
00:08:29,113 --> 00:08:36,493
They are far away from each other, but still they are having the same set, not only equal to spatial information.

78
00:08:36,673 --> 00:08:46,153
It helps us to do the causal. Also, they are also observed copolymers have effects outside of even cost structure.

79
00:08:46,363 --> 00:08:54,183
So that means the eastern region can see the two. So that means we need to consider both these kind of spatial conflicts.

80
00:08:54,193 --> 00:09:00,293
It also because it is kind of spatial. So what about shoes?

81
00:09:01,003 --> 00:09:04,093
The first thing you want to ask? Why you said much.

82
00:09:04,693 --> 00:09:11,413
What are my views and ambitions? So what I want to do is I want to give you a of the patient framework.

83
00:09:11,923 --> 00:09:19,333
If you have something where you see the patient and a patient with a castle and also we do not want you.

84
00:09:20,823 --> 00:09:28,143
The asylum has a number of beds. So that means we want to ascertain that all customers and across the country are using pipes.

85
00:09:29,323 --> 00:09:35,863
Seconds says we have special needs. That is, we need you want without some geographic information.

86
00:09:36,073 --> 00:09:45,563
Any kind of social commentator has said that with. That serves as a feedback present for us, our customers.

87
00:09:46,063 --> 00:09:51,613
We also want to allow for both locally and globally.

88
00:09:51,643 --> 00:09:58,773
This is our first veto, but most of the time the local council uses.

89
00:09:59,143 --> 00:10:03,283
Also, we have this kind of local nomadic politicians.

90
00:10:04,113 --> 00:10:08,183
So then I asked myself several questions. Since I was.

91
00:10:09,043 --> 00:10:18,753
The first question is what kind of partners? How can you design a fire to meet like breast cancer for reconsideration?

92
00:10:19,233 --> 00:10:26,883
Same concept in the crossword and the afro norwegian allow this kind of a global hospice response.

93
00:10:27,243 --> 00:10:31,323
How can we help other counties designed to try to achieve our goal?

94
00:10:32,663 --> 00:10:37,833
The sandwich is awesome. This is crazy. Some people do not like issue.

95
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:43,643
How can we do the. How would the become. How can we envision to get our business up?

96
00:10:44,093 --> 00:10:50,813
Get on with that I think. So that I need to get my hands in the galley.

97
00:10:50,843 --> 00:10:57,763
Kitchen samples. The hatchet maybe from that they use some pressure from the mathematics that you just.

98
00:10:57,773 --> 00:11:07,733
So that is what kind of threat. Yes. How we get so that in these chemicals easily ascertainable crossers and the cost calculation.

99
00:11:08,243 --> 00:11:11,833
So that is our customers. So that is the motivation.

100
00:11:11,843 --> 00:11:20,063
And look how I feel right now to move our first project that I use called model based company course.

101
00:11:20,693 --> 00:11:23,903
In the beginning, I want to introduce how Fisher. Fisher.

102
00:11:25,323 --> 00:11:29,703
So we have happy going on a little. You can't have this kind of space observation,

103
00:11:30,063 --> 00:11:36,623
these kind of these they are multivariate functional hazardous and the which you we

104
00:11:36,673 --> 00:11:42,033
post-operative and model yet and we have these kind of classes single practice.

105
00:11:42,303 --> 00:11:45,313
The practice can be better or whatever.

106
00:11:45,323 --> 00:11:53,283
Right. And what we do is pull these kinds of things, which usually means that it means if we know we have a concert,

107
00:11:53,613 --> 00:12:00,693
but then at least VII can continue to want to keep at it for these kind of cartography.

108
00:12:00,993 --> 00:12:06,183
And for that, you said what really is our mission to be for one and each population to be greater than zero?

109
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:13,232
That's not a lot as we're all personal, so we can't go to these kind of vision problems that is worse than that.

110
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:21,183
And then for these kind of possible tragedies, we can give them some facts, for example, if we consider calcium levels.

111
00:12:21,573 --> 00:12:28,083
So what is a calcium response? So here beta can be barriers and mean.

112
00:12:28,353 --> 00:12:32,093
So here we can give these kind of back to normal approach.

113
00:12:32,763 --> 00:12:37,793
So that is the idea how patient and I here if we just use this.

114
00:12:38,873 --> 00:12:49,483
We still use the Ps5 Nemo costume. So what possible solution if we just let this kind of hey goes to museums so this

115
00:12:49,723 --> 00:12:55,033
financial model because you do see a product that makes more sense based on this model,

116
00:12:55,213 --> 00:12:59,383
we have some intensity increase on our process and it accomplishes.

117
00:12:59,923 --> 00:13:00,933
So that is always the.

118
00:13:02,143 --> 00:13:12,763
But have for some reason, although it's what we the said of Zen, we know that, of course, that was a very flexible and efficient assassination.

119
00:13:13,123 --> 00:13:15,723
Now some see a radical and incredible. Sure.

120
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:24,523
And all of the opposition, although we can also see the green information or tax orientation for the complainant, is also a revision.

121
00:13:24,673 --> 00:13:36,393
We have will. But if we just consider the partition sample wrong, digit percentage are posterior tend to have multiple small transition costs.

122
00:13:36,963 --> 00:13:41,883
So that means the interest for the initial model always will be over.

123
00:13:42,483 --> 00:13:50,943
So that means if we have to that you point out each and model always about you that's Medicaid qualifying before that is.

124
00:13:51,693 --> 00:14:00,323
So there are two drawbacks, but you should have, for example, the first rule that is, it cannot give us a confusing affirmation when.

125
00:14:01,353 --> 00:14:06,663
It always does. The second is these are course that we can model.

126
00:14:06,933 --> 00:14:14,383
That's not not rich geographic information. So now I would just ask how you kind of shape what happens.

127
00:14:15,193 --> 00:14:21,203
So you are open to the possibility. What?

128
00:14:25,643 --> 00:14:28,853
That is a good question. That is a full set of things.

129
00:14:28,973 --> 00:14:38,133
So that means that, frankly, even though they have got opposite issues, how does the public know now that each of number.

130
00:14:38,883 --> 00:14:44,483
But it was a project. So now I'm with these guys, all this kind of support, and we should have all the rules.

131
00:14:46,013 --> 00:14:50,083
So here we have also our we're famous Chinese rules.

132
00:14:50,783 --> 00:14:55,373
But anyways, if we have a problem, we're all going over ourselves.

133
00:14:55,883 --> 00:15:02,453
If we assign somehow meaning the single, that means this customer will be in the same position.

134
00:15:03,023 --> 00:15:13,883
So what is kind of what are the world goals? So that is if we already have full customer in the SRI, it was table Y to this segment level.

135
00:15:14,183 --> 00:15:21,203
And if we have a newcomer joining this kind of restaurant, how can we assign common five seasons hazard a new houses.

136
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:27,533
So for the people what the customer five seating the table what that would equals to three divided by

137
00:15:28,163 --> 00:15:37,223
four and encouraging people to do what might want as nine new tables that properties are divided by four.

138
00:15:37,313 --> 00:15:43,133
So that means that some of the four really good what will be where zero list and what that is.

139
00:15:44,883 --> 00:15:48,203
So I just outlined a little process. Okay, easy, Parker.

140
00:15:49,053 --> 00:15:52,953
Now, where are we? What happens? The rich gas riches.

141
00:15:53,373 --> 00:16:00,393
But that means if we have more people on, then they have high profit to attract the new.

142
00:16:01,563 --> 00:16:11,673
That is a that is trying to resources. So that is the reason why this kind of tax reform process does not come with this kind of direct valuation.

143
00:16:11,983 --> 00:16:20,223
So it will treat this kind of customer. So, you know, single salaries and the recruitment process.

144
00:16:20,383 --> 00:16:24,343
Well, we have, you know, a customer sitting in limbo.

145
00:16:24,703 --> 00:16:32,483
The new customer will say to either an existing hotel with a credit card, you know, I'm a customer using Tinkerbell and also the you.

146
00:16:33,873 --> 00:16:38,283
So anyways, each customer I was at that time I was on the curve was on a six.

147
00:16:39,483 --> 00:16:43,203
But we'll make off the record. Well, we should pay bills.

148
00:16:43,923 --> 00:16:48,183
We tend to choose the table. Read more, our friends.

149
00:16:49,223 --> 00:16:56,383
So that is human nature. But this whole kind of transparent process does not consider this kind of human.

150
00:16:57,233 --> 00:17:03,503
So what we want to do is to get some geographic information quantified, this kind of relationship.

151
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:08,062
So our idea is what this report idea is.

152
00:17:08,063 --> 00:17:14,363
We propose we call that it is a geographical within. So now that means a new customer.

153
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:19,673
Joe I just kind of see the table. You can go with for a baby brings you some weights.

154
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:26,833
The summation of using tables customers and we see that in your table always saying already

155
00:17:26,933 --> 00:17:33,803
these are so here these with qualified friendship between the new customer to zero.

156
00:17:34,613 --> 00:17:39,373
So that means if one table have more friends at the movie, join.

157
00:17:40,383 --> 00:17:45,723
So that is our idea. If you love residual value, you know, having process.

158
00:17:46,383 --> 00:17:57,633
So how can we talk to vice president or Joe about the idea we just have this way using spatial functional spatial centralism from the first of all,

159
00:17:57,663 --> 00:18:05,563
our job in our season maybe. But you know by this new vision should be more that is in this observation.

160
00:18:05,853 --> 00:18:10,263
So here we have this kind of ECG function of citizens from the.

161
00:18:11,613 --> 00:18:14,663
So that the means. You know, I was spatial somehow.

162
00:18:15,123 --> 00:18:19,263
If we have huge space is nearby, we will have moments.

163
00:18:19,563 --> 00:18:27,483
For example, if Mister Rogers Restaurant either will have a fireplace to Ohio ambiance for that exact year.

164
00:18:27,783 --> 00:18:32,573
And here we all want you to know all the facts here. Really inferences.

165
00:18:32,793 --> 00:18:37,593
So here we just we said, what is this kind of space to represent his mental state?

166
00:18:38,883 --> 00:18:48,993
So in this kind of definition, what we can happen is if we have eight zero, then a vote is more than we reduce our traditional about process.

167
00:18:49,233 --> 00:18:56,283
So this then does not but it goes on even if we just have these kind of zero y axis.

168
00:18:57,363 --> 00:19:02,403
So that is all the idea. How can we formulate a coffee process that is this?

169
00:19:02,733 --> 00:19:06,293
This is also my first question. How can we design this have.

170
00:19:06,303 --> 00:19:11,223
All right. Now, the next question is how come all the functions.

171
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:18,703
So the well if we use the word respect yes the first well for the mean that's what we wanted was the basic

172
00:19:18,723 --> 00:19:24,603
set of exposure without here we use a piece right here and also we try different order and different notes.

173
00:19:24,993 --> 00:19:30,793
Yeah. Not much more sensitive. So but also we can use maybe functional piece if you want.

174
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:40,013
We'll pass. The segment, since this is the part of the hospital here, we also want to have a central structure over time, the residual.

175
00:19:40,293 --> 00:19:47,193
So here we try we try this kind of simple air structure that if you got this, will kind of go, hey,

176
00:19:47,493 --> 00:19:55,863
no is control these kind of temporal pollution and here Zika virus as well is a cough that will grow from this.

177
00:19:56,523 --> 00:20:00,603
That is for the capital formation. And that step is.

178
00:20:00,843 --> 00:20:06,363
You want to also invite the special folks here, although there is still no makeup.

179
00:20:06,753 --> 00:20:09,992
So we would traditionally use this kind of condition.

180
00:20:09,993 --> 00:20:15,243
All the request prior to that is a cobbled up, that is a well department and this kind of stuff.

181
00:20:15,483 --> 00:20:20,283
So here you have to have this kind of sterilizing residual for these kind of motorboat launch.

182
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:27,353
It's a mean zero. And here five is 25 spatial coordination and this kind of cop.

183
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:32,223
So here you order to make these kind of matrix possible sample down here.

184
00:20:32,433 --> 00:20:37,173
So we need to have some clustering. What is kind of a. So that is a basic idea.

185
00:20:37,353 --> 00:20:40,503
We how we want to. So that is worse than us.

186
00:20:41,133 --> 00:20:45,233
So compare combine our prior and I'll do the model.

187
00:20:45,543 --> 00:20:54,663
We have the handle, you have a little structure. So here it is called high level functional data, these people and the complications.

188
00:20:54,753 --> 00:21:00,723
So it is even this kind of class. So these are parameters, but it has the and the signals.

189
00:21:00,723 --> 00:21:04,263
These will these kind of residual content look about launch future.

190
00:21:04,623 --> 00:21:08,493
So can we have a kind of separable temporal and single coordination?

191
00:21:08,733 --> 00:21:10,673
Here we can use gestures to quantify,

192
00:21:11,043 --> 00:21:20,283
but also here you'll look I use some compact what complicated let's spectral temporal collection and here then we put these kind of.

193
00:21:21,673 --> 00:21:28,263
Spatial coordination and coordination appropriate so that it's global parameters and that you gave these high,

194
00:21:28,293 --> 00:21:35,003
low cost specific parameters of where we stand up distribution and in all cases because that was our geographical.

195
00:21:36,573 --> 00:21:39,633
So this is finish over here.

196
00:21:40,573 --> 00:21:44,443
And I think this will end up in the. So the.

197
00:21:46,713 --> 00:21:52,033
The way you use the way. Wait.

198
00:21:52,633 --> 00:21:56,533
So which party was here in such a low level with high. So we have one.

199
00:21:56,773 --> 00:22:01,793
I would probably use that for superintending the whole process and this age, complete with.

200
00:22:03,193 --> 00:22:05,133
Which part of your. Yeah.

201
00:22:05,273 --> 00:22:14,143
The wisdom is that these values are possible without the means of what these and always have the effect on the cytoplasm for babies the couple has.

202
00:22:17,153 --> 00:22:20,343
Well, at the same time, what you see in the weeks and.

203
00:22:21,293 --> 00:22:27,832
I don't know what is not. But we have one too new frontiers for these kind of works that is so qualified.

204
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:37,363
A special mission. So yes, we can say yes, you do.

205
00:22:39,023 --> 00:22:42,293
Yeah. Does that. Yeah.

206
00:22:42,293 --> 00:22:47,893
But yeah, we just have some ads on local, but we do not have that capacity of work.

207
00:22:48,343 --> 00:22:51,563
But still we can try different way in Belgium.

208
00:22:52,793 --> 00:22:57,553
That is, after choosing a willing partner in other subjects.

209
00:22:58,313 --> 00:23:01,403
To all things. But it has to be some.

210
00:23:03,233 --> 00:23:06,423
Some. Yes.

211
00:23:06,473 --> 00:23:11,353
Yes. Yes. Simple questions. Well, that is our here at home, Luke.

212
00:23:11,953 --> 00:23:22,613
Yeah. So what's the question? Yeah. It's this fight ground for always exist to fight for you to actually correct this deafness.

213
00:23:23,303 --> 00:23:30,083
Yes. Is that based on Kamal though we have is by fire is the receptacle the minimum and maximum opportunities.

214
00:23:31,633 --> 00:23:36,423
So yeah that I think it's amazing that we have to always find the.

215
00:23:36,953 --> 00:23:42,373
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

216
00:23:42,733 --> 00:23:46,883
That is a problem that the local governments. Okay.

217
00:23:47,563 --> 00:23:51,823
Yeah. So that is the theoretical models and they'll be mobile by the.

218
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:58,353
The competition is not. The idea is so that we have to make progress.

219
00:23:58,653 --> 00:24:04,503
The basic idea to the competition is we integrate our people so we can not walk into that behavior.

220
00:24:05,073 --> 00:24:12,543
So we we we talk to all of us and we just said, if we know the want it, we have to look at is arsenic.

221
00:24:13,143 --> 00:24:19,143
So that is just never seen again. Now, the basic idea is to figure out, okay,

222
00:24:19,593 --> 00:24:29,263
so major idea is which as opposed to Z condition a lot of progress said we kept says we have the similar 40 hours times level.

223
00:24:30,003 --> 00:24:35,653
So here we can get close to all of these kind of whole conditional of the others yet even more.

224
00:24:36,753 --> 00:24:45,143
And I think you kind of see parameters that fast parameters and then we jump up in kind of class wide parameters based on Z, Z.

225
00:24:45,353 --> 00:24:50,593
Here we have a normal, normal model. So here we have have all conditional.

226
00:24:51,033 --> 00:24:56,913
And then finally we often find out, oh, I know y based on multiple occasions.

227
00:24:57,243 --> 00:25:00,263
So that is universal or still is very easy to get to.

228
00:25:01,643 --> 00:25:04,863
But that is a major idea. How come you didn't have that?

229
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:09,333
Come here. We will jump in here.

230
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:14,793
We do not need to have some up on location so that someone activates where we.

231
00:25:15,833 --> 00:25:22,273
So that is the vision I'm sensing after. The last thing is when we get the samples.

232
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:29,243
How can we do that if. Since these Operation Recap was assembled.

233
00:25:29,483 --> 00:25:38,513
What became Al Jazeera's call for me immediately, if you want, because I go for the meaning of the word equals a weapon of war.

234
00:25:39,053 --> 00:25:45,143
There are no meetings or concerts. And also they also labels, which is about packaging.

235
00:25:45,593 --> 00:25:51,983
So here what we do is use these kind of hotels, master, to obtain the positive influence of the custom.

236
00:25:52,853 --> 00:26:00,083
So the method you is when you summarize membership metrics based on how each M.S. reaches the membership fee.

237
00:26:00,473 --> 00:26:07,163
So the beat that being is a smartphone, and by the metrics e z are equal to J.

238
00:26:07,253 --> 00:26:12,373
That means B.I.G. Because what? I had a beta and a big four zero.

239
00:26:13,823 --> 00:26:23,483
So what do we have? Isn't careful. My post here mean I'll be signing a membership matrix and then we just buy clothes, pieces and watch a matrix.

240
00:26:23,723 --> 00:26:29,493
You know what I'm saying? Equation. And then use that information as all of us data assemble.

241
00:26:30,273 --> 00:26:35,913
So that is the basic idea of how we saw this kind of cosmic sunrise in South Asia.

242
00:26:36,003 --> 00:26:43,233
Everything else, massive as we exist now that we can move, almost brings it up.

243
00:26:43,803 --> 00:26:53,753
So here we have two scenario. The first scenario, we have both these kind of low level closer and you can see that East Coast in the west in Hazard.

244
00:26:54,033 --> 00:27:00,273
And then a scenario, we just have this kind of local. We want to see how a massacre.

245
00:27:01,403 --> 00:27:10,013
And then we also consider two of the models. The first of all, the generation is that they are high generated by all of those models without a means.

246
00:27:10,343 --> 00:27:20,803
Our model is correct. The acid defamation that is, which, you know, we all date have frozen etymology that is so bad for eviction.

247
00:27:21,703 --> 00:27:24,733
That is where we stand. The problem is kind of the kitchen disease.

248
00:27:25,273 --> 00:27:27,613
And so that means all motel is not.

249
00:27:29,443 --> 00:27:39,133
And also we come out and as a result, these are frozen models for traditional visa process and also comparison some international means, Brazil.

250
00:27:39,373 --> 00:27:46,753
And so it was a job at the consulate. And here we all will model out our way of this kind of with crime union.

251
00:27:47,203 --> 00:27:56,263
If you by maximizing. But that is based on here and here at shop at West Shore, these kind of cosmic equity results.

252
00:27:56,773 --> 00:28:00,463
So use the running back to shoulder cost accuracy.

253
00:28:00,763 --> 00:28:06,163
So based on the different format of the setup, all matter can be almost massive.

254
00:28:06,253 --> 00:28:12,253
Even the model is not what I would have seen on because I haven't seen.

255
00:28:13,813 --> 00:28:17,773
Lebanese all matter as a separate class oppose this kind of.

256
00:28:19,263 --> 00:28:23,423
Special company, Macassar and Whole. Yes.

257
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:27,063
So you said you were going to the polls? Yeah.

258
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:33,133
Yes. Your costs are actually. Corresponding to the case of all.

259
00:28:34,053 --> 00:28:37,473
We're not necessarily, he says.

260
00:28:37,713 --> 00:28:41,043
You know, that's why he's here. And the course labels.

261
00:28:41,283 --> 00:28:45,423
We just need to increase the level of at least the level.

262
00:28:46,573 --> 00:28:52,513
So we all at based on market. Than.

263
00:28:57,853 --> 00:29:05,423
So are you getting as in the drafting process, are you getting the number of clusters or are you sort of.

264
00:29:06,623 --> 00:29:11,153
Are you better off for picking one? Lost.

265
00:29:13,103 --> 00:29:18,003
Yes, we can summarize the memo to summarize positive consequences.

266
00:29:18,023 --> 00:29:25,012
I send you some paper. There was definitely a road to summarize here is that we have these are no labels regime so

267
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:31,633
academies what do we summarize pick up what represent you in the region as our process.

268
00:29:32,893 --> 00:29:38,443
That is basically I guess my question is. It seems like you're using like two.

269
00:29:42,833 --> 00:29:49,073
They asked her. My question is, are they?

270
00:29:51,263 --> 00:29:54,713
The polls, the process is really changing the definition.

271
00:29:58,503 --> 00:30:03,033
No, I don't think. That's what this movie crashes.

272
00:30:03,683 --> 00:30:06,943
So that is almost in this study and that while we're really.

273
00:30:08,063 --> 00:30:12,973
There's a golf world in last place in the Gulf where the curse of the euro stakes here.

274
00:30:13,313 --> 00:30:21,983
How do you define the result of all these kind of special cuts, special computer customers and also any kind of cost of war?

275
00:30:22,433 --> 00:30:32,363
You define the US armed forces a still we have now Louisiana Michigan in these first classes says and also this is estimated being her.

276
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:45,103
So we can see that in this case, he's rapidly drop, rapid drop in this kind of way, how they help much and also how closely they are stayed.

277
00:30:45,123 --> 00:30:50,013
If you go over one of the California, you go back out and fix up for us.

278
00:30:50,253 --> 00:30:56,582
So steel and also state it is kind of they have pulled in more companies compared with

279
00:30:56,583 --> 00:31:02,853
our first look at it is the border and it's all like dramatically increase in length of.

280
00:31:04,143 --> 00:31:10,943
So Senator Battisti was were we open before and Governor will be home, you know.

281
00:31:11,933 --> 00:31:18,153
And also in class five, that is some classroom meal by the new year by new.

282
00:31:18,233 --> 00:31:24,743
This is the problem. That is the five sense. That is because see that in most of these things that control not.

283
00:31:25,163 --> 00:31:31,133
And that is what is low slow since that is and also both these government will

284
00:31:31,133 --> 00:31:36,763
have some contraction of size in and divorce and extend in hope that honestly.

285
00:31:37,843 --> 00:31:45,843
So that we can see that he's kind of holding pace. It also depends on the different state government that is yet.

286
00:31:45,883 --> 00:31:50,293
And also we have seen a pilot that hasn't always been accustomed.

287
00:31:51,143 --> 00:31:54,323
So if only I can show that this kind of process for me and qualified.

288
00:31:54,383 --> 00:32:00,163
So these are just all observed occur. This is all we're asking occur so we can see that we didn't closer.

289
00:32:00,443 --> 00:32:03,583
They are more just moving closer that much more accurate.

290
00:32:03,773 --> 00:32:10,043
And also we can help counteract that. And also there's an estimate of five in a row.

291
00:32:10,313 --> 00:32:14,573
We can see that they have mild and I want a special provision animal and I want.

292
00:32:15,703 --> 00:32:19,733
I host a of. That is.

293
00:32:21,073 --> 00:32:25,523
I go back to our last question. We're going to go back to slides.

294
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:31,723
Estimated cost for each? Yeah, I guess so.

295
00:32:32,293 --> 00:32:35,893
Presumably like half of that across time. But that's pretty much.

296
00:32:37,503 --> 00:32:46,373
Yes. Initial stages of the final. So when we get a Google customer.

297
00:32:47,233 --> 00:32:51,223
All the girls are telling me. James.

298
00:32:52,963 --> 00:32:58,033
Yeah, that's a good question. I think that all of that is called an online baby stuff,

299
00:32:58,123 --> 00:33:04,083
so that I is if you have a little bit of that kind of working with that company, all these kind of changes and all that.

300
00:33:04,093 --> 00:33:04,753
So that I mean,

301
00:33:04,963 --> 00:33:13,153
we need to propose our movement at some stage of advocacy so that over time we have the kind of cosmopolitan I'm now going to be Canada.

302
00:33:16,963 --> 00:33:25,943
Yeah. Yes. So type of question. So what kind of sample size you were to train your train involved here?

303
00:33:26,133 --> 00:33:30,293
You have 50 states here, right? You have 51 firms.

304
00:33:30,513 --> 00:33:35,033
Yeah. Wow. So you think the 50 function program would be sufficient for.

305
00:33:36,513 --> 00:33:42,183
Yeah, but he's from all over. Yes, but I think he wants the sample size works between them all.

306
00:33:42,213 --> 00:33:48,833
Well, I don't know what's a sample size use. At least that part you see they can also pleased to see that.

307
00:33:49,093 --> 00:33:52,903
Oh, you're right. You got $0.50 based on something.

308
00:33:52,963 --> 00:34:03,343
And we can already assume that the single member of the Cosmo operation, you can say so here we use the same structure, so we use the same order.

309
00:34:03,733 --> 00:34:07,643
So my question here is, do you think 52 will be sufficient?

310
00:34:07,663 --> 00:34:19,173
Yes, without needing to. Is there is there any qualification in the classroom?

311
00:34:19,413 --> 00:34:26,863
Yes. But it's based on the summary of content. For example, you can see a poster asking an for those perfect conditions.

312
00:34:27,973 --> 00:34:34,573
Yeah. Come on, I. You're looking at the present as a republic, so values all I have.

313
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:42,263
The last question I want. What is that base camp all about?

314
00:34:43,483 --> 00:34:50,993
In all these cases we can argue said you can your protection or not always will be because it has to do.

315
00:34:51,623 --> 00:34:59,463
But in our next project of disgust, how can we stop? So, Will, let's forget this thing about this song.

316
00:35:00,693 --> 00:35:06,963
So here I propose what we can do for the continents in the euro zone.

317
00:35:07,173 --> 00:35:12,553
That is, if it was somebody you. Keisha, you should protect me tomorrow, because that is a mission.

318
00:35:12,663 --> 00:35:16,703
I don't. So it is, although we can see it as a minimal.

319
00:35:16,943 --> 00:35:27,053
Okay. So in this model, the only difference is compared with your production model here is we keep another prior rubberized panel.

320
00:35:27,863 --> 00:35:36,213
That is the only difference. And also in this model, they show that they can sort of steal this model.

321
00:35:36,293 --> 00:35:43,243
That's not an average of one. So now we do stop on days to get our product.

322
00:35:44,123 --> 00:35:51,963
So our idea as smaller common process is we construct some properly run the initial management.

323
00:35:52,913 --> 00:36:01,733
So the idea is simple. That means our amateur is generated by the taking the products of Cuba.

324
00:36:03,083 --> 00:36:06,293
The first part is Michael Read, The New Yorker.

325
00:36:06,743 --> 00:36:11,443
The other part is Michelle. So that is the idea here.

326
00:36:11,713 --> 00:36:18,072
We have time. P is the mutual find issue here and is and is michael ratner.

327
00:36:18,073 --> 00:36:23,943
[INAUDIBLE] join. That is if you reach out to make a product to reach.

328
00:36:25,093 --> 00:36:32,683
So how these kind of problems so first we can develop a quality block will run until 12 March this year.

329
00:36:32,743 --> 00:36:40,983
We can write these kind of. All the data is equally wrong with the actress and almost constant exponential nephew h.

330
00:36:42,273 --> 00:36:47,973
So here, based on this kind of model politics, well, we have these we have this fusion.

331
00:36:48,153 --> 00:36:52,643
I'll be happy to unravel whether we can have these is equals.

332
00:36:52,653 --> 00:36:55,743
Do maybe pop them all in the environment.

333
00:36:56,103 --> 00:36:59,253
But that is where a stand up model approaches.

334
00:36:59,973 --> 00:37:06,663
So based on depend on model qualities, we also can run the concept of age functions.

335
00:37:06,963 --> 00:37:12,423
So the idea is the age function is also just consider the nearby issues.

336
00:37:12,933 --> 00:37:18,633
So that is the basic idea. How can we incorporate these kind of model, run the field child function?

337
00:37:18,753 --> 00:37:24,983
So here we need to write this kind of joint distribution at these kind of problems of this kind of how we should.

338
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:33,823
So that is the basic idea I'll carry forward. So here we have a new problem under control, the management of spatial solutions.

339
00:37:34,033 --> 00:37:38,383
So here, if we have long that we will incorporate the nearby.

340
00:37:39,293 --> 00:37:45,003
But that is. So based on this model, we have got it all payments.

341
00:37:45,393 --> 00:37:49,723
So this formula is very similar, like this kind of change.

342
00:37:49,753 --> 00:37:58,742
Revlon Physics. So if we just ignore these laws each and these all these reforms, this becomes new cabinet reshuffle.

343
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:04,613
Find out which. So here, based on this kind of horror, what would have happened?

344
00:38:05,823 --> 00:38:09,543
What we can't have is we can't have this final bonus property.

345
00:38:09,573 --> 00:38:16,803
He is in hospice. So that means this term will give you some special spatial power.

346
00:38:17,513 --> 00:38:25,123
So based on this exclusion we're looking to have where we could use that to use similar policies.

347
00:38:25,583 --> 00:38:32,123
But then, I mean, if the VIP will be equal to see that for the court of probate, he gave an all answer.

348
00:38:32,303 --> 00:38:33,263
We can't have this kind of thing.

349
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:41,763
So, yeah, if we just ignore especially don't try these more, they'll still be saying like however we shall find financial.

350
00:38:42,473 --> 00:38:45,503
But that means we are from this kind of religion.

351
00:38:45,833 --> 00:38:49,073
We can still have of good result of these kind of.

352
00:38:50,503 --> 00:38:53,883
That is this kind of jittery public probably in the future.

353
00:38:55,353 --> 00:39:00,623
And hope this model we can have some positive results that do not want to disappoint you.

354
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:07,683
So I just I'll Michael some results we get. So first we do our job as a result from the case.

355
00:39:08,853 --> 00:39:18,093
So that is on the graph. And also we show that if we add muscle one feel just on the deep steel, we can all go and see what happened.

356
00:39:18,903 --> 00:39:26,613
But if we just add a muscle when I feel an unusual I then, you know, is it will achieve consistency as a measure of normal.

357
00:39:27,153 --> 00:39:33,873
But what is truly. But that is a gap because obviously a lot of women feel visual, financial.

358
00:39:35,393 --> 00:39:38,453
But I want you. And I suppose so.

359
00:39:38,463 --> 00:39:42,293
There's a lot to learn. So it's very important and quality matters.

360
00:39:43,223 --> 00:39:49,213
So that's what matters. The income distribution. So how the national world is shooting it all the different peoples.

361
00:39:49,913 --> 00:39:58,963
So you need a worker we can find if we treat this kind of data, we will have more constraints compared with our COVID case.

362
00:39:59,603 --> 00:40:04,673
So in his care we have easy but is personally far zero.

363
00:40:05,063 --> 00:40:13,493
And for what? And also the first that you wrote he designed to lose curve which cannot be plotted and is want to review all these kind and also.

364
00:40:14,963 --> 00:40:18,533
So if we want to all in this kind of happy record.

365
00:40:19,593 --> 00:40:25,023
The cooperation model is what we need to add more strength to our culture in a moment.

366
00:40:25,773 --> 00:40:31,833
So for this model, you. So our idea is proposal y patient centered movies.

367
00:40:32,813 --> 00:40:35,993
So our idea is we do not want to be Tel Aviv.

368
00:40:35,993 --> 00:40:40,363
So we molly the pill was the american who trained these kind of options.

369
00:40:40,673 --> 00:40:47,933
For example, we can use that in our product. And here is the distribution of similarities.

370
00:40:48,173 --> 00:40:53,373
A thicker that original know. So that we can move forward symbolically.

371
00:40:54,073 --> 00:41:01,123
So the goal is we have this kind of empire's, which is what we want to find is this kind of payback.

372
00:41:01,453 --> 00:41:06,793
If we know we have paid customers, that means it is payback payment entitlement, actually.

373
00:41:06,973 --> 00:41:13,723
That means, we think, cost Americans by the ultimate and responsible measures, which mean cosmic semantics.

374
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:18,673
That is the basic idea how we call this kind of thing in all of this.

375
00:41:18,853 --> 00:41:24,823
We do not stop until we stop crossing the matrix between between the functions.

376
00:41:25,213 --> 00:41:28,533
So that is. So how can we do that here at the hotel?

377
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:32,163
You look at the first app, we first do the feature first.

378
00:41:32,183 --> 00:41:40,443
Malaysia is kind of my matrix. So in that it will make this kind of motivation entry close to the normal subject so special to the whole nation.

379
00:41:40,743 --> 00:41:51,273
These are my guys. We also can quantify that the larger value of this new CJD case, the closer between A5 the Nasdaq is.

380
00:41:51,363 --> 00:41:54,823
We have to stop producing multiple of these kind of new entry.

381
00:41:55,353 --> 00:42:02,343
So ideas with this kind of future transformation, this kind of new as associate can be used a lot longer.

382
00:42:02,733 --> 00:42:04,473
So here we have a new IG.

383
00:42:04,743 --> 00:42:16,623
Even the new vehicles do not much pressure and here new IgG equals do you use this object that I me is the mean of is between the clusters.

384
00:42:17,353 --> 00:42:24,323
And also we haven't had a precision. So based on this model, we have to choose that out from the.

385
00:42:24,753 --> 00:42:29,603
Why do you got to rise? So forth to make it asymmetric.

386
00:42:30,113 --> 00:42:38,943
And here is that you indicate the main closes of any function in CASA are to any function in consequence, any penalty.

387
00:42:39,413 --> 00:42:42,813
That's the position. God's idea.

388
00:42:43,043 --> 00:42:46,073
How can we do the cost just based on this matrix?

389
00:42:47,383 --> 00:42:54,163
So and then we just combine our cosmic fire and this kind of cinematic interface here.

390
00:42:54,523 --> 00:43:03,883
So we have all here at The Mogul, so we have all normal models and then amazing the normal models and the meaning and the procedure.

391
00:43:04,243 --> 00:43:10,873
So we gave them to mean normal prior and this procedure a common phrase it the net invasion.

392
00:43:11,173 --> 00:43:15,673
And then finally we give music and coffee because that is our model.

393
00:43:15,693 --> 00:43:23,683
Run the field. These are financial models. So here is how we comes out is Disney is a Pakistani model which offered a mixture and this was our model.

394
00:43:24,943 --> 00:43:29,573
So here we still have this. And now now comes up refers to news.

395
00:43:29,923 --> 00:43:33,853
So if we have not planned that, we will have to our stations.

396
00:43:34,663 --> 00:43:38,653
So if we have number equals zero, we do nothing here.

397
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:46,903
So this is all mission which. So that is our view.

398
00:43:47,113 --> 00:43:53,263
And also we use the same system. So that is we call it conditional either redundancy pay due to assembly.

399
00:43:53,623 --> 00:43:57,883
So for the cost, why from this example is the normal normal common?

400
00:43:57,883 --> 00:44:04,333
Because we have one model, conditional and comprehension computational and assembly based on what happens.

401
00:44:04,663 --> 00:44:13,143
So that is vehicle assembly. And also we do the same idea through the course incentive to see what we have to put in.

402
00:44:14,093 --> 00:44:19,312
Then we kind of got our worst managers. So still we have this final stand out with the top.

403
00:44:19,313 --> 00:44:22,753
So we generally think optimistic about wins. So we have a good reputation.

404
00:44:23,033 --> 00:44:26,933
But he's also an issue. And also, you know, all the true meaning is how, you know,

405
00:44:27,773 --> 00:44:33,533
so we deal with our individual income based on this kind of work, how much you have to make the long output.

406
00:44:34,823 --> 00:44:42,053
And then we set our number based on this kind of what if IPC curriculums and all the we compare us our benchmark measure.

407
00:44:43,653 --> 00:44:49,893
So here we have maybe three set up the first half that all one local we have equal

408
00:44:49,893 --> 00:44:56,273
to three and also we have more complicated case equal to five and the 451 days,

409
00:44:56,303 --> 00:45:05,823
days. And in this case, we have more randomly positive sign that I saw was the second generation and we had a count in a result.

410
00:45:06,423 --> 00:45:11,373
So here this kind of gray bar means we can expect to be packed to that.

411
00:45:12,263 --> 00:45:16,883
So we can see the balls step up and we can see that out of those.

412
00:45:17,003 --> 00:45:24,653
MITCHELL By then I will run the field Japanese model and successfully detect two normal clusters so that it is equal hours.

413
00:45:24,983 --> 00:45:31,583
So rat holds up. So these should even be covered even in these kind of swamps, you know, what do we see lost in the both?

414
00:45:32,453 --> 00:45:39,023
And also the figure of the big figure being represented as the average running index result.

415
00:45:39,083 --> 00:45:43,973
These all will. So we can see almost all can be lost out there.

416
00:45:44,993 --> 00:45:50,453
That is all simulation results. We can assimilate all cultures and religions.

417
00:45:50,723 --> 00:46:02,233
Well, that is awesome himself and also I haven't. Well my publisher says oh at he's very efficient examples says this is how we read index.

418
00:46:02,783 --> 00:46:08,153
Right. We can see that we just need to observe situation.

419
00:46:08,543 --> 00:46:13,832
We cannot choose how virtuous. So that means our maps.

420
00:46:13,833 --> 00:46:22,113
It is a blurry vision so that we do not need to my example to get all the cosmetics up these price but show these kind of results.

421
00:46:23,493 --> 00:46:37,983
And also we want to show you 0%, but that is we calculate every time our credit reports and we just use personal lexicon and protocol.

422
00:46:38,163 --> 00:46:45,723
And also all the code is read about click inadequacy pop up a lot and we compare.

423
00:46:46,543 --> 00:46:51,573
Sorry, Marcus. Kimmie. Sorry was just once again.

424
00:46:52,033 --> 00:46:56,953
But our message just needs 2 seconds. So this is a beautiful occasion.

425
00:46:57,553 --> 00:47:01,353
But if we just use a form of face masks in ward meetings.

426
00:47:02,043 --> 00:47:05,333
But that is we have one more infusion of population. You know what, people.

427
00:47:06,773 --> 00:47:14,533
And then finally we can show these kind of panels that are used at V.A. Hospital in the southeast.

428
00:47:14,843 --> 00:47:20,953
And also, we have we have both these kind of strange hybrid clusters and these kind of though,

429
00:47:21,383 --> 00:47:30,232
as you get more of these kind of northwest region and also the same concern and also the town of Vermont and these kind of is in New Hampshire,

430
00:47:30,233 --> 00:47:33,793
all of these hospitals, and they have very similar economies.

431
00:47:34,733 --> 00:47:39,513
But that to me is all masochistic. So you have this kind of local concern and also kind.

432
00:47:40,673 --> 00:47:43,973
And also we can have a different kind of hospital of different.

433
00:47:46,123 --> 00:47:50,393
So your salary might support it. So you need to collect.

434
00:47:50,413 --> 00:47:57,223
We set up a football stadium, all of it a center, closer and closer, and also depend on two different fighters.

435
00:47:57,553 --> 00:48:00,593
And the first part is a few more than five.

436
00:48:00,913 --> 00:48:05,443
We need more to drag that [INAUDIBLE] out in the future.

437
00:48:05,523 --> 00:48:10,483
Well, what do we have to lose? We can't bring more covariates for the cosmic makeover.

438
00:48:10,523 --> 00:48:14,753
We're ready for this kind of estimation.

439
00:48:14,833 --> 00:48:20,473
So also, we can. We will come out of the closet and also impose Masa.

440
00:48:20,473 --> 00:48:27,063
We have to practice. So now we are working on how can we have these kind of union readings and these analyzes look at that.

441
00:48:27,193 --> 00:48:32,923
And also we have some future work. For example, in the Master, we have all of these kind of four identical objects.

442
00:48:33,143 --> 00:48:39,463
Exactly. This kind of spatial type. You, honey. So that is the summary for my mother to protect.

443
00:48:40,243 --> 00:48:45,853
So she had more you go and then relative help is going to winemakers.

444
00:48:46,573 --> 00:48:56,683
And finally, I want to go out of all my other research related over to not only the family profit, we also used a similar idea in the Russian model,

445
00:48:57,263 --> 00:49:03,343
but because I know in this paper we analyze this and I'll come to you and I'll have to kind of see all the past.

446
00:49:03,433 --> 00:49:07,573
So we analyze and I'll say that the Louisiana that was Frederic has a name.

447
00:49:07,963 --> 00:49:13,033
So we find that they need a group based on these kind of piecewise constants.

448
00:49:13,153 --> 00:49:18,373
But we're going to have the models and also not only so I'll speak to them all.

449
00:49:18,373 --> 00:49:25,933
Mazur also can do some navigation analysis. For example, if we have a kind of group that or other Russia we also cast in time.

450
00:49:26,023 --> 00:49:30,043
Do you have this kind of community structure or network and the community?

451
00:49:30,043 --> 00:49:34,373
What are the baseline that's now the way it's back momentum and the.

452
00:49:36,123 --> 00:49:41,823
And also we have an analyst, the medical paper, to discuss how can we have surrendered guarantees.

453
00:49:42,753 --> 00:49:52,443
So here we proposed a new more general model that we call the model revenue bill for that provision so that it becomes a zero prior model.

454
00:49:52,713 --> 00:49:55,803
So here what we have is we just consider finance.

455
00:49:55,893 --> 00:50:02,522
Okay. But if we just pat each of each thing, we have this kind of the vertical.

456
00:50:02,523 --> 00:50:06,763
So we mean you can't have these kind of the, you know, the cost of.

457
00:50:07,893 --> 00:50:14,413
So that is some progress in relation to this project. Well, I want you to say something before my little time.

458
00:50:14,533 --> 00:50:20,823
Say. So you want to list milestone research, AIDS, patient learning, or capacity cuts?

459
00:50:21,223 --> 00:50:25,493
So there are three major themes. Causalities are natty.

460
00:50:26,513 --> 00:50:31,493
So I think that is extremely worrying for third parties in real that in any house.

461
00:50:31,833 --> 00:50:34,553
So today my thought is all about this in Germany,

462
00:50:34,943 --> 00:50:41,873
but in the future I will also be walking on some of the running and regularly and also have a cross section three means.

463
00:50:42,413 --> 00:50:54,563
And also I will have some patient signs on the gallows and also other people in context what was going to be so obvious proposal last year?

464
00:50:54,653 --> 00:51:02,523
So the first couple of last days I call the individual I like because of optimization and the U.S. Special Forces, but that is something to announce.

465
00:51:03,083 --> 00:51:06,803
So this is build up a on everything. Well, for the stage, of course.

466
00:51:06,803 --> 00:51:13,883
And it's nice that instead of the public assemblies last year is these call in a special camera which may very

467
00:51:14,183 --> 00:51:20,633
well this time they'll come and I will strap abusive says I know that drug abuse is a very severe issue and that

468
00:51:20,633 --> 00:51:27,983
perhaps what we want to do is to is you said look can you send a special type of expert haven't met that patient

469
00:51:28,253 --> 00:51:34,253
we have a new that comes in how can we have one kind of liaison class or different states for different countries?

470
00:51:34,533 --> 00:51:40,843
So that to me, you know, copies of will have similar policy if you control these kind of values.

471
00:51:41,593 --> 00:51:49,163
And I think this year what I will submit is the first thing is I have some collaboration with the farmers.

472
00:51:49,403 --> 00:51:59,363
So what we want to do is to analyze these kind of welfare schools and how to determine the power in these kind of neighbors has met with these ideas.

473
00:51:59,483 --> 00:52:02,903
We will target through age what brand and other thing is.

474
00:52:02,903 --> 00:52:11,093
We find that these kind of diagnostic so compositional freedom is what we see in all these kind of rhetorics.

475
00:52:11,393 --> 00:52:18,292
So what we will do is and we want for both the kind of state of modernity, what for the South, for these kind of values.

476
00:52:18,293 --> 00:52:24,083
They have medicinal compositions. For example, the composition of the population will come from digital.

477
00:52:25,713 --> 00:52:29,643
We'll find out. But I will do something for the allies of Korea.

478
00:52:29,923 --> 00:52:34,173
Yes, I want to do some research outside of sports and ethics.

479
00:52:34,233 --> 00:52:38,613
So that is a combination of the time, cosmology and Rocky and also this.

480
00:52:38,613 --> 00:52:42,663
It was such a world created these kind of schools, Madison and the sports campus.

481
00:52:43,023 --> 00:52:49,623
We know that some athletes look at some and they need some cover and then need on the train.

482
00:52:50,723 --> 00:52:56,423
Sketches. So finally, I want to kind of load my thoughts, which there was in this.

483
00:52:57,443 --> 00:53:04,253
Not all models are. In fact, some of them at least more one.

484
00:53:04,493 --> 00:53:08,083
That is why I did this at a local cost. But where do you bother?

485
00:53:08,153 --> 00:53:13,013
What about that visual perception? We can't hold useful information for obvious.

486
00:53:14,333 --> 00:53:19,273
Thank you. That's all my book and you have you just you can see all of my CV and outlooks on.

487
00:53:26,683 --> 00:53:33,633
Thank you very much. And time for questions. And so talk.

488
00:53:33,853 --> 00:53:43,113
I think that's a great start to concepts. So the first one basically decided not to follow.

489
00:53:45,073 --> 00:53:52,913
Forever. Module description of the task.

490
00:53:56,533 --> 00:54:03,133
The second topic. And the other thing, which is that you have a patent that's on the market in the field.

491
00:54:03,673 --> 00:54:10,383
But what the. I wonder.

492
00:54:11,363 --> 00:54:15,203
First of all. What do you.

493
00:54:16,643 --> 00:54:20,363
She's one person, one. Yeah, that's a good question.

494
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:28,393
Well, the first thing since the first thing we saw from the whole conditional and what was the average Joe nowadays and I think he's more of an angel.

495
00:54:28,403 --> 00:54:31,843
We've seen a lot of we have some problems with the customers.

496
00:54:32,553 --> 00:54:38,223
And the second step is probably stop doing that and try and have all the coverage.

497
00:54:38,823 --> 00:54:42,723
But especially if you just observe these kind of the ground.

498
00:54:43,353 --> 00:54:49,113
We just had a July one occasion. I was gonna use the first verse for supply.

499
00:54:49,563 --> 00:54:52,653
So that is more of a nature where you do have captains and also your business.

500
00:54:53,133 --> 00:54:57,543
But, you know, second part of what you need to have is you need to have these kind of.

501
00:55:02,533 --> 00:55:05,743
So here I want to emphasize here, we just kind a few.

502
00:55:10,743 --> 00:55:13,863
If you're running a little. What do we have? We need to know what.

503
00:55:15,373 --> 00:55:20,502
So that is the point. If you want to use the same approach, what do you need to do?

504
00:55:20,503 --> 00:55:23,893
The first step is you need to find the ground between these applications.

505
00:55:24,253 --> 00:55:30,213
So maybe you can use maybe the minimal spending tree, as in that is plan, for example.

506
00:55:30,463 --> 00:55:35,723
So first we do not want all the data. We just say that it will come.

507
00:55:36,313 --> 00:55:42,373
So that is the design of what is in nature so that we can use that agenda measure to contact.

508
00:55:43,283 --> 00:55:47,783
That is my idea. And also I continue to work this out of my.

509
00:55:48,863 --> 00:55:55,053
Thank you. Yeah. So. I always.

510
00:56:01,173 --> 00:56:09,943
So you have five now where you can not just. Often I think exaggerate the cost to assume the number of.

511
00:56:12,773 --> 00:56:21,293
Yes. Well, I'm wondering why you. I assume that you think that our application for accuracy when you have a finite number.

512
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:32,593
You can actually quite a number of. Ask her if you can find analogies for all of the other.

513
00:56:34,213 --> 00:56:39,313
Rachel White. You should be able.

514
00:56:40,403 --> 00:56:45,943
Yeah. That's that's true that I used to use to visit by number how to handle that.

515
00:56:46,103 --> 00:56:52,813
Still, you see my lack of training or patience. So that was the prior number.

516
00:56:53,203 --> 00:56:59,323
Yeah. So yeah, so that's true. So that is the idea of how people deal with these kind of.

517
00:57:00,323 --> 00:57:10,283
Michelle by the end. So, Michel, by the nature of all, just so this question is kind of unusual.

518
00:57:10,353 --> 00:57:16,983
They just put out a prior on this kind of. That is certainly true the problems.

519
00:57:17,523 --> 00:57:21,093
We can realize that it hasn't it hasn't been.

520
00:57:22,353 --> 00:57:28,013
But I still think it's a matter of international resolve. Is this potentially a recovered region?

521
00:57:28,233 --> 00:57:31,743
That is not how it works.

522
00:57:32,223 --> 00:57:38,593
But then we have the result. Truly remarkable not to knock the past seven.

523
00:57:40,553 --> 00:57:44,083
The first production technology battery powered. Yes.

524
00:57:44,103 --> 00:57:48,473
So we cannot we all. Yes.

525
00:57:49,373 --> 00:57:52,053
Yeah. So that is a lot of good questions in the first quarter.

526
00:57:52,133 --> 00:58:02,032
So we do not it hasn't so radical stuff to show that kids consider asthma, but no dramatic improvements of your body mass, maybe nearly 90%.

527
00:58:02,033 --> 00:58:08,123
We can tell you the culprit is obvious. We will continue to find out each practice.

528
00:58:08,123 --> 00:58:17,083
So this is a very good. Yeah. Well, then also we're going to find out that we also have get this kind of joint distribution based on the first.

529
00:58:17,883 --> 00:58:24,063
But that makes it very complicated. It's not that easy to think of a friendship between different states.

530
00:58:24,453 --> 00:58:28,403
But here I think this is a very good apportionment without much help.

531
00:58:28,713 --> 00:58:34,083
But we do have very easy capitation here based on that kind of waste voucher.

532
00:58:36,353 --> 00:58:39,563
We can have a very good interpretation of the French obligation.

533
00:58:39,713 --> 00:58:43,702
We shouldn't be passive, but that is major, active, agile versus not,

534
00:58:43,703 --> 00:58:48,743
and also very easy to think about how to cooperate for the rest of the year with a lot.

535
00:58:54,243 --> 00:59:02,373
What? What's assuming? But there's no such thing as quiet.

536
00:59:02,853 --> 00:59:05,933
Yes, that's. By.

537
00:59:07,553 --> 00:59:11,873
That was. Daniels.

538
00:59:18,283 --> 00:59:22,023
Yeah. I think we can argue that. And I think bet on this massive battle.

539
00:59:22,033 --> 00:59:25,463
We'll have to wait and see what happens with all of.

540
00:59:26,713 --> 00:59:32,923
So that all of this fusion is much different from that will be more diverse than using supported models.

541
00:59:33,683 --> 00:59:37,843
But also, we need to consider how can we practice under the actions?

542
00:59:39,073 --> 00:59:47,073
More and more. That is where we connect and we talk. Modifications.

543
00:59:48,253 --> 00:59:51,763
Yes. Father, you have a name? Yeah.

544
00:59:52,333 --> 00:59:57,343
You just got to have dads make a home as a citizen.

545
00:59:57,673 --> 01:00:04,633
We do not have a passenger, but I think I will try to finish these projects.

546
01:00:04,633 --> 01:00:12,553
And that all happens if you I know not you have not to do all the layers of your state coming to the house.

547
01:00:12,823 --> 01:00:22,103
But I think in this kind of kind of work, we also have a lot to see that the families will have to know what the elevator.

548
01:00:24,263 --> 01:00:29,583
Yeah. You have to go. Yeah, we have to go. Decision to.

549
01:00:31,983 --> 01:00:35,103
This book is three lines and two curves. I just realized the.

550
01:00:36,673 --> 01:00:43,853
Your body's not that good. If you had a lot more moderate, you know, 10 seconds.

551
01:00:47,493 --> 01:00:55,203
The way I see you. So we was asked the other half, these kind of. So that is that is going to mean zero for the Nasdaq composite.

552
01:00:57,083 --> 01:01:00,903
So we start driving these cars or have some to.

553
01:01:04,563 --> 01:01:07,563
Yes. All. Steve.

554
01:01:09,653 --> 01:01:12,833
So how do you choose a boss and.

555
01:01:15,403 --> 01:01:22,063
I understand you did. So that sort of some kind of faith that in fact.

556
01:01:23,973 --> 01:01:27,122
Yeah I think that is a very good question since we just has.

557
01:01:27,123 --> 01:01:31,223
Alright. Right. There are some similarities between these countries that we cannot say that,

558
01:01:31,233 --> 01:01:38,463
that it is safe for the House policy for this kind of organization or receive this kind of policy.

559
01:01:38,463 --> 01:01:43,503
But we find that these kinds of within this they will have very similar overrides.

560
01:01:44,493 --> 01:01:51,633
You've got a macro not this to. What do you imagine those pieces?

561
01:01:53,513 --> 01:01:58,013
That's it. That's it. Yeah. But to meet these kind of goals later.

562
01:01:58,013 --> 01:02:03,833
So that divided the total. But not Jackson was the congressman from.

563
01:02:04,833 --> 01:02:13,883
That is that is the proportion of. So I think this massive scale of possibly could accommodate that kind of population issues.

564
01:02:16,323 --> 01:02:20,253
And also that is we can see that there are some standing in the same perspective

565
01:02:20,433 --> 01:02:24,363
we would have wanted to operate in is dramatically different between them.

566
01:02:24,393 --> 01:02:30,323
I say that we do this kind of corporate proposition, guys talking about that there's a.

567
01:02:31,643 --> 01:02:37,613
The infection is the same as. Not very different just because of same.

568
01:02:38,343 --> 01:02:44,273
And it just because of testing, just because a lot of patients will be responding to that.

569
01:02:44,283 --> 01:02:47,822
So hopefully you can support and see that. Yeah. Yeah.

570
01:02:47,823 --> 01:02:52,273
I see you got a few questions that also we can treat that to some of those issues

571
01:02:52,883 --> 01:02:59,083
and that is even the rulings that that come from the same field that have right now.

572
01:02:59,553 --> 01:03:09,813
So that is we can't have more a more here and a section. The lack of what they do is special that I make.

573
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:16,353
I think that's a skill we can how can we make this more or more useful?

574
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:23,483
So ideal model is to implement a proprietary spatial.

575
01:03:24,803 --> 01:03:31,013
Yes. And in this primary, our experiment seemed to be very important in terms of this visual class.

576
01:03:31,773 --> 01:03:34,833
Yeah. And that was very difficult because that's not what I.

577
01:03:38,353 --> 01:03:44,823
I was wondering how you might pass this step on the way to your.

578
01:03:46,343 --> 01:03:55,373
Yeah, I think that was a very good question. Currently what we that the is based on some also based on some polling theories and also in our Senate.

579
01:03:55,373 --> 01:04:02,062
Correct. We also we also found you can use make the patient preferences in this election and also throughout

580
01:04:02,063 --> 01:04:10,703
your administration that you never nonvolatile to let us know that it's on either side.

581
01:04:11,203 --> 01:04:16,273
Okay. Excellent. He says here.

582
01:04:19,103 --> 01:04:22,283
So these guys all here will cut us off.

583
01:04:22,913 --> 01:04:28,883
So here, in these kind of armhole, we do not have. For the cosmic project we can prove.

584
01:04:31,073 --> 01:04:37,993
Rationale. So that is that they are no longer. That is so we can have the model so that the truth.

585
01:04:39,453 --> 01:04:46,733
Hour. And also now we want to hear how can we put a priority on the student athlete?

586
01:04:51,473 --> 01:05:00,603
The questions. So I wondered, you know, this is a kind of a double life model.

587
01:05:00,803 --> 01:05:04,193
So if I don't. Functional.

588
01:05:07,003 --> 01:05:13,743
I hope you. Yeah.

589
01:05:13,813 --> 01:05:18,843
So because, you know, they have some values, you can use some regression approach.

590
01:05:18,853 --> 01:05:26,963
When I feel that I do have some features or I'm not asking for the normal conversion, but just want the knowledge of the spectrum.

591
01:05:31,343 --> 01:05:34,563
Where is? Not.

592
01:05:35,533 --> 01:05:41,143
Yeah. I think God is accountable to the many. Do you have a college student population?

593
01:05:43,493 --> 01:05:47,363
In the scanner. The motorbike was on the morning. But you.

594
01:05:47,363 --> 01:05:50,863
Still you. Yes. Yes.

595
01:05:51,613 --> 01:05:57,343
So that is the way it got the comic part. So you can use any and all reasonable amount of.

596
01:06:08,773 --> 01:06:12,767
It's. Thank you.
