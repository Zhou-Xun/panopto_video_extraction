1
00:00:05,217 --> 00:00:08,531
So Randy Olson's ABT,
or, and, but, therefore,

2
00:00:08,531 --> 00:00:13,247
approach to narrative structure hs to
be one of the most influential things I

3
00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:16,780
have ever read about being
a clear communicator.

4
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:20,160
I really use it all the time,
including, if you've paid attention,

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,070
in many of my lectures.

6
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:26,900
I'd like to explain in this clip
why I see it as so valuable.

7
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,970
So, first, let's think about this.

8
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:32,980
How is a prototypical research
presentation structured?

9
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:37,157
Well, it's structure kind of
looks something like this.

10
00:00:37,157 --> 00:00:42,416
As time goes on and as you move down, you
start sort of big, with the big picture

11
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:47,136
context and significance,
then you get into some background facts.

12
00:00:47,136 --> 00:00:49,720
And, ultimately, hopefully a hypothesis.

13
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,687
You get into some methods about whatever
this thing is that you're studying.

14
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:55,935
And hopefully, then, get to some data.

15
00:00:55,935 --> 00:00:59,020
And those data lead to some
interruptions of the data.

16
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:03,540
The results, that ultimately lead
you back out to something bigger,

17
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,020
like impact or implications.

18
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,980
At least that's what it ought to be,
in theory.

19
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:12,262
Let's be honest, most of the time what
you usually see is something like this.

20
00:01:12,262 --> 00:01:14,870
You start off and
you get a little bit of background and

21
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:17,680
maybe some discussion of significance.

22
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,480
And really quickly,
you get into hypothesis and methods.

23
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:27,677
And then it's just data, data, data.

24
00:01:27,677 --> 00:01:31,817
And maybe, if somebody remembered to save
time, a little bit of interpretation and

25
00:01:31,817 --> 00:01:34,140
some implications at the end.

26
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,398
That's not actually a really
enjoyable experience,

27
00:01:37,398 --> 00:01:41,665
which is why often scientific
communications are just simply boring.

28
00:01:41,665 --> 00:01:45,950
Remember, narrative
revolves around tension.

29
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:49,100
You start low,
you think you know what's going on, and

30
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,220
then over time,
a narrative builds tension.

31
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,100
You realize that there's a problem,
or an issue, or

32
00:01:55,100 --> 00:02:00,170
something you don't know, and
that tension is what draws you in.

33
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:03,340
And then you resolve that tension

34
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:08,450
to a point where you know something
more than you didn't before.

35
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:13,150
So the ABT story structure is built
around that tension arch, right?

36
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,861
You start with the and section.

37
00:02:14,861 --> 00:02:20,872
That's the set up, the background, the
hypothesis, but the key here is the but.

38
00:02:20,872 --> 00:02:26,550
The but is that section of whatever
you're saying that defines the problem.

39
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:27,588
The thing you don't know.

40
00:02:27,588 --> 00:02:35,760
The thing that is causing tension that
therefore leads you to the resolution.

41
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,110
Now, when you apply ABT to science,

42
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:43,150
what you recognize is that the and
stuff is the background, the context.

43
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:48,220
It's what is known about
whatever the topic is.

44
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:51,970
And then you make this transition
into the knowledge gap.

45
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,626
That, but we don't know this.

46
00:02:54,626 --> 00:02:57,161
Or, but, this is the critical finding.

47
00:02:57,161 --> 00:03:01,180
Or, but,
this is what you need to pay attention to.

48
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:06,120
And that transition into the but
is the point at which you really

49
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:11,970
capture the audience's attention
about the scientific challenge.

50
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:15,390
And when you do it right,
it naturally leads to the therefore,

51
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:19,680
to the implications,
to what needs to change in the world

52
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,040
as a result of either defining
the scientific problem or

53
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,440
defining the scientific
knowledge that we now have.

54
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,830
So here's an example.

55
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:32,700
Sun exposure is dangerous.

56
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:37,660
And sunscreen can protect you
from that type of sun exposure.

57
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,950
But, notice the tension.

58
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:42,780
But, it wears off after time.

59
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:46,710
Especially if you're swimming or
wipe your skin.

60
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:50,560
Therefore, you need to
reapply sunscreen regularly

61
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,860
in order to get the kind of
sun protection that you want.

62
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:58,630
Notice that the therefore
comes directly from the but.

63
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,090
The but here is the tension.

64
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:04,550
Sunscreen will wear off,
it can't protect you if it wears off.

65
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:09,680
Therefore, you need to reapply
it regularly in order to get

66
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,460
the objective that you want,
the protection.

67
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:18,480
So how do we fuse this kind
of structure in practice?

68
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:23,120
What I've found over the years that I've
been using this structure is the key

69
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,350
is finding the but.

70
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:29,148
Finding what is the tension that I want
to communicate to the audience about

71
00:04:29,148 --> 00:04:32,358
whatever the science is
that I'm talking about.

72
00:04:32,358 --> 00:04:34,793
What is the motivation for my research?

73
00:04:34,793 --> 00:04:37,520
Or what is the problem
that needs to be solved?

74
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,000
Or what is the new or

75
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,850
critical piece of information that I want
to make sure that the audience gets?

76
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:45,035
In that sunscreen example,

77
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:50,868
the critical piece of information is
the idea that the sunscreen wears off.

78
00:04:50,868 --> 00:04:55,101
I wanna make sure they get that because it
naturally leads to the implication that

79
00:04:55,101 --> 00:04:57,820
you need to reapply.

80
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:02,150
The clearer you are about the but,
the better.

81
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:06,650
Because, really, the but is really tied to
the key question we've been talking about.

82
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,560
Why should I care?

83
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,050
Why should your audience care about
whatever it is you're talking about?

84
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:16,286
Once you know the but,
then you can walk backwards.

85
00:05:16,286 --> 00:05:18,730
What are the specific key facts or

86
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:25,520
background that sets up
the tension with the but?

87
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,507
And you can work forward.

88
00:05:27,507 --> 00:05:32,560
What are the implications that
flow naturally from the but?

89
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,580
So Iet me give you an example.

90
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:39,680
Vitamin D is necessary for building and
maintaining healthy bones.

91
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,829
And you can get it through eating certain
foods or through sunlight exposure.

92
00:05:44,829 --> 00:05:51,200
However, just a different word for but,
most older adults don't get enough.

93
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,770
As a result,

94
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:58,440
many older adults should consider
taking a supplement with Vitamin D.

95
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,583
Notice the but.

96
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:03,650
However, most older
adults don't get enough.

97
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:06,390
That's the critical point
that I want to get across.

98
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:11,820
That's the piece that I might be thinking
my audience doesn't yet understand.

99
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:16,450
Once I know that, I start by
setting it up by making sure that

100
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:20,510
people know why Vitamin D is important and
where they can get it.

101
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:23,430
And it leads to the natural implication
of, if they're not getting enough,

102
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:26,740
they should get more by
taking a supplement.

103
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,590
Note that when you do
this kind of structure,

104
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:34,430
often you find that
certain facts don't fit.

105
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:37,120
And you might feel, whoa,
wait a second, then something's wrong.

106
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,190
No, actually then something's right.

107
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,050
These facts are true and important.

108
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:45,180
They're just not relevant for this story.

109
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:50,120
You may need to tell multiple stories,
but this particular story

110
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:54,450
isn't about those facts and
you have to be willing to let those go.

111
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:59,720
To let go of facts that don't fit the
particular story that you're telling, why?

112
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,820
Because the honest truth is you
can only tell one story at a time.

113
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,870
So if you're only gonna
get one story across,

114
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:11,331
you want to tell it as cleanly and
simply as possible.
