1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:16,410
You know, I guess you look at it that way I was cause I mean, I think maybe it that that was I would be sorry anyway.

2
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,880
Yeah. I mean, there's like.

3
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:27,000
No, there's something that I can.

4
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:36,470
Oh, yeah, I know that. That's where I live.

5
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:43,030
What it's like to live with.

6
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:49,560
Yeah. Because I said, okay, let's keep going.

7
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:57,630
I forgot really hard the first half that I guess I started record for this, but I will share the notes too.

8
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,870
It's not like you guys would catch that I'm there. So, um.

9
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:07,229
Okay, let's continue on with our classification and just take a little bit of a nod to culinary.

10
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:11,370
You know, that's just to pique your interest. This also I can pass this book around.

11
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:18,470
It's a really wonderful book, kind of wasn't written by an already named Amanda Archibald who is kind of like the, um,

12
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:24,299
I would say like one of the originators of the term culinary genomics and how to really think a little

13
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:30,030
bit more about how we prepare the food that we eat and how to maximize the nutrients that are in it.

14
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:36,000
And specifically the idea that it's broken down into fairly digestible chapters.

15
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:43,799
There's a lot of biochemistry in it, there's a lot of genes, gene activation, transcription factors, but it's very readable.

16
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,100
And if you want to put it on like a birthday or holiday list,

17
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:53,030
I think it is something that's going to over the next five, ten years is something that we see a lot more of.

18
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:53,970
So.

19
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:05,700
So the popular way to classify vegetables is another popular way of classifying vegetables is using these terms cruciferous, cruciferous and brassica.

20
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:11,680
So like kind of in this like nutrition world, I tend to use the word cruciferous a little bit more.

21
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:17,130
Those people who grow vegetables and gardeners tend to use the word brassica, but they're very interchangeable.

22
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:23,940
They have some common feature. So they all they're called cruciferous because I think like in Roman Catholic.

23
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,120
Teachings, anything that's like Lucifer is like holder of the cross.

24
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:35,100
So and the flowers that are on court. Ed, thank you.

25
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:41,940
Thanks. Always remind me. Always remind me. So. So they all have, as you can see in the picture, like this cross, like flower.

26
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,750
So that's where they got that word, cruciferous. So the blossom is cross shape.

27
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:49,350
They're really rich in vitamins, minerals and phytochemicals.

28
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:54,720
They're rich in a category of compounds called Glucosinolates.

29
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:01,950
They're some tongue twisters and some of this and each of the different cruciferous vegetables have different glucosinolates in them,

30
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:05,490
and they all are converted to different ISO file assignments.

31
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:16,570
And the ISO tyrosine aids are really, really what seems to have some of the properties that really help in some of the

32
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:21,899
research that indicates in some settings like improvement in cardiovascular disease,

33
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:30,570
some gene activation, etc. But in order to have this conversion, we need to actually activate an enzyme and the enzyme is morose in it.

34
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:38,160
And how do we actively activate that enzyme? You can activate it by a gentle heat, but too high of the heat will destroy it.

35
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:44,820
And then you won't have the conversion to this bioactive that we need, and you can also activate it by cutting it.

36
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:53,730
So. So if you're cutting like a head of broccoli and you're giving it some time before you heat it, you can have the conversion complete.

37
00:03:54,210 --> 00:04:00,930
So so I'll just talk about a little bit how that impacts like the, the, the world of culinary genomics.

38
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:09,870
So, so for example, broccoli contains glucose in and that's a precursor to sulforaphane you've probably heard.

39
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,690
So if you're a fail at one of those bioscience dates,

40
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:18,000
it's rich in antioxidants and seems to have a lot of anti-inflammatory actually properties of it.

41
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:26,070
Animal studies have been much more conclusive than human studies, because if one thing you've learned in three semesters of nutritional sciences,

42
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,050
nutrition studies in humans can be really challenging for a variety of reasons.

43
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,979
Sometimes we have some good epidemiological data,

44
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:41,010
but we don't necessarily have great randomized clinical trials, which we all know are the gold standard there.

45
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:47,160
So animal studies have shown that inhibits cancer of the lungs, prostate, breast and colorectal.

46
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:53,310
Large epidemiological studies have been mixed and there seems to be some associations with lower cancer.

47
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,210
Hopefully we have a link there if you want to delve a little bit deeper.

48
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:03,960
This particular picture shows all of the most commonly consumed cruciferous vegetables.

49
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:11,760
People seem to either love or hate these. Some people produce a tremendous amount of gas from these and find it to be very uncomfortable.

50
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:21,180
They definitely have a bitter property to them. That bitter tends to be in nature protected from having that be consumed by animals in the wild.

51
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:25,589
But the bitter compound is also responsible for these isotopes cyanide.

52
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:26,700
So the sulforaphane,

53
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:36,030
which is thought to be advantageous in terms of the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant and the ability to kind of like squelch free radicals.

54
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:40,080
So that's what we think is the mechanism involved in that.

55
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:50,250
So culinary genomics is really kind of this broad new science of how we choose, prepare and cook ingredients that can optimize our DNA.

56
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:58,410
So we may have particular single nucleotide polymorphisms, otherwise known as snips.

57
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:05,790
If you've taken any genetics classes that many people in the population have these polymorphisms.

58
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:13,439
But what we're beginning to know is that we can alter some of the pathways and transcription factors and these switches in our body

59
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:21,149
that can turn on desirable pathways and that we think that we can do it with this growing field of bio actives which are bioactive,

60
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:25,410
that are present, like the course, the ten that I mentioned in the Allium family,

61
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:30,720
we've all heard about the benefits of curcumin, which we know is in turmeric.

62
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,040
We think that those benefits of sodium aldehyde, which isn't cinnamon.

63
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:39,660
So our course kind of goes into the details of some of these by the actives here.

64
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:49,170
This here just shows the conversion with the black arachnid cutting with the marrow some days and then producing the sulfuric acid,

65
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:57,120
these antioxidant properties. So the new terminology that is kind of given to this new way of cooking, especially with cruciferous vegetables,

66
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,370
where we want to activate the Sulforaphane is this new rule called the hack and old rule?

67
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:04,500
I don't know if anybody's ever heard of that before.

68
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:11,010
It's not particularly practical and there's not a lot of great research that 45 minutes to an hour is ideal.

69
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:16,600
But usually what is recommended in this growing field of culinary genomics, as you take your broccoli, you cut it,

70
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:22,470
and then you let it sit on the counter for 45 minutes while you're doing everything else that gives you optimal time to actually.

71
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:32,480
So I'm working in partnership. So a lot of what the Archibald's book that's going around it is actually talks about how to optimize.

72
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:38,340
Like we used to think about, we used to think about cooking and how to optimize nutrients and cooking.

73
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:44,190
And all of the original research studies have to do with how should we prepare our broccoli so that you get the most nutrients out of it?

74
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,940
But there's also how should we prepare our broccoli so that people will eat it?

75
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:52,530
Personally, roasting to me has a better flavor than something that steaming,

76
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:59,100
although we know if we steam and we microwave and we retain most of the moisture that you're probably atomizing the number of nutrients in it.

77
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:04,799
We never thought that that pre preparation of cutting actually could optimize and lose nutrients.

78
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:11,129
But now that we know more about the plants and how the different chemicals are converted, we know that this is helpful.

79
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:17,400
So probably more to come in this area. A definition of nutrition almost just to stick with you.

80
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,730
It's really genomics through the lens of nutrition.

81
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:25,200
So it's specifically how certain foods and bioreactors and the like.

82
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,560
A broad definition of a bioactive is really a non nutrient.

83
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:35,279
It's not something that you're going to see necessarily on a label and might be something that we would call like a polyphenol

84
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:43,020
or or some of the other like plant pigments that we'll discuss and they influence our genes and they can determine our health.

85
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:46,200
So that's kind of like a little lens into culinary genomics.

86
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:52,530
A couple of slides here. On the classification of fruits, it's much more simpler than the classification of vegetables.

87
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,370
So we have this broad category of citrus fruits. Everybody knows what they are.

88
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:04,380
They tend to be higher in vitamin C. Then we have another classification of droops, which are also more commonly known that stone fruits.

89
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:08,490
So there are those foods that have a single stone in the middle.

90
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:13,050
They can be the cutting stone variety or the free stone variety.

91
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:20,610
Basically all it means is it's been cultivated in a way that the flesh releases easily from the stone or it clings to it.

92
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:25,620
There's also like, like which one we talked about when we had our prune plum discussion.

93
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,139
Every prune is a plum,

94
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:34,290
but not every plum can be approved because of the different sugar alcohols in it and the different way that it clings to the stone.

95
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:41,339
So common examples of groups, small groups such as cherries, you know, bigger grapes such as mangoes.

96
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:45,240
And if you've eaten any of those, you know, the consistency of that single stone.

97
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:49,080
And then like the apple pear that I cut up.

98
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:57,120
Here is an example of a palm poem. They most people will say palm instead like you've probably heard like that promise,

99
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:04,770
that type of like it's sometimes like the discarded apple mush from a cider mill is called the pumice I.

100
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:13,170
Maybe the team is getting to me about how I was a coconut. I do like this because it has coconut milk in the center like this.

101
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,829
Yeah. Yeah. You know, I. It's funny, I just listened.

102
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:26,100
I was telling the small group over here, they listen to this great character gastropub, an episode about specifically coconuts.

103
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:33,899
And it's interesting because the seed is very different in a coconut than it is from the others.

104
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:39,030
And it's a great question and I don't know why I specified that way, but let's try and find the answer to it.

105
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:44,790
So but it seems distinctly different and there's different phases of coconut and different levels

106
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:49,799
of maturity that the inner contents actually change depending upon when you slice it open.

107
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:54,690
So it may have something to do with that and the seed dispersal.

108
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:58,679
So but I'll see if I can find out more about that.

109
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,510
So and then the other thing,

110
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:07,889
so then we talked about Poms having a Common Core five seeds surrounded by the same edible layer and those can usually be seen.

111
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:11,520
Oh, this one came out really nicely. Solid carrots, just like that star shape.

112
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:16,590
I guess we'll have those five seeds. And so just a different way to classify.

113
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:23,640
Let's see another question that often comes up here.

114
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:32,520
It's kind of like we're talking about drying fruit and the difference between yellow raisins and purple or black or brown raisins.

115
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:36,120
Anybody have any thoughts on that? What the difference is?

116
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:44,299
They all actually come from the same grape. A lot of people think Ella would come from a green grape and red would come.

117
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:48,740
I think the brand would come from great, actually. Yeah.

118
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,979
Coconut. Why is it classified as a tree?

119
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:55,940
Not like that. Yeah, that's consistent that way.

120
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,750
Yeah, I'm 100% sure. Yeah. Yeah.

121
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:03,420
So I think we need to do a little bit more. Coconut one.

122
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:09,150
Yeah. Let's see what we can find between now and next week and then come back and report on that.

123
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:18,799
Trying to think that the the podcast that I listened to didn't specifically kind of talk about that type of classification.

124
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:27,040
So it was really more of the lens of how growth matures and like two distinct places where it can actually grow and have peace out.

125
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:38,060
Um, it's also interesting, like a mango is closely related to tree nuts but doesn't have like the same allergies as people with tree nuts.

126
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:42,530
I'm not sure why that and the question stuff.

127
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:49,460
Oh, so we're talking about raisins. Any thoughts on differences there?

128
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,030
This actually goes to processing to maturity level.

129
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:58,670
No, not necessarily. Does anybody else have any other guesses?

130
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:02,840
Yes. Skin? Um. Nope, not necessarily.

131
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:12,980
Now, sultanas are often, like kind of a type of raisin that are grown from a distinct, a distinct type of fruit.

132
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:16,610
But in general, all raisins usually come from green grapes.

133
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,560
And the difference is in the drawing method.

134
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:25,940
So the dark raisins, black raisins, purple raisins, whatever color I kind of think they're brownish are generally dried under the sun,

135
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,870
kind of similar to like in some countries where cocoa beans and coffee beans are dry,

136
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:37,580
they're just dried under the sun for three weeks and they kind of shrivel and they actually oxidize and they tend to be a much lower moisture content,

137
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:47,600
whereas the yellow grapes are actually put into a dehydrator, but they're still there are first treated with a sulfur dioxide gas.

138
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:55,610
So so then that sulfur dioxide that's actually that changes the way that that particular fragrance process,

139
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:59,270
but it also preserves the color to be more yellow.

140
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:02,870
And it's also dehydrating. If you ever noticed, yellow raisins tend to be a little plumper,

141
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:08,509
a little moister because they're not drying out to the highest, that high level of degree of drying as the brown ones.

142
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:14,960
So I think there's like a misconception that because they're puffier, perhaps they're healthier.

143
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:21,079
A lot of people are really sensitive to the sulfur and then and may not be able to tolerate the yellow reasons,

144
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:29,690
but can tolerate the darker ones because of the way that process. And then there's these different classifications also for fruits.

145
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,250
Again, a little bit less important,

146
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:37,040
but just to know that you can continue to further subdivide the classification of fruits into aggregates and multiples.

147
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:44,419
Aggregates are dual from several ovaries of one flower, and most common examples are berries, various different types of berries,

148
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:49,579
and that multiples are a little bit more complex because they're fruits that are formed from a cluster of flowers.

149
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:58,730
And the best example I have for that is a pineapple. So so you can just kind of like look through the slide and see the evolution of those.

150
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:07,010
The next thing that I want to talk about, these next four slides will discuss what we refer to as color and pigmentation of produce.

151
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:13,219
But they can be classified into these three broad categories of chlorophyl and I got to know it.

152
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:23,540
And flavonoids. So so we know that there's a lot of various different health benefits of all of these different polyphenols.

153
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:29,780
So another popular term for these also, we're starting to use that as interchangeably with bioactive,

154
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:38,299
which we talked about being non nutrient substances. And I would talk about this in my notes I'm going to just look on here.

155
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:42,950
So in general, Chlorophyl is that green color that we see in the produce.

156
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:46,579
So it's not very stable and it's fat soluble.

157
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:50,480
So that's why when we talked about like that example of something that's green and leafy,

158
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:54,950
being blanched and having the air come out of it actually quickly changes color.

159
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:59,239
So it's responsible for green hues and produce.

160
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:04,100
And it comes from two different types. There's an alpha chlorophyl and a beta chlorophyl.

161
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:12,679
An alpha is kind of that blue green hue that you see in broccoli and Bayda is that yellow green hue that you see in cabbage, in green cabbage.

162
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:18,620
So distinctly different. So in terms of like cooking, when heat is applied to chlorophyl,

163
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:25,700
you see the fatty acid tail that it has there that is cleaved off and then the hydrogen hydrogen

164
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:31,760
ions and water will also replace the magnesium that's there and the magnesium will come off.

165
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:35,570
And then the further it cooks that it will produce more of a dull color.

166
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:39,020
You probably have seen that with many green vegetables.

167
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,030
You cook them too long, they become dull.

168
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:47,270
There are other factors in the dull color that could happen also, and it depends upon if you're cooking them with an acid or a base.

169
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:53,810
But talk about that also. So if it's exposed to an acid, it often will get the dull kind of color.

170
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:58,340
Also, if it's exposed to an acid, it will greatly increase the cooking time.

171
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:05,300
So if you want to have a chili and you're putting, let's say, green beans into a chopped up green beans or something like that,

172
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:11,809
it's always better to kind of cook those to the degree of tenderness that you want before you add them to anything.

173
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:14,840
That's tomato paste, because if you add in the tomato paste,

174
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:19,460
the cooking time will increase dramatically and they can never cook by the time your child is ready,

175
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:28,160
if they're exposed to a base or an alkali, they tend to have a brighter retention of their color, but they tend to get really mushy.

176
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:35,750
So you might have seen recipes where it will say add some baking soda to a pot of cooking beans and they will cook faster.

177
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:39,140
That's they'll cook faster. But they might also get a little bit mushy.

178
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:48,890
So so also interesting in terms of the color and that also there is another chemical called this pyro firefighting,

179
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:54,109
which is another dull olive green color in the Chlorophyl family.

180
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:57,910
And when we heat things, everybody's open like can green beans before.

181
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:03,020
They're not a beautiful green color anymore. They are that dull color because it's that form of chlorophyl.

182
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:11,120
So in the in the category of the second broad classification care category,

183
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:17,180
here is the carotenoids and they contain many, many phytochemicals that are listed in this slide.

184
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:25,670
So carotene are the yellow, orange and alpha carotene, as you might recall, from vitamins and minerals, is converted to the active form of vitamin A.

185
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:30,140
And then we have lycopene, which is responsible for the red orange color.

186
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:37,490
It is not a precursor to vitamin E and it tends to be more present in when when it is heated.

187
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:44,900
And as such in tomatoes, tomatoes probably have more vitamin C content when they're raw or lycopene when they're heated.

188
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:54,860
Kind of another example of culinary genomics. So and then we have the Santa Phil and all of the subclasses of Santa Fill that are different color.

189
00:18:54,860 --> 00:19:01,159
So then the Phil we often think of like the yellow pigment that you see in piece,

190
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:06,170
like any one piece of produce doesn't just have one pigment, it has different pigmentation.

191
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:14,300
So then you have lutein and zeaxanthin which are really potent phytochemicals that are in kale and collard greens.

192
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:21,979
You have asked the ZAM thing, which is some of the orange and the red fruits, and also you can see it in things like wild salmon.

193
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:24,710
So wild salmon that has like that brighter red.

194
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:31,700
CALLER to it, you know, kind of like, you know, we've been saying in the world of nutrition over and over and over again to eat your colors.

195
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:39,410
But, you know, they're we as this growing body of polyphenols and phytochemicals and bioactive becomes available.

196
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:48,030
We know that there's so much that's hidden in them that we don't know yet what the variety of the color exposes you to all of these different ways.

197
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:51,770
And then the last category that we have is the flavonoids.

198
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:58,610
And so the female compounds, otherwise known as flavonoids, have about 6000 members in them,

199
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:03,110
many that we don't even really we haven't been able to study. We don't know their purposes.

200
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:09,950
We know that they're numerous in vegetables, but they're really limited in fruits and they tend to be really sensitive to changes.

201
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:17,800
And some of you have had like an undergraduate food science class and there's like a classic experiment that you do with red cabbage.

202
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:21,050
I don't know. I think you had one, Sarah, didn't you? Yeah.

203
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:28,520
So you just basically take red cabbage and you expose it to a base of control and then an acid,

204
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:33,049
and you watch how it changes color because this pigment tends to be really sensitive.

205
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:40,190
So alkali often gives it a poor color and acidic also often intensifies the color.

206
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:48,740
So this is just a summary because the research in this area is really confusing.

207
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:53,480
I, I pulled up within the last couple of years.

208
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:59,000
Hopefully you can see this link here, went to today's dietitian with a summary of all the different research.

209
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:05,269
And what I wanted to try and do in this table is classify by color the type of produce that you

210
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:12,799
might see in that color what the phytochemical is or primarily in that particular produce.

211
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,610
And then some of the research that's been done,

212
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:23,690
most powerful research and in many of these categories has to do with free radicals and the neutralization of them.

213
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:30,860
And then many other thing is really like, you know, you have to really say, you know, that it may be responsible,

214
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:35,840
but there hasn't been a lot of conclusive research in humans, more research in animal models.

215
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:39,590
So this is just a summary document for you to peruse through.

216
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:47,180
We talked earlier about the knowing, the nutritive content of the various different.

217
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:52,579
We talked about it with protein, but it's important that, you know, of all of the different foods.

218
00:21:52,580 --> 00:22:01,850
So this is just a side by side comparison of fruits and vegetables and the relative differences in the nutrition and nutrient

219
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:08,630
content they are anything like kind of strikes you when you're comparing these to that is different than what you thought.

220
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:19,310
As you can see, none of them are particularly rich in fat, except certain fruits like avocado.

221
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:23,900
Olives tend to be a little bit richer in fat.

222
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:29,570
Coconut Durian actually has quite a bit of fat in it also.

223
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:39,920
More minerals and vegetables, more iron and fruits, especially prunes, figs, dates and dried tomatoes.

224
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:47,959
Vegetables have a higher protein, but not much, and it's not complete because it lacks the thiamin.

225
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:59,580
So just keep that in mind. This also doesn't account for it shows you the calories of vegetables being a relatively low fruit, slightly higher,

226
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:07,140
still pretty, pretty low, but doesn't account for that other classification of vegetables that we call low starchy vegetables.

227
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,710
Starchy vegetables having like more like 200 calories per serving.

228
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:16,290
It's not so much in the starchy vegetable category. It's not so much actually the vegetable itself that's concerning.

229
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,870
It's often what people put on those vegetables to make them more delicious.

230
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:25,650
When I think about starchy vegetables, I think about potatoes and all of the things that you might put into them when making,

231
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:29,309
let's say, mashed potato or the things you put on top of them when you're making a baked potato.

232
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:38,129
So that's really where the calories come in. The only other thing that I wanted to point out that it might be some terminology that

233
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:42,780
you'll hear if you have to also go into the kind of the field of clinical dietetics.

234
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:50,400
There are some produce such as beets, rhubarb, spinach, kale and five star fruit Swiss chard that are really high in oxalate.

235
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:59,430
So oxalate are the salt of oxalic acid and they often will bind with calcium and they can be responsible for things like kidney stones.

236
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:05,190
A lot of times we can't necessarily control our diet to prevent kidney stones.

237
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:12,000
It's not necessarily always the exaggerated sources of the oxalate, but it's really the internal.

238
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:18,930
And then in this production of it. So if you ever are having questions about the foods related to kidney stones,

239
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:24,659
first of all, kidney stones are all made of lots of different types of minerals.

240
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:27,840
They're not all related to oxalate, they're not all related to calcium.

241
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:36,120
So it's like you would need to and only if you have if the patient that has a kidney cell strains it and saves it and analyzes it,

242
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:42,120
would you know what it's made out of? So you just have to be really careful of really limiting people's oxalate consumption

243
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,960
because you would be eliminating a lot of really important proteins too.

244
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:53,340
So okay, I always like to in these specific units about food,

245
00:24:53,340 --> 00:25:02,010
just talk about grading and standards because they they actually provide this uniform language for describing quality and conditions.

246
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:06,899
And I think the key point in this, you can go to that grades and standards.

247
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:14,970
It is like way too much government information about every imaginable piece of produce and how it's graded, what the standards are.

248
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:20,280
I like to talk about this a little bit more when we talk about meat and milk, because I think it's more important.

249
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,900
And also, I mean, you can see that there are different standards for fresh, there are different.

250
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:31,110
There are certain growers that grow, particularly for can and their standards are lower because they know their

251
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:33,930
products always going to go with the candidate doesn't have to look as pretty.

252
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:40,560
And then the other thing that's really wonky about this also is everything is graded before it's shipped.

253
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:49,260
And we know that a lot of damage actually occurs in the shipping process and the quality of the produce changes the minute it's been picked.

254
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:58,320
So so you just have to kind of take that with a grain of sand and know like these different like six characteristics are the different types of things

255
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:11,520
that that the inspector what grade grading is generally voluntary so not everybody will will grade their produce because it does they do incur a cost.

256
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:20,880
You'll notice in the canvas pages that I've posted some fiber articles, hopefully that you've had a chance to take a look at.

257
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,500
Many of you also discussed fiber and we're talking about the gluten free grain assignments.

258
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,879
And when we discuss fiber, there's been a lot of changes.

259
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:35,280
The Institute of Medicine has changed its definition of fiber over the last couple of years.

260
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:39,299
When I was learning about fiber in the field of nutrition many years ago,

261
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:45,000
we talked about it only from the standpoint of soluble fiber versus insoluble fiber.

262
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:49,769
And now the new IOM report really talks about fiber.

263
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:58,410
That's this our fiber that we take in from the dietary sources in our food and that fiber that is extracted or synthesized,

264
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:07,229
otherwise known as functional fiber. And then there's a lot of debate about what we can call functional fiber with Inulin kind of being

265
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:12,120
one of the primary points of debate at this point and has been over the last couple of years,

266
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:15,930
we all know that we lack enzymes to process fiber.

267
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:21,540
We can't digest it and it's not absorbed and it doesn't provide any energy and calories.

268
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:24,060
But it's really important for a variety of reasons.

269
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:34,740
You know, we we have thought over time that soluble fiber is is the type of fiber that dissolves in water.

270
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:45,780
And we know that it's important linkage to improve cardiovascular health and soluble fiber tends to also absorb water bulk up.

271
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:50,430
And we think it's more important in digestive health. And I'm glad the research has indicated that.

272
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,380
When we talk about the plants, like kind of from a food science and a culinary standpoint,

273
00:27:55,770 --> 00:28:01,950
I like to name actually the different fiber components with cellulose being insoluble fiber in one of them.

274
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:07,590
And it's really what we kind of call like these steel reinforcement bars that support cell walls.

275
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:14,970
And it's a polymer of beta glucose. So not all fibers actually come from starches.

276
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:18,720
So it's different from starch because it doesn't branch.

277
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:26,160
So throughout the rest of the semester, we're going to be talking a little bit about cellulose, how many cellulose pectin,

278
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:32,610
fruit, jelly, lignin, and we've already mentioned lignin when we talk when we talk about vegetables and how they age.

279
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:38,040
So just keep those in mind. And that's why I'm mentioning these, the next one that I've mentioned previously,

280
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:44,130
when we're talking about vegetables growing too long and producing this kind of woody substance called lignin.

281
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:51,390
So lignin is also a phenolic compound. It's large and it's complex and is not a carbohydrate.

282
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,670
It's one of the fibers that's not a carbohydrate.

283
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,670
And as we talked about, as plants mature, they produce more of this and it gives it a stronger body or texture.

284
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:05,760
The problem with cooking is you can't boil the lignin out of it because the boiling doesn't destroy it.

285
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:12,749
So once you let a piece of produce go too far and it's really no coming back and making it really tender unless maybe you shred it.

286
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:21,960
So the next one I want to talk about are the two soluble fibers for still using the classification of soluble.

287
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:27,240
Toxic substances are important. They're found in the cell walls between cells.

288
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:34,830
And these toxic substances have different phases depending upon the maturity of the fruit.

289
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:46,260
So peptic substances also provide pectin, which is something that we need in fruits in order to create a gel when we're making things like jams.

290
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:51,450
So it is activated through pectin uses which are various different enzymes.

291
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:56,520
So and it really functions kind of as this cement that holds the cells together.

292
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,690
And then we have cellulose, which is another soluble fiber.

293
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:06,720
Its primary function is actually in a plant to strengthen the cross links between the cellulose.

294
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:08,249
So when we have,

295
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:15,540
when we talk about adding baking soda and that previous example that I have of using a base is added to vegetables to retain their color.

296
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:19,079
It actually functions to break down the heavy cellulose.

297
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:23,580
So it's not just that it's there and you don't know what happens.

298
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:32,880
I want you to understand that it is contributing to breaking down the heavy cellulose, which makes it subsequently more mushy.

299
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:38,100
Okay, so this will come up a couple of times actually throughout the semester.

300
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:41,010
We're talking about cooking these different produce,

301
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:51,540
other important fiber components and these kind of fall into that other category of not exhaustion risk but more functional fibers with,

302
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,370
as I mentioned, inulin.

303
00:30:53,760 --> 00:31:00,510
So Inulin we talked about fructans remember memory talking about Fructans we're talking about wheat and people having sensitivities to them.

304
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:06,390
And it's not always the protein component of wheat that people with their people have sensitive or the gluten that's often the

305
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:13,740
fructans fructans are primarily also important in people that are on fodmap diets because they can cause a lot of GI sensitivity.

306
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:20,730
Inulin is kind of interesting because it's this polymer that mimics fat and we have to think a little bit about this

307
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:28,709
about like fat replacers and food manufacturers extracted actually from a chicory root and then they added to products.

308
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:30,630
There's been some interesting research, though,

309
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:43,650
and the elderly given 15 grams of inulin each day and those that were given the inulin had actually better and improved constipation in the elderly.

310
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:51,570
That tends to be like a primary concern is they're less active, they eat less, they are on lots of medications.

311
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:55,680
They often can't move their bowels like they had to because they would like to.

312
00:31:55,950 --> 00:32:00,989
So there's been a lot of research on how can we possibly have a supplement supplement that might help.

313
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:07,920
And there seems to be a lot of promise in the field of Inulin there are things that are pretty amazing that I think are interesting are gums.

314
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:12,809
So and they're used tremendously in the food industry because they serve a really

315
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:19,380
important purpose of finding water and they bind about 100 times their weight.

316
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:22,380
So a pretty significant design finding of water.

317
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:29,790
They're used to often give their use as a food additive and they're used to give a desirable appearance and a desirable texture.

318
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:33,690
And they're also extracted from various different plants.

319
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:36,810
And, you know, we can talk about this beautiful world that plants have.

320
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:44,339
I just want to list some of them. So you would become familiar with the sources on this slide and you will see if you ever you know,

321
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:50,820
you might even on some of those bar see gums, because gums are often used, you know, to hold things together and.

322
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:54,680
You might see some of these and some of them actually are natural sources.

323
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:59,120
So they're not there's petroleum based bombs that are manufactured.

324
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:02,780
But look for the ones that are often used in the food industry.

325
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:07,120
Their primary sources are trees and beans and seaweed.

326
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:13,280
So keep that in mind. So just some interesting kind of chemical structures here and the different sources of them.

327
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:19,880
Other things that we as I mentioned, the different phases of pectin.

328
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:29,310
So what this slide. Demonstrates you is that A the process of ripening is like a continuum.

329
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:33,600
So plants continue to actually breathe and respire after you harvest them.

330
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:38,920
They're alive. Unlike hamburger meat, where the cow is no longer alive.

331
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,930
So but they do continue to breathe in and they do continue to change.

332
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:49,290
And knowing how they change and then knowing how to store them can decrease the amount of food waste that we have.

333
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:54,180
We also know that a lot of fruits are really rich in pectin.

334
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:59,220
And as that fruit ages and matures, the pectin changes in them.

335
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:05,549
And it also provides in this ripe fruit phase the gel that can form, like I mentioned in fruits.

336
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:13,500
And I have another slide on canning there also over time will develop more pleasant flavor, a more pleasant aroma from the time that it's picked.

337
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:22,110
So these are just all just things to think about as you are picking something and it goes for the ripening process.

338
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:31,110
The other thing to think about, and you've probably seen this before, you've probably all heard like if you want to ripen a piece of fruit,

339
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:42,060
all you need to do is put it in a brown paper bag with an apple, because there are some fruits actually that ripen in the presence of ethylene gas.

340
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:48,750
And ethylene gas is something that is emitted by fruits when they earn the right building phase.

341
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:54,540
So we have fruits that are sensitive, fruits and vegetables that are sensitive to ethylene.

342
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:59,580
So whether they're in the presence of an ethylene producer, they will ripen faster.

343
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:08,849
And then we have fruits and produce and vegetables that are ethylene for ethylene producers where they give off a lot of this gas and they will help.

344
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:15,270
Right. Best examples that I have for that is a lot of people think like in your vegetable draw,

345
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:19,679
your crisper drawer, that drawer that you have that has a little fencing, that why does it have a fence?

346
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,960
What am I supposed to do with it? You know, generally we like to keep the fence closed when you have a vegetable,

347
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:30,509
because the minute you pick a vegetable, it's peak harvest, it's peak taste, it's peak moisture.

348
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:38,220
It's all downhill from there. And you want to try and consume it as close to picking as possible, or it will lose a lot of its moisture.

349
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:46,680
Whereas fruit will change over time based upon the ethylene that it either gives off or absorbs or the projections that change within it.

350
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:56,010
A good example of this also is so because we don't grow bananas in Michigan or most of the Midwest or actually most of the United States,

351
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:59,670
all the bananas that we receive are picked green that then are shipped.

352
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:07,530
If you've ever been to a tour once of Eastern Market and did an incredible tour, that when the bananas come in, they're like bright, bright green.

353
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:10,980
And then they put them in an ethylene chamber that looks something like this.

354
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:18,389
And then the ethylene gas is actually released to ripen the bananas to the phase where you would want them, right?

355
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:25,620
So that you could distribute them. They're often ripened to kind of like the green yellow phase and then allowed to naturally brighten on their own.

356
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:32,400
But they like to ship them in that green phase because remember, they're and they're they're graded before they're shipped.

357
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:36,270
So they don't have any bruises. They don't have any malformations yet.

358
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:41,879
They can actually be at the point where people, once they break in a little bit more,

359
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:46,590
are more edible on the brightness chart and they can have this high quality of a grade.

360
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:53,129
So so I think think about like fruit bowls that you keep with different types of produce in

361
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:58,800
them that may be sensitive and may give off ethylene and how things become ripe or faster.

362
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:04,230
And think about how you store your produce in refrigerators in in these various different

363
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,730
palettes with these different gas is good enough because they can increase the ripening.

364
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:15,569
So the other thing that I know about ethylene is it's colorless, it's slightly sweet smelling.

365
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:22,740
It doesn't seem to be hazardous to plants. And then in summary, the plants generally fall into these two categories.

366
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:34,530
Another term that we use in produce is and the classes of fruit ripening, ripening are climax terror and non climax era fruits.

367
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:42,329
So the term climax era in terms of produce is defined as the stage of ripening when ethylene production increase.

368
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:48,870
So it's basically like a switch is hitting in the fruit and ethylene is given off and the fruit becomes rice.

369
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:55,169
And when we classify it's only important more from like producers and growers or you as a

370
00:37:55,170 --> 00:38:00,570
consumer to know if I pick up this piece of fruit that doesn't have a particularly good aroma,

371
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,490
isn't soft, like maybe looks like it's not right. If I buy it, is it going to change?

372
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:09,840
Is it worth buying it and keeping it on my counter or I've already lost kind of that important phase.

373
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:13,319
So just these are the different kind of key classifications.

374
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:20,130
So something that's considered non time, extra climactic, it never is going to right then after you pick it is only going to go bad.

375
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,500
So think about berries like you pick. You get strawberries.

376
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:27,100
The only thing that happens is they get mold on them and they go bad over time.

377
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:34,960
And then you have like the different bacteria classes where there are changes that occur after harvesting.

378
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:39,040
So there are those that ripen only after being like an avocado.

379
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:45,940
There are those that have changes in color and texture and they develop more complex flavor, but they don't develop any more sweetness.

380
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:51,730
And those are listed there. There are those that are sweeter, but they don't change color or texture.

381
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:55,089
So it's always like you probably bought a mango home,

382
00:38:55,090 --> 00:39:00,700
let it sit on your calendar and notice that if you come into it on day one, it might not be sweet.

383
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:05,080
But you wait a couple of days and the starch will convert to more sugar.

384
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:12,460
So and then we have like the example of a banana will ripen actually on or off the tree,

385
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:16,540
but we harvest it when it's not right so that we can transport it.

386
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:22,809
Yeah. So is that terminology only used for fruit or tomato?

387
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:25,450
We'll write it on or off. Yes. Right, right, right.

388
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:34,000
You use its primary foods like ethylene producers and ethylene sensitivity fall into the classification of fruits much more than vegetables.

389
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:40,120
But when you go back to like that beginning slide, when we talk about the technical versus culinary definitions,

390
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:45,040
so many of the fruits that we generally will call vegetables are really fruits.

391
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:53,540
So those that fall into this in that culinary vegetable classification, I guess you wouldn't call it a tomatoes type of climate.

392
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:58,300
I you you would because because a tomato is a fruit.

393
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:04,420
Oh, right. Yeah. Yeah. So and and and is can be more sensitive to ethylene.

394
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:10,210
Yes. Just well, wrap up on the slide here with storage.

395
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:21,220
Everybody looks so tired today. So I did this. And so this is kind of a fun slide just because it illustrates what we've talked about throughout.

396
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:24,339
Lettuce is never better than when you pick it at the garden.

397
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:29,409
You know, the minute you take it home, unless you really wrap it surrounded by some moisture, it's going to lose moisture.

398
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:34,270
You can actually stick it into the tip, into a glass of water and it will absorb more moisture,

399
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:40,690
will give you that that trigger that we talked about, those vacuoles will fill up, become a little bit more desirable.

400
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:49,239
And just like we talked about, all this produce is really composed of different living and respire and tissues.

401
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:55,840
But the the food industry has strategies for improving shelf life.

402
00:40:55,840 --> 00:41:04,239
And you have seen all of these and these are all like very systematic, well thought out scientific ways for controlling moisture.

403
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:09,219
And that's kind of why talk about ethylene and these changes that occur so that

404
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:15,040
we know in the food industry that how to preserve produce so we have less waste.

405
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:25,240
So although the couple of things that I just want to comment here is like a map otherwise known as modified atmospheric packaging is like it sounds,

406
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:33,219
it's like ubiquitous now in terms of salad kits. So many of those are these map packaging and what it does it controls.

407
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:37,660
We know that oxygen is the enemy of freshness.

408
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:47,500
So if we can create an environment where we control the oxygen, if you remember, oxygen and air, I think is about 21%, something like that.

409
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:52,870
But if so, if you just have lettuce that's exposed to air, it's going to degrade much quickly.

410
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:57,129
But if you have these modified atmosphere packages that control the oxygen level,

411
00:41:57,130 --> 00:42:04,780
it's like an oxygen level of 8% and it will have that lettuce last for much longer than exposed to the air.

412
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:11,200
So that's one way. That's why we have those packages. They're not just like beautiful ways to contain everything in one package.

413
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:17,140
Then we have waxes. You've all probably been to the grocery store and you've seen the wax coating that is used.

414
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:23,650
Well, it's not just to make it look shiny, but moisture loss is key and degradation.

415
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:31,450
So if we can find a way to seal the pores and keep the moisture in a product, then it's going to have a longer shelf life.

416
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:38,260
Fortunately, many of the wax coatings that we use our natural base, but some are also petroleum based.

417
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:43,360
So it will slow down the respiration or the breathing of these fruits.

418
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:50,140
So beeswax is used, carnauba wax is used, and carnauba wax actually comes from leaves.

419
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:55,450
You know, we can have our opinions about palm trees, the manufacturing of those, but it is natural source.

420
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:59,170
There's also another type of wax coating called shellac.

421
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:05,350
And shellac comes from actually a particular kind of find, a particular beetle called the Lark Beetle LLC.

422
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:11,829
So it's a natural source of waxes. And then the last thing just to talk about, we talked about crisper jaws.

423
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:15,250
But the other thing I want to mention are those little package inserts.

424
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:22,000
You've seen those, right? You know, do not eat the whole kind of package inserts that are often also in some of.

425
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:23,880
The modified atmosphere packages.

426
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:33,990
So what they do is actually they're made out of potassium permanganate and what they do is they destroy the ethylene gas because we know if ethylene

427
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:42,330
gas is present that the produce would be susceptible to it and it would go through the ripening phase faster and that it would be less desirable.

428
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:49,710
So they destroy this gas by oxidation and they allow the product to be safe, fresher, for longer periods of time.

429
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:58,280
Okay. So I will end the error. So you guys can now go home and take a nap and hopefully take a little break before anything else.

430
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:11,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

431
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:17,180
I love you. Yeah, I'm sorry to interrupt.

432
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:21,150
Oh, right. Before I leave, I have to change the calendar.

433
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:25,220
I think I mentioned it on the announcement. If you read that we're not going to South Quad next week,

434
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:32,350
we're going to be back here and we're going to be having to finish is talking about fermentation and preparation.

435
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:35,690
I think the I got a big inspection going on.

436
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:39,980
So we're going to finish the lecture, doing it and then go to south.

437
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:47,120
Not all of the group, everybody together. We're not breaking it off and that's why we do all our fermentation.

438
00:44:47,570 --> 00:44:53,840
I'm making sauerkraut there, so I'll give you more information so I will change the schedule.

439
00:44:53,840 --> 00:45:00,170
But now if you come back here in person, that's what I'm doing.

440
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:06,750
Oh, this is helpful. Oh.

441
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:15,770
Oh, you. I like I said, I have a lot.
