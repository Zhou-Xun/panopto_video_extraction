1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
To begin setup of a Yellowdig community for your Canvas course, go to the Assignments area

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Create a new assignment, give it a name and type an introduction to the tool.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
To use Yellowdig as a graded item in your course, give it a point value.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'll put 100 points. You may also have an assignment group if you're waiting grades.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:42,000
If so, you'll want to put this in the correct group. The submission type is where we'll select a yellow dog, choose External Tool.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Find. And scroll to the bottom of the list to select a Yellowdig.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We'll also recommend setting this to load in a new tab. You're welcome to set a due date on your assignment.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And if you do, it should be at the end of the course. We'll save and publish.

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Before we move on to the next step, I'm going to go to the Canvas grades area.

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Click on the menu on the header of my Yellowdig assignment.

11
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And set the grade posting policy to manual. Yellowdig is going to reset this grade on a weekly basis.

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So hiding this from student view until the end of the course will help reduce confusion on how it's impacting their final grade.

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We'll want to encourage them to track their progress in Yellowdig.

14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Now that your assignment is setup, you want to be sure to link it into your announcements, pages and modules.

15
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
As a reminder to students,

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:02,000
you won't need to create multiple assignments as Yellowdig works as a single participation activity for the full duration of your course in step two.

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:14,906
We'll look at setting up your community and configuring the point system.
