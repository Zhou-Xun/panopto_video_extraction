1
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,200
I'd like to welcome my friend,

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,675
Harold Pollack, from the
University of Chicago.

3
00:00:12,675 --> 00:00:14,700
Thanks for joining
me today to discuss

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,505
your index card guide
to microeconomics.

5
00:00:17,505 --> 00:00:19,650
The longer I've
taught economics,

6
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,140
the more I've asked myself,

7
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,070
"So what lessons
do I really want

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,115
my students to internalize
and take away with them?"

9
00:00:26,115 --> 00:00:28,050
When I saw your index card,

10
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,990
my reaction was, "That
really nailed it."

11
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,669
In 10 short statements,

12
00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:34,310
you captured what I've struggled

13
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:37,080
for years to put into words.

14
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:41,100
I'd like to get some idea

15
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,940
for my students of how you
came up with the idea to

16
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,800
create the index card and

17
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,139
what was the hardest
part of summarizing

18
00:00:48,139 --> 00:00:50,120
that microeconomics down to

19
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,400
10 bullets that fit
on one index card?

20
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,120
Rich, it's great to be with you

21
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,830
and your students are
very blessed to have you.

22
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:02,720
I remember so fondly our years
as colleagues together at

23
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,600
SPH and I just want to send my

24
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,780
best to everybody in
my old department.

25
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:13,080
I'm into this index card thing.

26
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,420
I actually wrote a book on

27
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,190
personal finance that was based

28
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:17,990
on a personal
finance index card,

29
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:20,270
which tried to argue that
what you needed to do to

30
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:23,820
manage your personal finances
could fit on an index card.

31
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:27,320
I've taught microeconomics as

32
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,705
well here at Chicago largely to

33
00:01:29,705 --> 00:01:33,800
social work students and

34
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,970
have thought about
some of the same

35
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,320
struggles that you have.

36
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,130
In our teaching,

37
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:42,710
we want to capture
the complexity

38
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:44,120
of the subject appropriately,

39
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,220
but what we also want to
capture is the huge amount of

40
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,590
granular detail that
can distract people

41
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,385
from understanding
the key concepts.

42
00:01:51,385 --> 00:01:53,360
It's actually a very
chastening thing when you say,

43
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,540
"How could I put
on a single card?"

44
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,610
What are the main things that we

45
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,795
regard as the key insights

46
00:01:59,795 --> 00:02:02,570
that honor the power

47
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:04,630
of the basic
microeconomic framework,

48
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:07,400
but that also acknowledge
there's a lot of

49
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,350
limitations to it that
anybody who's going to

50
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:12,380
work in health policy
or social policy,

51
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:16,340
medical care, social
services has to be aware of.

52
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:22,715
When I sat down and put
that card together,

53
00:02:22,715 --> 00:02:25,295
it was with that in mind.

54
00:02:25,295 --> 00:02:27,920
I should say that Justin
Wolfers' offers book and

55
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,500
Paul Krugman's textbook both
had a big impact on me.

56
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,810
Anybody who's familiar with

57
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:35,030
those texts would see
that an awful lot of

58
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,410
that index card is stuff that's

59
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:38,850
distilled by them as well,

60
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:43,875
so I can't take full
credit for originality.

61
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:45,690
Maybe that's part of the point,

62
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:47,689
means that these are
familiar concepts

63
00:02:47,689 --> 00:02:49,830
that I just tried to distill.

64
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,375
One of the points
you make is that

65
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:55,820
rational economic
actors think on

66
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,800
the margin and that's
something that I'm trying

67
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,730
to really convey in
a class as well.

68
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,500
Do you have a few examples
from health care about how

69
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,450
real actors can sometimes go

70
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:08,320
astray by not thinking that way?

71
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,745
I think when I was a student,

72
00:03:10,745 --> 00:03:12,380
I remember thinking like,

73
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:15,410
"I'm going to be
hired by the state of

74
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,090
Illinois or the
federal government

75
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:19,505
to ask these monster questions,

76
00:03:19,505 --> 00:03:21,050
should we have a
Medicaid program?

77
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:23,215
Is Head Start justified?"

78
00:03:23,215 --> 00:03:25,080
That's never the question.

79
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,450
Certainly, if it is a question,

80
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:27,260
I was not going to be

81
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,370
the person that was
going to be asked

82
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:32,530
that as my fresh out job.

83
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:35,265
But very often, you're
faced with a question.

84
00:03:35,265 --> 00:03:37,620
We think Head Start's a
really worthy program,

85
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,905
I think Medicaid is a
really worthy program.

86
00:03:39,905 --> 00:03:42,470
We have an extra
billion dollars in

87
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,210
the state budget that we can

88
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:46,340
allocate to one of
these two worthy things

89
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,850
and what are we really
going to get out of

90
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:51,200
spending that extra
billion dollars

91
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,405
in this program
versus that program?"

92
00:03:53,405 --> 00:03:56,135
That's what a lot of
trade-offs are about.

93
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:58,010
We have to cut a
billion dollars.

94
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:01,755
We have less tax revenue
than we expected,

95
00:04:01,755 --> 00:04:07,055
so we have to allocate our
resources at the margin.

96
00:04:07,055 --> 00:04:11,519
If we hire some more
Head Start teachers,

97
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,370
we'll definitely get
some benefit from that.

98
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:15,920
At the margin, who are the
teacher's going to be?

99
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,975
How effective are they
going to be at teaching?

100
00:04:17,975 --> 00:04:21,740
They're probably people that

101
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:24,080
may or may not be similar

102
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,700
to the other Head Start
teachers that we had.

103
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,400
We have to really think about

104
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,090
what are we going
to be doing with

105
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:30,260
that extra little bit of money

106
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,390
that we have to spend
on this program

107
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:35,405
or that extra Medicaid benefit
that we could provide?

108
00:04:35,405 --> 00:04:39,245
If we could slightly enrich
our reimbursement rate,

109
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:41,750
which would give people a
little bit more access to care,

110
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,220
or we could cover

111
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,030
a dental thing that we
weren't covering before.

112
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,315
What are you going
to get from that?

113
00:04:46,315 --> 00:04:48,580
That's the real world.

114
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:52,740
It's very hard to discipline
yourself and to be

115
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,900
asking the how much questions

116
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,270
rather than the
whether questions,

117
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,800
which are certainly profound

118
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,490
but are less common
in the real-world,

119
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:04,300
in real policy
environments that we face.

120
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,520
Often, the whether questions are

121
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,970
things that are already settled

122
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:11,000
and it's not really
where the action is.

123
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,520
In fact, the democratic
process is often

124
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,445
where the whether question
is most directly answered.

125
00:05:16,445 --> 00:05:19,175
If you say, "Should we
have a Medicaid program?"

126
00:05:19,175 --> 00:05:24,530
That's not a technocratic
question, in some ways.

127
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,225
It's, in some ways,
the question of,

128
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:28,250
"What are our
values as a society

129
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:34,000
and should we be providing
health care to poor people?"

130
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:39,920
Very often, what we bring
to the table is to say,

131
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,860
"Here's a set of values
that you as a society,

132
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:46,125
you as policymakers,
are trying to pursue.

133
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:48,495
How can we do that
most effectively?"

134
00:05:48,495 --> 00:05:51,610
Very often, those are
the marginal questions.
