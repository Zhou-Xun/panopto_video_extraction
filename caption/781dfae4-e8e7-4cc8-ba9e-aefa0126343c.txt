1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,320
Really long ago. The thing is, my brain snap.

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,900
That's totally fine. The start taking initiative to feel good about it.

3
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:15,299
So because I know that's a really long day and we'll talk about the structure.

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:20,700
There is one day where we're like on site in my lab and that would be different.

5
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:24,120
But we'll talk about kind of how that's structured. All right.

6
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,090
So this is talks pack lab.

7
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:36,000
It's really kind of a workshop because there is as it's structured now, there's only one session that's in a wet lab doing bench work.

8
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:44,849
A lot of what we do in this class is we talk in more depth about when you're looking at an individual study, how do you plan it appropriately?

9
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,729
How do you select your animal species? How do you pick your dose groups?

10
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:55,800
What kind of parameters are you going to be looking at to assess the question you're trying to answer and how do you analyze the data?

11
00:00:55,810 --> 00:01:03,320
So a lot of it is kind of discussion workshop based. Um, so let's take a look at how that's going to work.

12
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,450
So here we are at the site.

13
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,640
There's another tissue here that we will talk about subsequently that has something horrifically wrong with it.

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:21,660
But we're going to learn a little bit more in six. So I think everyone here is in six, 16 and five.

15
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:30,839
So we can skip some of the the generic introductory thing, but kind of the nuts and bolts.

16
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,220
As I said, this class is centered around talking a little bit more in depth.

17
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:41,850
How much glare can you guys see that? Okay, glowing for me.

18
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:46,110
But yeah, there's more lights, but let's just try to keep ourselves.

19
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:53,040
And it really centered around how do you plan to study an improve study and how do you interpret it?

20
00:01:53,460 --> 00:02:00,660
And the kind of framework of the course we, so to speak, run and then we will talk study through the semester.

21
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:04,530
And I say that kind of hand-waving because we're not actually dosing animals and running a study.

22
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:10,020
I'm using data from a previously run talk study, so I already have data set for you,

23
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,060
but we're going to talk about it in the context of if we were in the study group planning and running it,

24
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:19,410
and then we're going to get the data sets and analyze the data as if it were happening in real time.

25
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,979
When we do our necropsy lab, like for tissue collection lab,

26
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:28,620
it's important that we learn the techniques for appropriate collection of tissues and learn some of the things that can go wrong with that.

27
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:35,759
But we're going to use coal animals. So those are animals from our breeding colony or from our transgenic core that either don't

28
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,480
have the gene of interest or not of interest to the lab and are being euthanized anyway.

29
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,980
So we might as well get a learning experience out of it and we're going to use those for necropsy.

30
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:49,800
So that's we're going to talk about it like it's a real study, but no, it kind of put on for your benefit.

31
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:56,010
But that, I have found, is actually a really good way because we end up with data that's pretty interpretable.

32
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:03,330
We don't worry about a study coming out in a strange way, and it illustrates the concepts nicely, while also conserving animal use.

33
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:09,750
Okay, so that's the plan. As with 616, there's no required text for the course.

34
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:17,310
Everything I pull from a bajillion different areas, everything that you need to know, I'm going to give you in one way, shape or form on canvas.

35
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:29,009
I think I did give you I think it's later in the in the lecture part, there is a oh, here it is.

36
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:32,040
I'm sorry. It's so small I can't read the screen.

37
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:36,540
There is a textbook called Pathology for Toxicologists.

38
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,160
It's a fairly recent textbook.

39
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:47,040
This is one that was published in the UK that if I had to suggest like it pathology textbook for someone in the field of toxicology,

40
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,829
this one I think is nice because it really kind of explains it in the context of toxicology.

41
00:03:52,830 --> 00:04:00,840
There's another one that's us printed in the past few years that has a similar title that I think honestly,

42
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,700
the US one is a little bit too much pass focused and it doesn't really give it the context.

43
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:14,040
It's still good. I know a lot of the people who are authors on it, but this one is a little bit cheaper and it's a little bit more kind of one volume.

44
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,609
It is available electronically, unfortunately. My comments, you can check it out.

45
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:22,290
But like I said, if going forward, if you wanted a pathology text that would help you remember all the stuff.

46
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:27,900
That's one I can recommend, but you don't need it for this course.

47
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:35,820
Okay. So the goals of the course are to understand, to get some practical experience in the design and conduct of an individual study,

48
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:41,730
and to familiarize you with the interpretation and the pitfalls in front of interpretation of the data.

49
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:51,179
The way the course is structured and assessed, class participation is a significant chunk.

50
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:59,340
So about a third of the assessment. And class participation means like if we have discussion groups, so when we get our data.

51
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,270
You're not all individually going to be responsible for interpreting all the data because,

52
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,080
you know, you have limited time and this is like a one critic class.

53
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,990
So you'll get assigned a set of data, so you'll have to come to class ready to explain to your classmates, Well, this is the data.

54
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,190
This is what I think it means.

55
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:22,619
So participation like that, you also have certain assignments that have a due date at the end of the course or throughout the course.

56
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:26,160
Really, we're writing a toxicology study report.

57
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,150
So we're going to write a report in the style of the toxicology literature

58
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:33,840
that summarizes the data we get from our study and what our conclusions are.

59
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:39,450
And because part of the course is going to be learning how to write in that style,

60
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:47,969
I ask that you pass in drafts of the methods and the results section interim through the semester so that I can take a look at it,

61
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:53,340
provide some comments, and give it back to iteration, which is how you write papers.

62
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,370
Like you don't just write a paper. Perfect. First time for this.

63
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:03,570
I don't. But that will give you an opportunity to have some feedback on your papers before you get the grade at the end.

64
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,620
So the participation aspect is passing in those drafts.

65
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:10,979
There is no grade for that, none of that.

66
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:18,450
You could write the worst first, write the worst first draft imaginable, and the grade for the report is based entirely on the final study report.

67
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:23,849
Okay, sometimes I get questions about that, but the purpose for doing those interim drafts is for your benefits.

68
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:28,560
You can get some feedback on your writing. I find that that works better.

69
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:32,370
I mean, there's only it's not like a writing class have multiple things.

70
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:35,969
There's only one writing project. So it's kind of unfair, you know, not me.

71
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:39,060
I don't know you in your writing. If all of a sudden you just get a grade. Yeah.

72
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:46,800
And we've never had opportunity to kind of iterate. So class participation is like doing those participation things and passing in your drafts.

73
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:51,450
The final study report obviously is a significant chunk of the grade,

74
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:55,919
and then we have some topics that we cover in class that are a little bit more didactic,

75
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:02,760
a little bit more background type things that lend themselves better to a more of a quiz test type environment.

76
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:14,020
So there is an end of term quiz, and that's the other part of your grade that one is probably going to be in class.

77
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:21,059
I haven't quite decided on that yet. I've done that different ways, but there is a study guide at the end and I have a little review session,

78
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:25,380
so don't really worry too much about that until the end. That's usually pretty straightforward for people.

79
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:30,010
Okay, so those are the assessments. Any questions about that?

80
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:37,650
All right. So this course is offered in person in this weird gated room.

81
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:43,850
And there is one session now, as I said, that is at my lab.

82
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:47,160
So let's look at the schedule. You can see that.

83
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:55,500
So this is the schedule by week. The first thing we're going to do today is kind of a little bit of expansion on the topics we discussed this morning,

84
00:07:55,950 --> 00:08:01,320
a little bit more discussion of in a way, you know, and dosing. We're going to talk about that today.

85
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:09,120
Next week, we bring it into a regulatory context. So again, a little bit of expansion on the topics we just briefly touched upon this morning.

86
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:19,019
And then on the next session, we get a little bit more into the nitty gritty, the mock mock study that we're running.

87
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:24,720
You're going to hear a little bit about it today, but the mock study that we're running is intended to represent an early stage,

88
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:31,139
not in the regulatory fields, but at early stage vaccine efficacy toxicity study.

89
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:34,410
So it has some efficacy endpoints, it has some toxicity endpoints.

90
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:40,170
So we're pretending we're like, I don't know, the Discovery Group in a pharmaceutical company.

91
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,979
We're looking at vaccine candidates and trying to see if our candidate has good

92
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:48,720
efficacy against our virus of interest and whether it has adverse effects.

93
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:57,000
So in order to do that, we have to kind of all have some sort of basic knowledge of immunology and obviously people covered different backgrounds,

94
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:01,350
but we're going to do a crash course in immune response to antigens.

95
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:09,420
So that's our kind of immunology module then. And then we're going to do an overview on that third session of reporting and writing for In-Vivo talks,

96
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,580
because that's going to lead into how you write the protocol and how you write how you write the study.

97
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:25,320
And then we have a couple of sessions that are just kind of discussion to start our actual planning part for the study and then the big day, the days.

98
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:29,400
This is a pretty big class for a lab.

99
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:35,850
I have a decent sized animal necropsy lab, but the biggest I've ever done at one time in that lab is seven people.

100
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,380
So to avoid being all on top of each other, I'm splitting it into two groups.

101
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,030
So you will be attending going up to a CRC for one of these two days?

102
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,569
Not both. You'll be in Group Water, our group two and that'll be our day.

103
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:52,770
When we're collecting tissues, we do an overview of also of tissue trimming.

104
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:59,010
We walk you to our histology lab. So it's kind of like what would happen, say, in a preclinical setting at any point for a study.

105
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:04,139
So you're going to do one of those two days? I'm going to show you in a second.

106
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:07,500
I sort of pre assigned everybody to group one or group two.

107
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:14,070
What I'm going to ask of you over the next week is if you look I mean, it's during class time anyway, as you would expect to be here at least anyway,

108
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:19,800
if there is a day that works better for you of those two days for getting up to and CRC,

109
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:24,420
you can let me know in the next week so I can move the groups around if I need to.

110
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:29,840
Okay. I'll show you where to find that. Think, think, think.

111
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:35,640
So that's like the wet lab day. And then the remainder of the semester is analyzing the data.

112
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:40,500
So we have this group of these assignments that are individually passed out.

113
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:47,970
So we have a lot of data interpretation. We have some histology slides that will be interpreting kind of in real time.

114
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:53,430
And then at the end of it, a little scatter.

115
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:59,400
Right now, periodically through that, the different sections of the paper are due.

116
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:05,249
So for like group one, your methods section will be do whatever this other group is doing,

117
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:09,420
the labs, the next group has their method section do at that point and then I have those.

118
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:17,670
Back to you with comments. The results section is do a little bit later in the semester and then at the very end we kind of wrap up the discussion,

119
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:26,729
we do the review for the quiz and then over Thanksgiving and into that first week is when you finish up your paper.

120
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:32,070
So you have kind of a chunk of time to do the paper, the very last draft of the paper,

121
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:38,610
you can submit the interim draft if you want additional comments like for the intro or the conclusion.

122
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:44,819
I know that time gets a little bit crazy around that time of the semester, so it's not required to submit those drafts.

123
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:48,600
If you're like, I feel pretty good, I've got good comments back, I'm just going to go for it submitted at the end.

124
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,729
That's fine, but I want to give you that option. In order for me to do that, I have to have time to get it back to you.

125
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:58,050
So there is a deadline for that because it's kind of a lot of correcting for me, but it's okay.

126
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:04,920
And then at the final class, looks like here I put it final quiz in class.

127
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:09,240
I haven't quite decided whether I'm going to do that really as online or in class yet.

128
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,899
We'll see how we go through this. All right. That's the whirlwind.

129
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:16,830
So this class is little bit more moving parts, so sometimes it can be a little confusing.

130
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:21,490
Yeah. Just to be clear, on the way that you're doing the method section.

131
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:26,640
Yes. Are you like if the opposite group is allowed, do you does not have a lab that we've.

132
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,780
Yes. Correct. Yeah.

133
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:38,240
So you'll get a day off. I just don't know which one it's going to be. So.

134
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:44,490
Okay, so we have that one in lab session.

135
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:49,260
So one of the harder parts of this class is figure out how to get to where you're supposed to be.

136
00:12:50,190 --> 00:13:00,599
We'll talk about it again when we get closer. But under the administrative module here, it has like a little thingy explaining how to get to CRC.

137
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:06,590
So if you don't have a car, I don't want to take your car up there. There are bus routes, the northeast shuttles, kind of the best one for that.

138
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,170
We'll go over this again. But there's information there how to get to and CRC.

139
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:19,440
And then there was like a little map thing. I don't know how many of you have been to the North Campus Research Center, but this is Plymouth Road.

140
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,400
Anybody who hasn't been there, right? Yeah, I have made my labs up there.

141
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:30,030
All right, Beta going home for you. So Plymouth roads up there.

142
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:33,870
This is the whole big complex. We are in the southernmost building.

143
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:38,969
So if you take the bus up there, the bus stops like at the southern part of the complex where all those big parking lots are.

144
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:47,820
And our lab is like directly behind the bus stop. If you are driving up there, there is visitor parking, kind of facing that southernmost building.

145
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:52,110
So if you have a permit, there is yellow and orange south of the building.

146
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:59,190
So there are ways to getting up there. If you have a constraint for travel or an issue particular to travel, please let me know.

147
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:04,590
We'll go over that again. But just to let you know where that, I don't know.

148
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:12,989
Distant north campus research complexes for the other things that are administrative for your report at the end,

149
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:17,460
I told you that the paper is judged entirely on the final product.

150
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:25,640
So the interim tracks are for your benefit. But there's no grade assessed that those this is a copy what the study report rubric looks like.

151
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:29,400
You can kind of look at that yourselves and I mean, it doesn't all fit in one thing I think,

152
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:36,660
but basically each component has a score and then it kind of describes what I'm looking for when I review those.

153
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:43,490
So that can be helpful as you're writing the interim versions and when you read over your final before you pass it in.

154
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:49,650
So there's a study report rubric there. Where was I think the thing here.

155
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:55,940
All right. So that's the basic structure of the class, mark.

156
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:59,010
Study, study, report, quiz for the didactic stuff.

157
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:05,640
And then participation and then we have a little field trip to and CRC as far as that field trip.

158
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:11,570
If you look under the people and you don't know what your version of this looks like,

159
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:16,680
I could go to student view, I suppose, but there should be a necropsy lab groups tab.

160
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:21,239
And like I said, I've kind of pre assigned you to groups.

161
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:25,530
You can look up a syllabus. This is the October 7th day and this is the October 14th.

162
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:35,610
So if you could let me know in the next week if there is a problem with your given day or if one is better for you,

163
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:42,420
the other is I'm trying to make it relatively even, but let me know if there's an issue that can move stuff around as I have to.

164
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:47,520
Okay. All right. Or if you can't find that or something, just let me know.

165
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:55,110
All right. And then there's all mine looks a bit different than yours because I am in an instructor view.

166
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:58,350
But there's all kinds of stuff is a little bit more confusing class.

167
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:06,060
There are the lecture modules, some of which are not active yet, but those are the things that are going to go into that didactic portion at the end.

168
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:11,010
So when you're reviewing for that, there's going to be those are the things you can use to review.

169
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:15,510
There's going to be a study guide. So again, there's sort of a review document, so don't worry too much about it.

170
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:21,420
There's this lab safety presentation. So before you could do the lab, I'm required to do two things.

171
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:26,430
I have to give you information about animal welfare and regulations, which is coming in because that's part of the class.

172
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:32,910
So we'll have that covered by next week. And you also have to have a basic lab safety training, which many of you have had because you work in labs.

173
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:37,170
But the for the lab and it's not assigned this week but before the lab,

174
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:42,149
there's actually a lab safety presentation particular to my lab, most of it you already had before.

175
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:47,190
It's kind of commonsense lab safety, but it talks about things that are specific to my lab as well.

176
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:52,080
So you're going to have to read that thing over. And then there's a lab safety quiz.

177
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,829
I'll show you that later. But you have to take that before the lab.

178
00:16:55,830 --> 00:17:00,450
So that covers the lab safety training. Okay. So we're about that now, but that's in there.

179
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:06,959
And then there's this is a lot of this is not visible to you yet, but this is a lot of data and here are related to the study protocol.

180
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,680
So that's where we're going to put all our data that you can use when you're writing your paper.

181
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:17,399
So it gets a little confusing at any time. If you have any questions about where to find something, I try to give you hints as we go,

182
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:22,470
but if your questions about where to find something or anything like that can't find something, please let me know.

183
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:28,950
All right. Anybody have questions about how the class is structured?

184
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:34,020
Anything? I want to see if I can do the names. Michael.

185
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:42,750
JENNIFER. Yeah. Jennifer. Yes, it is.

186
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:48,730
W. Yeah. I can do it too.

187
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,450
Tiffany Yes, do it. Amber Subtle.

188
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:57,430
Yes. Sarah. Neil.

189
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:09,790
Margaret Abdul. Ah. Oh, no.

190
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:16,180
I'm worried about you. You get it for him? Oh, God.

191
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,790
Oh, no. What's your name? See her on the roof? Oh, okay.

192
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:26,770
Oh, no, no. You're Chloe's roommate? Oh, no.

193
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:34,990
Oh, no. The sea turtle. Jade James. Okay. Wow. I there's something weird about my brain when I used to work in private practice,

194
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:40,740
and I was, like, out of the grocery store or something, and, like, a client. Hey, Dr. Burton, I don't have time.

195
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,280
And then they'd be like, my dog, Mr. Beans. And I'm like, Oh, Mr. Beans.

196
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,540
Something about the way how you remember all of them.

197
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:59,620
I told you, it's your special axolotl cuttlefish.

198
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:05,290
It's only, I don't know, something weird about my brain. I try not to analyze it.

199
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:10,740
All right, so this is the same title. For the most part, as we did this morning.

200
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,050
But we're going to expand a little bit upon some of the topics.

201
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:18,190
So in addition to kind of broad view of In-Vivo toxicology, we'll talk a little bit about study design.

202
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,150
Are you sure you guys are paying for visibility? Okay.

203
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:28,480
Just looks like we're all right. So this is basically the same slide as we had this morning.

204
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:32,889
We talked about why might you perform toxicity testing.

205
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:37,510
And certainly one of the main arenas is to fulfill regulatory requirements.

206
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:43,000
So as you might know from some of your other course work, certainly if you're in toxicology,

207
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:49,930
some of the agencies that have regulatory requirements for compounds of the U.S. or the FDA,

208
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:52,150
which obviously covers foods and drugs,

209
00:19:52,630 --> 00:20:00,610
and then the piece of legislation that the FDA is under which the FDA operates is the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.

210
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,160
They didn't kind of know which go with which.

211
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:09,790
So that relates to foods and drugs for things that are going to be chemicals in the environment or pesticides.

212
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:13,030
The relevant agency is the Environmental Protection Agency,

213
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:20,860
and that it sort of depends on what the compound is, what the relative, the relevant legislation is.

214
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:26,350
If you're registering a pesticide for a use like for its intended use as a pesticide,

215
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:34,090
the relevant piece of legislation is the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act sets it for its intended use.

216
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:41,740
But when you do that because a lot of times that's in context of agriculture, you can potentially end up with residues right in the food system.

217
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:50,470
So interestingly, that actually goes back to the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, because that then it becomes food, so to speak.

218
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:56,740
It regulates the levels of a pesticide or of a chemical compound that can be in the food supply, for example,

219
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:04,840
for chemicals that are not pesticides or just substances in industrial use or in other applications in the environment.

220
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:09,190
That's pretty much under the U.S., under the jurisdiction of the EPA.

221
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:17,860
And the relevant piece of legislation is the Toxic Substances Control Act, which has existed for a long period of time, but was recently amended.

222
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:23,979
And we're going to to that in a little bit, because it's been strengthened to some degree to allow us to have a little bit better

223
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:29,800
control over the health effects of compounds that are being registered as chemicals.

224
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:37,480
And then for chemicals, you also have to think about the OCD, which again is the international agency that sets standards for testing of compounds,

225
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:43,900
because many of the companies that are marketing these compounds are global companies, and it's going to be in international use.

226
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:50,739
These are the relevant international regulatory work requirements.

227
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:58,390
So we already talked about the OECD, which is the agency that sets standards for chemical testing and the pharmaceutical sort of equivalent,

228
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,970
which is the Harmonization Council, the ICAO, International Council for Harmonization for pharmaceuticals.

229
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:08,590
And then obviously, individual countries have their own regulatory requirements,

230
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:14,260
many of which are derived or contain pieces that are derived from these international agencies.

231
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:19,900
One that we kind of glossed over but we talked about Rich, was the question about reach this morning.

232
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:29,410
That's I'll think of someone in this class, but which is the European legislation that pertains to chemicals.

233
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:37,390
So rich doesn't really pertain to pharmaceuticals, but it pertains to chemicals that are manufactured in or imported into the EU.

234
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,959
It first came into play around 2728,

235
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:50,380
but wasn't fully implemented in terms of the volume limits for chemicals under which it has jurisdiction with a fully implemented until 2018.

236
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:58,210
But it mandates that you register chemicals that are imported or manufactured above a certain a certain volume.

237
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,630
So which has a lot of other. Aspects.

238
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:11,310
That's kind of a stronger control on chemicals being introduced to the EU and because it has no legal jurisdiction here,

239
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:16,460
but again, because many companies sell globally. What happens or what the requirements are?

240
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:25,020
The EU tend to have an impact on companies that also sell their compounds in the US, but we don't specifically have a reach equivalent here.

241
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:33,360
So regulatory is a very common reason to do an individual study because there's a

242
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,560
requirement to have those compounds tested in animals under certain circumstances.

243
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:44,220
But another really common context is to investigate basic science, and that's actually in this institution.

244
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:50,040
You know, really the reason that we would be doing things so we're more experimental or investigative toxicology.

245
00:23:50,820 --> 00:24:00,600
So this is an article about the effects of estrogen exposure in neonatal mice and looking at downstream uterine lesions,

246
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:03,780
uterine neoplasia and prenatal places in mice.

247
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:08,280
This is a friend of mine, a veterinary pathologist who worked for a while for the EPA.

248
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:14,670
So there's a lot of work being done in basic science. A lot of these studies are geared mechanistically,

249
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:23,400
so you're trying to dig a little bit deeper than you would in a regulatory setting into what are the mechanisms of compounds toxic effect.

250
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:28,920
And that journal, the Journal of Toxicological Pathology, is the Society Journal for the STP,

251
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:36,000
which is the agency I told you for the entity I told you about this morning that most toxicology pathologists belong to.

252
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:40,430
So that's our our main journal. Okay.

253
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,620
So that's the context in which you might perform in vivo testing.

254
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:52,470
So now who would be doing this? Well, for pharmaceuticals, most of the toxic testing is sponsored or is done by private industry.

255
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:56,700
So these are companies obviously don't want to bring a pharmaceutical to market and they

256
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:02,130
are responsible for funding and running or subcontracting the preclinical safety testing.

257
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:09,870
So these are done in the context of formulating an R&D application or an investigational new drug application,

258
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,980
which is what you have to submit to the FDA in order to get permission to do

259
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:18,120
clinical trials in humans and eventually to make it a new drug application,

260
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,220
which is the application for final approval.

261
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:30,240
So in most contexts, you need to have before you can refile your idea, you need to have preclinical work or work in animals.

262
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:38,280
And kind of confusingly, those are often referred to as safety studies, but it's safety in animals because as I said this morning,

263
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:44,880
you can't 100% assess safety in humans in an animal model, but shorthand, you'll hear people talk about safety studies.

264
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:53,879
So private industry for pharmaceuticals, for chemicals, also private industry is often the entity that runs non-clinical safety testing.

265
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,490
But these would be studies that are reviewed by the EPA.

266
00:25:57,030 --> 00:26:03,570
And this has changed kind of most recently with this amendment to the Toxic Substances Control Act.

267
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:08,900
So that was the Frank Lautenberg amendment prior to this.

268
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:13,500
Interestingly, it shut the door a little bit because my job is to serve people.

269
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:19,530
I mean, if anyone feels like they're going to heatstroke.

270
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:32,880
So prior to this amendment, the, um, was interesting because the onus was really on kind of the EPA.

271
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:42,390
You didn't actually have to test the compounds in animals and generate safety data unless there was evidence that it posed a toxic risk to humans.

272
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:48,930
So that seems a little backwards, or at least like locking the barn door after the horses turned away.

273
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,639
And one of the main achievements,

274
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:57,690
or one of the main changes of the Lautenberg Chemical Safety Amendment was that if you're introducing a new chemical to the market,

275
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:03,480
you first you as the company, have to show a priority in it before it's on the market.

276
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:08,730
That a new chemical is not likely to pose a health risk based on its likely use.

277
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:13,110
Doesn't mean that's not toxic, but you can't say Drink my chemical and you're totally fine.

278
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:18,240
If it's you have to show that in the context of its likely use, it's not toxic.

279
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:22,550
That's great. Obviously, there's a lot of chemicals already on the market.

280
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:29,580
So another provision was that the EPA and its working group are going to have identified on a

281
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:35,430
prioritized list of existing compounds that there's most concern about or most health concern about.

282
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:42,689
At the time, I think I wrote the slide first in 2018, there were ten compounds identified as the priority list,

283
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:47,820
and there's mandated testing for those parts, and funds were set aside for the testing of those compounds.

284
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:54,780
So it's not perfect. There's still plenty of loopholes, but it did strengthen to some degree the requirement for testing,

285
00:27:55,290 --> 00:28:00,090
and unfortunately, it does involve some animal testing to get that done.

286
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:04,890
Okay. So that's for chemicals. There's also the national toxicology program.

287
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:14,700
That is tox people. We've heard of this to some degree, right. So the national toxicology the toxicology program or the A.P. is an inter-agency.

288
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:19,710
So it has done deals with several other agencies of the federal government.

289
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:30,060
It's a federal program, and its role is to coordinate testing for compounds that are nominated on the basis of their suspected public health risk.

290
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:35,500
So the A.P. has standing committees that anyone, anyone can nominate a compound.

291
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:40,920
So one a couple of years ago was bisphenol A, you know, like the water bottles.

292
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:44,550
So there's a lot of different plasticizers that have potential health risks.

293
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:48,629
So there is concern over this. And I'll say it was public nomination of this panel.

294
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:52,530
A, it can be a member of the public can be a health agency.

295
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,830
Anyone can nominate for testing.

296
00:28:54,840 --> 00:29:02,640
And then the A.P. sort of prioritizes and decides which of those is most likely to be an actual risk and then contracts out the testing.

297
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:11,160
So some of that there is a national toxicology lab. Some of that is also done by contract private industry like zero and things like that.

298
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:15,270
And then the National Toxicology Program has the responsibility of looking at

299
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:18,719
that data and making sort of a recommendation as to whether that compound does,

300
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:24,690
in fact, pose a health risk. That's the A.P., my colleague, Dr. Hoff, you might meet him at the lab day,

301
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:31,580
is a veteran pathologist who used to be at the A.P. It's kind of the environmental talks part of that talks about.

302
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:39,300
And then finally, there's the context of in-vivo, tox testing and basic sciences, which again, is like the things we do here.

303
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:45,110
And usually those are more mechanistic or hypothesis driven versus is it adverse, yes or no?

304
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:54,710
All right. So in vivo studies, as we've already discussed, are used pretty much the IRB for drug development are used in the early phases.

305
00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:02,160
So this is kind of a standard drug development pipeline where in the early phases you have sort of a discovery phase,

306
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:06,390
which is kind of a proof of concept. Is it going to work in the way it's intended?

307
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:10,740
And then you move to what's kind of shorthand called safety studies.

308
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:16,860
That's the preclinical testing intended to identify the dose range at which there might be an adverse response.

309
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:25,440
Only when that is done. Can you file an idea application and that needs to be approved before you can go into human clinical trials.

310
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:28,230
So you can't just willy nilly test in humans.

311
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:35,309
You need to have some evidence that you have an understanding of what the likely adverse effects are, that there are clinical trials,

312
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:43,140
the first of which is pretty small and is geared strictly towards safety, and then later looking at dosing and efficacy.

313
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:50,040
So the clinical trials have a progression and only after all that is done can you get approval of a new drug.

314
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:53,970
You can get a new drug authorization and put the drug on the market.

315
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:55,799
But because of a numbers game,

316
00:30:55,800 --> 00:31:01,740
sometimes there are toxicities that don't actually appear until you're using a drug or compound in a large number of people.

317
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:05,790
So there's also safety testing in a post-approval setting.

318
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:11,400
So there's monitoring of a drug that's particularly intense in the initial five years that it's on the market.

319
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:15,330
So preclinical testing is pretty early in the process.

320
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:22,620
There are a number of guidelines that govern. So when you're trying to plan a study, you can't just plan however you want.

321
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:29,940
And if you're looking at a regulatory setting, there are a number of guidelines by which you have to abide in order to come up with

322
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:34,950
documents at the end that would be acceptable to present to the FDA or to the EPA.

323
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:40,440
So these include for foods and food ingredients.

324
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:46,379
The FDA has something that's called the Red Book. It used to be read, I think it's online now, so it's probably irrelevant.

325
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:52,560
But the red book, if you hear people talking about that, is on the principles for the safety assessment of food ingredients.

326
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:57,120
So that's a main guidance document for food for food ingredients for pharmaceuticals.

327
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:05,840
We've already talked about the international ICAO guidelines and then the FDA has interpretations or clarifications that are based on ICAO.

328
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:13,200
So you'll hear about FDA guidance, you know, for people manufacturing like biologics or something like that.

329
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:20,570
So there's a number of guidance documents. So those are very high importance to drug companies to zeros,

330
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:28,440
because you have to make sure that any studies that you present that basically tells you what types of evidence the FDA is going to be looking for.

331
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:33,450
You have to make sure that your study is conducted in accordance with those guidance documents.

332
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:42,540
And then for chemicals, the EPA has similar sort of harmonized test guidelines which bring in principles from the OECD and from other countries.

333
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:47,850
So there's a lot of guidance documents in academic science.

334
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:56,339
We don't always we have a different focus. We're looking at a hypothesis, mechanisms we don't always have as controlled a study protocol.

335
00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:04,950
It's not prescribed, you know, by a regulation. But I find knowledge of these can help you if you're studying toxicology in an academic setting,

336
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:14,730
kind of gives you sort of a standard for proof for how would be the toxicology is interpreted, interpreted from a regulatory context.

337
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:20,910
And it has a lot of good information in terms of end points, like what is evidence of toxicity to deliver,

338
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:25,530
what is evidence of blood toxicity so it can help you come up with parameters to assess.

339
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:33,510
This is an example chart of some of the OECD testing guideline numbers for different aspects of toxicity.

340
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,740
So one of particular interest is this acute toxicity testing.

341
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:41,820
So this for a one guidance used to cover the old l.D 50.

342
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,950
I have it in parentheses because as we know now,

343
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:49,680
it's no longer in use and there are a number of other testing guidelines that are utilized as a substitute.

344
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:56,429
But if you ever go look these up, these are very specific. They tell you things like the number of animals, the dosing strategy.

345
00:33:56,430 --> 00:34:03,990
It's pretty specific and it's a good way to start to familiarize yourself with some of the methods in tox testing.

346
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:09,840
So what are the commonly utilized types of studies and regulatory talks?

347
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:21,990
So one common one is the acute is acute toxicity testing and sort of traditionally this first referred to single dose acute toxicity.

348
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:30,600
So it's kind of a measure of intrinsic toxicity. And in some ways this is reflective of the old L.D. 50 because the question you're trying to ask,

349
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:34,270
it's like, you know, at a basic level, how toxic is this substance?

350
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:38,970
How much of it do I need to give before this animal is showing signs of adversity?

351
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:50,550
So the goal of an acute single dose test is to identify the maximum tolerated dose or the MTD, which is the dose that produces some toxicity.

352
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:55,590
But that word tolerated is important, some toxicity, but then it's well tolerated.

353
00:34:56,100 --> 00:35:01,440
So it's not something that's going to cause the animal to die. It's not something that's going to cause it to become horrifically ill.

354
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:06,600
But maybe there's a dose that would you be able to do with 15% of their body weight or something.

355
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:10,380
So that's they can deal with that, but that's adverse.

356
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:17,160
So you're trying to benchmark like what are the limits, which I can dose this drug at a max before the animals become very ill.

357
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:24,989
And then in doing that, you also identify which are the organ systems that are going to be first, first affected.

358
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:33,990
So it's an intrinsic toxicity measure. And then you can do the same thing with repeated dose tox testing, that subacute intrinsic toxicity.

359
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:41,730
And again, the goal usually is to find a MTD or a maximum tolerated dose in the context of industry.

360
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,540
One acute single dose test not really done anymore. I'll show you.

361
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:50,489
There's a couple of different strategies for it, but if you're usually you do some sort of short term study,

362
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:55,490
but the purpose of these is often dose range finding what you want to do eventually.

363
00:35:55,500 --> 00:36:03,870
The real safety study is a longer term repeat dosing that usually has to be at least equivalent,

364
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:09,089
but more often a little bit longer than the intended dose period in humans, right?

365
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:11,430
So if you were driving on one taken once in a while, it's a short study.

366
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:16,560
If you're drug taking four years, it might be a two year study because that could be the.

367
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,360
The lifespan, essentially, of a rodent.

368
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:27,660
But when you do that longer study for it to be successful, you want to be able to identify a dose at which there is adverse effect.

369
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:32,010
But you don't want all the animals and all your dose groups to die.

370
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:38,170
Really? You want to have like a nice gradient. So usually there has to be some sort of earlier study that's dose range finding.

371
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:47,260
So it's the use of subacute toxicity testing. And then, as I said, the sub chronic is a longer term study.

372
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:49,260
These terms get looked around a little bit.

373
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:56,310
You could kind of almost consider a 28 year, 90 day study chronic, but a sub product study traditionally is a 90 day study,

374
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:00,090
and that's the true safety testing phase of preclinical drug development.

375
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:05,910
So the goal of that study is little bit different. The goal of that study, rather than finding the MTD,

376
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:13,530
the goal is to establish what is the know observed adverse effects level that gives these animals a dose over a longer period of time.

377
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:16,710
At what dosing level do I see? Nothing that's adverse.

378
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:24,870
So try to benchmark sort of a little bit lower level effect or lack of effect, rather, in chronic administration.

379
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:35,790
Okay. And then, as I said, there are some drugs where lifetime dosing is used and that's used for drugs that are suspected to have carcinogenicity.

380
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:40,890
So those are carcinogenicity studies or drugs that are for long term chronic conditions where they're going to be taking it,

381
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:45,330
you know, for the duration. Okay. So those are study types.

382
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:48,450
So this is a little bit more about acute toxicity testing,

383
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:55,860
which we said is for the purpose of identifying an MTD, which is the maximum dose that is well-tolerated.

384
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:59,980
Sometimes that gets confusing. Just remember, that doesn't mean that nothing's happening.

385
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,030
It just means there's no severe clinical signs of toxicity.

386
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:08,880
So usually what you have to do is set some endpoints, the definitions that what you're going to call severe toxicity.

387
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:14,520
The maximum tolerated dose is not an absolute value.

388
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:19,800
It's defined within a study. Okay, so I can run a study in rats and I can say, okay,

389
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:27,840
in this study I was able to adjust the rats at 20 milligrams per kg and they had some, you know, decrease food intake or something.

390
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:34,530
But that was, well, the maximum well tolerated dose doesn't mean that 20 milligrams per kg will be the safe dose in humans.

391
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:39,060
And it doesn't mean that if somebody else does a rat study that that's going to be their MTD.

392
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:46,590
It's always in the context of the study. And then what you do later with that information, you look at all the studies you have available to you.

393
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:51,299
Where is the MTD for those individual studies? Was there always around 20 milligrams?

394
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:58,770
There are some at ten, some at 100. And that can play into your confidence about whether you understand enough about the drug

395
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:03,120
and its variability in its mechanisms to be able to set a dose that's safe for humans.

396
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:09,780
Okay. So MTD is defined within a study and it applies to the animals, not necessarily to humans.

397
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,990
So other things have to happen to extrapolate to humans.

398
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:19,440
This is an example of the old acute toxicity testing method, which is the older 50.

399
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:27,010
So that that study had 5 to 6 dosing groups, a lot of animals, ten animals each, an equivalent number of male and female.

400
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:34,250
And they were young adults. And back in the way, way back, certainly before my time, this was done in three species.

401
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:38,700
You can imagine this is just kind of where toxicology gets its name.

402
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:45,840
And the point of it was to dose until you identified a dose where 50% of the animals were to die.

403
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:54,210
So that was the older 50. That's traditional. But as I said this morning, usually something happens on your way to death.

404
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:59,520
From healthy to death, there's a transitional period. So that's not necessarily need it anymore.

405
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:04,710
And there are replacement tests that have been identified and are acceptable by the EPA or the FDA.

406
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:08,490
So this is the revision of the guidance from the FDA.

407
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:13,590
And the purpose of the new approach is, is to minimize animal numbers and animal suffering.

408
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:18,959
So that's great from a welfare aspect. You know, if that's not important to you, I hope it is.

409
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,120
But if that's not important to you, it also saves money from a company aspect,

410
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:29,190
is more efficient and it also improves the science a bit because the animals don't have to actually die to use it as an endpoint.

411
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:32,489
So if you want to look at the tissues, you want to see something mechanistically.

412
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:37,230
You can look earlier in the process and get a little bit closer to where the direct activity of the drug is.

413
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:42,120
So here are some of the new approaches that replace the old E-15.

414
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:49,260
So there's something called the fixed dose test, which rather than take your five dose groups of ten animals and dosed everybody all at once,

415
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:57,160
you have sort of fixed starting doses that you might have determined from the literature, from other drugs, of the calm of the class.

416
00:40:57,180 --> 00:41:04,020
You might have an idea where the dosage level is likely to be and you dose animals only five at a time and one dose at a time.

417
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:07,770
So those fixed starting doses, you have some idea with that starting doses.

418
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:14,190
And then the end point is when the animals show signs of toxicity. So then you would euthanize them tissues, whatever you need to do.

419
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:19,230
That's basically the l.D 50 without the death. Tom BODETT and a more extrapolated dosing.

420
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:27,930
So that reduces the total number. There is a drug, a class of testing class that still uses mortality as an endpoint.

421
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:33,570
So that's acute toxic class, which uses one dose at a time and doses three animals at a time.

422
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:38,730
So it tries to decrease the number. And that one, the endpoint is do the animals die?

423
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:49,500
That is used in very specific circumstances for compounds that might have an adverse effect where there's not a lot of premonitory signs of it.

424
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:54,600
So you have something that's going to cause, I don't know, like an arrhythmia where the animal's going to have,

425
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:58,110
you know, a heart disturbance and might die suddenly of a heart disturbance.

426
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:02,399
That's something you're basically going to find them dead. They're not going to show signs of it.

427
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:08,040
So this is rarely used, but it is sometimes used for drugs that don't have much signs to look for.

428
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,729
And then the update this is used and academic signs.

429
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:19,350
What the up and down procedure where you're dosing really one animal at a time and you give a really micro dose, that one seems fine.

430
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:21,810
Then the next thing, another high or another high.

431
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:29,790
So it's not statistically very robust, but that's okay because the purpose of this is not really to come up with a statistical answer.

432
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:38,430
The purpose is just to benchmark the dose that you need to measure intrinsic toxicity, benchmark the dose you need to dose animals longer term.

433
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:42,930
Okay. So that's the newer approach.

434
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,629
And then this is the slide from this morning.

435
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:54,480
Again, looking at humane end points, one point about this, if you like, if you ever get a chance to sit in the eye approach,

436
00:42:54,480 --> 00:43:00,330
which is the Institutional Animal Care Use Committee, you'll hear us talk about you shouldn't use death as an endpoint.

437
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:01,440
Death is an end point is bad.

438
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:07,650
And sometimes that gets people confused because obviously if you're doing a tox study at the end of it, you're euthanizing the animal.

439
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:13,440
So the point is death. But what we mean from a welfare perspective when we say death is an endpoint,

440
00:43:14,370 --> 00:43:19,350
the study doesn't you're not waiting for the animal to die spontaneously, for the study to be over.

441
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:23,010
Your end point is when you reach a measure of toxicity.

442
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,850
And so, again, this is where we select things ahead of time, like, okay,

443
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:32,700
if the animals have decreased their food and water intake to a certain percent or have a certain percent of weight loss,

444
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:38,910
I'm going to say they're on their way to death. I'm going to euthanize them. And they're actually had been scientific studies showing.

445
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,180
But when these welfare guidelines were put in place,

446
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:51,900
showing that the animals that have these signs and more particularly animals have these severe signs essentially always die without intervention.

447
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:55,860
So you don't have to actually wait until they actually do. It's more humane to euthanize them earlier.

448
00:43:56,460 --> 00:44:01,590
So when we talk death as an endpoint or as well, the reason we say you can't have death is an endpoint.

449
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:09,419
What we're saying is you don't want to wait till the animals actually die. This is basically the same slide.

450
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:14,340
This is the new approaches to pharmaceuticals. It's just explaining it in the context of pharmaceuticals.

451
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:19,620
And then this is your review slide for the commonly utilized studies in regulatory talks.

452
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:24,720
So we talked about acute toxicity and some of the replacement studies there.

453
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:33,910
But what about some chronic testing where you're repeated dosing the animals, you're using the dose information you've got from your early step,

454
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:42,650
earlier studies and using it to try to establish a little bit more specifically at that time.

455
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:46,260
Sorry. Okay, good. Okay.

456
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:50,460
So this is really the true safety testing of preclinical drug development.

457
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:57,840
Traditionally, these are 90 day studies and this is the bulk of the information that's provided with a R&D application.

458
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:06,780
So the purpose of that preclinical testing, even though we call that thing safety testing, which is kind of misleading,

459
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:14,190
the purpose is really to inform decision making regarding your planning for the clinical testing in humans.

460
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:21,690
So you're not establishing that the compound is safe in humans. The safety in humans is really determined in human clinical trials.

461
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:27,270
All you're trying to do is affect your dose range at which adverse effects are seen in humans and animals.

462
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:34,380
And as we talked about this morning, that's going to be used to extrapolate the initial dose range in humans,

463
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:38,790
which traditionally has been extrapolated for L.

464
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:45,389
So how do we do this? Okay, so what are this kind of verbally?

465
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:52,440
A little bit this morning. But traditionally, the ADL has been used to calculate what's called the human equivalent dose.

466
00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:57,870
So first, what happens is the are well defined in multiple species.

467
00:45:58,290 --> 00:46:07,380
So usually in order to submit a pharmaceutical for approval, you need to have animal studies in at least two species, one of which is a non rodent.

468
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:11,610
Because we know that there are some differences between rodents and humans.

469
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:16,310
We don't necessarily know the species that's most relevant, every compound.

470
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:21,610
But you're trying to kind of spread the data out and get your best chance of identifying a relevant toxic effect.

471
00:46:22,390 --> 00:46:25,090
So the new ideal is defined in multiple species.

472
00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:34,330
And then you can determine a human equivalent dose by selecting the needle from the most appropriate species, which, as you can imagine,

473
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:41,740
a lot of hit women as starts here because you have to have enough information to identify what that most appropriate species is.

474
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:46,690
And that's going to be different and dependent on the strength of the data that you're examining.

475
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:54,190
So are you going to say, I don't really know much about this compounds, so I'm going to take the lowest.

476
00:46:54,190 --> 00:47:00,220
And I looked at all these species and this species had the lowest and also was the most sensitive.

477
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:03,280
So to cover my birds, I'm going to use that. That's one approach.

478
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:09,580
Or you're like, you know, I know a lot about the pharmacokinetics and a lot about the admitted data from this species,

479
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:14,580
and I can see that it's most similar to human. So I'm going to use that as the basis for my calculation.

480
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:21,490
Or if there's a, you know, a mouse, you know, has p450 enzymes that really break down that component,

481
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:25,720
that compound that one might not necessarily be the best relevant species.

482
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:30,970
So you have to pick something, right? You're going to pick the number from what you think is the most appropriate species.

483
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:38,290
And then the human equivalent dose is calculated by a conversion that's usually related to the body's surface area.

484
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:43,600
That depends a little bit on dosing. So that tends to work well.

485
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:50,439
There's a lot of caveats there, but it tends to work well for drugs that are orally dosed because the absorption

486
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:55,690
can be related to the surface area of the GI for drugs that are sometimes I mean,

487
00:47:55,690 --> 00:48:00,220
there are many drugs that are applied to a large surface topically, but drugs that might be inhaled,

488
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:04,780
it doesn't tend to work as well for drugs necessarily that are injected.

489
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:10,239
So like whether you use our metric scaling depends on the drug type, but in any case,

490
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:17,530
there's a dose conversion and this is the standard dose conversion that's used for drugs that are element scale.

491
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:21,880
So the human equivalent dose is related to the animal dose,

492
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:28,720
part of the conversion that's body weight to the two thirds or the three fourths power depending on the equation that you use.

493
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:34,900
And then that dose, that human equivalent dose is divided by a safety factor.

494
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:41,200
And the safety factor that you use depends on how confident you are or how severe the toxicities are.

495
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:44,470
If your data is really strong, you might use a safety factor of ten.

496
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:51,849
If the data is a little sketchier, you're really it has a high toxicity, like a high consequence toxicity.

497
00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:54,340
You might use a larger state safety factor.

498
00:48:56,110 --> 00:49:00,760
It might seem that you always want to go with like a safety factor of a thousand just to be on the safe side.

499
00:49:01,090 --> 00:49:09,610
But there is a kind of real world practical consequence to going with too high a safety factor and dropping your dose in humans too high.

500
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:16,960
Because then if you're microdosing humans, you're going to have to do a lot of clinical trials, kind of work your way up to the dose,

501
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:21,520
which is going to be therapeutically effective, and that gets very expensive and time consuming.

502
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:25,150
So then there's a cost in terms of the time it takes to bring your drug to market.

503
00:49:25,570 --> 00:49:28,990
So you want to try to be as accurate as you can. So here's an example.

504
00:49:28,990 --> 00:49:33,549
The FDA makes the math easy for you because they have this guidance document that

505
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:39,490
actually gives you a handy dandy chart for estimating the HIV dose from animal doses.

506
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:45,999
So for example, if you identified a yellow five mixed perching in a rat, it gives you the standard.

507
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:51,850
Any chart that says to convert an animal dose, you can either divide it or multiply it by the conversion factor.

508
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:56,170
Right. And that's derived from that equation I showed you. And then you divide it.

509
00:49:56,500 --> 00:50:00,880
You divide it by the safety factor. So now ADL of five makes for keeping the rat.

510
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:06,970
After you do all that comes out to a starting .08 makes per pig in the human.

511
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:11,139
Okay so that's showing how. Yes. For identifying those things in animals.

512
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:15,220
But that doesn't mean that's the same exact dose we're going to use in our clinical trials.

513
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:26,320
Okay. So that's classic dose extrapolation and is still used in many instances, but I think you probably already can think of your head.

514
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:30,940
There's a lot of it is going on there. There could be some problems with that strategy.

515
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:36,020
So some of the problems we talked about in terms of species,

516
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:42,130
you might not necessarily know biologically everything that you need to determine whether the species is relevant.

517
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:46,150
And some of it comes from something as simple as defining adversity.

518
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:51,440
So there are guidelines, at least in the pharmaceutical industry.

519
00:50:51,470 --> 00:50:57,280
We have guidance documents actually in pathology written on what findings are adverse, how do you define adversity?

520
00:50:57,670 --> 00:51:03,309
But ultimately it's a judgment call, right? So defining it, that dose level, you know,

521
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:11,230
you're giving a drug as a pharmaceutical for reasons you need some sort of biologic response and defining when that response becomes adverse.

522
00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:14,500
Sometimes it gets to be a little bit judgmental.

523
00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:21,070
Just call. So it's subject to inter observer and intra observer variation and differences of opinion.

524
00:51:22,030 --> 00:51:26,020
And like I said, there's consequences to being too lax or too strict.

525
00:51:26,770 --> 00:51:30,670
If it's too lax. There's a pretty high consequence cause you don't want to kill people.

526
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
So you really want to have a safety factor embedded.

527
00:51:34,330 --> 00:51:39,760
But if you have too strict a definition, you might be imposing an overly conservative regulatory threshold.

528
00:51:40,270 --> 00:51:45,640
And remember, these are compounds to treat disease. So you don't want to inhibit compounds from getting to market.

529
00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:50,530
So it has a health and an economic consequence. So it's not a perfect science.

530
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:58,210
But in our attempts to sort of refine this process of dose extrapolation, there are some newer, more modern approaches.

531
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:05,590
So you might have heard of the maybe our middle minimum anticipated biologic effect level.

532
00:52:06,550 --> 00:52:13,640
So this is a method where you use not just your safety study, use all available information so you can do your safety study.

533
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:20,710
It could be in vitro data, maybe in vitro assay for receptor binding with what percent of the available receptors are occupied.

534
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:26,860
You must use all the available information to extrapolate a dose, a minimum dose,

535
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:31,600
tiny dose now at which the drug has some sort of detectable biologic effect.

536
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:36,820
Okay. So we're taking toxicity right out of it here. We just want a biologic effect.

537
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:42,460
So if I have a good one and immunomodulatory compound,

538
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:48,310
rather than looking at the dose that completely wipes out my lymphocyte function, maybe that would be a toxic dose.

539
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:59,530
I might look at the dose where I don't know, you know, lymphocyte assay, the proliferation capacity is reduced by 10% for control.

540
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:07,780
So I'm looking for the minimum anticipated biologic effects level, and that's going to be a teeny tiny dose compared to what the ADL is.

541
00:53:09,010 --> 00:53:17,770
And then once I've established that, I can use a benchmark approach where I use all the dosing data.

542
00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:22,839
So I had my toxic studies, I had my physic, my toxicity studies and my physiologic studies,

543
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:26,530
and I can generate a mathematical model of the dose response curve.

544
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:31,630
So all the dose response curve, starting from where is my minimal biologic effect?

545
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:35,350
Here are my therapeutic effects, here are my toxic effects.

546
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:39,640
And then I can extrapolate to a benchmark response dose.

547
00:53:40,270 --> 00:53:44,260
So I can decide what it predetermine. What is the response that I'm concerned about here?

548
00:53:44,770 --> 00:53:50,200
So maybe in my immunological sample, I'm like, okay, well, I in my humans,

549
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:54,400
I want to make sure that I see some response, like maybe a diminution of lymphocyte function.

550
00:53:54,680 --> 00:54:02,229
I don't want to make sure making something up that lymphocyte levels don't drop below 20% of

551
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:06,490
the normal control group from just taking something that I think is biologically important.

552
00:54:06,850 --> 00:54:09,220
And I have a broad range of dosing information.

553
00:54:09,610 --> 00:54:16,060
So I can estimate, okay, if I pick that, I estimate that I'm X percent below where I start to see that toxicity.

554
00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:21,250
Okay. So bit more refined approach and this is a cartoon schematic of what that might look like.

555
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,200
So the important things to know here is where do all these doses relate to each other?

556
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:30,370
This is dose on the x axis response on the Y axis.

557
00:54:30,370 --> 00:54:33,970
And these are the different types of responses, the different end points.

558
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:38,679
This is minimum biologic effect. This is a therapeutic response.

559
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:42,700
And these are toxic responses. Right. So these could be different organ systems.

560
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:47,800
Different responses could have some similarities. And these are the relevant dose curves.

561
00:54:48,310 --> 00:54:54,220
So you can see by traditional toxicology, my no observed adverse effects level is at a fairly high dose.

562
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:57,970
And then I'm going to extrapolate that back right to my therapeutic dose.

563
00:54:58,450 --> 00:55:03,790
But if I'm using a made up of anticipated biologic effects level and I'm dosing humans based on that,

564
00:55:03,790 --> 00:55:08,200
I have a larger distance to go before I get to my likely toxic area.

565
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:09,340
Okay.

566
00:55:09,550 --> 00:55:16,240
So the thing to understand here is how these doses sort of relate to each other and just understand that even though the new HDL is still important,

567
00:55:16,630 --> 00:55:23,200
we have some different approaches now. So it's not necessarily the only way that we can settle upon a human dose.

568
00:55:24,310 --> 00:55:32,950
All right. So very question about that. So the turning point of departure on the is that so yeah,

569
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:39,190
I heard this term like point of departure being commonly used in like the EPA integrated risk information system.

570
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:43,030
And so I was just like wondering, is that interchangeable with like the benchmark dose?

571
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:50,800
I don't know. I'd have to I don't have as much knowledge of the EPA is sort of dose extrapolation

572
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:54,400
or I should say exposure extrapolation as I do of the pharmaceutical ones.

573
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:59,559
So I'd have to look that up. I know. I think it's similar.

574
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:03,060
I'm not sure if it refers to the exact same type of approach.

575
00:56:05,330 --> 00:56:07,890
All right. So we're going to take a little bit of a break,

576
00:56:07,910 --> 00:56:14,540
like five minute break and then finish up just talking a little bit about what our vaccine study is going to look like.

577
00:56:15,410 --> 00:56:22,070
All right. I'll open the door. Oh, yeah.

578
00:56:23,170 --> 00:56:26,580
You. This. This is all I wanted to do.

579
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:32,280
Here was my grandfather. I wish I could kind of say, Oh, yeah, they really like that.

580
00:56:32,570 --> 00:56:42,400
They're like, on the card, like, I'm going to have whereas a different of, you know, parents they love him.

581
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:47,590
That's why I said, like I just I just do I yeah.

582
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:51,250
I don't know. I wonder if I hope they really hurt.

583
00:56:51,290 --> 00:57:04,759
Like, you know, it's really not that I didn't get this from my family just because I need them to do things.

584
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:08,930
And I think that would be like, namedrop.

585
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:12,350
You just can understand. Yeah. No, I just saw.

586
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:19,430
Give them a break. Yeah. Yeah, I think it was like a no.

587
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:24,370
Yeah, it was like. It was like. Yeah, like I exorcism.

588
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:28,090
I, I'm surprised they caught it. Yeah.

589
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:35,820
It's like doing the in and I'm like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

590
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:39,570
You're right. Welcome to my family. Sorry.

591
00:57:40,270 --> 00:57:48,840
You're going to have so much fun when there's like, so, I mean, you know, at school, I mean, she's known as this person.

592
00:57:50,830 --> 00:57:54,470
Oh, say. Ah, yeah, well, I know, I know.

593
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:57,970
Yeah, it's pretty loud. That's what. It sounds bad.

594
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:03,320
I don't even know. Southern Michigan doesn't get this. There's. This is crazy.

595
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:12,909
Yeah. Yeah, well, it's always been the U.P. and I went through it this summer, and I was like all of it.

596
00:58:12,910 --> 00:58:19,890
And so I'm thinking uncertain. But the words up there are you from the.

597
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:23,740
Yeah, that's right here. It's called us but I drive.

598
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:29,690
That's right on the drive that they don't know about.

599
00:58:29,890 --> 00:58:34,210
So it's 3 hours from tomorrow. So that's like. Yeah, I know.

600
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:38,680
But it's like, I think it's going to be worth. It's a two and a half hour drive.

601
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:46,090
Yeah. College was good in that, you know, it's like community service or something, so.

602
00:58:46,810 --> 00:58:50,550
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. I'm not the whole city.

603
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:58,630
So we went to it. So I have like this.

604
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:03,880
So when I there ever been fortunate in that part of the world.

605
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:08,070
Yeah. To get that kind of feedback that that's the skill sets.

606
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:12,700
And I said, oh yeah, I've been, I've been running some tests.

607
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:21,369
Oh that's cool. I, well I, I wrapped up already here like literally writing for two different.

608
00:59:21,370 --> 00:59:25,930
So now I'm going to make my version of the passport.

609
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:31,940
So I know they're going to bring out all this, so I'm going to be on.

610
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:35,980
But it's like it's like a ten minute long blessed race finished.

611
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:40,570
Like they did that.

612
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:52,630
Yeah. Yeah, they they gave me, you know, they're like each scenario and it's how everybody gets into that 910 selection process before little can.

613
00:59:52,930 --> 00:59:58,780
Oh not that should be literary maybe. I mean, it's ending on like the trash sometimes the best lines are.

614
00:59:58,790 --> 01:00:06,100
Yeah, it's, it's actually when my husband works very early in time, we're like, Oh yeah, yeah.

615
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:14,620
We'd actually go and stay up. And to get a lot of, you know, like a little to get by my hotel, but there's no one in the world.

616
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:22,240
Like, there is a girl that has, like, that has a good laugh.

617
01:00:24,530 --> 01:00:30,010
Yeah, I like the grateful.

618
01:00:33,390 --> 01:00:37,840
I can say this. Let me see if my times is back, you know?

619
01:00:38,210 --> 01:00:47,930
Oh, yeah. You know that I do that, uh, for years.

620
01:00:48,050 --> 01:00:51,480
Yeah. Yeah, it's.

621
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:55,940
It's a nice expression. Except it's explaining to him out your college.

622
01:00:55,940 --> 01:01:00,350
Well, he graduated here. He's an engineer, so he's done with school.

623
01:01:01,270 --> 01:01:04,579
Yeah. That's all that true?

624
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:08,840
That this is, like. Is like. Actually, you haven't done anything yet.

625
01:01:09,390 --> 01:01:12,500
Yeah, I got really concerned. Really? Really? Yeah.

626
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:18,200
It's actually, it's too many complaints, you know? It's just like transmission is.

627
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:25,220
So he's studying mechanical engineering, but now he does microwave, so there's nothing, you know, send it over.

628
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:32,640
It's kind of like, you know, making some bio choice.

629
01:01:36,430 --> 01:01:39,829
So for one person to come back.

630
01:01:39,830 --> 01:01:46,130
But, um, you can probably get started early only by this point.

631
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:54,260
Okay. So, um, so we just spend a little time, we're not going to give like the full study introduction,

632
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:58,970
but just a little background on what our mock study is going to be for the semester.

633
01:01:59,810 --> 01:02:06,110
So I talked about pre-clinical testing and most of what I told you about kind of was developed

634
01:02:06,110 --> 01:02:13,550
traditionally for like small molecules or like traditional compounds to treat disease.

635
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:21,230
Vaccines are a little bit of a tourist or a little bit of a different ballgame because there are compounds that have an effect on the immune system.

636
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:30,200
And their dose responses are not necessarily a linear right, because you're stimulating or giving a signal to an immune cell.

637
01:02:30,710 --> 01:02:36,620
And that cell itself then has a proliferative response and sort of propagates the signal.

638
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:40,099
So like the dosing gets a little bit more complicated in the understanding,

639
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:45,200
the response gets a little more complicated, and from a toxicity standpoint,

640
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:49,970
it can be more complicated still because a small dose of this compound,

641
01:02:49,970 --> 01:02:58,540
if the adverse response is not necessarily as dose related, as with a traditional chemical compound that makes sense.

642
01:02:58,550 --> 01:03:02,330
So vaccine preclinical testing can be fraught with peril.

643
01:03:03,710 --> 01:03:10,970
Um, and then the other aspect where becomes difficult in most contexts, you're using a vaccine for prophylaxis, right?

644
01:03:10,970 --> 01:03:16,880
To prevent a disease. There are such things as therapeutic vaccines, mostly used in the context of cancer.

645
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:21,470
But for our purposes, we're going to be talking about traditional prophylactic vaccines.

646
01:03:22,190 --> 01:03:25,580
So these are drugs that you intend to administer to perfectly healthy people,

647
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:31,400
live their lives totally fine in order to protect them from a disease that they don't yet have and may never get.

648
01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:39,530
So it has a high standard rate for adverse effect compared to if I'm testing like a chemotherapeutic, right?

649
01:03:39,950 --> 01:03:44,540
Because a chemotherapeutic I'm giving something to someone who has a disease that's likely going to kill them.

650
01:03:44,540 --> 01:03:50,719
If I don't do something about it because of the nature of the disease, I might have to generate some toxicity,

651
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:56,090
but that is kind of acceptable as long as the ultimate effect is to protect the person.

652
01:03:56,090 --> 01:04:02,000
So a vaccine, I have a much lower tolerance for adverse effects because I'm giving it to a healthy person.

653
01:04:02,420 --> 01:04:10,580
Right. So the purpose of a vaccine is to stimulate an immune response that's similar to the response of actual infection,

654
01:04:11,390 --> 01:04:21,980
but ideally without the adverse effects of infection, or at least without the severity obviously of adverse infection, but it does not.

655
01:04:22,250 --> 01:04:25,910
And the outcome is really focused on disease.

656
01:04:26,090 --> 01:04:34,100
So the purpose of the vaccine is to protect against the severity of disease that you would get in an unvaccinated person exposed to the disease

657
01:04:34,730 --> 01:04:42,920
because of the nature of vaccines and just because of the nature biology of vaccine does not necessarily entirely protect against infection.

658
01:04:44,030 --> 01:04:48,200
So a perfect example is I'm sure everybody on the planet is older at this point.

659
01:04:48,650 --> 01:04:54,680
COVID vaccines, right? So COVID vaccines can be very protective against disease.

660
01:04:54,680 --> 01:05:02,719
So the epidemiology, the statistics show that vaccination is highly protective in most contexts against severe disease,

661
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:06,140
people who are hospitalized, people who have need to be in the ICU.

662
01:05:07,010 --> 01:05:11,030
But there are plenty of people who are vaccinated and still end up with can

663
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:16,550
show up as positive for infection and still may have mild symptoms from COVID.

664
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:26,210
And, you know, obviously, there is a lot of sociology aspects to that in terms of people's tolerance for the vaccine.

665
01:05:26,510 --> 01:05:31,400
But from a biologic standpoint, the purpose of a vaccine is not necessarily to fully protect against infectious.

666
01:05:31,670 --> 01:05:36,690
In fact, most vaccines don't fully protect against infection, even if you don't know it.

667
01:05:36,710 --> 01:05:39,590
They might protect against detectable infection,

668
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:48,050
but usually the virus has to get into the body and the cells have to encounter it to respond in the way the vaccine is intended.

669
01:05:48,620 --> 01:05:52,070
But in any case, the vaccine's purpose is to protect against severity of disease.

670
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:55,670
But because it's being administered to healthy people, again,

671
01:05:55,670 --> 01:06:01,430
you don't have a lot of tolerance for adverse effects like you might have in a different pharmaceutical compound.

672
01:06:03,140 --> 01:06:08,030
So how does it protect it? The purpose is to stimulate is specific.

673
01:06:08,270 --> 01:06:16,760
So specific for an antigen or for a protein structure from the infectious agent, stimulate a specific immune response.

674
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:25,070
And usually that has two aspects that relate to the two main arms of the adaptive or the acquired immune system.

675
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:33,110
So usually an immune response can consist of a B cell driven response, which is referred to as a humoral response,

676
01:06:33,110 --> 01:06:39,950
and usually essentially means are you forming antibodies against a relevant protein from the infectious agent?

677
01:06:40,550 --> 01:06:45,470
So immune response involves the humoral arm and it also involves a T cell arm.

678
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:54,110
So the T cells are kind of the directors or the generals of the immune system, and they're the ones that help direct inflammatory responses.

679
01:06:54,440 --> 01:07:00,350
So they help direct other white blood cells that are inflammatory cells to remove debris from infected cells.

680
01:07:00,710 --> 01:07:07,160
And they also, to some respect, drive or direct the B cell response to this crosstalk between these two arms.

681
01:07:08,210 --> 01:07:11,840
But the cellular aspect of the immune response is the t cell response.

682
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:17,870
And there's two different arms about it. And we'll talk a little bit more when we do our immune system crash course.

683
01:07:18,380 --> 01:07:23,480
When we refer to him in my response, we could be referring to either a humoral or a cellular one,

684
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:27,530
and ideally most vaccines generate some aspect of both.

685
01:07:28,310 --> 01:07:35,930
Okay. The preclinical and clinical assessment of vaccines have to demonstrate efficacy.

686
01:07:36,350 --> 01:07:43,790
So in humans, certainly you have to demonstrate that there's going to be benefit to giving it and also safety.

687
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:49,160
So the safety, as I said, is important because you don't want a vaccine to give to healthy people to cause adverse effects.

688
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:53,870
And efficacy is important because why give it and how can it be effective?

689
01:07:55,880 --> 01:08:00,350
A little history. So this is kind of interesting. I mean, some of the history you probably already know,

690
01:08:00,830 --> 01:08:06,020
but like sort of when you learn in high school or your high school biology, you learn in terms of vaccination.

691
01:08:06,890 --> 01:08:14,270
We talk about Edward Jenner, you know, right around 1800 used cowpox inoculation guys remember the cowpox story.

692
01:08:14,930 --> 01:08:22,790
So cowpox is a pox like lesion, raised ulcerated masses on the skin.

693
01:08:23,090 --> 01:08:29,389
It's a cup lesion that developed in milkmaids and they were catching essentially from cows.

694
01:08:29,390 --> 01:08:35,120
And what was noticed is that milkmaids really became severely infected with a different type of pox virus,

695
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:37,550
small pox that was highly prevalent at the time.

696
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:48,290
And so Edward Jenner used lesions from cowpox lesions from milkmaids hands to inoculate children against smallpox to be protected from smallpox.

697
01:08:48,860 --> 01:08:53,479
So that's what we learned. But sometimes we talk about a little bit less.

698
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:57,410
He was not the first to come up with this. As of all science, there's always things that went before.

699
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:05,149
So earlier this practice of inoculating cowpox lesions was actually took place in a variety

700
01:09:05,150 --> 01:09:10,160
of different areas in the U.K. So this is someone who strongly advocated for the practice,

701
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:18,680
who vaccinated his wife and sons when there was a smallpox outbreak in Britain using cowpox lesions and was able to protect his family that way.

702
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:26,420
But he was not the first either in the U.S. to remember Cotton Mather.

703
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:34,670
Mather was like a, I guess the intellectual of his day, kind of in the in the Northeast, in New England with the Puritans.

704
01:09:35,060 --> 01:09:37,940
Scott like wrote about a lot of different topics.

705
01:09:38,090 --> 01:09:44,510
But he also was famous because he was one of the people in the Salem witch trials in New England who like prosecuted witches.

706
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:50,660
So although he was scientifically literate for his day, he was not so literate that he wouldn't like burn people at the stake for witchcraft,

707
01:09:51,650 --> 01:09:58,730
but that he's the kind of a famous intellectual of the day and promoted the practice of preventative variolation.

708
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:06,800
So very elation is creating a pox like lesion with actual smallpox material.

709
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:10,340
So there was a smallpox outbreak in the Northeast at the time.

710
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:19,189
And if you took material from the legions of someone infected with smallpox and then on someone's arm or leg gave them a small inoculation with it,

711
01:10:19,190 --> 01:10:22,940
they would develop a very mild smallpox like lesion on their arm,

712
01:10:23,450 --> 01:10:27,950
but they wouldn't the virus wouldn't take hold and invade their body viscerally and kill them.

713
01:10:28,460 --> 01:10:31,280
So you're giving them a very mild case of the disease.

714
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:37,780
And the immune system recognizes this and develops cells that can protect them against more severe disease.

715
01:10:38,230 --> 01:10:45,700
That's what a vaccine is. But the interesting thing that I learned as I researched this class, he, too, didn't just come up with this out of the blue.

716
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,940
This practice had been going on for hundreds and hundreds of years.

717
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:55,540
And he actually learned about it from organisms who was a West African slave, as far as we know.

718
01:10:55,570 --> 01:10:59,469
I think he was I don't think they have a lot of history.

719
01:10:59,470 --> 01:11:08,920
But he was in the Northeast and told Cotton Mather of his practice because he had noticed that and that Smith had a smallpox like lesion or a scar,

720
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:21,790
rather, on his ankle. And he explained that in his in his homeland, basically, people would practice that regularly to prevent disease in populations.

721
01:11:22,030 --> 01:11:29,440
And there's actually evidence of having other similar practice in the Ottoman Empire in the 1500s and even earlier in China,

722
01:11:30,010 --> 01:11:35,770
which I think is really interesting. So even before we knew of the arms of the immune system,

723
01:11:36,190 --> 01:11:42,009
this idea or this practice that a small dose of a disease can trigger something in your

724
01:11:42,010 --> 01:11:46,930
body that is then going to be protected against later exposure to the same illness.

725
01:11:47,710 --> 01:11:49,090
So that was kind of interesting.

726
01:11:49,690 --> 01:11:57,220
And then the other interesting thing I learned, you know, we've all talked about COVID vaccine pro-vaccine anti-vax movement,

727
01:11:58,030 --> 01:12:04,419
just like in science with all this new again, this is actually an etching from around the turn of the century.

728
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:13,450
In the 1800s, there was an anti-vaccine movement when smallpox variolation came into play because the idea was twofold.

729
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:17,530
It's just bizarre to me how these things recur. It was twofold.

730
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:23,200
One is that you were taking something from a beast, from an animal,

731
01:12:23,230 --> 01:12:26,950
and there was a little bit of a religious overtone that humans and animals are very separate.

732
01:12:27,250 --> 01:12:32,710
So there was a religious objection to taking something from a beast and putting it on a person.

733
01:12:33,190 --> 01:12:44,649
And then there was kind of a classist, I guess, objection in that, because the practice came from what was considered sort of unlearning populations,

734
01:12:44,650 --> 01:12:50,260
because it was like, you know, Mather was talking about learning this from someone from West Africa.

735
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:55,750
There was a thought that you were anti-Christian or anti is like a religious movement

736
01:12:56,260 --> 01:13:02,410
where you were bringing in kind of primitive or non God driven practices into science.

737
01:13:02,860 --> 01:13:06,010
So this would actually show this weird towelette creature.

738
01:13:06,430 --> 01:13:09,520
These are the scientists who have devil horns. Hard to see there.

739
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:16,000
And this is babies. This was like a chain kind of anti-vaccine when they were vaccinating children.

740
01:13:16,030 --> 01:13:19,749
They're dumping the babies into the mouth of this. I don't know what that is.

741
01:13:19,750 --> 01:13:26,139
Account outcome data. And these are cowpox like lesions on it and would come out the other end would just being

742
01:13:26,140 --> 01:13:30,340
sort of collected and shoveled into this cart or babies with little horns on their heads.

743
01:13:30,940 --> 01:13:38,890
So they were trying to express the idea that these are practices that are anti-religious and people are trying to kind of poison your children.

744
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:43,170
So, so fascinating to me. But I don't know. Interesting.

745
01:13:43,990 --> 01:13:46,390
Okay. So vaccine considerations.

746
01:13:46,660 --> 01:13:53,590
So when you're looking at preclinical testing of a vaccine or deciding on a candidate that you're going to put forth as a vaccine candidate,

747
01:13:54,010 --> 01:13:58,480
there are a number of different things you need to consider, things like immunogenicity.

748
01:13:58,990 --> 01:14:02,830
So immunogenicity is the ability to engender an immune response.

749
01:14:03,010 --> 01:14:07,270
So can produce an antibody response. Can it produce a cellular immune response?

750
01:14:07,900 --> 01:14:14,830
And ideally, you want it to be strongly immunogenic. You want to have a titer of antibody above a certain level and have it be long lasting.

751
01:14:15,610 --> 01:14:20,240
So that's just immunogenicity. That doesn't really say anything about whether it'll protect against disease.

752
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:25,810
So obviously another concern is efficacy. Does it prevent infection or ameliorate disease?

753
01:14:26,290 --> 01:14:29,830
And then finally, also safety, because again, this is to healthy people.

754
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:34,360
So we don't have wanted to have any adverse effects do just to vaccination.

755
01:14:35,350 --> 01:14:39,640
There are also a number of practical concerns related to scalability and cost.

756
01:14:40,210 --> 01:14:44,170
So you can have a great vaccine, but if it's stability and the environment is not high,

757
01:14:44,170 --> 01:14:48,010
you're going to have a problem distribution wise, giving that to a large number of people.

758
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:51,880
So we saw that to some degree with the M RNA vaccines for COVID,

759
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:58,990
they have a higher requirement or have a need to be kept colder than a traditional vaccine, and that can limit the distribution capacity.

760
01:14:59,740 --> 01:15:08,830
You also need to consider you might have a very effective vaccine for a particular antigen, but if the virus in the in the wild, so to speak,

761
01:15:09,010 --> 01:15:16,240
has a high mutation rate and mutates that particular antigen, then your vaccine becomes worthless or at least less of less value.

762
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:24,190
So you need to think about what is the target of your vaccine and how frequently does this virus in nature change that epitope,

763
01:15:24,190 --> 01:15:31,240
or how frequently does it undergo mutation and also among the different strains of the virus that.

764
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:40,959
Are extant. Are there certain epitopes that primarily drive disease, or is it a wide variety of epitopes that can drive disease?

765
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:45,580
Because that might affect how complex an antigenic mixture you need in your vaccine.

766
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:52,150
They need to select things that are likely to stay relatively conserved but still have a strong effect on preventing disease.

767
01:15:52,570 --> 01:15:56,500
So there's a lot of kind of production related aspects to vaccine development.

768
01:15:57,850 --> 01:16:01,390
So what are some obstacles? From the animal testing standpoint?

769
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:05,740
I told you, you have to identify whether it's immunogenic and whether it's effective.

770
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:10,959
And that can be kind of difficult because in an animal, what you're looking for,

771
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:16,210
what are the correlates or what are the biomarkers of immunity that I can use to make that assessment?

772
01:16:17,110 --> 01:16:20,400
So certainly you can do a challenge study.

773
01:16:20,420 --> 01:16:26,110
You can look at response to natural infection. Well, that wouldn't be natural infection.

774
01:16:26,110 --> 01:16:31,239
That's a challenge study. But you can look at the natural response to someone who gets infected by the virus

775
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:36,550
and try to figure out what aspect of the immune response is most protective.

776
01:16:37,390 --> 01:16:44,290
So maybe under certain conditions, there are viruses where an antibody response is better protective against acquiring disease.

777
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:50,050
There are other viruses where you need to have a strong cellular immune response to clear the virus from your body.

778
01:16:50,500 --> 01:17:00,780
So that might push you one way or the other. Deciding between vaccines that do one aspect of better or worse are the things that you can measure.

779
01:17:00,790 --> 01:17:05,830
Antibody levels are the easiest things to measure because it can easily measure antibody levels in serum.

780
01:17:06,910 --> 01:17:14,140
But remember, you can give a vaccine, you can generate an antibody response, and all that reflects is immunogenicity, not efficacy.

781
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:23,830
And it only looks at one part of the immune response. Immunogenicity usually caveat again, usually correlates with efficacy.

782
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:29,080
So at least in the animal studies, it's often accepted as a proxy of efficacy.

783
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:38,200
And in certain circumstances, like if you're if you are in the face of a pandemic and you have expedited review of an application,

784
01:17:38,950 --> 01:17:42,480
immunogenicity can sometimes be accepted as a proxy for efficacy,

785
01:17:42,490 --> 01:17:50,229
even in human studies challenge studies where you have a human that's vaccinated and you actually infect them with the virus in humans,

786
01:17:50,230 --> 01:17:54,880
for obvious reasons, are rarely done for safety reasons and for ethics.

787
01:17:56,170 --> 01:18:01,330
But historically there have been challenge studies for certain vaccine strategies done in humans.

788
01:18:01,810 --> 01:18:10,840
So over yellow fever, for example, fairly famously, the AMI yellow fever was a huge problem for the AMI for people going to South America,

789
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:13,930
and they actually did when they were developing yellow fever vaccines,

790
01:18:14,260 --> 01:18:20,500
use military to recruit volunteers to do human challenge studies to test the yellow fever vaccine.

791
01:18:20,770 --> 01:18:23,860
So there are historical instances of challenge studies done in humans.

792
01:18:24,340 --> 01:18:30,440
When this is done, this is usually done in the context of highly prevalent infections and usually,

793
01:18:30,580 --> 01:18:33,790
always, but usually in populations that are at high risk.

794
01:18:33,940 --> 01:18:42,250
So like kind of the cost benefit ratio, those are populations likely to be infected anyway and potential high benefit.

795
01:18:43,990 --> 01:18:49,360
These are the relevant regulatory guidelines for the non-clinical testing of vaccines.

796
01:18:49,450 --> 01:18:55,060
So there's an international one, which is the World Health Organization has two guidance documents that explain what

797
01:18:55,090 --> 01:18:59,140
types of information are necessary from animal studies before you go into humans.

798
01:18:59,770 --> 01:19:05,379
And then Ceiba Our Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the FDA is the

799
01:19:05,380 --> 01:19:09,730
section of the FDA that's in charge of looking at vaccine or vaccine approval.

800
01:19:11,860 --> 01:19:15,070
This is the kind of standard vaccine development pipeline.

801
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:19,089
So the traditional vaccine development is just like any other pharmaceutical.

802
01:19:19,090 --> 01:19:25,450
You have an early non-clinical research or animal research phase and you have your clinical trials and then post-approval monitoring.

803
01:19:25,990 --> 01:19:28,840
But that's pretty long and that can take 10 to 15 years.

804
01:19:29,230 --> 01:19:36,490
So that was our world before 2020, you know, before the FDA had a mechanism for expedited review.

805
01:19:36,490 --> 01:19:40,030
But this is what it kind of looks like. This is what happened on a run on that side.

806
01:19:40,570 --> 01:19:42,100
Well, try understand it from your viewpoint.

807
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:48,370
This is what happened with COVID vaccine development, which is an example of their accelerated review process.

808
01:19:48,970 --> 01:19:56,860
Essentially, a lot of these things happened at the same time. So phase one, human clinical trials are safety studies.

809
01:19:56,860 --> 01:20:00,939
They're done for humans. They're done with a really small dose and a very limited number of people.

810
01:20:00,940 --> 01:20:07,390
Their only purpose is to look at safety. So they're not like exposing your cover and everything in that context.

811
01:20:07,930 --> 01:20:11,410
But basically there was early safety testing in animals.

812
01:20:11,650 --> 01:20:18,130
So when people say that the COVID vaccine was not tested in animals, that's not really entirely true.

813
01:20:18,820 --> 01:20:24,160
A vaccine that goes through expedited review still has to have safety testing done in animals.

814
01:20:24,460 --> 01:20:31,050
It's just the timeline has changed. So there was early safety testing done in animals and sort of overall.

815
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:34,779
I think the end stage of the safety testing, like the non rodent studies,

816
01:20:34,780 --> 01:20:42,849
there were early phase one safety only clinical trials done, everything else was expedited and it's kind of miraculous in a way.

817
01:20:42,850 --> 01:20:50,350
This reduced the vaccine development timeline in this instance to slightly less than a year, which is pretty amazing, actually.

818
01:20:51,370 --> 01:20:56,769
So that's an example of accelerated development, which that's our most recent and certainly most famous example.

819
01:20:56,770 --> 01:21:00,250
But there are other contexts where accelerated development schedules are used.

820
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:06,100
This is just kind of a list of some of the expedited approval pathways from the FDA.

821
01:21:06,490 --> 01:21:09,129
I'm not going to go into the difference between these,

822
01:21:09,130 --> 01:21:19,180
but essentially these are all expedited approval pathways intended to approve faster drugs that meet an unmet indication or improve treatment,

823
01:21:19,780 --> 01:21:23,919
and then before approval is fully granted,

824
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:30,220
if there is sufficient for widespread commercial use, if there is sufficient data that a compound is safe,

825
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:39,970
you can have emergency use authorization before the product is fully licensed so that it can be utilized in the face of a public health emergency.

826
01:21:40,390 --> 01:21:42,820
And in its initial use, obviously, as you know,

827
01:21:42,820 --> 01:21:49,780
the COVID vaccine was being used through this emergency use authorization and since it has undergone full approval.

828
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:54,999
Another aspect for vaccines is that sometimes for vaccines,

829
01:21:55,000 --> 01:22:04,420
because we're using this usually to protect against viral infection, um, human efficacy trials may be unsafe or unethical.

830
01:22:04,430 --> 01:22:13,209
So think like Ebola vaccine, you know, you can't really it can be unfeasible to go into the setting of an Ebola outbreak and get

831
01:22:13,210 --> 01:22:18,670
standardized data for efficacy unless you have reduced dosing a large number of people.

832
01:22:18,670 --> 01:22:20,740
And obviously challenge studies would be unethical.

833
01:22:21,310 --> 01:22:28,900
So FDA has a special ruling called the app shorthand called the Animal Rule in some instances for these severe infections.

834
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:35,410
You can have approval like marketing approval of a drug based solely on efficacy data in animals.

835
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:41,640
So usually you have to prove safety and animal safety in humans and then you have to show efficacy in humans, right?

836
01:22:41,650 --> 01:22:48,309
Like if you're making a drug for like arthritis or something with the FDA animal rule for certain conditions,

837
01:22:48,310 --> 01:22:52,090
you can approve the drug based solely on efficacy data in animals.

838
01:22:52,660 --> 01:22:55,750
It doesn't mean that it's not tested for safety.

839
01:22:55,750 --> 01:23:01,960
It still has to be screened for toxicity. But the efficacy data doesn't come until after approval.

840
01:23:02,620 --> 01:23:05,980
Okay, so that's if you hear people talking about the animal rule, that's what they're referring to.

841
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:15,350
This is just talking about expedited review. They're now coming out a number of different books about these are not retroactive books,

842
01:23:15,430 --> 01:23:19,390
but these are more a kind of the personal story of the development of vaccines.

843
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:25,870
If you're interested in that whole development timeline or the development pressures in that expedited schedule,

844
01:23:26,650 --> 01:23:30,700
these are kind of interesting because that was like a whole new world. I actually just got one on the right.

845
01:23:30,710 --> 01:23:31,450
I haven't read it yet,

846
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:38,280
but these are some articles that kind of give you a real world view of what that was like developing a vaccine in the face of a pandemic.

847
01:23:38,290 --> 01:23:39,310
So kind of interesting.

848
01:23:41,150 --> 01:23:47,990
I said that human infection models for efficacy are rarely done, but there have been cases where challenge studies have been done in humans.

849
01:23:47,990 --> 01:23:54,920
And as a matter of fact, a COVID 19 human challenge study just came out in 2022.

850
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:57,349
This was being discussed back in 2020,

851
01:23:57,350 --> 01:24:05,900
and this study actually was done in the U.K. So these were 36 healthy human volunteers who volunteered to have actual COVID,

852
01:24:06,170 --> 01:24:10,520
actual live COVID arm placed in their nostril and become infected.

853
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:17,000
And this was to a stat this is interesting because this wasn't actually a vaccine study.

854
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:22,310
This was to establish not the animal model, but the human model of COVID infection.

855
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:28,370
So they infected these persons of the people that they gave, whatever the dose was, which was a very small dose,

856
01:24:28,790 --> 01:24:34,610
53% of them became infected, meaning that the virus could subsequently be detected by PCR.

857
01:24:35,060 --> 01:24:42,530
And this just shows their peak viral load in both the nose and the throat when they were symptomatic and what the long term outcome was.

858
01:24:43,070 --> 01:24:48,620
So I thought that was very interesting. And the intent of this study was to kind of establish the dynamics of that early

859
01:24:48,620 --> 01:24:53,419
stage of COVID infection so that if later they want to test vaccine candidates,

860
01:24:53,420 --> 01:24:56,480
they have a better, more reliable human model of doing so.

861
01:24:57,740 --> 01:25:06,740
So there you go. Human infection trials for animal models, for vaccine efficacy trials, this can be problematic.

862
01:25:07,130 --> 01:25:13,040
It's actually rare to have the perfect animal model. Some would say you never have a perfect animal model.

863
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:20,750
And usually what you find is that some aspects of the animal immune response to a virus resemble the human response, and some do not.

864
01:25:21,350 --> 01:25:27,290
So maybe you'll get a strong antibody titer. But cellular immunity response varies from species to species.

865
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:33,320
It's important to bear in mind, though, that even one human is not a perfect model for another human.

866
01:25:33,650 --> 01:25:39,740
Again, look at Kobe. You have some people, unvaccinated people who got infected, mild symptoms, hardly knew they were infected.

867
01:25:39,740 --> 01:25:43,970
Other people, perfectly healthy, no known effects and ended up dying.

868
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:48,560
So even one human is not necessarily a perfect model from a disease standpoint.

869
01:25:48,830 --> 01:25:53,930
And there's a lot we still don't know about what governs what the effect is on one person versus another.

870
01:25:55,070 --> 01:26:01,070
And along those lines, the correlate of natural immunity is an antibody response that's most important.

871
01:26:01,070 --> 01:26:05,180
Is it cell mediated response that's most important? Is it some weird combo of both?

872
01:26:05,750 --> 01:26:11,540
That's not usually well understood. So that actually makes it hard to identify what is the most appropriate animal model.

873
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:17,570
Further, a lot of agents are species specific for infection or disease.

874
01:26:17,780 --> 01:26:29,060
So mice, for example, just regular off the shelf mice that they don't have or their equivalent receptor is not susceptible to COVID infection.

875
01:26:29,510 --> 01:26:34,100
So initially, mice were not really susceptible to COVID infection.

876
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:40,610
And could it be used as an animal model? Since then, we have transgenic mice that have expressed the human ace2 receptor.

877
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:42,560
So we can use those as animal models.

878
01:26:43,070 --> 01:26:49,070
But there are species that have their differences like that because of receptors or other aspects of disease are not really equivalent.

879
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:54,680
Sometimes they just aren't as susceptible no matter what you do and you have to use a

880
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:59,480
modified viral agent or the animal equivalent virus when you're testing a vaccine.

881
01:27:00,170 --> 01:27:03,710
So a good example of that is the papillomavirus vaccine,

882
01:27:04,220 --> 01:27:11,090
because now the papillomavirus vaccine that's given to adolescents now that protects against human papillomavirus infection,

883
01:27:11,450 --> 01:27:17,450
which is the main cause of cervical cancer in humans. Papilloma papillomavirus is super, super species specific,

884
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:23,880
so almost every species has its papillomavirus equivalent, but they don't work well in animal models.

885
01:27:23,890 --> 01:27:31,070
So some of that early preclinical testing was done in primates because primates, macaques in particular have a purple.

886
01:27:31,070 --> 01:27:36,440
A naturally occurring papillomavirus that has the same effect, causes chronic inflammation in the cervix,

887
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:39,830
and in some percentage of cases it leads to cervical carcinoma.

888
01:27:40,130 --> 01:27:44,420
So some of the pre-clinical testing for papillomavirus vaccine was done with sort of a modified

889
01:27:44,420 --> 01:27:50,150
version of the vaccine against epitope safe platform and everything but against epitopes in primates.

890
01:27:51,470 --> 01:27:54,620
And then finally. Oh, go ahead. I was just going to ask, like for earlier,

891
01:27:54,630 --> 01:28:00,050
like into an individual like very like best practices for like graded versus

892
01:28:00,050 --> 01:28:06,680
like kind of dose response curve in animal over just like human extrapolations.

893
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:16,580
I mean, I think in an experimental thing, are you talking like now like in terms of effective dose for vaccine or just.

894
01:28:16,910 --> 01:28:20,020
Yeah, just like population variability. Just like. Yeah, I mean,

895
01:28:21,710 --> 01:28:32,420
I think probably if you're looking at trying to establish the relationship between virus exposure and but I think there's going to be a of answer.

896
01:28:32,420 --> 01:28:36,229
But I think it's not just the dose question.

897
01:28:36,230 --> 01:28:39,530
It's also there's such a large biologic question.

898
01:28:39,610 --> 01:28:46,570
On the other side that you can give the same dose and still have a widely different biologic response.

899
01:28:46,990 --> 01:28:54,670
And most of the actual sort of real world efficacy trials done in vaccine sense aren't looking at that level of specificity.

900
01:28:55,180 --> 01:28:58,210
So they're really just looking kind of a numbers game on average.

901
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:08,380
You know, what the percent effectiveness is for a pretty crude measure of disease, like hospitalizations or something like that.

902
01:29:08,410 --> 01:29:15,410
I think if I understand your question, your question correctly, you're getting at a much finer estimation of dose relationship.

903
01:29:15,510 --> 01:29:23,740
Yeah. Yeah, I think that's probably done more experimentally for people who are, you know, looking at the mathematical aspects of dose response.

904
01:29:24,130 --> 01:29:31,960
But it probably is I don't have knowledge of the field. That's probably pretty messy because of the large biologic component to that.

905
01:29:32,350 --> 01:29:40,360
And because, like vaccines, their dose response curves just are very strange because it has to do with how well your

906
01:29:40,360 --> 01:29:45,970
T cells and B cells proliferate and the the pool of memory cells that you're left with.

907
01:29:46,210 --> 01:29:49,360
Mm hmm. So probably someone's mathematical model that in some way,

908
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:59,739
I'm just not sure how precisely and how completely that's able to explain the inter individual variation of extremely convoluted answer.

909
01:29:59,740 --> 01:30:03,620
And I don't know.

910
01:30:06,220 --> 01:30:11,170
The other aspect of vaccine studies in animals is that usually when you're doing safety studies like that,

911
01:30:11,170 --> 01:30:15,910
it's best able to detect pretty direct adverse effects in the short term.

912
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:21,040
And if there's a lot this is true even for traditional pharmaceuticals, the longer term effects.

913
01:30:21,490 --> 01:30:27,640
Our animal studies are a little bit less. Even if you're doing these long carcinogenicity studies, a little bit less able to direct them,

914
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:35,049
to detect those and to detect subtle things like I mean, most trends don't have not subtle things.

915
01:30:35,050 --> 01:30:39,610
Like maybe there's an epigenetic effect that increases your risk of something downstream.

916
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:47,190
But there's a lot of biology between those two endpoints. And our traditional tox testing is not that great at detecting endpoints like that.

917
01:30:47,240 --> 01:30:56,410
So that's a shortcoming of in vivo toxicology. In terms of vaccines, there's a lot of different types of vaccines you can have at its most crude.

918
01:30:56,410 --> 01:31:02,469
A lot of veterinary vaccines are basically using a live pathogen that's been attenuated in some way.

919
01:31:02,470 --> 01:31:07,480
So maybe it's passage through mice to decrease the severity of disease that causes,

920
01:31:08,020 --> 01:31:12,760
or maybe it's been modified in some way that's not as disease causing, but it's a live vaccine.

921
01:31:13,390 --> 01:31:19,660
So the advantage of that is it tends to have kind of the naturally occurring epitopes that stimulate immunity,

922
01:31:20,350 --> 01:31:25,600
but potentially you can have a replication competent if it's inadequately attenuated.

923
01:31:25,870 --> 01:31:30,130
So you could get more severe disease or you can have a mutation to form.

924
01:31:31,300 --> 01:31:36,610
You can have pathogens that are killed or inactivated, which retains some of the natural immunogenicity.

925
01:31:37,030 --> 01:31:42,040
But because they're killed, sometimes these don't stimulate as robust an immune response.

926
01:31:42,370 --> 01:31:47,560
So sometimes those need to be used with a strong adjuvant, like a helper to stimulate an immune response.

927
01:31:47,950 --> 01:31:51,010
And you can have variations in immunity in that way.

928
01:31:52,090 --> 01:31:58,630
And then probably one of the more common types of of traditional vaccines that use today is rather than using a whole organism,

929
01:31:59,260 --> 01:32:02,860
you sort of identify which are the most immunogenic aspects of the organism.

930
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:07,480
So what proteins are most immunogenic, either one protein or a combination of proteins,

931
01:32:07,900 --> 01:32:12,610
and you make a vaccine based on a recombinant or purified protein version of that vaccine.

932
01:32:13,180 --> 01:32:16,930
So you're removing the potential for that vaccine to revert to virulence.

933
01:32:17,950 --> 01:32:25,360
And so in some respects, you are making it a little bit safer, but again, it's dependent on the immunogenicity of the antigen that you choose.

934
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:29,530
And then this was from an STP seminar back in 2020.

935
01:32:29,530 --> 01:32:35,740
At the time, there were no approved nucleic acid or and RNA based vaccines for human use.

936
01:32:36,280 --> 01:32:42,070
Look at that technology in action. Now, we have, of course, our COVID vaccines, which utilize an RNA platform,

937
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:47,170
at least for the Pfizer vaccine, is delivered in a nanoparticle, a lipid nanoparticle vehicle.

938
01:32:48,250 --> 01:32:54,129
So now we have DNA and RNA based vaccines that are a little bit interesting.

939
01:32:54,130 --> 01:32:58,800
And for the RNA vaccines, they utilize some of the cell's own machinery to generate the proteins.

940
01:32:58,810 --> 01:33:04,480
But there is a whole new platform. There were some veterinary vaccines, actually, the West Nile virus for ducks,

941
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:08,860
for horses and birds was a DNA based vaccine that was approved prior to that.

942
01:33:09,790 --> 01:33:14,620
So probably definitely accelerated our acceptance of new viral vaccine platforms.

943
01:33:15,670 --> 01:33:21,910
So those are the viral are for the antigen component. As I said, some vaccines need to be given with an adjuvant.

944
01:33:22,120 --> 01:33:27,910
The purpose of an adjuvant is to enhance or modulate the immune response to a vaccine antigen,

945
01:33:28,690 --> 01:33:33,550
and this can increase its effectiveness or stabilize the vaccine preparation.

946
01:33:34,990 --> 01:33:39,280
Usually adjuvants or often adjuvants are something that stimulates a local.

947
01:33:39,370 --> 01:33:40,630
Inflammatory response.

948
01:33:41,020 --> 01:33:46,780
So sometimes that can be adverse in the sense you'll get a little more redness or a little bit more irritation at the site of vaccination.

949
01:33:47,140 --> 01:33:54,040
But the good part of that is what's happening is innate immune cells are being recruited to macrophages and to drink cells.

950
01:33:54,640 --> 01:33:56,890
Those are the cells are the sentinels of the body.

951
01:33:57,400 --> 01:34:02,800
So you put something irritating in there and then the innate immune system goes, Oh my God, I got to clean up this mess.

952
01:34:03,580 --> 01:34:05,180
But here is the virus antigen.

953
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:12,750
Those antigen presenting cells are going to grab bits of the antigen that you want to form an immune response against and traffic it to the local one.

954
01:34:13,540 --> 01:34:17,180
So it increases the number of sentinel cells that are local in the area.

955
01:34:17,320 --> 01:34:20,590
So that's there's still a lot of uncertainty about how adjuvants work,

956
01:34:20,590 --> 01:34:28,360
but that's one of the main mechanisms are believed to be intact in terms of testing the knowledge of the knowledge about the novel.

957
01:34:28,360 --> 01:34:32,049
And that has a if it's a novel adjuvant never used before,

958
01:34:32,050 --> 01:34:37,540
you're going to have a pretty high regulatory burden and you may need to assess the adjuvant separately for toxicity.

959
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:41,830
If it's an adjuvant that's used before, you don't need to have a separate study.

960
01:34:42,310 --> 01:34:45,610
But the entire test article is the vaccine plus the adjuvant.

961
01:34:45,620 --> 01:34:48,640
So this is what you're testing in the safety preparation.

962
01:34:49,060 --> 01:34:52,719
And in our mock study, we're going to be testing a vaccine plus an adjuvant.

963
01:34:52,720 --> 01:34:57,160
So we'll describe what that is. There are a lot of different adjuvants used.

964
01:34:57,160 --> 01:35:01,780
As I said, very often there's something that's slightly irritating. So you're trying to recruit inflammatory cells.

965
01:35:02,230 --> 01:35:08,090
One really common one used traditionally is alum or aluminum that's used in a lot of vaccines.

966
01:35:08,110 --> 01:35:16,180
Again, there's still a fair amount of hand-waving as but one of the thoughts is that it induces a local inflammatory response.

967
01:35:17,890 --> 01:35:21,010
And that's why let's finish up our immune response. Overview.

968
01:35:21,160 --> 01:35:25,590
Again, reminding you that the goal of vaccination is to generate immunogenicity.

969
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:30,250
So immunogenicity is just the immune response says nothing about efficacy.

970
01:35:30,730 --> 01:35:33,980
And so that involves generating an antibody response.

971
01:35:34,750 --> 01:35:40,510
And in order for the antibody response to be effective, it has to be a neutralizing antibody response.

972
01:35:40,780 --> 01:35:45,970
So it has to be something that can inactivate the biologic power of a viral epitope.

973
01:35:46,810 --> 01:35:48,100
And then you also want cells.

974
01:35:48,100 --> 01:35:55,210
They're going to stick around so that if you get exposed to that agent later in terms of a natural infection, it's going to do the same thing.

975
01:35:55,750 --> 01:36:01,030
So you want to generate a long lasting and strong memory, B cell and T cell response.

976
01:36:01,960 --> 01:36:07,210
Okay. So don't worry. If you haven't had immunology, if you have an allergy, you're like, yeah, I mean,

977
01:36:07,570 --> 01:36:10,540
if you haven't had it, you're probably like a deer in the headlights right now.

978
01:36:10,550 --> 01:36:14,800
But we're going to go over this in closer detail later in our immune crash course.

979
01:36:16,420 --> 01:36:21,190
Okay. So that's your regulatory overview of vaccine studies.

980
01:36:21,490 --> 01:36:29,130
Do the immunology a bit later. This is our challenge in this course to design, conduct, interpret and report a mask.

981
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:38,280
It's just pretend. We're not actually doing this as a mark in vivo study to address a specific defined objective and the objective.

982
01:36:38,290 --> 01:36:42,610
This has changed different sessions of the course, but this one seems relevant.

983
01:36:43,180 --> 01:36:47,950
So this semester, applying to run a mock early preclinical vaccine study.

984
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:54,790
And early in our setting, we're going to pretend, like I said, that we're the Discovery Group, say, in a zero or something.

985
01:36:55,180 --> 01:37:02,050
So we're going to look at the early stages of development where we're still trying to pick a good candidate for use as a vaccine.

986
01:37:03,010 --> 01:37:05,649
So we're going to run this early phase.

987
01:37:05,650 --> 01:37:12,160
Studies are less regulatory constrained, so it's not like we're going to look up, you know, what are the FDA requirements, the obesity requirements?

988
01:37:12,460 --> 01:37:13,600
We're trying to answer a question.

989
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:21,940
I mean, so the question is, is this vaccine candidate effective and is it safe as far as we can look at it in the context of our animal study?

990
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:26,950
So we're going to design one study that assesses efficacy. That's our primary objective.

991
01:37:27,400 --> 01:37:34,240
Does it protect our animal model from virus challenge? And we're also going to put in some endpoints that assess toxicity.

992
01:37:34,240 --> 01:37:38,140
So for adverse effects. So this is a little bit of a combo study.

993
01:37:38,440 --> 01:37:39,940
You can get into trouble doing this.

994
01:37:39,940 --> 01:37:46,480
Many, many, many people on this campus, like some of the studies we read for investigators, are weird efficacy toxicity combos.

995
01:37:47,350 --> 01:37:48,280
I would tell people,

996
01:37:48,280 --> 01:37:54,700
identify your main objective because the more end points you throw in there and the more you try to make your study answer 50 million questions,

997
01:37:55,720 --> 01:37:58,120
your study design starts to become compromised.

998
01:37:58,180 --> 01:38:03,160
You want to make sure that you limit your objectives enough so that you at least answer the most important one.

999
01:38:03,610 --> 01:38:06,610
But that said, we're going to do efficacy and toxicity.

1000
01:38:07,510 --> 01:38:10,810
So in the next few weeks we're going to talk about designing the study protocol.

1001
01:38:10,840 --> 01:38:14,739
So if we were really doing this, we'd having a meeting right now, we'd be kind of coming up with ideas.

1002
01:38:14,740 --> 01:38:19,600
Which animal model are we going to use? What are the different dose groups we have to have?

1003
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:21,490
Right. We're obviously going to have a vaccine group.

1004
01:38:21,970 --> 01:38:26,470
What are the other dose groups that we have to have in order to answer our main question, which is efficacy?

1005
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:30,070
What's the studying length? What's the structure going to look like?

1006
01:38:30,230 --> 01:38:34,780
Are we going to get any interim data or are we just going to wait till the end and euthanize the animals and collect data?

1007
01:38:34,780 --> 01:38:39,040
Then how are we going to assess efficacy? How are we going to assess toxicity?

1008
01:38:41,050 --> 01:38:43,870
Are there regulatory aspects we should consider?

1009
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:51,940
And this is not going to be so much from the regulatory talk standpoint, but we're at a university campus.

1010
01:38:52,210 --> 01:38:54,670
We're using warm blooded vertebrate animals.

1011
01:38:54,670 --> 01:39:00,879
So there are regulatory welfare aspects that we need to consider and we need to build into the design of our study.

1012
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:06,130
So we'll talk more about that next week and then how are we going to address unanticipated complications

1013
01:39:06,130 --> 01:39:11,920
or what are some variables that might derail our study or cause some background complications?

1014
01:39:12,520 --> 01:39:20,319
So talk about that next few groups. So this is where we are here we are in the exploratory phase and we'll talk about this next week.

1015
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:24,820
But this would be a study that's run under a non GOP setting.

1016
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:30,250
Guys have heard who's not who's heard of GOP party, GOP right.

1017
01:39:30,250 --> 01:39:33,730
Good laboratory practices. So we'll talk about that next time.

1018
01:39:34,030 --> 01:39:37,299
Usually people say good laboratory practices. Of course, I'm a great scientist.

1019
01:39:37,300 --> 01:39:38,860
I always use good laboratory practices.

1020
01:39:39,310 --> 01:39:46,420
But GOP with the capital GOP has a very specific regulatory meeting and in academia essentially all our studies

1021
01:39:46,420 --> 01:39:54,819
are run non GAAP will talk about the means and at the end of our little our first discussions sessions,

1022
01:39:54,820 --> 01:39:59,560
we talk about study protocols. We're going to come up with a written plan, which is our study protocol.

1023
01:40:00,280 --> 01:40:02,500
So the term protocol can mean different things.

1024
01:40:03,700 --> 01:40:09,700
When you're running a talk study, at minimum, you should have a written plan that states your objective Why am I doing this?

1025
01:40:10,510 --> 01:40:15,159
What is the design and methods? Do you got a plan it out? Just decide on all the things we talked about.

1026
01:40:15,160 --> 01:40:18,940
What are our endpoints? This seems very self-evident.

1027
01:40:19,060 --> 01:40:28,060
I cannot tell you how many times there is no real written plan behind some of the studies that we get submitted to us and our path core.

1028
01:40:28,090 --> 01:40:29,620
Like a general idea.

1029
01:40:30,580 --> 01:40:38,530
I want to assess this, but you really have to think this through and specify what you're going to do to kind of have the most effective,

1030
01:40:38,530 --> 01:40:43,180
reproducible science. So we're going to talk about study protocols as a master plan.

1031
01:40:44,140 --> 01:40:49,930
Also at a university, you'll hear people talk about an animal protocol that's a regulatory document.

1032
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:53,800
The Iacocca, which is the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee,

1033
01:40:54,130 --> 01:41:02,110
requires you to write a protocol for regulatory approval for the animal welfare concerns that has aspects of the protocol.

1034
01:41:02,380 --> 01:41:08,620
But the purpose of that document is so that the IOP committee can assess what are the welfare concerns and how will you address them.

1035
01:41:09,250 --> 01:41:13,900
The purpose of your in-house study protocols to tell yourself and your technicians what you're going to do.

1036
01:41:14,410 --> 01:41:19,750
Okay, so protocol must always be clear on what you're talking about. This is our timeline.

1037
01:41:19,750 --> 01:41:23,049
We did intro to and we will talk today. Next week.

1038
01:41:23,050 --> 01:41:28,900
We'll talk a little bit more about GAAP stuff and some welfare things, like we'll know what the input is going to need to know from us.

1039
01:41:29,620 --> 01:41:36,490
Then we're going to have our crash course in writing and then we'll do a couple of sessions, two sessions that are study design protocol discussions.

1040
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:41,800
So we'll give you some more questions to let up on that. And then, of course, these are our onsite labs.

1041
01:41:42,310 --> 01:41:47,080
So there's nothing specific you need to do this week for homework for this class, even if stuff going on,

1042
01:41:48,070 --> 01:41:54,610
except look at those two dates, look at your lab group and let me know if your assigned date is not going to work for you.

1043
01:41:55,120 --> 01:41:59,439
Okay. And I know you guys have got a logistic constraint,

1044
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:04,390
so if there's one day that works better for you than the other in terms of your other classes about it, let me know.

1045
01:42:05,260 --> 01:42:07,000
Um, yeah. So there's not.

1046
01:42:07,300 --> 01:42:15,520
And does anyone have any questions about the structure of the class talked about how do you get to where you need to go and you think about nature.

1047
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:21,460
All right. Look at that. All right. Thank you, guys, for attention.

1048
01:42:21,470 --> 01:42:27,320
I know it's a really, really warm day, but we have a three day weekend, so I hope everyone has a good weekend.

1049
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:33,950
So no homework assignments for this class. The other one, it's just your online quiz, remember?

1050
01:42:38,020 --> 01:42:41,740
Oh, I have to talk. What is?

1051
01:42:44,470 --> 01:42:52,090
And yeah, I mean, I guess the problem is that this is a 90 minutes turnaround.

1052
01:42:52,330 --> 01:42:55,780
Yeah, I really.

1053
01:42:57,260 --> 01:43:00,280
I wouldn't be surprised at all. Or is it. Yeah.

1054
01:43:03,010 --> 01:43:06,100
Oh, like for that. Yeah, for that. Yeah, we could.

1055
01:43:06,790 --> 01:43:11,470
We could start.

1056
01:43:11,490 --> 01:43:16,420
My memories are kind of crazy right now, but was your research like?

1057
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:20,770
Primarily. This is what I'm working at right now.

1058
01:43:20,950 --> 01:43:30,600
That's why we're here. Yeah, it was just kind of just for right now until we get home, so we kind of.

1059
01:43:30,610 --> 01:43:33,690
I was on a cell phone. Cardiovascular. Okay.

1060
01:43:33,740 --> 01:43:37,420
Right. So is it serious?

1061
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:43,810
Yeah, actually, I mean, I think I want to say, like like there is a lot of.

1062
01:43:44,120 --> 01:44:00,540
Yeah, I agree. I guess. Yeah, we are in the early on and I was going to say I to start as a survivor but I'm not sure.

1063
01:44:00,550 --> 01:44:09,760
Yeah, I'm still trying to find out. It's like oh probably yeah I a call because we just recently figured out that what

1064
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:13,540
we were doing was just not going to be biologically relevant and just be here.

1065
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:20,559
I was. Yeah. I just have to understand, like, PFOA is not going away.

1066
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:20,930
Does not?

1067
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:32,319
I mean, that's what we have to actually we are using derive mammary gland cells from this and so like I did like a normal RNA like high throughput,

1068
01:44:32,320 --> 01:44:35,560
like sequencing, like that analysis. They couldn't find anything.

1069
01:44:35,660 --> 01:44:42,300
Yeah, it's like, what, 14 significant genes from one of those $10 or six 0 seconds?

1070
01:44:42,920 --> 01:44:43,240
Yeah,

1071
01:44:43,480 --> 01:44:56,200
I honestly think it's just because people prefer just like like cells that secrete things and memory cells and cardiomyocytes don't secrete much,

1072
01:44:56,200 --> 01:45:04,300
but it does immune cells. I don't know if it's hormones or.

1073
01:45:04,640 --> 01:45:10,130
Right. Yeah. Yeah. Many and, and the current stuff like makes total sense.

1074
01:45:10,160 --> 01:45:17,740
Oh yeah. All the marijuana sort of weird because there's like entire individual heterogeneity because we use like six different people.

1075
01:45:18,240 --> 01:45:19,030
Really? Yeah.

1076
01:45:19,030 --> 01:45:25,780
And so like, some people are actually pretty sensitive like in the hundreds, I mean, in terms of like differently express schemes like that.

1077
01:45:28,060 --> 01:45:35,030
And, and then like I was like we try to them you can always get a.

1078
01:45:41,160 --> 02:41:59,460
It's just that there. They?

1079
02:42:05,080 --> 02:42:21,600
I don't think. I know.

1080
02:42:26,780 --> 02:43:25,840
Takes. This is.

1081
02:43:37,050 --> 02:43:45,240
I don't think that. What?

1082
02:44:02,380 --> 02:44:54,250
You know. Yeah.

1083
02:50:32,220 --> 02:50:36,150
Well, yeah. Hey, listen, I'm going to be our.
