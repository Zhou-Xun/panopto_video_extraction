Welcome to the epidemiology department Math module series,

2
00:00:05,876 --> 00:00:11,549
probability applications In Epidemiology for two I am MIATTA BUXTON and

3
00:00:11,549 --> 00:00:18,340
I am an assistant research scientist and epidemiology department.

4
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:23,344
This unit extends applications of probability concepts

5
00:00:23,344 --> 00:00:29,491
in the field of epidemiology and focuses on measures of association,

6
00:00:29,491 --> 00:00:35,428
by the end of this unit, you will be able to connect the relationship

7
00:00:35,428 --> 00:00:40,119
between probability and epidemiologic measures and

8
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:47,540
apply those concepts to calculate relative risk measures.

9
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:51,954
So far we have covered epidemiologic examples

10
00:00:51,954 --> 00:00:56,142
involving measures of disease frequency,

11
00:00:56,142 --> 00:01:02,027
where we talked about prevalence, cumulative incidents and

12
00:01:02,027 --> 00:01:08,931
we got a chance to work through examples calculating pura prevalence but

13
00:01:08,931 --> 00:01:15,190
measures of disease frequencies are helpful to a certain point.

14
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:20,618
They helpful in informing us how common an outcome is or

15
00:01:20,618 --> 00:01:26,400
to be able to compare disease burden across populations,

16
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:34,540
so what these are very useful pieces of information or epidemiologic data.

17
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:38,622
There are other measures that can help us understand

18
00:01:38,622 --> 00:01:42,705
the relationship between disease and exposure, so

19
00:01:42,705 --> 00:01:48,828
let's take a moment to connect the concept of probability to these measures,

20
00:01:48,828 --> 00:01:55,540
specifically measures of association and in general measures of association.

21
00:01:55,540 --> 00:02:01,706
Are used to evaluate whether there is a relationship between exposure and

22
00:02:01,706 --> 00:02:06,878
an outcome and also the strength of that association to do this

23
00:02:06,878 --> 00:02:13,140
we group people by different levels of exposure and all come status.

24
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:18,309
And typically used to buy two tables to demonstrate how to evaluate

25
00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:23,479
whether there's an association between exposure and outcome for

26
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:28,830
example, the outcome category could be those with an outcome versus

27
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:34,770
those without an outcome or it could be mild disease versus severe disease.

28
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:39,816
So there is some amount of flexibility in how the outcome may be classified and

29
00:02:39,816 --> 00:02:44,629
you have the same situation where this flexibility in what's considered

30
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:47,740
an exposure and how it may be classified.

31
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:52,764
So the measure of association we're going to focus on

32
00:02:52,764 --> 00:02:57,785
in this unit is the relative risk the risk in general is

33
00:02:57,785 --> 00:03:03,029
an umbrella term used to describe the ratio of the risk or

34
00:03:03,029 --> 00:03:09,169
rate of disease among exposed individuals compared to the rate or

35
00:03:09,169 --> 00:03:14,840
risk of disease among unexposed individuals.

36
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,312
In other words, the relative risk is the probability of developing

37
00:03:19,312 --> 00:03:24,097
the outcome of interest among the exposed compared to the probability of

38
00:03:24,097 --> 00:03:29,340
developing the outcome of interest among the unexposed.

39
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:34,318
So these two broad categories of relative risk which will be

40
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:39,591
the risk ratio and rate ratio, so the risk ratio uses the number

41
00:03:39,591 --> 00:03:43,971
of cases among exposed compared to the unexposed and

42
00:03:43,971 --> 00:03:49,047
their corresponding totals and this can be seen in this table

43
00:03:49,047 --> 00:03:53,651
on the screen where you have the typical two x 2 table.

44
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:59,690
Use in epidemiology, we have those with disease status in the columns,

45
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:05,036
so disease yes and disease no and then we have exposure status and

46
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:10,976
the rows so we have exposed and unexposed and then you have the totals for

47
00:04:10,976 --> 00:04:15,040
the rows and the totals also for the column.

48
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,810
And then you have an overall total that gives you

49
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:24,699
the total amount of participants in your study or

50
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:29,588
in the particular evaluation you're doing so,

51
00:04:29,588 --> 00:04:35,220
these values in the highlighted red text box are A and C.

52
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:39,610
Which will give you the number of cases among the exposed,

53
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,206
in this case it will be the A cell and

54
00:04:42,206 --> 00:04:47,402
the number of cases among their own exports which will be the C cell and

55
00:04:47,402 --> 00:04:52,090
the corresponding totals here would be where you have A and B.

56
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:57,036
Which would be the total of exposed individuals and C and

57
00:04:57,036 --> 00:05:02,192
D the total of unexposed individuals, on the other hand,

58
00:05:02,192 --> 00:05:08,823
for the rate ratio, this measure uses the number of cases among exposed and

59
00:05:08,823 --> 00:05:14,220
unexposed persons and the total person time for each group.

60
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,800
As you can see in the table where we have similar information for

61
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,824
disease equals yes so the A and C values but

62
00:05:21,824 --> 00:05:27,540
in this case you have a slightly different presentation of the data.

63
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,149
In studies where you collect person time and

64
00:05:30,149 --> 00:05:35,014
person time would be the amount of time that each person contributes to the study,

65
00:05:35,014 --> 00:05:39,640
the amount of follow up time that each person contributes to the study.

66
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:44,620
So in the spot where you usually have the B values, In this case,

67
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:50,434
you have the total person time for all of the individuals who are exposed and

68
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:53,780
then similarly in the detailed location.

69
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:57,534
This time around, you have first in time for

70
00:05:57,534 --> 00:06:03,214
all individuals who are on exposed and are still the person time for

71
00:06:03,214 --> 00:06:09,430
on exposed persons, so let's take an example of radon and lung cancer.

72
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:15,001
So this is a hypothetical example which has radon as the exposure and

73
00:06:15,001 --> 00:06:18,422
lung cancer as the outcome, according to

74
00:06:18,422 --> 00:06:24,011
the United States Environmental Protection Agency, so that E P A.

75
00:06:24,011 --> 00:06:30,752
Radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer in the general population,

76
00:06:30,752 --> 00:06:36,017
smoking is known to be the leading cause of lung cancer, And

77
00:06:36,017 --> 00:06:42,540
radon is also the number one cause of lung cancer among non smokers.

78
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:47,625
So this is a very important public health problem, so

79
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:52,710
the table here presents data in the tuba to format that

80
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:58,134
I explained earlier and we have the sl where we have 100

81
00:06:58,134 --> 00:07:03,470
persons who had lung cancer and were exposed to ridden.

82
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:08,933
We have 20 participants who were exposed to radon but

83
00:07:08,933 --> 00:07:15,940
did not have lung cancer, 500 persons were not exposed to radon and

84
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:21,048
had lung cancer and 1380 participants were not

85
00:07:21,048 --> 00:07:26,640
exposed to radon and did not develop lung cancer.

86
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:31,735
So the first question we have is what is the probability

87
00:07:31,735 --> 00:07:36,940
of lung cancer among those exposed to radon?

88
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:41,671
And then the second part of this question is what is another term

89
00:07:41,671 --> 00:07:45,540
used to describe this probability?

90
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:50,042
So, applying the probability formula in this situation,

91
00:07:50,042 --> 00:07:55,263
remember from the first video in this series, we define probability

92
00:07:55,263 --> 00:08:01,340
as the number of events divided by the total number of possible outcomes.

93
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:06,302
In this case, we can apply that formula and say probability is equal

94
00:08:06,302 --> 00:08:11,265
to the number of outcomes divided by the total number in that group,

95
00:08:11,265 --> 00:08:17,140
in this case, it will be the total number of exposed individuals.

96
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:21,444
So the probability of lung cancer among those

97
00:08:21,444 --> 00:08:26,088
exposed the radon is 100 divided by 120 and

98
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:31,525
the 100 represents those who were exposed to radon and

99
00:08:31,525 --> 00:08:39,940
develop lung cancer at 120 is the total of all those who were exposed to radon.

100
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:44,738
So based on this, the probability of lung cancer among

101
00:08:44,738 --> 00:08:49,120
those exposed to radon is 0.83 another term,

102
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,800
which is the second part of the question.

103
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,144
Another term used to describe this probability is the incidents among

104
00:08:57,144 --> 00:08:58,102
the exposed and

105
00:08:58,102 --> 00:09:04,440
this might be a little more familiar to you based on your epic classes.

106
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:09,036
The next question asked about the probability of lung cancer

107
00:09:09,036 --> 00:09:12,010
among those not exposed to radon and for

108
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:19,440
two of that question is what is another name used to describe this probability.

109
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,864
The probability of lung cancer among those not

110
00:09:23,864 --> 00:09:28,516
exposed to radon is 500 divided by 1880,

111
00:09:28,516 --> 00:09:35,440
which is the total number of people who are not exposed to radon.

112
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:41,093
So if you do the math, the answer to that is 0.27

113
00:09:41,093 --> 00:09:46,354
another term used to describe this probability

114
00:09:46,354 --> 00:09:50,825
is the incidents among the own exposed,

115
00:09:50,825 --> 00:09:57,440
the last part of this question is using the same data.

116
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:03,488
What is the probability of developing the outcome of interest among those exposed

117
00:10:03,488 --> 00:10:10,040
compared to the probability of developing the outcome among those not exposed?

118
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:15,440
What is another name used to describe this measure?

119
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:21,057
So the probability of the outcome among the exposed versus the unexposed

120
00:10:21,057 --> 00:10:26,671
would be the first step that we calculated in the first part of the example

121
00:10:26,671 --> 00:10:33,740
where we're looking at the probability of lung cancer among their unexposed.

122
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:38,543
This is going to be divided by the second step that we did in

123
00:10:38,543 --> 00:10:43,450
the previous slide where we calculated the probability of

124
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:47,454
lung cancer among those who are not exposed, so

125
00:10:47,454 --> 00:10:52,359
based on the answers we guide from the previous examples,

126
00:10:52,359 --> 00:10:59,000
we have 0.83 divided by 0.27 this gives us a final answer of 3.07.

127
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,021
So the second part of the question is asking what is another name used to

128
00:11:03,021 --> 00:11:04,840
describe this measure?

129
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:10,182
Another name or another term used to describe this measure

130
00:11:10,182 --> 00:11:14,761
is the risk ratio, so the risk ratio is 3.07,

131
00:11:14,761 --> 00:11:21,630
meaning there's a strong association between being exposed to read on and

132
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:26,646
developing lung cancer so this example concludes this

133
00:11:26,646 --> 00:11:33,540
unit on application of probability concepts in epidemiology.

134
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:38,302
This unit is really intended to connect statistical

135
00:11:38,302 --> 00:11:42,412
concepts to the work we do in epidemiology and

136
00:11:42,412 --> 00:11:49,120
I encourage you to explore additional resources on the math module page,

137
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:58,533
specifically the introduction to probability modules, page on canvas.
