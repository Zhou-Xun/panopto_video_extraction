1
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:09,600
All right. She has proved.

2
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:48,739
So with this lab activity for teens, we're just going to do something very simple.

3
00:01:48,740 --> 00:02:02,210
But usually useful is to insert a new map in the existing Project API file and then change the projection of that map that you're looking at.

4
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,820
So we're going to do is open another project. Okay, fine.

5
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:25,880
Go to your C Drive page 5066 Lab Projects, Lung Cancer Mortality and lung cancer mortality API tracks and put you on the open.

6
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:51,000
All right. So we're familiar with this map, but many times in your project, you want to create multiple maps in this one project map, just one man.

7
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,460
Right. So you may have a map of the whole U.S. We may have a map of Michigan.

8
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:07,290
You may have a map of your another state, etc. So you can add a new map to this specific project by going to insert.

9
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,750
Okay. And add a new mayor.

10
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:22,200
So here we don't have anything here except a base layer. I like to turn these off.

11
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:33,000
You can also remove them if you want. If you right click on it, you can remove them, but not necessarily just close your computer down a bit.

12
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:42,120
So now we're going to create a map here for lung cancer mortality in Michigan from 2015 through the 19th.

13
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:51,550
So some updated data that someone bit of folders here and going remove that that's that's there

14
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:58,560
just ignore it because it's a it's a link from my home computer which we don't use in class.

15
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:07,230
Okay. It's already linked to the C drive. If you hover over it, there's a folder connection to the C drive, HP 1866 lab.

16
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:17,370
So we can go there and we want to find the cancer profile view database.

17
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:21,480
So that's in projects under lung cancer mortality.

18
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,750
There's two of databases in this folder.

19
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:31,830
So there's a cancer profile to your database, which is the updated data and this lung cancer mortality, the old data.

20
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:35,700
So you opened up this to your database. There are two feature classes in here.

21
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:43,560
One is for Michigan and one is for the whole U.S. Updated for that, you say 2019, but that's okay.

22
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:50,430
So you can drag over my counties 2018 to your drawing order.

23
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,880
And then you'll see this map here.

24
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:58,229
If you look at the table, right?

25
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:06,059
This is a data we downloaded from, uh, cancer profiles, state cancer profiles,

26
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:12,090
plus some other information that I had, which is information and poverty.

27
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:17,430
Okay. So it's nice to observe the data whenever you're looking at something.

28
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:21,520
So if you look at this map, it looks a little odd, right?

29
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:27,000
It looks squished. Right. Usually you don't see maps of Michigan that look like this.

30
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:34,440
This is because this map is projected for the whole United States of America and not for Michigan specifically.

31
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:41,850
So we want to change the projection system for this map. So the way you do that is you go, well, I didn't have you do this stuff.

32
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:51,840
Let's rename this map so we know what you're looking at. You can click on map under drawing order, and if you just double click it in cover,

33
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,900
you can change the name or you can just right click and go to properties and in the general tab you can name it.

34
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:02,520
And I think I asked you to name it. Yeah. My lung cancer mortality.

35
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:22,570
2015 to 2. Okay.

36
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,950
All right. So what you do is this is called a map frame.

37
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:35,720
Okay. This is. So there's a map frame for lung cancer mortality from the previous work we did on the other map.

38
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:42,260
There's one here. Um, you can right click on that and go to properties.

39
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,730
And there's an option called coordinate system.

40
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:54,580
Right. So you can click on that option. And right now, it's, it's projected with the North American data.

41
00:06:54,630 --> 00:07:01,310
That's what it stands for, 1983. So it's projected to the North America, that specifically to Michigan.

42
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:08,720
So one way you can find a projection system that you would like is to search for keywords.

43
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:14,270
Right now, we need Michigan to take Michigan in the search field and push it into.

44
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:23,450
Right. And it should have filtered out just the Michigan word in all these projections projection system.

45
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:26,660
We're going to look at projected coordinate systems.

46
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:31,490
And there are two options here state plane and state system.

47
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:38,690
We're going to use the state system and you'll see many different options for Michigan.

48
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:45,140
All right. We're going to go down and find an ad in 1983.

49
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:52,040
She'll reference us. Click on that once and push.

50
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:58,190
Okay. And you notice that the map changes and it looks more like what you're used to see.

51
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:01,520
All right, so let's see. You're working on a different state.

52
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:05,160
You should do the same thing working in California.

53
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:10,520
I go into California and I will find the right state system projection for that.

54
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:20,620
The 1983 system is fine. There are updated ones, I think, to 2011, but if you use 83 or 2011, you're fine.

55
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:29,510
You can do meters of feet. I just use meters now, but generally it's good to use, I mean, feet now, but it's generally good to use meters.

56
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:39,620
Okay. Yeah, I know that one of the requirements for a map is to put the projection system of that be what we just selected with that.

57
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,540
That's right. You would put that at the bottom of the somewhere?

58
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:52,300
Yeah. Great. All right, now save the file so it can be saved.

59
00:08:54,700 --> 00:09:01,900
So now when you open it again, you'll have both of these maps here and you have this specific one projected in the right way.

60
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:07,030
Now, let's move on to lab activity 15.

61
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,430
So let's look at some ways we could symbolize this data.

62
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:17,470
Okay. That's in this map, an attribute table.

63
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:27,610
And look at the different options we may have. So turn right, click on it and go to symbology.

64
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:42,190
Right click on the layer and build a symbol. Then you'll see something called primary symbology here, and there is a single symbol.

65
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:45,940
So it just has one symbol. But you have many different options here.

66
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:53,620
And it's a single symbol is just is the classless actually.

67
00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:07,000
Yeah. I think classless is not single, single, single ed. Yeah, I think there are different, different options for a classless single symbol.

68
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:25,210
Unique values and class colors. Okay. So each value is is a map mapped when you look at unique values and you go down and cast colors.

69
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:29,040
Okay. So I see unique values.

70
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:35,600
We can look at death rate as unique values.

71
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:41,160
Right. So it's going to each value is going to be given its own category, which is not very helpful.

72
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:45,660
But you may have a variable with these three categories.

73
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:56,880
Right. You know, did not meet 2030 goals, did meet 20 or 30 goals or something like that.

74
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:06,120
And if you use a. Enclosed colors.

75
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:15,240
It's actually very nice because it gives you a gradient based on the intensity of the variable.

76
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:27,240
Okay, so the high rates are up here, but it doesn't really give you a good differentiation and if the data are skewed here.

77
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,440
So it's probably not the best option to use.

78
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:39,540
Right. So let's look at another option, equal interval selection.

79
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:44,850
To do that, you can change this to graduated colors.

80
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:51,780
Okay. Instead and choose a same field death rate.

81
00:11:53,820 --> 00:12:05,650
Okay. And. Let's look at the histogram.

82
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:18,710
So that the data looks kind of normal but a little bit skewed to the right.

83
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:25,070
You can try equal interval. Okay.

84
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:34,340
Or quantile. You can change a number of classes from 5 to 4 or three.

85
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:39,320
I think I said three in the notes. So you can change to three.

86
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:47,780
Kind of indicates that some high rate counties are all in red ones, low rates or yellow oranges in the middle.

87
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,580
You can decide whichever color scheme suits your needs.

88
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:58,300
This one is going from low to high, so dark to light.

89
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:05,000
That's probably not the right color scheme to use, right? The lighter colors are actually higher value in this scheme.

90
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:10,040
This is probably the right scheme is going to use a grayscale approach.

91
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:22,610
So Quantile is using graduated colors and instead of using the equal interval method, you would use a quantum method, which we just did.

92
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:29,420
Now let's look at top density. So we're looking at rates, but we're going to look at dense that density instead of these colors.

93
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:34,520
So there's a dot density option, right?

94
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:46,950
Change the field to death rate again. You can change the symbol like you can change the dot to be some different color.

95
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:51,550
If you click on symbol, if you like, you can label it.

96
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:57,280
So for the legend, if you want to be more clear, you would change the label.

97
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:11,640
To be more specific, you can change the dot size, okay, to increase the value and change the dark sizes to each value.

98
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:17,320
Each dot represents to a, you know, a rate of two per 100,000.

99
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:23,770
But you can increase or decrease the numbers. If you increase the number, you have less dots.

100
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:31,250
Okay. Now these dots are randomly distributed.

101
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:40,370
They don't tell you where the event occurred. It just tells you how dense the event is in the specific fall event, which here is a.

102
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:48,770
Okay. Now, there's also graduated colors, not graduated symbols.

103
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:56,210
So that's not a corporate map, but gets you similar information.

104
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:02,350
So you can change the graduated symbol. Go to the field and select death rate again.

105
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:12,890
Will maybe is equal interval selection. And here the size of the circle indicates the the value.

106
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:18,870
The larger the circle, the higher the value. And you can change the circle to be different.

107
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,610
Change its properties in terms of the color, etc.

108
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:36,660
Okay. And there's also something called bivariate maps of maps where you can look at two variables.

109
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:42,950
For example, you can do. Death rate by.

110
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,510
We'll look at that in the left, next left.

111
00:15:49,510 --> 00:16:02,770
So I'd just like you to just explore, you know, graduated symbols, graduated colors, change pick of methodology you think is the best for the data.

112
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:09,430
And change the color to your liking. Right? And just explore the symbology options under here.

113
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:16,960
You know, you have. Explore these options.

114
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:22,040
The field name is, of course you can change to death or you can look at average number of deaths,

115
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:28,490
normalization you shouldn't mess with because we already have a rate.

116
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:32,210
Normalization just means you're dividing by another variable.

117
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:40,700
Okay, check out the different methods of selecting your classes or your groups and the different number of groups,

118
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:48,809
different color schemes and so forth. So just spend a few minutes doing that.

119
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:52,290
And once you do you like the data? Like the look.

120
00:16:52,980 --> 00:18:03,660
Save it. And. Yeah.

121
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:15,299
I'm having trouble. Okay. I wasn't even pulling it off.

122
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:25,640
And I don't know why. Because I removed everything into the scene for the last time, but I don't see it.

123
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:37,750
And I put all of this in the right place because in this area, my kids are.

124
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:47,430
Strange. Yeah. And I know what I'm doing.

125
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:56,750
So I turned to her and say, that's a research project.

126
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:08,560
Inside. I think.

127
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:21,730
I know. So I need someone.

128
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:58,130
There are no. I'm okay.

129
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,430
I will be here now. Okay, open that.

130
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,350
Sorry. I just didn't want to interrupt you. Yeah, interrupt because you can.

131
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:23,200
So we're going to create a new map and search your map.

132
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:30,720
And in Michigan, you can take those boxes.

133
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:37,740
Okay, great. It was a great speech.

134
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:53,100
Project cancer profiles and GDP drives and.

135
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:04,250
If you change the projection system to make one, we're not there obvious.

136
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:12,390
The system. In Michigan in the stretch is.

137
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:23,070
The projections. IT systems like 880.

138
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:35,079
This. Yeah.

139
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:42,070
He just projects in front from Michigan. I think there must be some value.

140
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:47,920
We're exploring different symbology options for the statutory right.

141
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:55,479
Graduate culinary symbols and just play around with these.

142
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:05,610
And this is where it is. I think it's it's the first time and it was there and and I restarted it.

143
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:09,500
And you're not doing that. Oh.

144
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:24,850
All right. So the next activity you can play around this with this stuff when you practice is looking at five year record put me.

145
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:32,440
So let's say you wanted to see if there was any relationship between lung cancer mortality at the county level and

146
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:40,870
poverty rates at the county level and which counties are having high levels of both versus low levels of both.

147
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,729
So that's the important question.

148
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:52,390
Many times we ask, right, where are the high need counties in terms of the health outcome, but also some social determinant of that health outcomes?

149
00:22:52,900 --> 00:23:02,780
Okay. So one way to look at these kinds of bivariate relationships is of course, to cross tabulate that data in,

150
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:11,799
in your statistical software calculator, chi square test or calculate a correlation coefficient, right?

151
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,910
That will give you some indication of the relationship between those two variables.

152
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:20,170
And then you can visualize the geographic relationship,

153
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:26,410
the overlap between those two variables on a map using something called a bivariate corporate map.

154
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:32,050
So there's some option under primary symbology here called bivariate colors.

155
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:38,830
So you can click on that. And I'm on number one in lab activity 16.

156
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,760
And for field one, we can choose death rate.

157
00:23:43,690 --> 00:24:00,520
Okay. And for field two, we can use POF 150, which is the, the rate of people below 150% of the federal poverty line in the specific county.

158
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:07,090
Okay. And so let's look at the histogram for both of these variables.

159
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:15,580
So there's a field of one histogram here, which is your death rate relatively normal, but a little rate skewed.

160
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:24,820
And then you have a field two, which is a poverty rate, which is a little bit skewed.

161
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:34,420
Okay. So I think that the best method probably to use is the quantile distribution.

162
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,990
So we can select quantile here.

163
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:45,760
And let me make sure and I think I said do three by three grid.

164
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:52,030
Right, so you can make this group to be four by four, which could be get complicated,

165
00:24:52,600 --> 00:25:02,790
but three by three is a nice grid and you can choose the the different color schemes for a bivariate map.

166
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:09,430
There are many of them. I'm just going to use the default for the moment and just to get an idea what this is showing us.

167
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:13,390
Right. On the left is the legend here that shows up.

168
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:23,080
You can look at the labels for the legend and then the one on the right here under symbology in the symbology frame,

169
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:30,410
you can change those legend right here.

170
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:41,920
So for death rate, you can change that to be more specific and say lung cancer mortality per 100,000.

171
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:48,610
Right. And for 150, you can say percent.

172
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:59,630
You know, 150% of federal poverty level.

173
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:13,820
Okay. So on the left, you'll see the tax change in the contents pane as you update the legend text in the right here.

174
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:26,360
But so what you're seeing is the purple squares or counties are the ones that are high lung cancer mortality and high poverty rate.

175
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:35,870
Okay. And the gray areas are low lung cancer mortality and low poverty rates.

176
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:48,770
And if you look at the pink Cobb County, those have a high level of lung cancer mortality, but low levels of poverty.

177
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:56,450
And blue counties are high poverty.

178
00:26:56,690 --> 00:27:02,270
That low. Lung cancer mortality. So all of those counties might be of interest to you.

179
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:07,700
Why are these poor counties doing so well in lung cancer mortality?

180
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:13,620
Why are these poor counties doing so poorly in terms of lung cancer mortality, etc.?

181
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:19,100
And these probably will guide future activities in terms of outreach.

182
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:27,350
If you had lung cancer screening programs, lung cancer treatment facilities, prevention efforts like smoking cessation,

183
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:33,890
smoking prevention, you can target two different counties in Michigan based on these type of data.

184
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:47,840
Okay. Now, I would suggest you start with number five and six and explore the options for grid size, different color schemes,

185
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:56,540
try different class intervals for the data and see how the results change in terms of which counties become the,

186
00:27:56,540 --> 00:28:08,179
quote unquote high need counties where you have both high levels of mortality and high levels of poverty in what you could do next is look

187
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:18,170
at the lung cancer mortality per 100,000 white men data which is in the first map and create a corporate bivariate corporate map there.

188
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:30,770
Right. The poverty this that's the data in this map is not percent below the federal poverty line, but it's female headed households.

189
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:43,069
So you can create a bivariate map using the U.S. continental map cross tabulating rwm00 underscore four and the female headed

190
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:52,160
household variable which you have to normalize fh each and school child divided by the households number of households.

191
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:57,290
So do those two things five and six on your own. And I'll come by and help folks who may need.

192
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:53,650
The difference. Continue freaking out in the.

193
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:03,270
No. Yes. Okay.

194
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:11,550
Expecting to hear from the president today.

195
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:30,480
The last. I'm just waiting for something bigger.

196
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:42,179
I look for my girl, every one of those.

197
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:51,480
And, you know I look for you first.

198
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:56,770
Yeah. I couldn't tell you what my not.

199
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:10,120
South. I.

200
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:21,790
I think it's a smart.

201
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:33,600
Not too important for anyone who wants to take that.

202
00:31:51,670 --> 00:32:09,470
Yes. So first I heard.

203
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:24,230
Yeah. What now?

204
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:29,670
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

205
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:42,500
It's much. And that includes the.

206
00:32:47,760 --> 00:33:10,450
Think. So I give you a summary.

207
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:21,490
So you. I think this.

208
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:42,190
Very quickly. I mean, I feeling. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

209
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:48,380
You know, I was in a.

210
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:59,230
So I like it doesn't I don't remember which one.

211
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:07,810
Yeah, I think a lot of people don't read more than nine which is that the majority of people never.

212
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:14,320
It was suggested I do they said before the day. Okay.

213
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:22,310
We can use that in the colony domination of certain things.

214
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:27,349
Yeah, I think that for me, I just have to be able to visualize myself.

215
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:37,020
So it makes sense that, you know, the people understand your vision because it's such a nice combination of the.

216
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:46,210
Do you feel? There's like six different things here.

217
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:59,570
And then when you do live in Georgia, because it's more regimented, because you're going to have to go there.

218
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:07,760
Do you think it's funny? I don't know.

219
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:18,350
I think they were sort of. She's like, you know, mysterious things like this, you know?

220
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:24,920
Yeah. I don't think that's something that you can.

221
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:35,730
Yeah. Wow. All right, so you guys finish messing around with the binary corporate maps.

222
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,820
Okay. Anything you learned from maybe the Michigan already looked at?

223
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:45,870
How about the US map? What do we see here?

224
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:13,590
Okay. So the purple colors indicate both values being fine, right?

225
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:22,770
So you're seeing a lot of high lung cancer mortality rates and high rates of female that in households in the south of the country.

226
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:29,489
Right. Relatively soon, if you look in the western area of the country,

227
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:37,260
you do have low rates of lung cancer mortality, but relatively high rates of poverty here as well.

228
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:43,139
Right. So it may not be that it's poverty driving these problems,

229
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:51,420
but this is an area of the country where we have both poverty and lung cancer mortality happening in the same place.

230
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:59,880
Okay, great. So this is one way to try to show relationships between two variables.

231
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:04,600
I think that is it for lab activities for today.

232
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:10,139
I was going to ask you to practice doing this for your own state,

233
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:19,140
but I say we wait on the practice until we have the student presentations done and then we'll do independent work and assignments,

234
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:25,830
one or two slash practice, previous lab activities, and you can decide whichever works for you best.

235
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:30,689
Okay. So let's take a short break or let's do 10 minutes.

236
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:35,850
So let's come back at 355 or do 12 minute break.

237
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:42,190
And we will start with the student presentations. Good.

238
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:57,970
I think it's very easy to go with that.

239
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:08,820
I'm not going to be your customer.

240
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:42,050
My first. It's special time in this country in general because we spend a lot of life with people.

241
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:52,220
And I would just like to add more color on the colorful color.

242
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:59,060
Then I'm like, Yeah, you just make me like what you were. I was like very even.

243
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:05,870
Like, if I like Mark, I still kind of like the content and I'm like, I'm pretty certain that I look at.

244
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:19,500
Lindsey Yeah. If she has like pictures on there and I was like, Oh, I understand why you say, Oh, you know, you look great, nice.

245
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:28,760
And I always I love it. And I'm just like, they want us closer to talking about because because at that point I was like,

246
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:35,870
I mean, I'm pretty sure I'm just going to play social media and yeah, like, what is it like?

247
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,270
I don't care what you say.

248
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:48,649
It's not like, Oh yeah, maybe like a two page reporter, it's 30 pages something because we were like, Oh, I don't know why we didn't do an intro.

249
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:53,720
And then I maybe have to and like this, like too much data on each section.

250
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:58,110
Okay? And I was like, oh yeah, yeah. Like a table of content.

251
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:03,680
So it's like, ended up being an instance, a website.

252
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:12,490
Yeah. Like you're like, oh, I remember that it was that turned out for you.

253
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:21,120
There were any kind of things. And sometimes when I'm like looking at like people.

254
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:32,270
I couldn't stand it any more. Yeah, it's just like something we like.

255
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:37,230
You don't combine them to have to be watching.

256
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:45,340
Oh, yeah, that was the referee were like. Like, I guess we're going to present the music with too much more readily.

257
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:49,899
Just more content. Yeah, but then they put like she was the one.

258
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:56,410
I was like, Oh, really? And I was like, Oh, man. At this point, it's like, I don't care for independent groups or that was going to be.

259
00:40:57,130 --> 00:41:00,810
Yes, I think that's true. I mean, we got together. Yeah.

260
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:07,990
You know, I never thought this was we found a template like with templates and then we just yeah,

261
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:14,020
we had the rest of be covered after I left because I feel like there's a lot more you can do because it has to,

262
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:22,150
you know that your record probably the template, but it's more like Yeah, yeah, I would say so yeah, I'm going to be there.

263
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:27,700
T raises a question. I don't know if I agree with that somewhere.

264
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:33,459
Yeah, there will be questions or something. And I think the plan was the after pool of feedback.

265
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:36,680
We were like making tweaks and. For the game and for the game tomorrow.

266
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:56,290
And so when I got started, I had I had I had to figure out what was happening on the following day in the morning.

267
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:04,790
And so I had the setting and he was like, well actually spoke written in there.

268
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:10,099
Yeah. So an inference that it might go for like making it, screwing it up.

269
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:14,180
And at this point, I'm just like, I'm just done. Yeah.

270
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:18,020
I spent a lot of the weekend, basically, and I think I'm right.

271
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:21,650
Oh, just think this is.

272
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:27,840
I thought I was more confident, but I was like Lindsay during the Depression.

273
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:32,260
I'm getting better at it, but it's also worked out pretty well.

274
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,960
So I think that's going on here.

275
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:43,460
But there's a lot to what I'm concerned about because I mean, I'm making my poster camera versus using the PowerPoint, which to do this too.

276
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:47,029
Yeah, I think so. Yeah.

277
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:53,450
Because I think her team. Yeah. It was like, I don't realize that when I'm on it because I can't change that.

278
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:58,520
I'm like, Oh, I look at the things that were there. And so it is a lot nicer.

279
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:03,820
But yeah, I don't know. I mean, that is the way that like she said it had to be.

280
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:11,580
I don't know what it actually I'm getting like what printed. Probably not the right thing so she tells me.

281
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:17,020
Say goodbye to love right now. Oh, my gosh.

282
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:22,740
Now try not to contemplate. Check out my classes.

283
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:29,450
The virtual, you know, sometimes like the lectures.

284
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:36,729
As much as some of your songs.

285
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:41,389
I like the class in general. Just like your kitchen, your company.

286
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:45,010
The pressure, just. Oh, yeah.

287
00:43:45,610 --> 00:43:48,990
I think, you know, like, sometimes we're a little more formal.

288
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:52,630
Oftentimes I was just like, Oh, can we just put it on, like, something like this?

289
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:58,830
I think we should. Yeah.

290
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:06,430
So, but like, I mean, we don't talk about, like, probably wasn't supposed to do anything.

291
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:15,850
I remember I get flashes, but when it goes real quick, right, like, oh, I still have a it like I don't know my phone, I still have screenshots.

292
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:21,999
Finally I like the equations and how they want to calculate stuff.

293
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,170
And I was like, you know, I keep telling myself I'm not a leader, but I feel something is telling me.

294
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:30,489
And I was like, Oh, okay.

295
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:37,230
So that just goes back to something. It's. And we able to actually do something before we had a class.

296
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:41,250
So. I just need to be doing this.

297
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:49,350
Yeah, I don't know. I think the community was working with it, and especially for me it was like figuring out what was coming later.

298
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:53,170
What's your denomination right now? I know.

299
00:44:54,800 --> 00:45:01,990
I was the one who he like that. Long Island is for me a role model things.

300
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:06,490
Yeah I guess like there was that. I think it's always like.

301
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:11,870
Tester acknowledges that her work is questionable and never going to count.

302
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:21,410
Right. Because the point right now, I think at this point, I think was I wasn't I don't think it was hard,

303
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:25,010
but it was like a lot of stuff where we would be like undecided.

304
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:29,470
And she asked us to recalculation things for that. Question. Do you think?

305
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:33,470
The whole time I spent the whole time I still have it. And I was just like,

306
00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:41,870
I'm really not I didn't want to finish with it because I wasn't done because

307
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:46,390
it was like a gradual assessment to some of the former candidates and wrong.

308
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:51,380
Not just like I don't have to like scroll up to go look back at the data set and

309
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:58,400
then down the of the question like this is really the time to bring to the table.

310
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:03,620
And then over into the questions because it all the question really tied to one thing the table or

311
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:08,390
something that would be really bad for finally fixing it because a lot of people were just like,

312
00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:16,000
I agree with everyone even. So but I mean, it was time for our discussion.

313
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:22,400
Thank you. I guess I'd like you to have her lunch.

314
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:30,320
She would have discretion, and she's just like you. And we were all trying to figure out if there was someone else in the car with her or an animal,

315
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:36,140
because, like, she was talking to somebody else about this sort of it cause it wasn't for.

316
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:39,680
Do you think they were only like one was like on top of like answering questions

317
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:48,120
and the other people kind of just they seem to think it's like or something.

318
00:46:48,140 --> 00:47:02,390
If it's this, you know, this way, it should be one of the answers to the nuts and bolts of how we can do that.

319
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:08,820
One get the ending like the last ten or 15, and she would come back. She's like looking at all in discussing.

320
00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:13,380
Yeah, it's because of this.

321
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:17,120
So that sounds like a lot of time with the first 2 seconds.

322
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:20,990
And I think we would get a chance to do that because, you know, vulnerability and sadness of it.

323
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:26,520
So let's try to make.

324
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:35,080
They were later that that was the best move for me.

325
00:47:35,330 --> 00:47:40,140
That's why I think it was interesting at this commission.

326
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:47,740
Thank you. Thank you, sir, for your response. You physically suffered at the hands.

327
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:54,760
Perfect. You also need concentric rings and supplication, particularly in.

328
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:05,910
Interestingly enough, before I did. For anyone to give the government is like an underground and I do.

329
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:12,400
It was like I had the best time doing it and I think. Like rooms.

330
00:48:14,770 --> 00:48:21,370
Yeah. I got my undergrad that the professor was like this little man, you know, like the students.

331
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:27,850
No. I heard of Jon Snow again.

332
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:47,930
Because he didn't care for people voted the which tend to tell you they take it after.

333
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:53,770
I'm very happy to hear your words.

334
00:48:54,170 --> 00:49:02,260
I told them if they tell you what happened to me, you know, I have to.

335
00:49:02,410 --> 00:49:09,960
I mean, I appreciate you write that, but right now I need to do the right thing.

336
00:49:10,370 --> 00:49:14,530
I mean, how do you do that? And he goes, Yeah, I feel like.

337
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:27,340
A give and take so that the fun of it is, you know, do you think we're gonna get there?

338
00:49:27,430 --> 00:49:38,290
Yeah. Oh, I think you should do that. All right, let's get started.

339
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:49,810
Just one thing. Before the student led discussion. A small homework assignment for you guys this week is just to explore the US Census website.

340
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:56,300
Okay, we're going to start downloading data from that website next week and I want you to just get a feel for it.

341
00:49:56,370 --> 00:50:05,920
It's a C word. If you can find out some specific information for a specific county in a state of your choice.

342
00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:16,000
Okay. So look at see if you can find the race and ethnic distribution of that county as well as the poverty rate in that county.

343
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:25,510
And then compare the race, ethnicity breakdown and the poverty rate in that county with the rest of the state in the nation.

344
00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:35,170
And see if you are able to download the race, ethnicity and poverty rate data for every county in the state of your choice.

345
00:50:35,770 --> 00:50:42,819
Okay. And we're going to do similar activities next week, but it's good to try to get acquainted with the website.

346
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:47,740
And part of your second assigned is to do this kind of stuff for various websites

347
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:52,780
to get to start figuring out how to download and use data from the internet.

348
00:50:53,140 --> 00:51:00,100
Okay, it's not great. It is just something to work on in practice at your leisure at home.

349
00:51:01,150 --> 00:51:06,910
All right. Let's do this to make presentations that the first person is DeBerry and second is Mack.

350
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:18,090
Thank you for sending your slides. I have them already up here, so I will start slide show for you.

351
00:51:18,370 --> 00:51:33,319
Thank you. Hi everyone.

352
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:38,990
My name is Avery and I'm Brazilian linked social spatial data, promises and challenges,

353
00:51:38,990 --> 00:51:43,940
which came out of a panel from the National Research Council in 2007.

354
00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:50,960
And so to start off, I wanted to just address a couple of key terms that came up in the article.

355
00:51:51,590 --> 00:51:55,819
You've read the article and you can see the definitions here,

356
00:51:55,820 --> 00:52:01,610
so I'm not going to read them verbatim, but I cover a couple key points about each of them.

357
00:52:01,610 --> 00:52:06,820
So the articles main focus was on social spatial data and micro data.

358
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:18,110
This is focus on linking social data with geographic location data as the social spatial name suggests.

359
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:23,210
And these are they were talking about it in the context of using it for research studies.

360
00:52:23,330 --> 00:52:31,130
And the importance of micro data is to understand that these data are easily associated with spatial data.

361
00:52:31,490 --> 00:52:37,010
And when that happens, you can easily compromise confidentiality related to data,

362
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:44,600
including through the fact that a person's identifying information can be exposed or sensitive information that then,

363
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:50,730
when linked with their identifying information like their name or birth date, can also be exposed.

364
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:56,720
And that creates problems which are the harms and identification that we see here.

365
00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:04,820
And those things are things that we're trying to limit from happening through insurance of privacy and confidentiality.

366
00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:11,750
The paper talks about a couple of ways to promote confidentiality and to also notify

367
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:18,260
research participants of confidentiality agreements through like informed consent processes.

368
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:28,999
And then also of note with the harms piece, harms can come in a variety of different formats emotional,

369
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,959
physical harm, but they can also appear to be harmless.

370
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:37,910
But the fact that a person's trust is being breached when their data is exposed

371
00:53:37,910 --> 00:53:44,239
without their consent can be harmful both to the person's sense of self,

372
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:51,410
and then also just to the research in general. And then the last term that we have up here is spatial covariance.

373
00:53:52,190 --> 00:53:57,260
And this is important to note because if you know the magnitude of variables

374
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:02,360
in relationship to each other as well as the value for one of the variables,

375
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:07,310
it's really easy to then estimate where the other variables are or things about them.

376
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:21,200
And that was demonstrated through the example of the researchers in Boston who simulated geographic addresses for 550 patients in the hospital.

377
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:27,560
And then they were able to identify 79% of them with just like the the simulation.

378
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:38,600
And so moving along, a couple of the key ideas that came up in this paper were one that improved spatial data,

379
00:54:38,930 --> 00:54:43,460
has supported advancements in understanding individual behavior and social interactions.

380
00:54:43,910 --> 00:54:54,170
And an example of this was for a long time, you could only really look at how access to health care was mitigated through things like age and gender.

381
00:54:54,920 --> 00:55:04,040
But with the linkage to spatial data, it's also possible to look at how access to health care is mitigated through distances from home

382
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:10,009
of health care centers or distances to work and your health care provider and things like that.

383
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:11,570
And then also transportation.

384
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:20,330
We also saw that linking spatial data with social science data increases the risk that research participants will be identified.

385
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:26,659
There's just more data available, so and more information about a research participant available.

386
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:34,910
So that's why that happens. And then with this, there are various trade offs to using and protecting social spatial data.

387
00:55:36,410 --> 00:55:47,930
Recent trends, well, recent in 2007, but they're still applicable now have promoted like increased demand for accessibility of information.

388
00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:55,670
And then also improvements in computer technology have increased the accessibility of information to all sorts of people.

389
00:55:55,970 --> 00:56:01,400
And so there's a lot to be considered for how we're protecting data of participants.

390
00:56:02,210 --> 00:56:09,200
And then the last thing to note is that some of these tradeoffs are more serious than others, and this can depend on a lot of different things.

391
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:14,990
A couple of the examples that were given in the article where like clustered data is more easily

392
00:56:14,990 --> 00:56:23,180
identifiable than scattered examples of data data that identifies a person's personal characteristics.

393
00:56:23,450 --> 00:56:27,740
It can be more serious if that gets out rather than data that identifies.

394
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:36,000
Attitudes because it can be easier to like know who someone is if you're looking at their characteristics as opposed to just what they think.

395
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:40,460
The types of questions that are covered in the data.

396
00:56:40,470 --> 00:56:43,940
So if you're asking someone about their drug use, it's a lot more serious.

397
00:56:43,950 --> 00:56:48,750
If that gets out, then if you're asking them about their retirement planning, that was one of the examples.

398
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:56,010
And then also just considering the motives and identities of people who are using this as a secondary user,

399
00:56:56,040 --> 00:57:01,950
they're not always good reasons, unfortunately. And so being mindful of that as we protect our data.

400
00:57:03,330 --> 00:57:06,360
And so as the authors moved throughout the article,

401
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:12,960
they talked about both opportunities and challenges to having social and spatial data being linked.

402
00:57:12,990 --> 00:57:20,190
And the first opportunity I'm talking about is that linking social and spatial data can advance knowledge of social phenomena.

403
00:57:20,550 --> 00:57:31,140
And there was an example with Thailand where when they were looking at social networks like kinship and economic assistance to people,

404
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:36,299
they found that when they were able to identify the household location and the

405
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:40,140
farm plot location and link that with other social network data that they had,

406
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:48,470
they had a better understanding of how those social networks were functioning and how that impacted over society.

407
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:55,530
And then social spatial data can help. Researchers examined issues at the personal level rather than the group level.

408
00:57:55,540 --> 00:58:04,679
So in previous classes we've discussed how when we have aggregated geographic level data, we can sometimes miss these individual dynamics.

409
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:12,390
And this is allowing individuals and households to be connected to the geographic environment and then evaluate it at a finer scale.

410
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:13,590
And then finally,

411
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:21,959
I just wanted to know that there were a lot of examples discussed in terms of the opportunities with human interactions of the environment,

412
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:29,640
global patterns, and then also to ask you all what additional opportunities can you think of any ideas?

413
00:58:35,990 --> 00:58:40,600
Mac. Seems like he could help me with, like, program planning and implementation.

414
00:58:40,610 --> 00:58:42,439
If you're able to use,

415
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:52,159
like social spatial data and see like how many people in a given county are more likely to walk to work versus drive versus whatever you feel like.

416
00:58:52,160 --> 00:59:01,310
Okay, so a more targeted like weight loss or whatever program in an area where people are more likely to drive versus like on one level.

417
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:11,040
Great. That's awesome. Any other thought? Okay.

418
00:59:11,350 --> 00:59:17,650
Well, Mark had a great example for us, so we will move on to talk about challenges that we see in this article.

419
00:59:19,210 --> 00:59:24,850
One of the pieces that the authors talked a lot about is that precision of data is really

420
00:59:24,850 --> 00:59:30,070
important in these situations because it increases the work that we're able to do with it.

421
00:59:30,370 --> 00:59:35,290
But it also at the same time increases confidentiality when you're able to precisely

422
00:59:35,290 --> 00:59:40,450
locate where someone lives and then also all of their associated identifying information.

423
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:48,340
And then another piece that I think compounds precision of data and the risks that

424
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:51,790
come along with it is the fact that we're really interested in sharing data.

425
00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:57,639
I'm sure a lot of us have encountered in our classes this concept that we want to give data back to communities and

426
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:02,560
that we want to make it accessible to other people so that we can keep building on the concepts that we're working on.

427
01:00:03,010 --> 01:00:10,659
But when you do that, of course, you have to consider what people are using it for and who should know about this identifying information.

428
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:13,629
And so when we talk about sharing data,

429
01:00:13,630 --> 01:00:21,100
the researchers noted that you can either consider stripping data of certain markers, which then decreases its usability,

430
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:28,660
or you can just like rely on the belief that secondary researchers will breach confidentiality and they'll use it for good things.

431
01:00:29,110 --> 01:00:31,960
And that's not always a belief that you can rely on.

432
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:42,190
And so I want to recognize that this was written in 2007 with, you know, we've seen advancements in technology since then.

433
01:00:42,670 --> 01:00:50,770
Can you think of any other challenges that that have come about with the technology and methods that we've seen?

434
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:04,159
Imagine that, like as people get better with technology,

435
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:09,880
we see more data breaches and more people are hacking into different databases, which makes this more and more.

436
01:01:11,070 --> 01:01:18,750
Yes. Yeah, that was one of the things that I think the authors mentioned even then, but I think it's just become increasingly easier to do that.

437
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:25,270
Jean, I know that the recent changes in Roe versus Wade,

438
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:29,300
people have been really afraid about their data being collected by like period tracking apps and stuff.

439
01:01:30,050 --> 01:01:37,760
So the online search histories and things like that affected by like the laws in certain states that you might get prosecuted for,

440
01:01:37,970 --> 01:01:41,240
like your search history or things like that. Right.

441
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:46,850
And I think that really relates to like relying on the idea that people are using your data that's out there for good,

442
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:50,210
but that's just obviously not always the case.

443
01:01:50,780 --> 01:02:00,860
Did you have something that you are finding similar or just generally this idea of taking our phones everywhere we don't always want.

444
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:05,670
Apps platforms are collecting information on how they.

445
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:09,590
Right? Right. Thanks.

446
01:02:10,550 --> 01:02:18,530
And so just to wrap things up here, I'm going to talk through some of the strengths and limitations and then also implications of this article.

447
01:02:20,330 --> 01:02:26,360
So the first strength that I saw in this article was that addressed sort of existing gaps in research at that time.

448
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:33,500
They talked about how they were specifically examining linking social science data with spatial data,

449
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:36,670
and that really hadn't been done before this paper came out.

450
01:02:36,690 --> 01:02:40,040
And so there was a lot of information game here.

451
01:02:42,230 --> 01:02:51,050
I also thought that the use of the various examples, both Real-Life and hypothetical, really illustrated a lot of the arguments and strengthen them.

452
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:52,820
And an example is person.

453
01:02:52,820 --> 01:03:02,540
So maybe that was just me, but I think that it just always helps to be able to look at how it applies in our work and then maybe other areas as well.

454
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:08,179
I'm going to let you just think about this question in the interest of time,

455
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:14,340
but how do you foresee the tradeoffs presented in this article affecting your work in public health?

456
01:03:14,510 --> 01:03:22,880
I was thinking about that, and so I encourage you all to think about that as well in terms of limitations.

457
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:28,639
The authors noted this limitation, actually them themselves.

458
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:37,410
But because confidentiality concerns have affected research policies around around what folks can use social spatial data for,

459
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:42,319
how much it can be used. They actually acknowledged that they were only able to explore so many

460
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:46,430
opportunities and there were a lot more that they could imagine being out there.

461
01:03:46,730 --> 01:03:51,530
And I imagine that some of those have come to fruition since the time that this article was written.

462
01:03:52,490 --> 01:03:56,390
But I think that there's always more more room in that area.

463
01:03:57,950 --> 01:04:05,600
And then this article focuses a lot on the the challenges and the problems that we see, but not so much on the solutions.

464
01:04:06,470 --> 01:04:12,140
The authors do acknowledge that they are going to talk about solutions later on in their book.

465
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:14,750
We mean that for today. So I don't know.

466
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:25,280
I just acknowledge that there's there there were some solutions offered up later on and that this was more focus on what that the questions were.

467
01:04:26,690 --> 01:04:30,080
And so I wanted to also ask you,

468
01:04:30,290 --> 01:04:37,370
have you thought of any solutions or have you seen solutions in your work that have come about maybe since this this article was originally written,

469
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:45,680
ways of managing this balance of confidentiality and also using more precise social spatial data.

470
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:58,800
Jennifer. So interestingly enough, I did some research over the summer and I think like even just in the way we collected data,

471
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:02,190
it was like the direct person who was like, I was conducting interviews.

472
01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:08,100
So like, I know what the person's name was. But when I was inputting data where I was sharing with other peers, like it was like, oh.

473
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:14,040
Participant seven. So like trying to limit who maybe like knows some of the identifying information could help.

474
01:05:14,340 --> 01:05:18,780
And like what, where it saved and think about where it was aimed.

475
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:23,459
So I like so we had like some information that was safe enough to be put in like Google Drive,

476
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:28,320
but versus other ones had to be secured in like Dropbox or something where only limited people had access to that information.

477
01:05:30,330 --> 01:05:33,360
Yeah, I encountered a really interesting example the other day where.

478
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:44,489
INTERVIEWER He does qualitative research with men who have police encounters and he said that he always told them to tell him a false name.

479
01:05:44,490 --> 01:05:52,680
So that way if he was ever asked like what their name was and what crimes they had been involved in, he like literally can't tell anyone, right?

480
01:05:52,690 --> 01:05:56,340
So he can report on this data and it can be shared out, but he never knows anyone's name.

481
01:05:56,760 --> 01:06:00,270
And so, like, that's his way of protecting those those individuals.

482
01:06:00,990 --> 01:06:05,520
Great. And so just to wrap up with a couple of the implications here,

483
01:06:06,150 --> 01:06:12,570
this paper offers a lot of important considerations for individuals who are working with social spatial data, and that's all of us.

484
01:06:13,230 --> 01:06:19,470
So hopefully it's giving you some ideas for how you can approach using GIFs in your work in the future.

485
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:25,740
And then it encourages further thought around how to make data accessible, specific and confidential.

486
01:06:26,130 --> 01:06:29,100
And I found this really interesting as I kind of hinted at before,

487
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:33,510
because I think there's been a lot of shift in talking about giving data back to communities,

488
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:37,620
and there's a lot of accessibility questions around that.

489
01:06:37,620 --> 01:06:46,589
But also just knowing it's going out to such a broad audience and so making sure that that it's really useful that way presents an argument

490
01:06:46,590 --> 01:06:54,059
for continually evaluating how research policy addresses data confidentiality and privacy concerns in the context of evolving technology.

491
01:06:54,060 --> 01:07:00,719
I think even since 27, like not calling it out, there's it's a lot easier to get your data now.

492
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:07,860
And so just continuing to think about how research policy is looking at that while not limiting what can be done with it.

493
01:07:08,250 --> 01:07:12,180
And then finally, it just lays a framework for for doing kind of that,

494
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:18,930
that work and for thinking about how we look at technology and social science moving forward with that.

495
01:07:19,110 --> 01:07:26,640
Thank you for your contribution. You very much.

496
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:31,229
Nicely done. Cloud, just a couple of extra points.

497
01:07:31,230 --> 01:07:37,200
I guess you guys talked about that. You know, spatial data is now collected all the time by your phones.

498
01:07:38,070 --> 01:07:45,840
But also when we do interviews and collect data from our participants, many times we use technology to collect that information.

499
01:07:46,470 --> 01:07:54,860
And you can easily collected GPS coordinates on any participant automatically when you use these types of technology.

500
01:07:54,870 --> 01:08:01,050
So that's that's another issue that comes to that.

501
01:08:01,110 --> 01:08:06,360
That's a challenge. And if you have an institutional review board going through your work,

502
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:14,790
they can mitigate the problem of collecting and force you to identify your data.

503
01:08:14,790 --> 01:08:22,350
But if you're using these types of data for programmatic purposes, you really don't have a board or outside committee reviewing your work.

504
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:30,720
So really you have to be mindful of removing all identifiable information from your dataset if you collect it right.

505
01:08:31,230 --> 01:08:35,910
The one thing you can do is always try to collect anonymous data, but we need to get anonymous data.

506
01:08:36,210 --> 01:08:41,490
That means you don't really get spatial information like where people may live or where you conducted the interview.

507
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:47,910
So anonymizing data is kind of antithesis to doing GIS related work.

508
01:08:48,810 --> 01:08:50,580
Now let's say you get spatial data.

509
01:08:50,730 --> 01:08:57,510
How do you deal with that problem to make sure that you don't reveal somebody's identity or reveal information about them?

510
01:08:58,860 --> 01:09:03,150
One thing is to do is aggregate that information to a higher level of geography.

511
01:09:03,780 --> 01:09:07,620
Now, that limits the type of research question you can ask, right?

512
01:09:07,980 --> 01:09:19,980
But it might be critical to do that, to keep the participant, the client for your services safe and private and their information quite confidential.

513
01:09:20,610 --> 01:09:27,420
The other thing you could do is if you have point data, let's see how people's addresses or business addresses,

514
01:09:28,530 --> 01:09:36,120
you can make those points larger on a map depending on how many you have of them, right?

515
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:42,780
So if you have a larger point, you don't know exactly where that individual or that business is located.

516
01:09:43,230 --> 01:09:48,780
And that's one of the solutions that they do recommend is increase the size of the point on a map.

517
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:51,870
If you're not able to aggregate those points to a higher level of.

518
01:09:54,710 --> 01:09:58,850
So just a couple of pointers and you guys will probably come up with these problems,

519
01:09:58,850 --> 01:10:03,770
especially if you use programmatic data for your final assignments.

520
01:10:04,190 --> 01:10:10,550
If you're getting data from the Internet to do your final assignments, you probably don't have to worry about these problems.

521
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:16,610
The other solution is that you need to get access to private data.

522
01:10:17,210 --> 01:10:23,030
And many times you have to analyze and use that private data in a safe and secure facility.

523
01:10:24,050 --> 01:10:26,390
That means you have to go to a facility.

524
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:35,840
But now the technology in terms of remote computing has increased so much you can access what we call virtual data on calls.

525
01:10:36,470 --> 01:10:41,270
So we have systems at the U of M, for example, if you want private information,

526
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:48,290
secure and confidential information and a data set, you don't work on it on your home or office computer.

527
01:10:48,380 --> 01:10:55,400
You log into a safe and secure server, which is like working at a university computer from home or your office,

528
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:59,690
and you have to follow certain rules along with that.

529
01:10:59,750 --> 01:11:06,229
One of those rules are you can't actually share the results with anybody until somebody

530
01:11:06,230 --> 01:11:12,650
at that office reviews them and sees that you can't identify anybody from the tables,

531
01:11:13,010 --> 01:11:22,100
charts or maps that you're making. So technology has helped us get a lot of social and in spatial data,

532
01:11:22,970 --> 01:11:29,060
but it also helps us to use that data in a safe way by using these virtual data enclaves.

533
01:11:29,090 --> 01:11:32,989
And so, Mac, I think you have your hand up. Oh, no, sorry.

534
01:11:32,990 --> 01:11:38,360
I'm just scratching up here. All right. Let's go to the second presenter, Mac.

535
01:11:38,570 --> 01:11:46,660
We'll talk about some examples of the chips and how it's used for remote.

536
01:11:49,130 --> 01:11:53,030
You'll find that as I run into that.

537
01:11:53,240 --> 01:12:04,240
I think it's open. Yeah. Good, good, good. I don't know about y'all, but I deeply love Halloween in a way that is scary.

538
01:12:04,250 --> 01:12:07,639
So I was looking for templates and I found this one.

539
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:08,540
I was really excited about it.

540
01:12:08,550 --> 01:12:17,570
So I'll be talking about mapping the gaps, which is using GUESS to enhance local health department priority setting and program planning.

541
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:26,600
This was a really long reading, so I chose to just go through two of the case studies instead of all three, just for the sake of time.

542
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:36,560
But in essence, a lot of what the reading was talking about was just that health apartments, basically their budgets are shrinking, shrinking.

543
01:12:36,890 --> 01:12:38,120
And there's something else to manage.

544
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:45,800
All of these tasks like educating on health issues, coordinating care services, building community partnerships, gaining their own funding,

545
01:12:46,460 --> 01:12:53,690
creating and influencing policy, as well as like monitoring, like community health and also program management.

546
01:12:53,690 --> 01:12:59,720
And this is a really valuable tool that can be used to see like what is there and also what is not.

547
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:07,940
So this paper highlighted three case studies in which GIS was used and nontraditional ways to kind of help track gaps and services.

548
01:13:08,390 --> 01:13:13,790
Right. Prioritize program locations, influence policy, reallocate funds and track health behaviors.

549
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:19,219
And then I'm going to try I'm going to do a quick overview of the two of the three case studies and then refer back

550
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:26,240
to what enables and inhibits a local health department from being able to use like this for mapping the gaps.

551
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:30,290
So this first one is one of the first maps that they put up there.

552
01:13:30,290 --> 01:13:37,010
It's a chloroplast map that shows H1N1 vaccination rates in service planning areas in L.A. County.

553
01:13:37,340 --> 01:13:45,230
So this is one of the ones that they did without the more improved, so to speak, this strategy.

554
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:50,149
So why are your ideas about why there might be a lower uptake rates in square one?

555
01:13:50,150 --> 01:13:54,890
So this, like the smart one is the like lightest lowest uptake rates to the darkest.

556
01:14:02,990 --> 01:14:07,100
If you like, the locations where you can readily access a vaccine.

557
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:11,029
I think that's just not an area. Yeah, exactly. Whether you've been here like this.

558
01:14:11,030 --> 01:14:21,980
Yeah. Yeah, that here is, I think, South Central, a predominantly African-American and Latino.

559
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:34,200
They're getting ahead of me. Oh. That's why I come back to the fold on so many.

560
01:14:34,290 --> 01:14:39,319
You. So you might get in what someone was saying, ignoring the information.

561
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:45,059
That's very good information. But what you might do if that was the issue you kind of came upon is be like, Oh,

562
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:51,290
we need to build more vaccination sites in that area or we need to put more educational materials out there or

563
01:14:51,290 --> 01:14:58,210
send more professionals or do additional research as to like why the population is not up taking the vaccine.

564
01:14:58,220 --> 01:15:00,320
So hold out your heads. It comes back.

565
01:15:01,970 --> 01:15:08,690
So we're going to go into a case study and kind of learn more about their more advanced ways of doing this and come back to that one.

566
01:15:08,690 --> 01:15:14,130
So this is an initially proposed map for Palm Beach County, Florida.

567
01:15:14,150 --> 01:15:15,910
It does not. It's kind of hard to read.

568
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:21,079
That was one of the weaknesses I thought of in this paper is just like all of these maps I found very difficult to read.

569
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:28,130
But anyway, so they're trying to understand, do uninsured residents have adequate access to like to health care?

570
01:15:28,460 --> 01:15:34,310
So the initial kind of solution that they proposed was that we just need to build more

571
01:15:34,340 --> 01:15:38,450
health care centers so that like the actual range of people that are being helped is more,

572
01:15:39,530 --> 01:15:43,040
but there's not enough information really to do that.

573
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:47,720
So they have this map just shows where they are. And then the green is like the proposed sites.

574
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:52,610
So and then the like yellow shaded is like the uninsured in that area.

575
01:15:53,480 --> 01:16:00,620
So anyway, is a medically uninsured or medically underserved area with high proportions of uninsured people.

576
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:07,340
So this was the initial. But the staff at the ABA health clinics were also interested in understanding

577
01:16:07,340 --> 01:16:10,850
like what are the clinical staffing and resource levels were appropriate.

578
01:16:11,150 --> 01:16:20,960
So their answer was to use jazz to overlay to two different sources of data.

579
01:16:21,350 --> 01:16:28,370
So they have not only looked at like the number of medically underserved or uninsured people that were being

580
01:16:28,370 --> 01:16:35,180
served at each clinic and chloroplast so like the darker is the greater proportion of uninsured people,

581
01:16:35,390 --> 01:16:38,900
but also the proportion of uninsured people that were being served at the health clinics.

582
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:42,680
So here in this like ramping health center, but, you know,

583
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:49,370
there's a large proportion of uninsured people and about half the people that go to the clinic are uninsured.

584
01:16:49,700 --> 01:16:59,239
So what you're learning is it's like answering a bigger question of like and gives like a more interesting answer of like cost effectiveness.

585
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:03,979
So it's looking at the number of full time staff that work there.

586
01:17:03,980 --> 01:17:11,270
So thinking about the number of full time staff, the proportion of uninsured people that actually go to those clinics,

587
01:17:11,570 --> 01:17:14,840
and then the number of uninsured people that are proportionate to the area.

588
01:17:15,140 --> 01:17:17,180
What you come up with is a much better solution.

589
01:17:17,180 --> 01:17:22,160
Rather than pouring all of this money into building a bunch of new clinics, that would take a really long time.

590
01:17:22,460 --> 01:17:25,940
You actually can just improve staffing ratios at existing clinics.

591
01:17:26,690 --> 01:17:35,780
So I think that they decided that like physician physician assistants were more likely to be seen like seeing uninsured patients than doctors.

592
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:40,220
So they can increase the number of physicians assistants at these areas,

593
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:50,180
which would improve the staffing and improve the number of people who could get seen at a high, high traffic clinic like this 1901.

594
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:56,870
And establishing partnerships with other clinics would actually do the same thing as building all of these clinics.

595
01:17:56,870 --> 01:18:02,660
So it's saving a bunch of money, saving a bunch of time. And so that's the question I'm gonna skip.

596
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:07,220
It's I'm afraid of time, but like other factors related to social determinants of health,

597
01:18:07,460 --> 01:18:14,060
I think Avery did a really good job covering those, like how far they have to walk, you know, what their access to transportation is, etc.

598
01:18:17,030 --> 01:18:20,149
So the other maps that are produced for this case,

599
01:18:20,150 --> 01:18:24,760
I think there are like for maybe advanced the use of clinical data beyond like

600
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:29,959
just points on a map to help provide important contextual information to address

601
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:35,780
the the questions that the and I know the Palm Beach County Health Department

602
01:18:35,780 --> 01:18:41,990
had and gives them better ways to organize and deliver health care services.

603
01:18:42,470 --> 01:18:46,290
So. This one.

604
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:48,839
You also got to have me in class because you already showed this one.

605
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:55,829
But it's another quarter class map of L.A. County where they were asking, like, how can we refocus the program,

606
01:18:55,830 --> 01:19:07,050
which is based around reducing obesity in L.A. County and improving active activeness actually

607
01:19:07,470 --> 01:19:12,900
activity levels with children and meet the needs of a greater proportion of the at risk population.

608
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:19,340
So one thing that to note about this is that this program only serves people or like

609
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:26,100
areas that are over 50% populated by people at 185% of the federal poverty level.

610
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:30,780
So everything that's read is showing you those areas.

611
01:19:30,780 --> 01:19:37,739
So anything I think in this like light orange color is 42 or 30 to 49%.

612
01:19:37,740 --> 01:19:46,290
So what they did was that this this shows that like with some exceptions, they're pretty much meeting their goal of serving this area,

613
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:55,830
but that they if they moved it to these like orange areas, you can see you'll see that it's not as cut and dry as that.

614
01:19:56,160 --> 01:20:07,470
So what they did was they overlaid the 32 for 39 or 40 to 49% of residents and then also overlaid it with the prevalence of obesity map.

615
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:13,739
So the health department was able to see where and the areas of possible expanded qualification.

616
01:20:13,740 --> 01:20:16,920
The need was the greatest for health, education, programing and outreach.

617
01:20:17,370 --> 01:20:22,829
So these local county health departments can use maps like these to see where the hotspots

618
01:20:22,830 --> 01:20:27,410
are of need and compare those to the parameters that their programs have to exist with.

619
01:20:27,420 --> 01:20:33,930
And so how well the local health department and its partners are currently targeting health,

620
01:20:33,930 --> 01:20:41,100
education and health promotion activities is kind of like a micro level approach to this, but you can also take it to Amazon on a macro.

621
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:47,579
So Amazon might being able might be like comparing this map to a map of a different county

622
01:20:47,580 --> 01:20:52,410
and seeing how we could emulate what they're doing to be able to like recreate it.

623
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:54,210
Or on a macro level,

624
01:20:54,930 --> 01:21:04,110
it can be used as like an external communication tool to influence state and federal policymakers to change the threshold of a grant

625
01:21:04,110 --> 01:21:11,480
or a policy that allows them to expand into these areas that they're needed but they're not currently allowed to expand into.

626
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:21,270
So I have a couple of questions here, is like, how could a map like this assist in program planning or an implementation and evaluation?

627
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:37,309
Do you think like like noticing where the hot spots were then like in the program planning,

628
01:21:37,310 --> 01:21:42,629
you can learn about contextual factors of this population and then better develop the programs

629
01:21:42,630 --> 01:21:47,300
to be more applicable to certain populations because some very like the northern areas,

630
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:50,300
maybe like population, may be very different than the more the southern area.

631
01:21:50,300 --> 01:21:54,080
So you don't have to change your program. Yeah, exactly. Exactly.

632
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:59,840
Something else for evaluation, too, would be able like looking at those two years into a program,

633
01:22:00,140 --> 01:22:03,200
you're seeing that you're doing what you need to be do need to be doing.

634
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:08,840
But there are places where you could grow and things that you could do to improve the reach of your program long term.

635
01:22:11,310 --> 01:22:17,750
So the last one was about Alameda County and it was emergency room visits.

636
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:23,760
So that was actually very interesting, like looking at kind of that social spatial data that Avery was talking about.

637
01:22:24,690 --> 01:22:27,419
But I was afraid I was going to go way, way over. I did that.

638
01:22:27,420 --> 01:22:35,790
So through the interviews that the authors conducted with the local health departments, they were able to create this conceptual,

639
01:22:35,790 --> 01:22:41,609
not basically understanding what it would take to implement this approach all over the country.

640
01:22:41,610 --> 01:22:45,989
And if you notice, there are a lot of things that it would take to implement this.

641
01:22:45,990 --> 01:22:49,889
So first and foremost, being access to geo enabled data.

642
01:22:49,890 --> 01:22:54,629
So population health and local health department services program data.

643
01:22:54,630 --> 01:22:59,820
For the most part, I think that most local health departments would be able to get a get a hold of that.

644
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:04,650
But the first thing that came to mind coming from where I do is just rural communities,

645
01:23:04,950 --> 01:23:11,159
is that like we talked about, some people are like, I will not have a phone like that sounds surprising,

646
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:19,469
but there are a lot of people in rural areas that refuse any kind of technology because they are so afraid of being tracked that if a rural,

647
01:23:19,470 --> 01:23:21,690
local health department were to try and do something like this,

648
01:23:21,690 --> 01:23:26,220
it might cause an uproar in the community or they might not even have access to it in the first place.

649
01:23:27,060 --> 01:23:32,700
So that was one of the barriers is access to quality data and then the technical and technical capacity,

650
01:23:33,540 --> 01:23:40,530
resources for mapping analysis, human financial software, even just money to pay for it in the first place.

651
01:23:41,490 --> 01:23:47,630
All of that are harder to reach for, like small local health departments or rural local health departments versus like

652
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:52,740
a large one or a well-financed one and a responsive organizational structure.

653
01:23:52,740 --> 01:23:58,260
This is something that they talk about a lot in the in the reading is just how important it is

654
01:23:58,260 --> 01:24:06,569
to have an organization that can make room for this kind of analysis and be able to facilitate,

655
01:24:06,570 --> 01:24:12,390
pay for and sustain continual analysis for program building and implementation,

656
01:24:13,620 --> 01:24:18,840
and then also being able to use it to evaluate, reevaluate, using strategic planning.

657
01:24:19,350 --> 01:24:26,639
And then finally, just priority setting. So creating a strategic plan, using health assessments, creating or using,

658
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:30,480
going along with guidelines on political mandate and planning with a geographic focus.

659
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:37,050
So it would require that you kind of go back to the foundations of the way that you implement your programs and build them,

660
01:24:37,350 --> 01:24:42,180
and then go use this GIS pair and then go through the cycle again.

661
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:54,150
So but one of the facilitations things that they talked about was a champion staff I have some beef with this is like I realize,

662
01:24:54,450 --> 01:24:59,370
I realize that a champion staff is important because if someone says we want to do this,

663
01:24:59,670 --> 01:25:04,410
it's the only way a lot of places will be like, okay, we can try this because they're pushing for it and trying to do it.

664
01:25:04,830 --> 01:25:12,180
But at the same time, we all know that it's really hard to stand up in front of them and be like, I think we should change everything that we do.

665
01:25:12,450 --> 01:25:15,569
And you find a lot of pushback and you want to map this.

666
01:25:15,570 --> 01:25:23,070
But and I think the great thing about this in particular is that they had case studies to kind of give basis for this.

667
01:25:23,340 --> 01:25:29,280
But at the same time, you know, some places that really, really need something like this might just be like,

668
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:32,070
we don't have the funding, we don't have the time, we don't have the access.

669
01:25:33,090 --> 01:25:40,319
And so I would really like to see kind of on like a national or a state level implementation of this

670
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:45,629
or like education around this so that more people are more familiar with it and feel more comfortable,

671
01:25:45,630 --> 01:25:49,709
kind of like bringing it into like a local health department setting and then

672
01:25:49,710 --> 01:25:54,210
access to outside funding and training because we have a whole class for guys,

673
01:25:54,210 --> 01:25:57,060
but others don't. So we're back.

674
01:25:58,200 --> 01:26:06,840
So given what we've learned, what kind of information would make this map more useful to an LHD to improve like a program?

675
01:26:13,180 --> 01:26:18,790
What percentage of people attended each of the park sites in those areas?

676
01:26:19,090 --> 01:26:28,419
Yeah, absolutely. Also, I. If those I guess if those locations were like places where they normally rent or if

677
01:26:28,420 --> 01:26:32,290
there's like any way to understand like how they got there or something like that.

678
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:37,570
Yeah, absolutely. Another one that Ritesh mentioned earlier is like the racial makeup.

679
01:26:40,150 --> 01:26:43,450
Anyone else have any ideas? Poverty level.

680
01:26:44,020 --> 01:26:51,070
Yeah, that's a great idea. Yeah, absolutely.

681
01:26:51,430 --> 01:26:56,350
So then a new kind of approach to this might be reallocating funding.

682
01:26:56,620 --> 01:27:01,629
So if it's a high poverty area and we might want to put more funding into the clinics

683
01:27:01,630 --> 01:27:06,490
so that they're real nice and clean and a place where people can come and feel safe.

684
01:27:07,390 --> 01:27:12,549
Or we might want to reallocate staff like there might not be enough staff and so one for people to go.

685
01:27:12,550 --> 01:27:19,180
And if it's like a high proportion of like maybe like low education or something like that,

686
01:27:19,180 --> 01:27:25,540
you could do more of those like health education, but then you're tailoring it to be better for the population that lives there.

687
01:27:25,810 --> 01:27:32,590
So ultimately, your interventions are targeted, they're more specific, and they're ultimately more cost effective.

688
01:27:33,060 --> 01:27:41,170
Public schools. So the good, the bad. That's so I think that's one of the strengths.

689
01:27:41,170 --> 01:27:45,580
I thought, as I mentioned earlier, that the justifications in case building was really strong.

690
01:27:46,390 --> 01:27:50,950
I actually found this really easy to read for other than the fact that it was 70 pages long.

691
01:27:50,950 --> 01:28:00,639
But I liked learning about it and I think that they were clear and concise so that if you weren't an effort person or an HPC person,

692
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:05,950
you could read it and kind of understand what they were getting at. And great set of case study examples.

693
01:28:06,940 --> 01:28:12,309
The last section that I didn't really get to touch about but is in there is resources for implementation.

694
01:28:12,310 --> 01:28:21,310
So they gave free like genius mapping tools, ways to get jazz training for free so that those like smaller,

695
01:28:21,310 --> 01:28:26,080
like local county health departments could overcome some of the existing barriers and be

696
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:31,470
able to access this for like a reduced cost and the last being like accessible options.

697
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:40,680
So one thing that I really like when people do this is that they give barriers, but they also give solutions, free ways to access it.

698
01:28:41,170 --> 01:28:44,770
Love a free way to get something and then ways to learn.

699
01:28:44,770 --> 01:28:48,370
That doesn't require that you have to go through your employer or pay extra.

700
01:28:49,390 --> 01:28:58,180
And then some of the weaknesses. So this one was, I think, the worst for me of the map.

701
01:28:58,180 --> 01:29:02,049
Readability is just like once I stared at it for about 15 minutes.

702
01:29:02,050 --> 01:29:08,770
I understood that they were trying to get at. But I've been told in every class that I've ever done it, data design is that don't do a pie chart.

703
01:29:09,130 --> 01:29:16,590
And so when they overlaid a pie chart onto a quarter black knob, I was like, I am so lost and I don't know what you're asking,

704
01:29:17,470 --> 01:29:24,010
so I don't know if I have a solution to what could be better than this paragraph,

705
01:29:24,010 --> 01:29:29,790
but I would like to see an improved like map readability so that people can like better piece it apart.

706
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:37,090
Something that I've seen is like hovering. So if you are on your laptop, you can hover and it'll give you some additional information about that.

707
01:29:37,090 --> 01:29:43,239
Could be helpful, although it's not if you're publishing because obviously you can't publish and hover at the same time.

708
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:47,920
So and it doesn't explain accompanying analysis thoroughly.

709
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:53,829
So some of the concepts I talked about were highly correlational.

710
01:29:53,830 --> 01:29:57,309
So we can assume or we can think that that might be the problem.

711
01:29:57,310 --> 01:30:03,580
But what really needs to be happen is additional analysis or interviews or data collection.

712
01:30:03,580 --> 01:30:07,240
And they mentioned, I think there were like a couple of sentences where they talked about this,

713
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:12,580
but they didn't actually talk about what that would look like or it's like what kind of expenses it would be.

714
01:30:13,960 --> 01:30:20,710
And so that leads into my last one, is that explanation of the cost or process of collecting all the additional data.

715
01:30:20,710 --> 01:30:25,750
So like, especially if you're the champion stuff and you're like, let's do this.

716
01:30:25,750 --> 01:30:28,600
I have all of these free resources and they're like, okay, great.

717
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:31,899
And then you hit a wall where you're like, Okay, well, we need to do more data research.

718
01:30:31,900 --> 01:30:37,630
And they're like, while we don't have funding for that or like we thought that this would be one and done and it's not.

719
01:30:38,590 --> 01:30:46,180
So I think that it would be helpful either in like a follow up or in the future to say like we got these results by doing X,

720
01:30:46,180 --> 01:30:49,690
Y and Z and this is how much it costs and this is what it looks like so that you can

721
01:30:49,690 --> 01:30:54,340
really create a proposal and like take it to someone and be able to do something with it.

722
01:30:54,700 --> 01:31:03,300
So these are some of the limitations that they talked about case studies as examples, like they're not sure of the continuity.

723
01:31:03,310 --> 01:31:05,470
These are like point in time examples.

724
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:12,430
So over time with the Los Angeles example, for example, wow, you ever say something so many times, it's not really real.

725
01:31:12,820 --> 01:31:21,190
That's how you hope l.a. That was just a screenshot point in time, so they would have to either redo the analysis.

726
01:31:21,510 --> 01:31:26,640
Again or they would want to do it yearly. How often would they want to pull that data?

727
01:31:27,570 --> 01:31:31,799
And it's not a replacement they mentioned for spatial analysis or assessment techniques.

728
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:37,080
So you can't say, Oh, we'll just make a map of it instead of talking to community members, you still need to do that.

729
01:31:37,290 --> 01:31:43,680
This is more of a supplemental technique that gives you more hard data in order to build a case for something.

730
01:31:45,030 --> 01:31:49,140
So I talked about this a little bit earlier, too, but smaller and less resourced,

731
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:55,440
local health departments will struggle to find or collect the kind of data needed to implement.

732
01:31:55,740 --> 01:32:02,190
And I just feel very strongly about rural areas because they just don't have access to a lot of this.

733
01:32:02,190 --> 01:32:09,500
And it's hard because like we've seen with the lung cancer mortality, when I created my own map for Tennessee, like all of them are blank.

734
01:32:09,750 --> 01:32:13,980
There's like five counties that have like maternal health data.

735
01:32:14,370 --> 01:32:20,100
And I just am so interested in knowing, like, what we can do about that and like how we can improve it.

736
01:32:21,540 --> 01:32:27,720
I don't know. I love to help people and there's a steep learning curve, but you need significant buy in from staff.

737
01:32:28,050 --> 01:32:35,460
So just trying to convince people and get them going. Something else that I was thinking up or that they mentioned and I was thinking about was like,

738
01:32:35,820 --> 01:32:40,680
how do we reframe questions, research questions to ask that like service component?

739
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:44,339
So rather than asking like, are we meeting the need?

740
01:32:44,340 --> 01:32:51,000
It's like we're just getting, we're asking, are we meeting the need, what services are needed rather than what is the need itself?

741
01:32:51,330 --> 01:32:57,510
So that kind of changes the way that we're educated around public health questions and like how we do this kind of work,

742
01:32:58,470 --> 01:33:02,310
which is more of like a large scale change that kind of influence us,

743
01:33:02,670 --> 01:33:10,740
and then identifying available data to characterize the service component and identifying the ways in which maps can best effect data.

744
01:33:11,010 --> 01:33:13,170
So going back to that pie chart issue.

745
01:33:15,270 --> 01:33:25,440
So key takeaways and implement and implications, jazz can be used to compare what kind of services exist to where the need is.

746
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:31,770
So understanding, going back to the title of it all is Mapping the Gap.

747
01:33:31,780 --> 01:33:37,560
So where are we missing and where is the need exist and where could we improve services?

748
01:33:37,980 --> 01:33:45,930
And then the method could also help health departments integrate information and communicate it clearly to staff and stakeholders,

749
01:33:46,770 --> 01:33:56,120
which I think is huge, considering how much of our country is now really doubting scientific information of here's data.

750
01:33:56,130 --> 01:34:03,660
It's not just that we talk to people and we say that this is true. Like, Here's a map, here is what it is clearly and concisely.

751
01:34:03,960 --> 01:34:11,700
And then ultimately that I think the big and simple implication of this and the takeaway is that this can be used internally or externally.

752
01:34:11,700 --> 01:34:18,749
So internally for grant proposals, program planning, assessment, program management evaluation,

753
01:34:18,750 --> 01:34:25,200
and then externally to advocate for policy change so that it's all.

754
01:34:25,830 --> 01:34:31,470
Thank you. I'm going to close this.

755
01:34:31,890 --> 01:34:36,780
Thank you, Mark. That was extremely thoughtful and appreciated.

756
01:34:37,710 --> 01:34:41,880
All right. Okay.

757
01:34:42,510 --> 01:34:47,460
Let's see. I don't want to add anything more. I think Matt covered it really well.

758
01:34:48,690 --> 01:34:54,809
I think what I would like you guys all to do now is do either two of these one or one of

759
01:34:54,810 --> 01:35:01,590
these two things practice any of the lab activities you like right up to the last one.

760
01:35:02,310 --> 01:35:13,170
Whatever helps you get more familiar and more confident with the software or or and I guess work on assignments one and two.

761
01:35:14,670 --> 01:35:23,430
So the rest of the time is your time to do what you think is most important for you to make some progress in this course.

762
01:35:23,880 --> 01:35:27,120
And I'm going to be here to help with any questions you want.

763
01:35:28,160 --> 01:35:47,600
All right. Most serious issues, I think.

764
01:35:50,420 --> 01:35:55,730
It's the question. You know, I just don't get when I go slow.

765
01:35:55,940 --> 01:36:12,520
So I follow this idea and it's like, oh, I have the same issue basically like this in terms of getting me to open up here on this drive.

766
01:36:12,910 --> 01:36:16,380
I thought to myself, I'm going to be an individual and this is not it. Right.

767
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:20,180
This is very interesting.

768
01:36:21,120 --> 01:36:29,360
Okay. Well, maybe maybe I'll play you because the way you said it, I had decided on 30 something, and I see what's been going on here.

769
01:36:30,640 --> 01:36:36,600
I think so. So here it goes.

770
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:46,820
Oh, so you think what you're doing is horrible because now you can drive on a job like this.

771
01:36:47,950 --> 01:36:53,050
And I said, you know, you should explore her differences that we had.

772
01:36:54,410 --> 01:37:04,070
Yeah. So you have to do go to her making your money and you know, and now, you know, you're dead.

773
01:37:05,180 --> 01:37:09,290
And I don't want to see the names that are still there.

774
01:37:09,350 --> 01:37:25,130
So I think that's a problem with me, because I think it was a solution that I had never heard of a frequency celebrity for the first time in my life.

775
01:37:25,820 --> 01:37:29,930
You know, I think that is most right, you know?

776
01:37:32,580 --> 01:37:43,500
Yeah. Yes. Is it something I need to worry about?

777
01:37:48,280 --> 01:37:53,900
Maybe you can pick on the Native Americans just like they were.

778
01:37:55,110 --> 01:38:00,540
Oh, my. So do we. I guess we want to look at the map side.

779
01:38:00,860 --> 01:38:12,879
Oh, yeah, I'm going to have that. Yeah. Which I'm going to call our section.

780
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:24,790
That what we'll do momentarily for now. I'm like, Oh, I just had to put up the video that you've got for me now.

781
01:38:29,590 --> 01:38:34,590
Just like from the White House, right?

782
01:38:36,490 --> 01:38:40,480
So that. Yeah, there's like a fitting for dressed dressing room.

783
01:38:41,110 --> 01:38:52,300
So it's like, really like, why do I feel like, you know, how I know it's going to be a.

784
01:38:54,790 --> 01:39:08,050
Yeah. I think in the sense that anyone who specializes in it will be in a software package, you know.

785
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:33,630
In June of last year because Tina Turner, I guess, going to be part of it is going to be.

786
01:39:36,390 --> 01:39:41,360
And I really do think that that's tragic.

787
01:39:42,970 --> 01:39:59,720
I think for. You had a terrorist attack and yet the secretary of state is unfair.

788
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:06,480
And the message it is now come to this is.

789
01:40:09,970 --> 01:40:18,980
This should be the end of the year to have those who are.

790
01:40:23,200 --> 01:40:28,830
One. This is what we would be doing. It would be getting better at that.

791
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:39,970
Yeah. The first thing to do is pick an article and then work on it and try to recreate it.

792
01:40:40,340 --> 01:40:44,370
A version that doesn't have to be a sustainable business.

793
01:40:46,650 --> 01:40:53,910
Although I know that someone for the next 20 years it's possible.

794
01:40:54,900 --> 01:41:02,820
Okay. So this is one that you mentioned anonymously, which is kind of what you would think.

795
01:41:03,120 --> 01:41:18,780
You could just have, you know, just think about. And then there's the issue I find interesting is for general and the research institutions,

796
01:41:19,680 --> 01:41:31,710
do you try to help them with missions which links in with how you're.

797
01:41:33,380 --> 01:41:37,880
Yeah. Stuff like that. An article.

798
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:42,290
Right. Yeah. Little too hydrogen weapons.

799
01:41:43,870 --> 01:41:48,840
Yes. Because we work with governments. Should have a solution where?

800
01:41:48,920 --> 01:41:52,389
Even just a Google search, right? Yeah. We haven't started,

801
01:41:52,390 --> 01:42:00,290
which is good news to get rid of people saying you're interested in signing off on a

802
01:42:00,290 --> 01:42:04,999
special position in the U.S. and just see if you can find something to that effect.

803
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:12,889
Topic in populations with some special instructions that start with the date for

804
01:42:12,890 --> 01:42:17,240
this assignment that you won't be able to find an article that matches with you.

805
01:42:17,770 --> 01:42:20,870
Yeah, I know. Yeah. Yeah.

806
01:42:22,100 --> 01:42:30,790
We check in on this word for some time.

807
01:42:31,850 --> 01:42:39,590
Yeah, yeah. Individual. But you can coordinate. You can't just say, hey, we're behind this project.

808
01:42:40,510 --> 01:42:52,450
One person said, Oh, yeah, oh, no, no, you can do more work.

809
01:42:52,560 --> 01:43:04,740
Oh, right. So doing emails and I get back to that now, I'm like, Yeah, yeah.

810
01:43:06,680 --> 01:43:10,990
So doing the math, it's like that just and it's a start.

811
01:43:12,210 --> 01:43:17,050
Right. Yeah. We have every application of various data.

812
01:43:19,320 --> 01:43:22,740
Yeah. Looking like this. We have to close it somewhere.

813
01:43:22,770 --> 01:43:28,940
Yeah. In here somehow in L.A. I don't really take that information in, like a commercial use.

814
01:43:29,190 --> 01:43:33,490
Yeah. Yeah.

815
01:43:33,510 --> 01:43:38,250
Or you can address this. Do you also want to take my decision to address this?

816
01:43:38,860 --> 01:43:43,500
No. Okay. We haven't covered the borders, but.

817
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:48,900
Well, if you want to sort that out now.

818
01:43:49,030 --> 01:43:56,850
Yeah, I'm sure you know. Okay. Okay. So there is that you find the regular conventions in this area.

819
01:43:57,480 --> 01:44:04,240
There's not much. It's something I just.

820
01:44:06,590 --> 01:44:10,420
Oh, I. Coming from Western Hemisphere to nice.

821
01:44:12,680 --> 01:44:19,280
This is a call management this.

822
01:44:27,680 --> 01:44:34,100
Just add sorry and ship it out because he was fresh off the boat.

823
01:44:36,660 --> 01:44:42,210
We also do have the addresses of the survey.

824
01:44:43,230 --> 01:44:48,920
Yes. And there's something like this. We actually are the 100 times as a.

825
01:44:49,270 --> 01:45:02,510
Yeah. So then when you in the desert on the other side and so and I realize it was done

826
01:45:02,910 --> 01:45:08,220
at least like something else and then come up with a when I saw that with a map.

827
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:16,920
Maybe I was thinking of something like, you know, using a good would be helpful.

828
01:45:17,260 --> 01:45:20,740
These are I thought it was.

829
01:45:20,910 --> 01:45:27,170
I have it. Is there. Sorry. I just want to know, why do you use.

830
01:45:27,540 --> 01:45:34,020
I always. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's like there's always, you know.

831
01:45:34,830 --> 01:45:43,820
And I guess I'll have to just, like, say, yes, I can do like a five year old analysis and exercise listening to somebody.

832
01:45:44,760 --> 01:45:47,940
Sorry. Yeah. 17 year old found it.

833
01:45:49,110 --> 01:45:56,879
The number of these kinds of properties and these are really good because this is good for a period of time.

834
01:45:56,880 --> 01:46:03,240
So, like, you know, you can look at these things and right click on this and.

835
01:46:03,330 --> 01:46:09,110
Yeah. Japan.

836
01:46:11,090 --> 01:46:25,370
And also from this Thursday, I can definitely say that. I would say that, you know, just the option that Putin displayed.

837
01:46:40,700 --> 01:46:44,150
Thank you. X-Y table two points. Okay.

838
01:46:48,340 --> 01:46:55,420
You would have to have a new spreadsheet at the end of this year.

839
01:46:56,400 --> 01:46:59,560
It is only the relevant information you want. Yeah.

840
01:47:00,100 --> 01:47:09,220
That also includes the corn sirup. Input was taken into the company and then they will finish in the moment.

841
01:47:09,610 --> 01:47:20,990
What we're going to do is, you know, I'm like know you do your own research and that's it.

842
01:47:21,640 --> 01:47:35,170
In this period you kind of translate into this because you can, you know, so that's your graphics card system.

843
01:47:35,830 --> 01:47:44,140
And so you can there's multiple options to put together that we need.

844
01:47:45,070 --> 01:48:00,910
You can have you see this picture or you can make it that you give them the data for these two points here based on whatever important distributors.

845
01:48:00,910 --> 01:48:07,059
And I guess, okay, so it's relatively simple to do that.

846
01:48:07,060 --> 01:48:13,450
If you have a whole section on the data and displaying all that, I think that's good.

847
01:48:14,580 --> 01:48:19,670
That's okay. But you're still in time for the final stuff.

848
01:48:20,050 --> 01:48:26,590
But if you have that to do for your second assignment, I can walk you through it.

849
01:48:27,470 --> 01:48:35,350
Also, there's another way to learn how to do it on your own, because the next year is super cool.

850
01:48:36,820 --> 01:48:46,230
So if you type in Jupiter and the space pro display that you want to do, that couldn't help you with that.

851
01:48:46,930 --> 01:48:52,750
Right. And just to see if I know how to use to do.

852
01:48:54,280 --> 01:49:04,790
I just pro at least that's what we're doing, right?

853
01:49:05,860 --> 01:49:19,900
Yeah. We're not even going to point out our earnings in terms of now for other companies as well.

854
01:49:23,180 --> 01:49:33,610
So for the most relevant version of this week, Fred, this pandemic already has thousands of years before the sort of.

855
01:49:34,890 --> 01:49:44,410
Yeah, that's why people complain, point out and something happens and we'll give you.

856
01:49:46,060 --> 01:49:50,340
Yeah. Years ago at this point.

857
01:49:50,390 --> 01:49:54,890
I know that's kind of what you do. Yeah. Yeah, I appreciate that.

858
01:49:56,310 --> 01:50:03,090
You know, until the finals, then we can go on to the other side and turn them into points.

859
01:50:03,140 --> 01:50:12,820
Okay. I would just, like, know. Well, I'll show you how to do it in class, but you can also brutally say and go back to your methods.

860
01:50:12,830 --> 01:50:25,370
And in addition to projecting your current nervousness that you could have just been texting.

861
01:50:30,210 --> 01:50:40,380
Yeah. Yeah, including that one. So one thing I'd like you guys to do is get familiar with the idea of mutual respect program.

862
01:50:40,680 --> 01:50:49,650
Right. Because if you notice over the course of the year, the tool that precedes and you just never know which one.

863
01:50:52,380 --> 01:50:58,140
Okay. You can try to do when you don't put more of a project out there.

864
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:01,620
Okay. The toy possibly to make a difference. It's great.

865
01:51:01,620 --> 01:51:07,440
You're doing your own project. You have also more assignments.

866
01:51:07,470 --> 01:51:10,980
Who? Yeah. How much flexibility we have around.

867
01:51:13,470 --> 01:51:18,090
I guess we're using the article here if there's something to read.

868
01:51:18,540 --> 01:51:26,249
Yes. So with that mortgage book article, I have the data and stuff like that.

869
01:51:26,250 --> 01:51:35,490
It has lots of field workers, but some of the groups that are connected to that data don't necessarily have the same things.

870
01:51:35,910 --> 01:51:44,490
Yes, you should find a paper that has insurance because you want and I think the first part of this business around like environmental,

871
01:51:44,820 --> 01:51:48,700
the paper tied together these kind. You try to recreate this.

872
01:51:48,720 --> 01:51:57,810
Yeah. So we find a paper that does make sure our listeners have a background on the radio.

873
01:51:58,270 --> 01:52:02,690
Sure. Yeah, absolutely. It's a version of your own version of that.

874
01:52:02,690 --> 01:52:11,010
We put that on the radio. Cool. Oh, thank you for this question.

875
01:52:11,700 --> 01:52:26,670
So for these assignments, one is you are connected, obviously, but it is also because there was so much that's what I was feeling.

876
01:52:28,500 --> 01:52:36,290
So I that's right. But it's an article that doesn't really matter.

877
01:52:37,110 --> 01:52:44,360
I guess it doesn't matter what you can coordinate really will here and we're going to do something because that's what I was doing.

878
01:52:44,360 --> 01:52:48,200
This is I should work on these fights.

879
01:52:48,200 --> 01:52:53,840
And I think this is a way to show, you know, the first time that I do it, I don't get to have a story.

880
01:52:55,890 --> 01:53:06,950
Okay. But what it is I know that I'm going to make sure because I know when I was when I was watching maps.

881
01:53:08,480 --> 01:53:15,940
Okay. Sure. So this is my version of it and like that.

882
01:53:16,640 --> 01:53:26,330
And then also the rest of the world is at work and hopefully works always.

883
01:53:26,430 --> 01:53:32,280
Okay. Yeah. And see what data these days defining.

884
01:53:32,720 --> 01:53:39,040
Okay. Data. Okay. So the dots on this one is because there is.

885
01:53:39,380 --> 01:53:52,760
Yeah. So whether or not they find that either they pose a risk it and then you also know that you find your parents I

886
01:53:52,760 --> 01:54:01,520
don't know yet but essentially that looks like your responded by so you may not be able to get everything together.

887
01:54:01,820 --> 01:54:05,630
Guess is standard. Okay. That's okay.

888
01:54:06,440 --> 01:54:11,770
You can have a population. See how they measured.

889
01:54:11,890 --> 01:54:24,610
That is a combination of their version of the town and the reference to the final result statements of different things.

890
01:54:24,790 --> 01:54:28,690
So we need to find the source of all the data to go through.

891
01:54:29,590 --> 01:54:33,880
Thank you very much. Well, if you can't plan for that,

892
01:54:33,940 --> 01:54:41,469
you should try to find data that are related to this period of some other lessons

893
01:54:41,470 --> 01:54:47,560
learned to help legal U.S. trade in South Korea and Michigan around this issue.

894
01:54:47,750 --> 01:54:52,030
Okay. I think it's up to us to look at different excuse me, like lung cancer,

895
01:54:52,510 --> 01:54:59,470
because this is something that you've indicated, but it's definitely something that you must be aware is here.

896
01:54:59,500 --> 01:55:05,620
Okay, so then what? Let's find data on my own for the state of Michigan.

897
01:55:05,620 --> 01:55:11,860
Really make sure. Do I how do I do that for him here?

898
01:55:11,950 --> 01:55:15,740
Right. I would like that.

899
01:55:16,260 --> 01:55:25,870
So I guess one of your basic data resources are provided by and so this is how I incorporate all of the data tables.

900
01:55:25,870 --> 01:55:36,099
For example, this this means that after that, because I can change the table because to me I just really because they have a so let's say,

901
01:55:36,100 --> 01:55:46,450
for example, people would have insurance and that is if there was a column that I'm like, I've been doing this.

902
01:55:47,350 --> 01:55:57,010
Like I said, these are the ones she was talking about and I don't like having that.

903
01:55:57,220 --> 01:56:04,450
So you have to look at some of the landscape cancer profiles.

904
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:07,890
Yes. Yes. Okay. So a similar idea for your time.

905
01:56:08,200 --> 01:56:21,510
Oh, so you have to have a geographic identifier in the right race with you all over the state census tract number.

906
01:56:22,210 --> 01:56:26,260
Remember, the scale here is just giving purpose addresses.

907
01:56:26,980 --> 01:56:32,740
Obviously, we're making sure that they get there and then you have to do that.

908
01:56:33,460 --> 01:56:36,490
Okay. We can start showing for these in.

909
01:56:36,820 --> 01:56:42,820
Okay, that's not a problem because I have a girl like it's going to be okay.

910
01:56:42,930 --> 01:56:46,300
So you connect that you have to join it.

911
01:56:46,810 --> 01:56:50,469
So to achieve black boundary, fine. Okay.

912
01:56:50,470 --> 01:56:58,740
So this, this first before you look at the map and the system table has a separate system that.

913
01:56:59,860 --> 01:57:10,480
The race of words goes together, but it also gives people the state cancer profiles on July 24.

914
01:57:11,560 --> 01:57:15,530
In some ways it's possible you'll be able to do it. I know I'll be able to.

915
01:57:15,550 --> 01:57:22,330
Just realizing now how much more complex it is, I thought. But now I'm kind of like, okay, I'm a result of this now.

916
01:57:22,990 --> 01:57:28,790
So you have those exercises around state council coming down to the last few weeks.

917
01:57:30,370 --> 01:57:33,630
Okay. Okay. Okay.

918
01:57:33,850 --> 01:57:40,750
All right. Thank you. Yeah, I think that's a good direction.

919
01:57:42,980 --> 01:57:48,190
He's going to get a Lexus high for doing that.

920
01:57:48,880 --> 01:58:04,060
When you're trying to put time on, not really the problems that I had before or after the whole thing.

921
01:58:04,170 --> 01:58:12,080
Yeah. But again, we are interested in.

922
01:58:16,940 --> 01:58:25,940
I recognize. She lives in the same houses.

923
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:42,450
Because you don't like the description. Yeah, but I had been marveling about the drive through right now.

924
01:58:43,170 --> 01:58:49,800
Okay, so give me an argument that I think will tell us about the city and what you guys are doing here.

925
01:58:50,820 --> 01:58:59,630
Yeah, exactly. Those are pieces. Back.

926
01:59:02,520 --> 01:59:18,460
For. Because if we were to go to bidder their.

927
01:59:23,530 --> 01:59:28,080
The 33 year old. Yeah, I.

928
01:59:30,710 --> 01:59:40,680
Question. But I'm wondering, like, this could be kind of like.

929
01:59:41,810 --> 01:59:46,420
And then, like, this is the place to go.

930
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:55,590
And I guess you like you've got a bit of a playground here or something that they wanted to do, like and that sort of thing and so forth.

931
01:59:55,670 --> 02:00:00,650
That would be kind of the easiest thing that we have to do as.

932
02:00:03,020 --> 02:00:06,520
And then you'd have to have the data for the music piracy part.

933
02:00:09,920 --> 02:00:15,310
I guess it's not like.

934
02:00:17,570 --> 02:00:26,450
Okay. So what's the idea that you want to delete memory off and throw it in countless values and then drag it over and seem like,

935
02:00:26,960 --> 02:00:31,200
you know, almost nothing for them?

936
02:00:31,220 --> 02:00:35,150
Are you using it as a.

937
02:00:36,950 --> 02:00:40,700
That's true to the potential.

938
02:00:41,170 --> 02:00:54,490
I that's what I'm saying is that we need to really understand that this is not going to be happening effectively single use.

939
02:00:55,880 --> 02:01:07,160
So this is something that I think you're going to have to see the visuals.

940
02:01:16,810 --> 02:01:21,110
Have to sell that stuff. Digital.

941
02:01:24,640 --> 02:01:28,120
Steve. No.

942
02:01:31,260 --> 02:01:34,560
Is it because of all the other things besides?

943
02:01:38,660 --> 02:01:50,570
In the room. You don't have to show.

944
02:01:57,820 --> 02:02:03,310
Both contributed to the access. Services.

945
02:02:05,910 --> 02:02:17,080
Evaluation this is based on. No.

946
02:02:32,430 --> 02:02:56,370
You know someone. You know, I'm certain that story and what that means for the future.

947
02:02:58,190 --> 02:03:13,700
It was very interesting about this whole approach from some people in the.

948
02:03:18,090 --> 02:03:21,510
Service station.

949
02:03:25,520 --> 02:03:29,100
I got started on this and.

950
02:03:30,610 --> 02:03:36,100
Start to produce an interest in the problem. We?

951
02:03:40,440 --> 02:04:19,900
First. Oh, I just.

952
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:32,640
So I'm grateful to. And that was kind of.

953
02:04:54,210 --> 02:04:58,450
Was since. That's what I.

954
02:05:02,530 --> 02:05:08,540
You have seen. It's going to work out.

955
02:05:15,390 --> 02:05:27,840
Frustration may not making enough is unusual, but.

956
02:05:35,540 --> 02:05:49,290
Oh, look, I guess they're using your. That's interesting, House Speaker, because that's what it's like.

957
02:05:49,290 --> 02:05:53,150
It's like it's we're like a national holiday, I guess.

958
02:05:53,910 --> 02:05:57,240
Yeah. And so it's like.

959
02:06:00,360 --> 02:06:25,750
Mean. People love to see some skin.

960
02:06:34,600 --> 02:06:50,410
Yeah. Well, I think experience. What is the story it hard a human being.

961
02:06:51,980 --> 02:06:59,370
You have to trust for people to protect.

962
02:07:03,160 --> 02:07:19,380
Story. They do it very well just by working with agencies to do this.

963
02:07:20,280 --> 02:07:39,070
All they want is to go out and say, Oh, yeah, all right.

964
02:07:40,800 --> 02:07:45,150
Oh, yeah, let's just do this.

965
02:07:45,510 --> 02:07:53,730
Yeah. Okay. Yeah, this is their process.

966
02:07:54,150 --> 02:07:57,430
So this is very similar.

967
02:07:57,570 --> 02:08:12,020
This. So you suggested, but.

968
02:08:14,520 --> 02:08:25,000
Oh, I don't know. You single. Yeah, well, so that is an issue, I reckon.

969
02:08:25,640 --> 02:08:31,219
What would it look like to do it right.

970
02:08:31,220 --> 02:08:37,300
To do it. And I guess. How long is it?

971
02:08:41,370 --> 02:08:49,520
I really don't believe that.

972
02:08:51,620 --> 02:08:54,620
Yeah, it's like. It's not like what happened.
