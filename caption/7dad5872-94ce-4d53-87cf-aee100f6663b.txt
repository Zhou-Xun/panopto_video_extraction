1
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,544
As we transition from general
microeconomic concepts to applying those

2
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:16,845
concepts to analyze the performance of
health care markets, it will be important

3
00:00:16,845 --> 00:00:21,740
to have some shared understanding
effects about the US Healthcare System.

4
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,913
You should have examined data
about the US Healthcare system and

5
00:00:24,913 --> 00:00:27,910
some comparative data about
other high income countries.

6
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:32,051
Today we will highlight some of
the key descriptive data that will

7
00:00:32,051 --> 00:00:33,936
provide valuable context for

8
00:00:33,936 --> 00:00:38,321
the discussions we'll be having
during the rest of this course are.

9
00:00:38,321 --> 00:00:42,156
Our learning objectives are to describe
the key economic actors in health and

10
00:00:42,156 --> 00:00:44,457
healthcare, including their objectives and

11
00:00:44,457 --> 00:00:47,997
incentives and to compare public and
private roles in the financing and

12
00:00:47,997 --> 00:00:51,601
delivery of healthcare in the US
relative to other high income nations.

13
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:58,332
We will review data that will help us
answer some of the big questions about

14
00:00:58,332 --> 00:01:03,203
resources used in healthcare, where
they flow and what levels of costs and

15
00:01:03,203 --> 00:01:05,159
health outcomes we achieve.

16
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:10,240
Consistent phenomenon is that richer
countries not only devote more resources

17
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,440
to healthcare in absolute terms, but
also as a share of their economies.

18
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,132
Similarly, as countries
become richer over time,

19
00:01:18,132 --> 00:01:21,840
the share of resources devoted
to healthcare tends to grow.

20
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,528
Therefore it shouldn't be surprising
that the US devotes a high share of GDP

21
00:01:25,528 --> 00:01:28,740
to healthcare relative
to most other countries.

22
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,835
However, the trend line this graph shows
the typical relationship between per

23
00:01:32,835 --> 00:01:36,740
capita income and health spending
in higher income countries.

24
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:41,600
As you can see, the US is the most extreme
positive outlier for this trend spending

25
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,761
about $5,000 more per capita than would
be expected solely based on its income.

26
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,399
Over the last three decades, healthcare
share of GDP has risen about six

27
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:57,191
percentage points in absolute terms,
representing a 50% relative increase.

28
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,230
The vertical bars in the graph
represent times of economic recessions.

29
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:06,319
In other words, times where economic
output was falling, as you see,

30
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:10,476
health care tends to be recession
resistant, so its share of GDP tends to

31
00:02:10,476 --> 00:02:14,840
grow most rapidly during and
shortly following recessions.

32
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,865
Health care tends to account for
a relatively stable or

33
00:02:17,865 --> 00:02:22,140
only slightly increasing share of
GDP when the economy is strong.

34
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:26,222
You can see this when looking at the times
where the two curves come close together,

35
00:02:26,222 --> 00:02:30,261
which represent times when the economy is
growing at close to its full potential.

36
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,988
Please stop the video for

37
00:02:32,988 --> 00:02:36,561
a minute and think about why healthcare
might be recession resistant.

38
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,068
Another way of looking at this is to
compare the growth of health spending

39
00:02:42,068 --> 00:02:43,816
to the overall growth of GDP.

40
00:02:43,816 --> 00:02:48,222
Over the past three decades and even
longer if we took these data further back,

41
00:02:48,222 --> 00:02:52,497
health spending has consistently grown
as fast or faster than overall GDP,

42
00:02:52,497 --> 00:02:57,440
with the largest gaps occurring during and
shortly following recessions.

43
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,607
A couple of reasons healthcare might be
recession resistant are that underlying

44
00:03:01,607 --> 00:03:04,978
healthcare needs are not likely
to decline during recessions and

45
00:03:04,978 --> 00:03:07,675
that the insurance coverage
that enables demand for

46
00:03:07,675 --> 00:03:11,243
healthcare is stable during recessions for
much of the population.

47
00:03:11,243 --> 00:03:16,024
In particular, Medicare coverage is not
lost and those over 65 or eligible for

48
00:03:16,024 --> 00:03:19,120
Medicare due to a qualifying
disability account for

49
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,540
a disproportionate share
of health spending.

50
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,952
Certainly some private coverage
is lost during recessions, but

51
00:03:25,952 --> 00:03:27,876
increases in Medicare enrollment or

52
00:03:27,876 --> 00:03:31,051
use of other programs at least
partially offsets that loss.

53
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,058
One way of assessing the opportunity cost
of healthcare is by the percent of labor

54
00:03:37,058 --> 00:03:41,525
force devoted to the healthcare sector, a
greater share of employment in healthcare

55
00:03:41,525 --> 00:03:44,889
implies fewer skilled workers
are available to other sectors.

56
00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:48,035
As we saw with overall healthcare
spending, employment and

57
00:03:48,035 --> 00:03:50,810
healthcare is also recession resistant,
except for

58
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:54,240
a brief decline during
the early part of the pandemic.

59
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,027
That is, while the rest of
the economy is losing jobs,

60
00:03:57,027 --> 00:04:00,861
healthcare employment tends to be
maintained or even continues growing.

61
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:05,840
Much of the increase occurs during and
shortly following recessions.

62
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,921
If we smooth this trend, the share of
total employment in healthcare rises

63
00:04:09,921 --> 00:04:12,461
by about one percent
point every eight years.

64
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,951
Now that we've seen data on
the total share of the economy and

65
00:04:16,951 --> 00:04:21,839
labor force devoted to healthcare, let's
take a look at where those dollars flow.

66
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,947
The largest category hospital care
accounts for about a third of spending and

67
00:04:25,947 --> 00:04:30,440
the second largest physician
services accounts for about 1/5.

68
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,817
It's also notable that prescription drugs,
which are often a major focus of public

69
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:38,148
and political outrage about
healthcare spending, account for

70
00:04:38,148 --> 00:04:40,440
less than a tenth of all spending.

71
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,161
However, that share has
been growing over time.

72
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,760
The Affordable Care Act was passed in
2010, but it's most important provisions

73
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,940
affecting insurance coverage
didn't go into effect until 2014.

74
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:57,040
Two of these provisions
are particularly significant.

75
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,460
First, the ACA set up health insurance
exchanges in which individuals could

76
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,130
buy coverage.

77
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,490
Those buying on the exchanges
are eligible for

78
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:08,440
subsidies that are phased
out as income rises.

79
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,876
Second, Medicaid eligibility was
extended to households up to 133% of

80
00:05:12,876 --> 00:05:15,140
the federal poverty level.

81
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:18,636
State participation in the Medicaid
expansion was then made optional under

82
00:05:18,636 --> 00:05:20,060
a Supreme Court ruling.

83
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:23,743
And there's still multiple states,
including some large ones like Texas and

84
00:05:23,743 --> 00:05:26,340
Florida who have not expanded Medicaid.

85
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:30,334
Most importantly, we see that the share
of the population without any health

86
00:05:30,334 --> 00:05:32,244
insurance dropped by about a third.

87
00:05:32,244 --> 00:05:35,125
Increase in Medicare accounted for
part of that decline,

88
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:39,340
though it could have been even higher
had it stayed uptake been universal.

89
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,796
We also see an increase in the share
with non-group coverage, but

90
00:05:42,796 --> 00:05:46,810
that might seem smaller than expected
given the implementation of the health

91
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:48,940
insurance exchanges.

92
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:53,493
However many of those enrolled in exchange
plans after the ACA were drawn from those

93
00:05:53,493 --> 00:05:57,640
who would have been in non-group
coverage before the ACA.

94
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:02,581
Not only were the subsidy is not available
before the ACA but pre-ACA non-group plans

95
00:06:02,581 --> 00:06:07,840
often had significant limitations on what
they covered and who they would cover.

96
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,568
Therefore, much of the post ACA
non-group coverage was more

97
00:06:11,568 --> 00:06:15,160
comprehensive came at a lower
out of pocket premium.

98
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,429
It was more available to those with pre
existing conditions than it was before

99
00:06:19,429 --> 00:06:19,961
the ACA.

100
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:24,558
We will now turn to some
international comparisons.

101
00:06:24,558 --> 00:06:27,678
In this figure,
we see that in the typical OECD country,

102
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:32,440
at least 70% of healthcare spending
runs through government programs.

103
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:37,010
The US is among the lowest with only half
of spending through government programs.

104
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:39,440
We can draw our two
inferences from these data.

105
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,828
One of them probably isn't surprising,
but the other one maybe.

106
00:06:42,828 --> 00:06:46,860
Unsurprisingly, given the US reputation
for having a more market oriented

107
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,884
healthcare system than most
other high income nations,

108
00:06:49,884 --> 00:06:53,286
spending through private sources
such as private insurance and

109
00:06:53,286 --> 00:06:57,940
out of pocket payments makes up a much
larger share of spending in the US.

110
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:02,858
Perhaps more surprisingly is the fact that
even in the relatively market oriented

111
00:07:02,858 --> 00:07:07,845
system of the US half of spending runs
through government programs like Medicare,

112
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:09,144
Medicaid and the VA.

113
00:07:09,144 --> 00:07:13,255
Even those with private coverage receive
substantial government subsidies through

114
00:07:13,255 --> 00:07:15,652
the pre tax treatment of
employer paid premiums or

115
00:07:15,652 --> 00:07:19,261
through subsidies directly received
on the health insurance exchanges.

116
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,574
If we compare countries government
spending on healthcare using another

117
00:07:24,574 --> 00:07:28,740
metric, the US actually moves to
the opposite end of the distribution.

118
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,309
Health care accounts for

119
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:34,502
about 15% of all government
spending in typical OECD country.

120
00:07:34,502 --> 00:07:37,826
Even though the US uses more private
sources to pay for healthcare,

121
00:07:37,826 --> 00:07:42,540
healthcare still accounts for a much
larger share of all government spending.

122
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:46,961
This partly reflects the high total
spending in the US simply put 50% of

123
00:07:46,961 --> 00:07:50,169
a large number is more than
70% of a small number and

124
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:56,240
partly reflects lower US spending on some
other government services and programs.

125
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,560
One can also think of this as a proxy for
opportunity cost.

126
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,285
Particularly at the state level,
high spending on healthcare crowds out

127
00:08:03,285 --> 00:08:06,061
spending on other priorities
like higher education.

128
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,229
It is often observed that despite
high healthcare spending in the US,

129
00:08:12,229 --> 00:08:16,291
many population metrics fall short of
those achieved by other countries.

130
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:21,162
Selecting three illustrative metrics,
US life expectancy is about two years

131
00:08:21,162 --> 00:08:24,629
below the OECD average,
US suicide rates are higher and

132
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:29,571
as a measure of disease burden, a much
higher share of the US population suffers

133
00:08:29,571 --> 00:08:33,660
from multiple chronic conditions
compared to the OECD average.

134
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,440
What might explain these
outcome disparities?

135
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,502
Several factors likely contribute.

136
00:08:40,502 --> 00:08:43,507
First, although the US
spends a lot on healthcare,

137
00:08:43,507 --> 00:08:46,112
those resources might be male distributed.

138
00:08:46,112 --> 00:08:48,166
Relative to other OECD countries,

139
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:52,640
Americans are more likely to
be uninsured or underinsured.

140
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,560
Maybe the US places too little
emphasis on preventive care.

141
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,740
There's a mixed picture on that.

142
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:02,008
The US does have high rates of
preventable hospitalizations for

143
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:05,440
conditions like diabetes,
hypertension and asthma.

144
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,316
But Americans are actually more likely
than the OECD average to get services like

145
00:09:09,316 --> 00:09:11,261
flu shots and breast cancer screening.

146
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,640
Maybe there's too little
emphasis on public health.

147
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:20,153
Public health spending is only a small
share of all national health expenditures.

148
00:09:20,153 --> 00:09:25,002
Although it rose from 1.4% of
national health spending in 1962

149
00:09:25,002 --> 00:09:29,461
to a peak of 3.2% in 2002,
it has fallen since that time.

150
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:36,170
Another factor that may explain
disparities in population level outcomes

151
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:40,545
is that healthcare is only one of many
factors that influence health status.

152
00:09:40,545 --> 00:09:44,995
In this figure, the total height of
the bars represents the sum of spending on

153
00:09:44,995 --> 00:09:49,410
healthcare and other social
services that may affect health.

154
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:52,651
Those are services like housing,
education and income support.

155
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:57,811
In terms of total share of GDP devoted
to healthcare and these other services.

156
00:09:57,811 --> 00:10:00,140
The US falls right in the middle.

157
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:04,157
However, the US split that spending
much differently than any other country

158
00:10:04,157 --> 00:10:08,261
spending much more heavily on healthcare
relative to other social services.

159
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:14,210
Maybe you would get greater bang for the
buck from spending the same amount, but

160
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,888
spending it differently.

161
00:10:15,888 --> 00:10:19,907
Even within the US, the ratio of
public spending on healthcare and

162
00:10:19,907 --> 00:10:22,140
social services varies.

163
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:26,400
While any good empirical researcher will
caution that correlation does not improve

164
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,660
causation, is interesting that states with
higher spending on social services and

165
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,640
public health relative to Medicare and

166
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,941
Medicaid had better outcomes on
a variety of important metrics.

167
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:42,111
Finally, it is hard to find clear measures
of quality of care at the system level,

168
00:10:42,111 --> 00:10:46,241
but one possibility is deaths from causes
that could plausibly have been avoided by

169
00:10:46,241 --> 00:10:47,540
better care.

170
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:52,640
Those are causes like diabetes,
hypertensive diseases and certain cancers.

171
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,506
The good news is that across
all countries in this figure,

172
00:10:55,506 --> 00:10:58,240
rates have improved
substantially over time.

173
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,961
The bad news is that the US rates
remain high relative to its peers.

174
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:08,040
Our dive into the data yields
several important takeaway messages.

175
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,509
First, the US is an outlier in
total healthcare spending but

176
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:14,540
does not get uniformly good outcomes.

177
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:18,380
Understanding why it likely requires
us to look at factors beyond the formal

178
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,040
healthcare system.

179
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,696
Second, more Americans became insured
following the ACA going into effect, but

180
00:11:24,696 --> 00:11:27,640
un-insurance remains an issue.

181
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:31,884
Third, the mix of spending on programs
that may influence population health

182
00:11:31,884 --> 00:11:36,517
status is very different in the US than in
other OECD countries, with the US spending

183
00:11:36,517 --> 00:11:40,261
less on social services and
public health relative to health care.
