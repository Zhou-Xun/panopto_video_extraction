1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:06,310
It was [INAUDIBLE] all over, I guess.

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:25,340
I guess it's for anyone else. I just want to see what should I not like to know?

3
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:35,969
This is not a small group today. It's definitely not everybody stopping by for this Saturday morning.

4
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:40,740
So it's going to be fun. I mean, you're just like, I like what's going to happen.

5
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:50,010
So today we're going to talk about how insurance affects the demand for medical supplies, an issue that we have a moral hazard.

6
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:57,820
The last time we talked about utility maximization.

7
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:07,559
When you say risk and how that critical situation could create a demand disappearance, that risk averse consumers would prefer,

8
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:14,930
that there's no fear of that risk for them to change for a four year career and talk

9
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:19,790
about sort of how we think of health insurance with relation to and for medical care.

10
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:25,549
Now, having insurance changes your brand and how to do that.

11
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:30,080
We're going to start by talking about sort of an ideal structure for insurance so that we could be sort of,

12
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:37,309
you know, the models for how the structure of insurance contract would actually be structured.

13
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:52,480
A lot like your car insurance is structured. So if you told your car you're going to do car insurance, company companies really get that.

14
00:01:53,780 --> 00:02:02,050
What can you do with that? Check this new car if you want to, or you could go to Hawaii.

15
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,710
Or if they give you cash, you totally your car.

16
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:15,740
The car insurance company says, well, based on the make and model of that car, here is its current market value.

17
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:26,390
And here is a check for that car's current market value. You could decide to go to a car dealer and find the exact same make model and year of the

18
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:31,130
car that you just totaled and replace the exact same replace it with the exact same car.

19
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:35,600
Or you could say, You know what, I have other need for that money.

20
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:42,350
I'm going to buy a less expensive car and use the difference on something else where you can say,

21
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:46,610
you know, I really want a nicer car than the make model and year that I just wrecked.

22
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:52,280
So I'm going to use that money to go towards buying a more expensive car.

23
00:02:53,180 --> 00:03:00,890
Or you could decide, you know what, I didn't really need that car at all, sort of an extra car.

24
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:05,260
And now that I have this money, I might as well just take my trip to Hawaii.

25
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:14,420
So the insurance policy pays off by giving you cash, and then you can decide how to best use that cash.

26
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:19,400
If you want to buy a more expensive car, that's up to you.

27
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:28,400
But you have to pay the difference. If you get $10,000 for the car you told you want to buy a $30,000 car, that extra 20,000 is out of your pocket.

28
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:36,610
Similarly, if you could find that same make and model and bargain and get a price of $9,000,

29
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:41,350
you could replace the exact same car and you've got $1,000 left over.

30
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:47,080
In other words, you still have an incentive to drive the best deal you possibly can in replacing that car,

31
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,590
even if your goal was to get the exact same car that you just wrecked.

32
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:57,550
So you have an incentive to shop because any dollar you save is your dollar to keep.

33
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,070
It's not the insurer. You're not saving the insurance company money. You're saving your own money because you just got that check.

34
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:09,190
You have an incentive to only upgrade to a more expensive car if it's worth it to you,

35
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:14,169
because you have to pay the entire difference between the value of the car that the insurance

36
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:19,180
company is compensating you for and the value of the more expensive car you decide.

37
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,900
So imagine we can write health insurance like that. Why do you write auto insurance policies like that?

38
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:33,950
Why is it feasible? What can insurance companies do to figure out how much that should be?

39
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:48,050
There's a big market for used cars and a lot of data, and they know that the current market value of a 2016 Chevy Malibu.

40
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,530
This equipment on this many miles is X dollars.

41
00:04:54,370 --> 00:05:00,460
They can figure that out very clearly. And they and they can inspect the car, determine, yes, in fact, the car is totaled.

42
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:06,280
So they have the ability to assess how much damage that you incur.

43
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,620
And what is the market value of that vehicle that they're replacing?

44
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:17,409
So it's easy for them to do that. Now, let's think about it.

45
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:21,010
Health insurance. Okay. Suppose it is this exact same scenario.

46
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:25,360
Suppose your health insurer could observe easily.

47
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:31,800
Observe both your exact health situation, what condition you have, and exactly what severity level you have.

48
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:40,030
And what's your preferences? Are you a person who likes really aggressive care or are you person who is much more conservative?

49
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:48,159
And they also don't have the clinical knowledge to know that for this exact person, just like you, this is the optimal care path.

50
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:55,470
And this is what it would cost. That's just like that car insurance company, knowing how much damage they can.

51
00:05:55,590 --> 00:06:03,060
They can send their adjuster out to look at the car or they can they have relationships with body shops that evaluate for them.

52
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:10,330
And they know exactly what that car was worth in the market. Okay.

53
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,620
So if health insurers could also do that, they write the same contract.

54
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:21,450
I would say if you come down with condition X at severity level Y, we're going to send you a check for Z dollars.

55
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,140
And just like that, car insurance payments Z dollars would be cash to you.

56
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:34,040
You probably would use it to buy medical care if it was effective.

57
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:39,050
Care to help you? That probably would be a high use of high priority use of that money.

58
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:42,830
So, again, you're free to use it to use it for whatever you want.

59
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,820
So you've got that same incentive to shop around.

60
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:55,250
Just like if I could cut a better deal on replacing that car than the check the insurance gave me, I would save that entire difference.

61
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:57,440
If health insurance were structured like that,

62
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:03,090
if you could find a provider charging less than the Z dollar check, you'd get to keep that entire difference.

63
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:08,600
You'd have the incentive to shop around. You're also having, instead of not to use, low value care.

64
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:16,520
So the insurer sets that check to be this is sort of the cost of the optimal care path for a person like you.

65
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:21,620
And you decide you want to stay in the hospital a week longer. You're free to do that.

66
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,460
But you'd have to pay the entire extra week out of pocket,

67
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:29,959
just like the person upgrading their car saying, Well, I had that 2016 Chevy Malibu instead.

68
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:34,250
I want a 2022 Mercedes Benz. I'm free to make that decision.

69
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:37,880
But the entire incremental cost comes out of my pocket.

70
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:42,620
So I only have the incentive to make that decision if I think that's a good value for my money.

71
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,240
So the enrollee then would be free to buy whatever care they wanted.

72
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,919
But if they bought more than $0 worth of care, they would have to be paying for that out of pocket.

73
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:58,389
So they'd have an incentive to say, are those extra days in the hospital really worth it?

74
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:02,110
Is that extra MRI really worth it to me because I'm the one who has to pay for it.

75
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:13,240
Okay. So what would such a policy kind of accomplish in terms of how much risk in the population from policyholders perspective?

76
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,340
Think of it as moving around money across different states in the world.

77
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:23,319
State of the world is something that could happen to your health this year. So there's a really good state of the world.

78
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:28,930
I say very healthy. I've got all of my income left to spend on non-medical things.

79
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,980
So essentially the marginal utility of my income is relatively low.

80
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,240
But now if I develop some condition that requires some expensive care,

81
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:41,770
all of a sudden dollars become really valuable to me in that state of the world.

82
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:48,700
Because if I didn't have an insurance policy that covered that care, I would have to give up some really,

83
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,240
really valuable non-medical consumption in order to get that surgery.

84
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,310
So the insurance policy is really doing a saying at the beginning of the year.

85
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:03,250
You don't know who you're going to be, the healthy you or the unlucky sick or injured you.

86
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:11,140
Insurance policy simply becomes a mechanism to transfer money between those two future selves.

87
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,670
If you end up being that healthy self, well, you've lost the premium.

88
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:19,830
But you still have all the rest of your money to spend on everything else.

89
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,620
But by paying that premium, then you allow the sick self should you become that person this year.

90
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:34,920
Have a claim. On the insurance company who then give you the money to cover the care.

91
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:44,079
So you're just moving money around. My income is incredibly valuable if something really bad happens to me because I now there's

92
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,340
expensive medical care that either ends to make the choice of if I don't have insurance,

93
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:54,370
do I do without that medical care and suffer the health consequences in order to preserve my non-medical consumption?

94
00:09:55,190 --> 00:10:02,410
Or do I pay for that medical care and therefore sacrifice an awful lot of non-medical that's really valuable to me.

95
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:07,060
So think of my six self as being a person where the marginal utility of income is high.

96
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:12,250
So I want to transfer money into that state of the world. So this thing goes to different people.

97
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:16,830
I want the healthy me to give money to the sick me an insurance profit.

98
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:22,390
Basically, it allows that transaction to occur. Insurance is just sort of a fiction that allows that.

99
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,930
It's the mechanism, the conduit that allows that to occur.

100
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:31,300
Kind of like what you talk with talked about taking out student loans.

101
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:35,800
You're not borrowing money from the bank or the government. You're borrowing money from your future self.

102
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:41,800
Student loan program is simply the conduit that allows that transaction to occur,

103
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:48,280
and without that you couldn't transact with your future self that really you're not borrowing money from the government.

104
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:54,650
You're borrowing money from your future self. Okay.

105
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:58,080
So awesome. Let's write our insurance policies. Health insurance policy.

106
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:03,330
Just like a car insurance policy. Little bit harder.

107
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:10,380
So we said that the auto insurer could easily assess the damage and easily assess the value of the vehicle.

108
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:15,000
So they can write that policy that just gives you a check very, very easily.

109
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,470
Now, what if you tried to do that health insurance?

110
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:26,730
So one of the conditions that people might come down with a very common condition is they lower back and lower back.

111
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:35,880
Pain comes in a wide gradation of severity from its mild and occasional to its constant and debilitating and everything in between.

112
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:43,780
Now. Can the insurer easily verify your report of how severe your back pain symptoms are?

113
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:52,770
Incredibly hard for them to do. So if they wrote a contract that says, well, if you have mild back pain,

114
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:56,580
we're going to give you $1,000, and if it's severe, we're going to give you $10,000.

115
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:06,030
What level of severity are people going to report? It's pretty easy to guess, well, if my back is killing you.

116
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:15,410
So it's going to be hard for them to get the information they would need to set that right things.

117
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:23,640
There's also a lot of unobservable factors that affect optimal care, things like preferences.

118
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:33,250
So just saying what is the optimal care path for a person like you depends on a lot of information that the insurer is not going to have.

119
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,579
So it's much harder to do that for health insurance than it was for our auto insurer who can do that relatively

120
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:45,070
easily because there is a big market for used cars that they can collect data from on an instantaneous,

121
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,790
you know, minute by minute basis for what the value of that vehicle is.

122
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:54,670
So if your health insurance, unlike your auto insurance, doesn't just give you a check,

123
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,540
other words, it doesn't pay you cash when you file a claim for damages.

124
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:04,820
How does it pay off? It pays off by making care cheap, by reducing the price of medical care.

125
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:12,559
It doesn't give you cash you can spend on a trip to Hawaii. But it says, well, we're going to say you have a great insurance policy.

126
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:19,160
No deductibles, no co-pays, full coverage. Essentially, that policy pays off by saying your medical care is free.

127
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:24,460
I go to Hawaii with that money. But you get all the medical care.

128
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:30,970
You and your doctor agree to subject to whatever utilization review this plan has for free.

129
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:35,559
So it pays off by reducing the price of care. But now that changes your incentives.

130
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:40,660
As a consumer, do you have an incentive to shop for a cheaper provider?

131
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:47,410
If I save a dollar, who's. Who's dollar? Am I saving mine?

132
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,620
Now, I've got no incentive to save the insurance company. Mine is if I.

133
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:57,459
If I choose a cheaper provider, it's going to save the insurer money.

134
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:05,230
It doesn't save me anything. So the incentive to shop around is eliminated and very different than that car insurance where you got the check.

135
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:11,580
If you could find a cheaper car, you saved the dollar. You don't have to give back the money to the insurance company.

136
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:21,300
Also think about how much care I'm going to consume. In that perfect insurance policy.

137
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,930
If the insurer could write a contract that's just like your car insurance contract.

138
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:33,840
If you want to buy extra care beyond the optimal level you're free to, but you would have to pay for that out of pocket.

139
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,400
But now you've got this policy that gives you free care.

140
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:45,450
You have no incentive to say no to care. That is low value, not no value.

141
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,110
And any care you perceive as having positive value, it's free.

142
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,460
I might as well get it.

143
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:59,459
So the way we really have to write health insurance policies to pay off by reducing the price of care, distorts our incentives,

144
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:04,950
distorts our incentives to shop around and distorts our incentives to say, no,

145
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:11,100
I don't want that extra MRI unless you really convince me it's super valuable and important for my hair.

146
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:19,300
So that guy creates the fundamental trade off that health insurance policy design.

147
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:25,260
There are two goals. The first obvious goal of insurance is to spread financial risk,

148
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:33,300
to protect risk averse consumers from the financial risk created by unknown things that could happen to their health in the future.

149
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,690
Because that's not the purpose of insurance in the first place.

150
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:43,190
But we've got the second set of well, we have insurance that's restricted to paying off by reducing the price of care.

151
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:48,440
And so giving you a fixed check. It distorts your incentives.

152
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:58,130
So we wanted to create a policy that protects you from financial risk as well as possible, but maybe still preserves some of your incentives.

153
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:06,130
So if I were a risk averse consumer, a perfect world, I have full coverage, somebody else to bear that risk,

154
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:13,480
then I've got no incentive to be cost conscious the way health insurance is structured by reducing the price of care.

155
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:21,080
So we try to find a middle ground with cost sharing. So here's a typical health insurance policy.

156
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:31,250
It starts out as deductible. So, for example, first $500 of spending a year, I pay 100% of I get no insurance coverage whatsoever.

157
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:43,690
You might be certain services. It could be exempted from the deductible that most things if I spend up to $500, it's only once I've met my deductible.

158
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:50,990
All of a sudden my insurance benefit kicks in, but I still have to pay something for each unit of care I use either.

159
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:59,360
So insurance would be a fixed percentage like 20% of the cost of care or a co-payment, which should be a fixed amount per unit of care.

160
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:05,059
Let's say $20 for an office visit and then some level.

161
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,730
I've spent enough money out of pocket, my deductible,

162
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:12,980
plus all the cost sharing I've accrued for the care I've used that I've hit my out-of-pocket maximum.

163
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:21,890
Sometimes called a stop loss insurance lingo. And at that point I would have 100% coverage for any care beyond that severely catastrophic coverage.

164
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:27,229
So I paid three different prices for care depending on how much I've used.

165
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:30,110
I pay the full price of care up to meeting my deductible.

166
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:39,620
I pay some fraction after I've met my deductible, and then I pay a price of zero once I've exceeded my out-of-pocket maximum.

167
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:45,580
So the price I face depends on how much care I've used. Yes.

168
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,790
Now, what's sort of the logic behind that? Okay.

169
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:54,040
So here's a typical distribution of health spending. Incredibly skewed.

170
00:17:55,930 --> 00:18:00,370
1% of spenders account for over 20% of the dollars in a given year.

171
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:05,650
So you've got a very small percentage of the population that has catastrophic costs.

172
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:13,120
Let's look at the other side. The lowest 50% spend only about 3% of the total.

173
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:17,350
So essentially you have half the population that spend almost nothing.

174
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:24,490
Almost all the spending is in the top half. And even in the top half, it's very skewed.

175
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:28,300
Just 1% spend almost a quarter, so an over 20%.

176
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:34,180
So now relate that to our structure of insurance.

177
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:43,760
We're going to be hit by the deductible. It's mostly these folks with very little spending.

178
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:50,090
So we're preserving some incentives for people to be cost conscious about their care.

179
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:54,230
Primarily among the people who don't have a large financial cost.

180
00:18:54,740 --> 00:19:01,490
So there's not a big risk we're dumping back on them through the $500 deductible because many of them are using very little care.

181
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:08,830
Our real starting point, closing, some cost sharing, that's kind of mostly going to hit the people in here.

182
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:15,930
They've met their deductible. They're not in this 50% to spend almost nothing.

183
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:20,460
They have some care. So they face a little bigger financial risk.

184
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:27,960
And we start protecting them and giving them, say, 80% coverage for a 20% co-insurance plan.

185
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:33,720
And who's going to head the stop loss? It's going to be these folks up here.

186
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:38,400
They're going to hit their out-of-pocket, Max. They're the ones that face the biggest financial risk.

187
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:47,280
Their care costs truly are catastrophic. So we wanted them to air on the side of giving them very good protection from their financial risk by saying,

188
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:52,350
okay, you've now paid enough out of pocket, the rest of your care is fully covered.

189
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,580
You're in the catastrophic coverage region. Your pocket maximum has been that.

190
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:02,479
So we're kind of saying the balance we want to take between these two objectives of

191
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:08,900
spreading risk and preserving incentives depends on where we are in this distribution.

192
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,330
For these folks, the risk is very low, so we might as well not mess up their incentives too badly.

193
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:19,370
So one positive deductable for these people, the risk is kind of moderate.

194
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:21,530
So we want to balance those two.

195
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:28,280
We want to give them some coverage, but still give them a bit of cost sharing to at least make them a little bit cost conscious.

196
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:35,990
And for these folks, there is such a such bad shape that we really just want to err on the side of protecting them.

197
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:41,240
Even though we're sacrificing incentives.

198
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:51,350
So that's kind of the logic of how this typical health insurance structure sort of works across the distribution of standard.

199
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:57,580
That makes sense. So we're just talking through.

200
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:02,550
Now. How will insurance affect the demand for care?

201
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,850
There are two different ways that we can analyze that.

202
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:19,839
The simplest way, although one argues, remains the more useful way, is just, well, it changes the price.

203
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:25,209
So you're sliding down the demand curve. So what determines slowing down the demand curve?

204
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:29,950
Well, price changes your mood, changing the variable that's on the axis.

205
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:40,299
So just like we had in basic demand theory say the full price of medical care is PM per unit and I have a policy that has a co-insurance rate.

206
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:46,210
See, so that essentially says, well I'm going to feel like the price is C times PM per unit.

207
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,230
So PM is $100 and I've got a 20% cut cost sharing.

208
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:54,790
A $100 price of care is going to feel like $20 to me.

209
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:03,820
The full price is 100, but my price is 20. So if I didn't have insurance, I'd say, well, care is $100 a unit.

210
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:14,360
I want to be at point buying this much care. If I get this insurance policy care is only $20 a unit, 20% times the full price of 100.

211
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:20,420
So I want to actually buy a lot more here. I want to be at point B, I'm adding these extra units of care.

212
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,850
That I subjectively believe are worth less than $100.

213
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:35,310
The demand curve tells me I would not have spent the full price of $100 for these units of care, but I will spend $20 for them.

214
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:45,870
I do think they're worth at least $20. So that's the sense in which I'm sort of adding low value care and low value using my subjective,

215
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:52,530
subjective demand curve as the sort of marker of how much I think care is worth.

216
00:22:52,560 --> 00:23:01,230
Maybe it's a poorly informed demand curve, but as a predictive matter, you predict that a person with this demand curve is going to stop here.

217
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:06,090
If they had to pay all of the price of care out of pocket and they slide all the way down to here.

218
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:23,110
They only have to pay co-insurance rates. See? And jump quickly here and show us sort of a different way of doing it is to actually say,

219
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:28,930
can we just translate the demand curve and say, what does my demand curve look like if I have insurance?

220
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:36,400
There was can I just simply write down and insurer demand curve and it turns out that we can.

221
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:42,150
Because we know the translation with this co-insurance rate between the full price of

222
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:47,490
care and the price that I pay out of pocket is going to be a simple insurance policy,

223
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:54,010
just as co-insurance rates seem. And let's make see 20%.

224
00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:00,030
This is my uninsured demand curve since the original demand curve like we had on the last graph.

225
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:04,470
And one point on that demand curve is at a price of 20.

226
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:14,310
I buy ten units of care. LEMON Are you is that one point on this persons insured demand curve that we're trying to construct?

227
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:19,290
Is it a price of 100? They would buy ten units of care.

228
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:28,000
Because if I have insurance that covers 80% of the cost, if the price of care was 100, I would feel the price is 20.

229
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:37,510
That's the price that I actually face. So I predict that I audit if I chose ten units of care when I faced an out-of-pocket price of 20.

230
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:47,900
If I've got this 80% coverage insurance policy and the price were 100, I ought to also buy ten units of care because then the price to me is 20.

231
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:55,940
So we're kind of translating point by point from the uninsured demand curve to the insured demand curve,

232
00:24:56,810 --> 00:25:04,410
sort of scaling up the price by the co-insurance say, well, if I buy, if I faced one price of $20 out of pocket, I buy ten units.

233
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:11,450
What price of care would leave me with $20 out of pocket if I had the insurance plan?

234
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:18,140
The $100? That hundred dollar price, full price of care translates to 20 to me.

235
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:21,620
So I also buy ten units of care.

236
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:27,130
If I had the policy and the price were 100. It's that logic kind of makes sense.

237
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:29,380
So you do that point by point.

238
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:37,630
Here's just one point, but we could do it for a price of 25 and then we go up to 125 or a price of ten, and then we go up to 50.

239
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:43,540
And each point here then would translate to a point on the insured demand curve.

240
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:50,260
And then that gives us a whole new demand curve that reflects the fact that this consumer has this policy.

241
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:57,200
So we're just translating information from their uninsured demand curve into creating the sort of hypothetical,

242
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:03,020
you know, what would my demand curve look like? Just accounting for the fact that I'm paying 2/10 of the price.

243
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,010
Think of another way. This might be a more even a more logical way of thinking about it.

244
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:13,730
You're, like, rotated. Yeah.

245
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:21,530
So is the price representing what the consumer pays with their bill and the insurance covers part of this is the total price.

246
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:25,160
So in other words, this is the price the doctor collects.

247
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:30,110
The doctor collects $100. They collect 80 of it from the insurance company and 20 from the consumer.

248
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:36,290
So I think this is the with the insured demand curve, the price is the full price of care.

249
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:42,809
Right. So with the uninsured, demand curve is also the full price of care.

250
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:47,610
But in this case, the consumer pays 100%. Yes.

251
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:53,189
And then it looks like with a little change in price, it looks like with a large change in price,

252
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:58,980
they'll only pursue a little bit more care when with the demand curve, with the insurance.

253
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:03,300
So think of it this way. Which of these two demand curves is less elastic?

254
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:10,720
So. Says One with no insurance.

255
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:19,510
What's the last thing? Because the because the one with insurance with the large change in price, there's a little change in quantity.

256
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:23,170
And so which actually that describes less elastic less.

257
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:26,799
So you have to split more or less. Your logic is exactly right.

258
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,620
We're just kind of flip. We're more and less elastic one so.

259
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:40,210
And that makes sense because it says people are being less price sensitive when a $1 increase in price only costs them $0.20 in this demand curve,

260
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:43,290
a $1 increase in price costs me $1. Mm hmm.

261
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:53,170
So having insurance inherently makes my demand curve less price elastic because I only feel a fraction of any change in price.

262
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:59,440
And if my doctor charges $10 more for office visit today than they did yesterday.

263
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:06,400
They're only charging me $2 more. So it mutes my response to price, meaning it's going to become less elastic.

264
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:10,900
So this demand curve with insurance is going to be a steeper, less elastic curve.

265
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:19,630
So I'd be very less price responsive because an extra dollar only means $0.20 to them because insurers picking up $0.80 of that difference.

266
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:25,390
Okay. Without insurance, an extra dollar in price means an extra dollar out of my own pocket.

267
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:28,630
I don't have anybody picking up any part of that for me.

268
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:32,530
Okay. So is this the same, like, insurance? Like, as in.

269
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:43,380
Oh, never mind. Answer that question. I got it. Do you also think of creating this insured demand curve just by sort of rotating?

270
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:49,620
The Uninsured Demand Center's two extremes.

271
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:57,330
This is that the original no insurance demand curve or consider that my demand curve with the world's worst insurance policy.

272
00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:01,560
What's the world's worst insurance policy? Right.

273
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:07,080
Oh, baby. In the world's worst insurance policy. 100%.

274
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:11,070
Exactly. So think of this. I have insurance, but it has 100% co-pay.

275
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:16,050
Now, what's the world's best insurance policy? Best for? Not.

276
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:24,540
Not, but from the perspective of sort of efficiency or optimality, but for respect of a generosity to the patients who resent coverage.

277
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:27,509
Right. So I get my pay. Nothing. What am I demand curve look like?

278
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:35,040
If I had zero co-insurance, that should be vertical because price no longer matters to me.

279
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:41,760
If my doctor charges a dollar more, that means they're charging my insurance company a dollar more and I don't pay a single penny more.

280
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:49,710
So think of these as the extremes. This is a policy with 100% coinsurance rate, the equivalent of not having coverage.

281
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:57,240
Let's just think of it as I've got a policy that charges me 100% coinsurance as the literal extreme of crap insurance.

282
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:02,820
And then here's the other little literal extreme. I've got full coverage by co-pay.

283
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:11,610
Co-insurance is zero. Now let's consider an intermediate where I've got some co-insurance rate greater than zero in less than 100.

284
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:21,630
You kind of think of that as well. If I co-insurance rate was very close to 100%, this insured demand curve would only be a little bit above.

285
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:33,030
The uninsured demand curve. If we were close to 100%, if I say at a 1% co-insurance rate, the demand curve would be nearly vertical.

286
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:45,990
So think of the are 20% co-insurance rate, kind of like starting here and then rotating this demand curve up 80% of the way towards the vertical line.

287
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:55,010
Can you calculate price elasticity or is price elasticity relevant if the new prices zero like?

288
00:30:55,230 --> 00:31:00,130
Is that potentially something we'll have to do like the price is zero here?

289
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:03,170
Can we say this is completely unrealistic? Right.

290
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:08,720
This would be completely inelastic. So the price elasticity of demand would be zero.

291
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:13,800
So because you would get percent change in quantity divided by percent change in price.

292
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:19,559
So let's say price fell from here to here. That's going to give us some percentage change in price.

293
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:26,070
With the percent change in quantity, the numerator is going to be zero because the quantity is going to be 15 regardless of price.

294
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:32,820
So the old quantity is 15, the new quantity is 15. So the percentage change is going to be 15.

295
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:35,430
-15 divided by 15 is nothing.

296
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:45,500
So we can calculate the elasticity as zero for the vertical amount because the numerator is always going to be zero regardless of the price change.

297
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:49,230
I'm always going to buy 15 because I don't feel the price change at all.

298
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:55,110
The price change is meaningless to me if I have full government treat. I couldn't care less what the hospital charges.

299
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:04,049
So this is kind of the exact equivalent of what we did sort of in that point by point exercise where we translate as,

300
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:08,460
say, the $20 price into $100 price. It's going to give you the same demand curve.

301
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:13,260
But sort of the greater the coverage is, the more you rotate it up towards the vertical,

302
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:20,400
the worse the coverage is, the closer it's going to be to the original uninsured demand curve.

303
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:28,860
So with 80% coverage, you think of your rotating their uninsured demand curve 80% of the way up towards the vertical.

304
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:35,930
So perfectly equivalent ways that whichever one you think is more logical to you.

305
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:43,840
Okay. So that's the policy with co-insurance now is added deductible.

306
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:54,010
I suppose I've got a policy that has a $500 deductible, and once I've met that deductible, then it has a 20% coinsurance rate.

307
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:58,900
Now, let's suppose that we have defined units of care so they cost $100 each.

308
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:05,320
So what we talked about was that distribution of spending.

309
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,730
The matter to me is going to depend on, well,

310
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:16,370
my person is very healthy and doesn't use a lot of care or that I have some stuff happen to me and I had to use a bunch of care.

311
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:19,430
So for a very minor illness.

312
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:26,890
It's a deductible that's going to be sort of the binding constraint on the longer term, the price of getting one more unit of care.

313
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:34,240
Okay. If I met my deductible, then the co-insurance is going to determine what's the cost of getting one more unit of care.

314
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:44,580
So think of this very step function as just reflecting the price that I pay out of pocket as a function of the quantity of care that I can do so.

315
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:51,030
So with this policy I described, I have to consume five units of care to meet my deductible.

316
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:57,930
So I paid $100 to $400 a unit for the first five units in order to spend $500 out of pocket.

317
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:02,400
So for the first five units, my price is the full price of $100.

318
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:11,790
Once I bought five units, at that point, my cost out of pocket for any additional units of care drops to $20.

319
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:18,240
So that sort of solid stair step line just sort of shows me for each unit of care,

320
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,690
given the provisions of my policy, how much do I have to pay out of pocket?

321
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:28,320
I have to pay $100 for the first five units and then my out-of-pocket price drops to 20 thereafter.

322
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:33,750
So if I'm somebody who has sort of very little illness during the year, I'm very lucky person.

323
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:40,030
The mantra of is going to be very close to the origin. I don't demand a lot of care.

324
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:49,070
So I was lucky and stayed really healthy and I'm going to kind of behave as if the price of care is $100 a unit and I'm going to stop there.

325
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:54,710
So the deductible is going to be what ultimately gets me to say, I've had enough care, I don't want anymore.

326
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:04,910
I'm still going to look at it as costing $100. Now, suppose I have a more severe illness shifting my demand for medical care way out here.

327
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:13,160
I'm gonna blow through the deductible. That's like a deductible.

328
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:18,620
It's almost just like a tax. I'm getting severely ill. I've got to pay for $500 tax for having gotten the second.

329
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:26,160
Once I paid that a $500 tax, then I get to use care and additional units at $20.

330
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:30,900
Ultimately, what's going to get me to say, okay, I've had enough, I want no more.

331
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:34,500
This is what I've consumed.

332
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,770
The amount at which my demand curve has dropped to $20,

333
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:44,670
where my subjective opinion of the value of another unit of care is exactly equal to that co-insurance price of $20.

334
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:50,790
So for some people, it's the deductible that's going to get them to say no more.

335
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:54,660
This is where I want to stop. Another unit of care is not worth it to me.

336
00:35:55,290 --> 00:36:00,780
And for people who have a higher level of illness, it's going to be the co-insurance and deductibles really not going up.

337
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:05,810
So it's just a tax on getting severely ill. It's not really changing their incentives in any beneficial way.

338
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:15,780
They're blowing through it because they're this sick. Now, we can also think of intermediate cases.

339
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,239
It's a demand curve that look like that.

340
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:31,430
So we'll call this the moderately old person's. So I've got the minor illness.

341
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:36,860
My demand is here. If I develop a moderate illness, my demand curve shifts out to the red line.

342
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:40,130
It's like a severe illness that shifts out to that further black line.

343
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:45,710
So let's look at the moderately old person. Where is this person going to say no more?

344
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:52,040
This is how much care I want and this is where I'm stopping. I get three sort of candidates.

345
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:07,219
Okay. Who thinks this person be sort of stopped by the deductible and stop and Friday and say, you know, that's where I want to stop.

346
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:14,720
That's I don't want another unit of care. And you would think there and stop at point A and what about point B?

347
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:29,059
So let's go on board and see. Right. So why would this person go to point C rather than stopping at a marginal cost like the next year?

348
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:33,780
It appears very low there. So very good point. A higher price per unit.

349
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:37,680
I mean, it doesn't make any sense to stop once it starts getting cheaper. Right.

350
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:42,570
So I really don't want to go from A to B, from A to B.

351
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:53,860
Secondly, the loss of consumer surplus, not to pay $100 per unit for that little extra amount of care, and it's worth less than 100 to me.

352
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:59,530
But if I do go from A to B, then the price jumps down to $20.

353
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,950
And I would say, Well, I don't want any of these units of care.

354
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:18,670
25 And here, if I had to pay $100 for them, yeah, I do want them at $20 and they kind of generate that much consumer surplus for me.

355
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:22,299
Again, we're using that the height of the demand curve is telling me sort of how much

356
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:26,730
I value each successive unit and we're subtracting out the price I have to pay.

357
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:30,580
That's my opportunity cost of getting them. I'm giving up $20 of other stuff.

358
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:37,200
And since this area of consumer surplus gained.

359
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:46,210
Is greater than this area of consumer surplus loss. I'm better off going to sea than stopping it.

360
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:52,870
Now I never want to do is go to be and stop. And that would be the killer of all three choices.

361
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:57,400
That would be the worst. If I'm not going to go to see that, I might as well stop it.

362
00:38:58,270 --> 00:38:59,620
Yes. Why would I go to be where?

363
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:08,889
I'm paying $100 a unit for care that's worth less than 100 to me, and the not avail myself of additional units of care that I could get for $20.

364
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:14,860
And while they're not worth the full price of 100, they're definitely worth more than 20 to meet my subjective opinions.

365
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:25,859
Regardless. Demand curve a little bit farther back. And we would have made the opposite conclusion.

366
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:29,250
Then Point A would have been best because you'd say, well, wait a second, if I'd.

367
00:39:46,590 --> 00:40:07,490
Let's. So Blue Triangle is sort of the consumer surplus from that care above the deductible.

368
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:18,920
And in order to get that care, I would have to first pay $100 a unit for a whole bunch of care that's worth a less than $100 to me.

369
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:24,739
So getting that bonus of a little bit of cheap care beyond meeting the deductible is not

370
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:30,080
sufficiently valuable to pay for the extra units that I would need to get to the table.

371
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:35,710
So with the blue demand curve, we would say the person would stop at blue point.

372
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:40,780
It's equivalent of one day with the red demand curve with the red one.

373
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:47,380
And so, you know, it's worth paying a little bit to get, you know, to meet the deductible because then I get a bonus.

374
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:51,340
I can buy a bunch more care at $20 that I'm happy to get for $20.

375
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:58,660
Questions about that sort of make sense or, you know, so this person's going to stop here.

376
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:04,089
This person's going to stop here. So they're also going to be ultimately constrained by the deductible.

377
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:07,390
The deductible is going to be what convinces them to say, I've had enough.

378
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:13,030
This person is going to ask the deductible and ultimately it's going to be the

379
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:16,210
co-insurance price that's going to say that determines when I've had enough,

380
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:24,459
when that last unit was just worth $20 to me, then the severely ill person is really going to follow through the deductibles and

381
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:28,900
they're going to also the co-insurance is going to be what ultimately gets them to say,

382
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:34,160
I've had enough units of care. I don't want another one. It sounds.

383
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:41,719
Now, what's missing from this discussion of a deductible? What a common feature of a deductible.

384
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:47,660
Haven't we really put into this graph? And deductibles operate.

385
00:41:51,740 --> 00:42:00,520
What time period for you. So we have really no time to match this or this more like a one shot thing where you, you know,

386
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:06,430
at one point in time in the year, you discover what your illness status is and therefore what your demand curve looks like.

387
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:11,329
Are you, first of all, low demander of care as you got lucky, a fairly low demander of care.

388
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:16,520
You got a little bit sick in a moderate demander of care or you got really sick.

389
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:27,170
What deductibles also have is that time dimension of they accrue over the year and you and information is revealed to you over the year.

390
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:31,670
It's not revealed all at once. This is what high demand curve for care is going to be in 2022.

391
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:37,220
You know, something does or doesn't happen to me in January. Something does or doesn't happen to me in February.

392
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:45,410
If I've already met my deductible in January, then I know for the rest of the year any other things that happen to me.

393
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:50,810
I get care for $20 if it's December and I'm not close to meeting my deductible.

394
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:59,950
I'm probably not going to meet it, so I'm probably going to more behave as if the deductible matters and maybe delay some care until January.

395
00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:10,420
Where it can accrue to next year is acceptable. Now, the $500 deductible in my example, is pretty small compared to what we typically see see now.

396
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:17,650
So among workers, employees, employer sponsored plans who have deductibles, so not everybody has a deductible,

397
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:29,290
but among those who do have deductibles and are plans there now for small firms, over $2,000 typically and is for large firms about 1400.

398
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:34,870
So and you can kind of see how these are very steadily growing large firms.

399
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:41,860
So deductibles were about $500 in 2006, and they're 14 over 1400 in 2020.

400
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:48,700
The large firms, they've also tripled from $775 to 20 $300.

401
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:54,370
And this is just sort of the weighted average of all firms employing a weighted average.

402
00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:01,360
So we've seen a big increase or a tripling in deductibles over this time period.

403
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:08,200
Okay. So what are deductibles actually accomplish?

404
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:18,540
So was a nice study done a few years ago by Brad Goldberg, where he had data from a firm that switched all of its employees in one calendar year.

405
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:29,320
So to say January 1st when your policy changes switched all their employees from a plan that had no cost sharing to a plan that had a high deductible,

406
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:32,950
this is sort of a huge change in one year.

407
00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:37,030
And all their all their employees got switched over. They had no choice.

408
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:48,290
So health care spending fell by about 13%. So clearly, people's decisions responded to that big change in cost sharing.

409
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:54,349
Now, how did it decrease? Well, they looked at sort of what accounted for that.

410
00:44:54,350 --> 00:45:00,110
It was entirely a reduction of the quantity of care, even going from no cost sharing to a high deductible.

411
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:07,340
They could not find evidence of price shopping. So in other words, the 13% decrease was 13% less care was used.

412
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:12,679
It wasn't that I used 10% less care, but the care I used.

413
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:16,520
I also found 3% cheaper as I shopped around.

414
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:22,340
So it was entirely a cutback in quantity, not an increase in shopping behavior, wasn't it?

415
00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:29,530
You know, the CT scan that I got to use for my eyes that I got to use an example from the presentations last week,

416
00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:35,090
I got cheaper MRI's because I shopped around. It's entirely I got less of our eyes.

417
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:44,270
Not surprisingly, the vast majority of these reductions, 90% of them occurred before the deductible was met.

418
00:45:47,730 --> 00:45:53,880
Maybe a little bit more concerning is that half the overall reductions occurred among the sickest subset of employees.

419
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:05,130
So a lot of oil is powerful at decreasing use, but we have to worry a little bit about it.

420
00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:07,990
Why is it not creating an incentive to shop around?

421
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:13,500
You would hope it wouldn't just be decreasing use, but it also shows cause people to shop around for better deals.

422
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:19,720
It's not doing that. And we also have to worry about what's hitting in terms of the illness distribution.

423
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:33,910
And here's our timing. And so we know that people shift utilization of what was planned years to take into account their deductible.

424
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:39,579
If I've already met my deductible. Then some care that maybe I would have gotten some elective stuff.

425
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:43,690
Maybe I would have gotten in January or February. I'm going to try to get it in November or December.

426
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,360
That's why it's so hard to get an appointment. December.

427
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:54,350
People meet their deductibles or they have flexible spending account that expire at the end of the year for various,

428
00:46:54,580 --> 00:47:01,120
various reasons why if they get the care this calendar year, it's cheaper for them than if they delay it to the next calendar year.

429
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:03,150
And we also see the flip side.

430
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:13,450
If it's November or December and I haven't met my deductible yet, then maybe I'll postpone that care until January or February.

431
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:15,820
So that counts towards next year's deductible.

432
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:23,110
So maybe I will to because it's a whole brand new year and I don't know what's going to happen throughout the year if I don't know,

433
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:27,190
it's December 31st and I haven't met my deductible, I'm probably not going to need it.

434
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:34,330
So if I care that I can delay till January, why would I get an appointment on December 31st for that year?

435
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:41,890
In fact, the elasticity of changes in the future price should be higher.

436
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:49,190
If I've met my deductible this year and therefore I have to start a new one or bright future price could be lower if I haven't had my luck.

437
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:51,560
Double this year or next year.

438
00:47:53,610 --> 00:48:02,130
As a last test result negative point five saw a 1% change in what I think the price of care is going to be next year compared to this year

439
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:08,460
because of the status of my deductible leads to about a half a percent change in the quantity of care I'm going to consume this year.

440
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:18,980
So what's the price elasticity of demand for medical care more generally?

441
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:23,059
Negative point five is a very particular type of elasticity.

442
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:25,940
It's elasticity of respect to a future price.

443
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:32,750
I was next year's price going to be different than this year's price because of where I sit on my deductible this year.

444
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:37,160
But more generically, how price elastic is the demand for care?

445
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:45,680
And we need to know this in order to try to design an optimal insurance policy and balancing this sort of risk spreading versus incentives.

446
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:50,979
If the price elasticity of demand of care is really, really high,

447
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:56,710
then we know those incentives are very powerful and people will buy a lot more care if you cover them more generously.

448
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:01,750
And therefore, we're going to have to charge premiums that are a lot higher to cover all that extra care.

449
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:06,310
So ultimately, the enrollees are going to, as a group, are going to have to pay for it.

450
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:18,780
So a lot of the best evidence on price elasticity of demand comes from differences in the generosity of insurance.

451
00:49:19,350 --> 00:49:26,370
This is that since insurance pays off by reducing the price of care, then the generosity of your coverage is going to determine your price.

452
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,780
So a lot of researchers have used that variation in price.

453
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:35,549
People have different insurance policies at a point in time or changes in their insurance policy over

454
00:49:35,550 --> 00:49:41,730
time to try to say how responsive is the quantity of care to the price some people pay out of pocket?

455
00:49:42,990 --> 00:49:47,340
Now, there are a lot of methodological issues because we have the problem of selection.

456
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:55,000
Suppose I think I'm going to use a lot of care next year and I have a choice in terms of whether or not to get insurance in the first place.

457
00:49:55,530 --> 00:50:03,510
And then once I decide to get insurance, do I buy a really generous policy, pay a high premium for much better coverage or a less generous policy?

458
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:08,190
If I think I'm going to use a lot of care next year, I'm more likely to get insured in the first place,

459
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:12,030
and I'm more likely to pay the higher premium to get more generous coverage.

460
00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:16,049
So we can't just look at people in differential ance policies and say, well,

461
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:22,560
the people on the more generous plans consume three times as much as the people in the less generous plans because they're different people.

462
00:50:24,810 --> 00:50:28,950
People expect to use more care, select themselves into the more generous plan.

463
00:50:29,370 --> 00:50:36,060
So that plan is going to have more use, not just because those people face a lower price, but because they're bigger users in the first place.

464
00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:43,020
There have been a number of studies that have tried to use that as more experimental type designs,

465
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:49,920
either directly experimental or talk about the Rand health insurance experiment in the Oregon experiment or kind of quasi

466
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:57,329
experimental like that study of a lock table where you had one set of in one set of employees and the employer decided overnight,

467
00:50:57,330 --> 00:51:00,540
we're going to change you from this plan to this other plan.

468
00:51:01,410 --> 00:51:11,310
So it's kind of like an experiment. So we have to observe people who face different prices, either over time themselves or at a point in time,

469
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:15,770
but then hope that that price variation is for reasons that's sort of random.

470
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:22,110
It's not reasons of selection of sicker people into certain plans which are going to bias your estimates.

471
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:27,330
So there are two well-known experimental studies on this.

472
00:51:27,330 --> 00:51:29,910
Denise talked about the Rand study in 600.

473
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:37,430
So give you a little bit of background, although it's an old study, but it was the biggest experiment ever done.

474
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:42,860
So it's going to be cited forever because for not being able to redo this any time soon.

475
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:50,570
It was an incredibly expensive study to run, and so patients were randomly assigned to different levels of coverage.

476
00:51:51,050 --> 00:51:58,970
In other words, they're randomly assigned to different out-of-pocket prices. There are six sites, and they also included one that had an HMO in it.

477
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:03,710
The enrollment was in the mid seventies and then people were followed for 3 to 5

478
00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:10,220
years after randomization and different plans and cost sharing varied from 0 to 95%.

479
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:15,560
However, the 95% comes with the caveat there is $1,000 out-of-pocket maximum.

480
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:24,110
Nobody would have agreed to be randomized to 95% co-insurance if there was, say, a $50,000 out-of-pocket maximum.

481
00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:26,750
As soon as I got randomized to that plan, I'm going to quit the study.

482
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:31,730
And if you had all the people in one arm quitting the study, you do longer of a valid study.

483
00:52:32,330 --> 00:52:39,709
So they cap the out-of-pocket at $1,000. And they also if you got randomized, they're really high co-insurance.

484
00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:44,540
At the beginning of the study, you got sort of a one time sort of cash bonus payment to sort of compensate you.

485
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:53,860
So number one, cost sharing matters. Expenses went down as sharing went up.

486
00:52:54,910 --> 00:52:58,090
It also found and we'll talk more about this sort of later in the course.

487
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:05,980
Not a lot of consequences of the extra utilization that people with lower out-of-pocket prices had on measures of health status.

488
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:10,690
Still somewhat controversial. But, you know, it's there are no big effects.

489
00:53:11,530 --> 00:53:16,780
We'll talk much, much more detail later in the class about the impact of insurance on actual health.

490
00:53:16,870 --> 00:53:23,079
For today or so, mainly talk about the impact on utilization as opposed to what the health consequences were.

491
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:26,980
But we'll definitely get to the health consequences overall.

492
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:31,330
So the price elasticity of demand was kind of negative point one to negative point two.

493
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:39,520
So quite inelastic, probably not surprising that health care of the inelastic demand had good, but definitely not zero.

494
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:48,840
So people definitely did respond to price and also found that people weren't very good at being salt reactionaries.

495
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:54,720
When they looked at care of the people, cut back on if they were randomized into the higher cost sharing plans.

496
00:53:55,380 --> 00:54:03,510
We had to cut back both on care that based on chart review was deemed to be sort of effective care and care those deemed to be ineffective care.

497
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:07,170
So some controversy about how they define those things,

498
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:13,319
but it's consistent with a lot of other literature we'll talk about later that know people cut back,

499
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:17,640
but they don't cut back in sort of the way we would hope they would do and say,

500
00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:21,330
you know, well, I'm going to get rid of all this low value care that really wasn't helping me much,

501
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:23,910
but I'm going to keep getting the really important stuff.

502
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:30,600
Instead, it seems that people cut back sort of across the board to skip some low value stuff,

503
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:35,280
but they also skip some high value stuff they're not real good at lasering out that,

504
00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:41,220
you know, if I go pay a little more out of pocket, it's only the stuff that's not really important that I cut back.

505
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:52,580
So we would hope they would do. Here's some other evidence from data that I pulled a few years ago from the Michigan Health Insurance Exchange.

506
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:57,860
So the exact same plan, Blue Cross, premier, single coverage.

507
00:54:57,860 --> 00:55:01,310
So I've got the same provider network, I've got the same customer service.

508
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:06,260
The only thing that differs is, was that the bronze plan, the silver plan or the gold plan.

509
00:55:06,290 --> 00:55:12,620
So in the exchanges, the metal tiers are based on sort of how much of the average health expense is covered by the plan.

510
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:20,959
So bronze cover, 60%, silver cover 70 gold covers, and each platinum covers 90.

511
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:24,980
But platinum almost doesn't exist in the insurer insurance exchange market.

512
00:55:24,990 --> 00:55:33,470
There are very few platinum plans offered. Now suppose people didn't respond to price by consuming more care.

513
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:39,740
So if you got more generous coverage, I'm going to still consume the same. Suppose my demand were perfectly price inelastic.

514
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:49,790
What you would expect then is that the premiums for these three identical plans that differ only by what fraction the person pays out of pocket.

515
00:55:49,790 --> 00:55:54,260
40% on average, 30% on average, 20% on average.

516
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:58,400
The premiums auto just very broadly is linearly.

517
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:08,270
Okay. What do I mean by that? So like a simple example, suppose a 50% plan costs $100 a month if there is no moral hazard.

518
00:56:08,270 --> 00:56:14,210
In other words, if there's no increase in consumption in response to getting more generous coverage and facing a lower out-of-pocket price,

519
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:18,800
I would predict that 100% coverage in that same plan ought to cost $200.

520
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:25,040
In other words, the premium would only vary with how generous the coverage is, and the coverage is twice as generous.

521
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:34,070
The premium would have to double to cover that cost. Now it's through this calculation, scaling up these three different plans to 100% coverage.

522
00:56:35,210 --> 00:56:39,020
So I had to pay $184 for 60% coverage.

523
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:42,860
Let's do that. Scale up exercise divided by point six.

524
00:56:43,430 --> 00:56:49,970
We would then predict at that rate of 194 for 60%, it should be 325 for 100% coverage.

525
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:59,090
I'll do the same exercise of the silver. If insurers are baking in sort of the cost of, well,

526
00:56:59,090 --> 00:57:06,140
if I give people more generous coverage or to use more care, that ought to be $325 when I scale that one up.

527
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:10,130
But look at it's 255 divided by 0.7.

528
00:57:11,450 --> 00:57:14,720
Scaling that coverage up to 100%, cost 364.

529
00:57:16,130 --> 00:57:25,430
Similarly, scaling up the gold premium of 308 for 80% coverage to 100% gives me 385.

530
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:36,110
Since these numbers are rising, that means the insurance setting is premium, is anticipating that people in this plan are going to use more care.

531
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:42,260
Not just that I'm going to cover a greater percent of it, but they're actually going to respond to the lower out-of-pocket price by using more.

532
00:57:43,070 --> 00:57:48,710
They could also be anticipating that selection issue. We talked about that, you know, maybe sicker people are going to join this plan.

533
00:57:49,790 --> 00:57:55,340
So the fact that this sort of hypothetical scale up to 100% is greater than this one.

534
00:57:55,430 --> 00:58:03,110
Just one is greater than this one reflects. Blue Cross, anticipating some combination of the people in the more generous plans,

535
00:58:03,770 --> 00:58:11,299
are going to use more care because they're responding to the lower out-of-pocket price and or they're going to be sicker people in the first place,

536
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:16,700
because sicker people are more likely to be attracted to the more generous plans because they think they're going to lose more care.

537
00:58:17,390 --> 00:58:24,800
So some combination of what we called moral hazard today and what we'll call adverse selection next week is going to explain this.

538
00:58:26,210 --> 00:58:34,910
Does that logic makes sense? So just go back to the $100 for 50% versus 200 for 100%.

539
00:58:35,270 --> 00:58:43,940
That's the scale up we're doing here. And what this is more like saying, well, if it's $100 for 50%, it's going to be $250 for 100%.

540
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:51,170
The insurers are anticipating that if they offer a 100% plan, people are going to use more care or sicker people.

541
00:58:51,170 --> 00:58:55,400
Bigger users are going to disproportionately select that 100% plan in the first place.

542
00:58:55,820 --> 00:58:59,870
So I can't just charge double the premium for double the generosity of coverage.

543
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:03,120
I've got to charge more than double the premium twice.

544
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:07,100
I'm going to be really surprised if my claims come in. I didn't collect enough premiums to pay them.

545
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:14,270
So again, evidence that people respond because insurers are anticipating this behavior.

546
00:59:16,450 --> 00:59:18,610
So here's the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment.

547
00:59:19,810 --> 00:59:25,360
So more and more reasons and the grand experiment in a different population around was more of a general population.

548
00:59:26,470 --> 00:59:30,040
The Oregon Health Insurance Experiment was focused on low income adults.

549
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:36,520
The state had some money to expand Medicaid coverage to include more low income adults.

550
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:42,010
But they didn't have nearly enough money to cover all the people that would qualify for it.

551
00:59:43,030 --> 00:59:48,190
So what they did is they set up a lottery. They said, you know, hey, apply for this coverage.

552
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:52,270
And then we'll randomly choose the number of people that we have the money to cover.

553
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:58,449
And then they the researchers were then able to compare the people who applied and got lucky,

554
00:59:58,450 --> 01:00:03,430
got randomized into being able to enroll versus the people who applied and got unlucky.

555
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:09,930
There's really no reason to believe that people were the people who got lucky or didn't in the lottery were different from each other.

556
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:15,280
They're drawn randomly from the same population, so they're essentially chosen experimentally.

557
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:26,020
So what happened to use the people who were given the opportunity to enroll?

558
01:00:26,590 --> 01:00:31,870
Used about 2.1 percentage points, which is about 30% in relative terms.

559
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:43,040
More hospital admissions. 2.1 emissions per person per year and about 35% relative increase in outpatient visits.

560
01:00:44,270 --> 01:00:50,300
ED use was the same. There was no significant change in ED use and overall spending went up by about a quarter.

561
01:00:51,890 --> 01:01:02,630
So in this population of adults with lower incomes, we see that providing Medicaid coverage definitely increases the use of care.

562
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:13,660
Okay. Some other. You got some other evidence that we have before the ACA?

563
01:01:15,390 --> 01:01:19,830
Kids who weren't full time students could only be covered on their parent's plan until age 19.

564
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:24,500
If you're a full time student, I think you'll be covered until 25.

565
01:01:24,510 --> 01:01:30,620
With the ACA, you can be covered until 26 and you could be working, you could be unemployed, you could be a student.

566
01:01:30,630 --> 01:01:34,050
It's just if you're under 26, you can be covered on your parent's policy.

567
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:39,570
So at this time period, this study was still you're 19. If you weren't a full time student was the limit.

568
01:01:41,490 --> 01:01:47,640
So we saw that aging out of the parents coverage at 19 and increased our insurance rates by 5 to 8%.

569
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:58,500
And then there are huge impacts on that newly uninsured set of young adults, 18 year olds becoming 19 40% drop in hospital admissions.

570
01:02:01,290 --> 01:02:06,170
A fourth person drop it, he argues, and 61% drop in hospital admissions.

571
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:14,180
So in this population of probably on average relatively healthy people losing coverage

572
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:20,600
because of this aging out of the parents plan dramatically affect the fact that utilization,

573
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:29,000
the ACA overall would be expected to increase use because we've obviously got more people covered than before and

574
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:35,540
we've eliminated some plans that had very high out-of-pocket costs and very little out of pocket or very low coverage,

575
01:02:35,540 --> 01:02:43,909
maximum coverage limits. And kind of the sort of forecast that was put together is it would be about a

576
01:02:43,910 --> 01:02:48,620
10% increase in use and outpatient care would be comfortable because that.

577
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:57,830
And so here's some evidence from Medicare. We've got two types of hospital admissions.

578
01:02:58,370 --> 01:03:03,679
They're deemed elective or not elective in the way they kind of split those up to kind of get an operational definition

579
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:10,280
of that is they looked at admissions for things where the admission rate was the same on weekends as weekdays.

580
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:17,290
And the elect those who consider the not. If I have a heart attack, I'm going to go to the hospital regardless of what they look at us.

581
01:03:18,190 --> 01:03:24,370
And then the things that had dramatically different admission rates Monday through Friday that over the weekend they deem to be elective.

582
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:30,429
So, again, a very crude split, but it's something at least empirically you can kind of do when there's sort of some logic to it.

583
01:03:30,430 --> 01:03:37,360
The things that are very similar admissions, regardless of day of the week, are probably more urgent, things harder to avoid,

584
01:03:38,170 --> 01:03:44,380
and things that are more optional would be things that should be admitted Monday through Friday, but not Saturday or Sunday for.

585
01:03:45,250 --> 01:03:55,260
So the dark line is that you've got a age trend in use for the elective, for these are not elective things.

586
01:03:55,260 --> 01:04:00,660
So things that are not very much and we see that well as you get older, you're using more, not surprisingly.

587
01:04:01,630 --> 01:04:06,160
And then there's a little break at age 65 when people become eligible for Medicare.

588
01:04:07,540 --> 01:04:10,779
Certainly some people at a lot of people had good insurance before 65.

589
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:17,170
But there definitely are a big chunk of people that are going from uninsured to insured in the population at age 65.

590
01:04:17,890 --> 01:04:21,310
And we see a little bit of an increase in the non elective stuff.

591
01:04:21,310 --> 01:04:28,270
So even those urgent things that you know, it didn't vary by day of the week, getting Medicare caused a little bit of an increase in use.

592
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:33,340
But now let's look at it for the elective things. So here's the age trend.

593
01:04:33,340 --> 01:04:39,370
In not surprisingly, as you get older, as you move from 60 to 65, there's a little bit of increase every year.

594
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:46,090
But then there's this massive break at age 65 and you've got the new trend line up here.

595
01:04:49,430 --> 01:04:53,290
A pretty compelling evidence that here use changes.

596
01:04:53,980 --> 01:04:57,969
So we've got a lot of different populations worried about adults with lower incomes from the

597
01:04:57,970 --> 01:05:04,420
Oregon study sort of the general under 65 population and round ramp didn't include over 65.

598
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:13,750
And we've got the Medicare population here. And we also talked about sort of very young adults or anything to 19 before the ACA.

599
01:05:25,330 --> 01:05:30,530
So we kind of use this general term of moral hazard. It's kind of a term that was sort of invented.

600
01:05:30,550 --> 01:05:33,730
But I don't think you should interpret as sort of like immoral behavior.

601
01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:38,889
This is not moral or immoral in a kind of a pejorative sense of that.

602
01:05:38,890 --> 01:05:43,420
It's just sort of a silly phrase that the insurance industry came up with decades ago.

603
01:05:43,870 --> 01:05:50,350
And now it's sort of been applied broadly. It basically just means how does having insurance change your behavior?

604
01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:57,810
We don't have to put any sort of moral or immoral connotation with that, but that's the phrase, and we're stuck with it.

605
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:07,620
So I can change my behavior in two ways if I have insurance. So far we've talked about as my utilization, how much care do I use when I get sick?

606
01:06:08,940 --> 01:06:18,240
It also change my preventive behavior. If I have insurance to cover the cost of my care, I might be less likely to avoid the loss in the first place.

607
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:26,730
So I might take chances I wouldn't take if I if I were the one that had to stay for all those consequences.

608
01:06:27,570 --> 01:06:36,340
When I go skydiving, if I didn't have health insurance, I'm probably not skydiving uninsured.

609
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:42,450
Sounds like a bad idea. I don't care if I'm a thrill seeker and I'm insured, maybe I'll go skydiving.

610
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:48,610
I don't think insurance is going to help you. You can get injured, skydiving and not killed.

611
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:56,010
If you get a hard landing or you can land in a tree and you can definitely get injured without getting killed.

612
01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:05,380
If your tail lights that the chute completely fails, health insurance is not going to help you, but you can definitely get injured skydiving.

613
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:14,070
So it's kind of the downside of insurance from a societal perspective because we have to pay more for it.

614
01:07:14,820 --> 01:07:19,290
You're the government program or the private insurer that we're either paying taxes to subsidize or

615
01:07:19,290 --> 01:07:27,120
we're paying premiums to pay for is going to have to collect enough money to to cover this extra care,

616
01:07:27,130 --> 01:07:34,170
because we're not either preventing illness as much as we would have some of these incentives that insurance creates,

617
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:37,680
or when we do get sick, we use a lot more care than would otherwise be enough.

618
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:45,780
So we've got to divide up those two types of moral hazard we call ex-head of your ex post moral hazard.

619
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:52,440
Ex-ante just means before the fact behavior changes that occur before the event occurs.

620
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:53,940
So think of that as the prevention.

621
01:07:55,890 --> 01:08:02,400
You know, if I have insurance, I'm less likely to take actions that prevent the claim from occurring in the first place.

622
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:06,030
I'll leave my Stovall out. If I have homeowner's insurance, I'll forget.

623
01:08:06,030 --> 01:08:09,530
You know, it won't be as careful as, say, Oh, did I turn that off before I left for vacation?

624
01:08:12,510 --> 01:08:17,910
Maybe I'll skip my flu vaccine as well. If I get sick and I get hospitalized, at least I have to pay for the hospitalization.

625
01:08:20,130 --> 01:08:24,480
The next post Moral hazard is how my behavior changes once the bad event has already happened.

626
01:08:25,260 --> 01:08:30,180
So this is sort of affecting the probability of of the loss occurring in the first place.

627
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:33,930
And this is affecting how expensive the losses, if it does occur.

628
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:39,989
If I do get sick and now I've got somebody else paying for most or all of the cost of my care,

629
01:08:39,990 --> 01:08:45,120
I'm going to use more care and I'm going to not shop around. So it's going to make the loss bigger.

630
01:08:46,110 --> 01:08:49,739
So ex-ante your ex post is just sort of before or after the event,

631
01:08:49,740 --> 01:08:53,550
ex ante or things that I do that affect the likelihood the event ever happens at all.

632
01:08:55,290 --> 01:08:59,249
Insured event. The claim is going to be filed for an ex post moral hazard.

633
01:08:59,250 --> 01:09:03,030
It's how insurance changes my behavior with respect to how big the loss is going to be,

634
01:09:03,030 --> 01:09:06,540
I'll make the claim I'm going to file if the event actually occurs.

635
01:09:11,030 --> 01:09:18,460
So kind of typical pattern. This is out of the Bhattacharya book, you know, I read more of the text about it there, if you want.

636
01:09:19,330 --> 01:09:24,580
I face a risk of some bad event and my actions can increase or decrease its likelihood.

637
01:09:24,580 --> 01:09:30,670
If I take care, it increases the likelihood. If I am a little more lax about caretaking and prevention,

638
01:09:30,670 --> 01:09:38,320
it increases the likelihood I have an insurance contract that's going to pay some or all of the costs of the bad event occurs.

639
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:42,370
So now the price of a bad event is sort of made artificially low to me.

640
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:48,760
And since the price is artificially low to me, I've got less incentive to prevent it from occurring.

641
01:09:51,710 --> 01:10:01,360
If you have auto insurance or don't and you have a choice between parking on the street for free or parking in a paid lot that's guarded.

642
01:10:03,540 --> 01:10:07,870
If you don't have auto insurance, you know, if my car gets stolen, I'm really screwed here.

643
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:11,940
Yeah. I'll pay for the parking in the monitored, fenced lot.

644
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:20,310
If you have insurance, it's like Val parked for free in the street. So that's an example of ex-ante moral hazard.

645
01:10:21,390 --> 01:10:29,310
Having insurance makes you more likely to take chances because paying the cost of the parking that you'd have to pay for.

646
01:10:31,390 --> 01:10:36,790
Part of the benefits of you paying that cost accrues to the insurer is not going to have to pay a claim for a stolen car.

647
01:10:37,870 --> 01:10:42,010
So you're taking a little higher risk of having your car stolen if you have insurance.

648
01:10:42,370 --> 01:10:45,549
Is parking for free just sounds a little bit more desirable than parking?

649
01:10:45,550 --> 01:10:49,300
Paying 20 bucks to park, even if there's a little bit higher risk.

650
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:54,970
Your car had stolen, you didn't have insurance. You might think that $20 got stolen.

651
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:00,080
Well, tough luck that's on you and the insurance company.

652
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:05,979
If they can simply sort of observe your behavior, well, they could write the contract and say, well,

653
01:11:05,980 --> 01:11:12,790
we're only going to cover you if you pay for parking when you're in a situation where there's free parking and it's more likely your target stolen.

654
01:11:14,410 --> 01:11:27,290
Hard for them to monitor that. So back in the health insurance context laboratory uses that cheeseburger as an example.

655
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:33,300
Says Without insurance, there are two costs to consuming a cheeseburger.

656
01:11:34,110 --> 01:11:40,530
The cost of actually buying the burger and then the cost of the increased likelihood that I have a heart attack in the future.

657
01:11:40,890 --> 01:11:44,580
And without insurance, I have to then pay for the medical care associated with that heart attack.

658
01:11:46,990 --> 01:11:50,230
With insurance. The cost of a cheeseburger is the cost of the cheeseburger.

659
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:58,660
His insurance is picking up the cost of the heart attack here. So I decide how many cheeseburgers do I want to have in a typical year?

660
01:12:00,370 --> 01:12:04,030
If I didn't have health insurance, I might have a few less than if I did.

661
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:15,389
Okay. So my price uninsured is sort of the sum of the price of the cheeseburger that I have

662
01:12:15,390 --> 01:12:19,710
to pay and then sort of the expected value of the extra medical costs down the road.

663
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:27,810
With insurance, the price drops. So I moved down my demand curve for cheeseburgers and I buy more of them.

664
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:34,840
So kind of this is for the call, the extent of the price distortion,

665
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:39,280
how much the price is artificially lowered below the full price of consuming a cheeseburger.

666
01:12:40,090 --> 01:12:44,410
And this is going to be the extra use. So the optimal amount of cheeseburgers is not zero.

667
01:12:48,650 --> 01:12:49,250
It's a point.

668
01:12:49,580 --> 01:12:56,930
So even if I had to pay the cost, not only of buying the cheeseburger, but also the future health care costs, I'd still eat some cheeseburgers.

669
01:12:57,350 --> 01:13:00,830
They're sufficiently valuable to me. There are chances I'm willing to take.

670
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:09,899
But if I have insurance, I'm going to take more chances. Is I'm only going to account for the price of a cheeseburger.

671
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:13,320
I'm not going to account for. Well, how is that going to impact my future medical costs?

672
01:13:13,740 --> 01:13:24,080
Because my insurer is going to take up those future medical costs. So that's kind of the ex-ante moral hazard that I'm going to have less prevention.

673
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:31,190
I'm going to take more chances because I have insurance that that artificially reduces the cost to me of taking those chances.

674
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:39,450
Already I've talked about this moral hazard and asymmetric information.

675
01:13:39,460 --> 01:13:44,580
If the insurer could easily observe my behavior, if they could observe how many cheeseburgers I'm eating.

676
01:13:44,970 --> 01:13:51,960
They could write the contract saying that we're only going to cover you if over the year you don't eat more than Q you cheeseburgers.

677
01:13:55,390 --> 01:14:00,580
Number one, is it easy for them to do that? And number two, do you really want your insurance company, your business like that?

678
01:14:03,170 --> 01:14:08,360
Kind of like some privacy in my life. It's none of our business having cheeseburgers I eat.

679
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:18,730
So what do insurance companies try to do? Well, we already talked about cost sharing.

680
01:14:18,740 --> 01:14:24,030
They impose co-insurance, co-payments and deductibles. They might also do some level monitoring.

681
01:14:24,050 --> 01:14:29,120
So in one of the presentations we had last week, we had the life insurer that was monitoring the Fitbits.

682
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:42,330
And who that. Yeah, I know there are a lot of variables, but when we compare the health care systems where there's universal coverage,

683
01:14:43,410 --> 01:14:48,810
why are people generally healthier and lead healthier lifestyles without.

684
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:53,940
Like they try to even avoid medical care or like, let's say Japan or Switzerland or something like that.

685
01:14:55,470 --> 01:15:00,090
So. That's a hard one because there are so many cultural differences as well,

686
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:05,880
which might even be correlated with what type of health insurance system they've decided to nationally impose.

687
01:15:07,150 --> 01:15:09,090
You know, it is a very health conscious society.

688
01:15:09,090 --> 01:15:18,510
They're probably not going to want to have a lot of a large uninsured population, very high out-of-pocket costs, bankrupting people if they get care.

689
01:15:19,050 --> 01:15:25,590
So even the preferences for health in the society might actually be reflected in the insurance system that's that's created.

690
01:15:25,590 --> 01:15:29,070
And so you can kind of like a similar selection effect that we talked about.

691
01:15:29,370 --> 01:15:31,620
You know, the more generous plan is going to get sicker people.

692
01:15:31,980 --> 01:15:37,970
So, you know, a more health conscious country is probably going to want a more generous health insurance system,

693
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:50,550
a national system that covers everybody, that even the correlations that you do, you think people's behaviors are less selfish than here, for example?

694
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:59,070
I sure I want to get into that. But, yeah, you could you can certainly say there are there are big cultural differences.

695
01:15:59,700 --> 01:16:07,110
You know, people who work or travel abroad or are aware of and, you know, we have a certain reputation in this country.

696
01:16:07,570 --> 01:16:12,420
I don't mean that in general. Yes. But the point well taken.

697
01:16:13,420 --> 01:16:14,610
So they might be able to do monitoring.

698
01:16:14,610 --> 01:16:21,600
They might monitor your provider's utilization or review on the providers and say you were trying to limit moral hazard by saying,

699
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:27,660
yeah, you can only get an MRI for certain conditions if you jump through certain hoops.

700
01:16:28,740 --> 01:16:32,790
So there's a lot they try to do to limit moral hazard.

701
01:16:33,330 --> 01:16:36,120
So monitoring of it might be.

702
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:47,400
Consumer facing trying to get people to do preventive care fitness test quit smoking exercise, have your Fitbit data uploaded.

703
01:16:48,090 --> 01:16:52,620
Maybe if you see a nutritionist, you get a bonus in your insurance plans from your employer.

704
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:58,770
Sometimes it's just motivation for being healthy, but then there's also the stuff they do with providers,

705
01:16:58,770 --> 01:17:03,990
you know, gatekeeping saying, well, you can only see a specialist if your primary care physician refers you.

706
01:17:05,820 --> 01:17:14,190
You can only get this test if your physician orders it and establishes that the insurer's indications for the test run that.

707
01:17:15,330 --> 01:17:21,090
So this type of monitoring can be both on consumers and on the provider side.

708
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:29,460
Finally as we before we end, is all moral hazard necessarily bad?

709
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:34,800
Let's think about if we cover preventive services very generously.

710
01:17:34,890 --> 01:17:37,980
So the ACA, for example, has a set of you know,

711
01:17:38,010 --> 01:17:45,270
if you ask us for our task force A or B graded services based on the strength of the evidence of their effectiveness.

712
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:49,770
They have to be covered by all insurance plans at zero out of pocket cost.

713
01:17:50,670 --> 01:17:57,060
And that's part of the Supreme Court case. So that may or may not disappear, but right now that is the law.

714
01:17:58,590 --> 01:18:03,990
So in that case, we'd say, well, wait a second, we've got moral hazard on the use of care when you get sick.

715
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:13,260
Let's maybe also try to create moral hazard on prevention by making that free to try to encourage you to not skimp on prevention.

716
01:18:15,030 --> 01:18:19,020
And potentially save costs down the road. So that's an example.

717
01:18:19,030 --> 01:18:23,640
So if in fact, people were consuming a suboptimal amount of preventive care,

718
01:18:24,060 --> 01:18:29,100
then providing it more generously to try to encourage it could be efficient moral hazard.

719
01:18:29,820 --> 01:18:35,340
So again, it goes back to the point of let's not use moral hazard as a term that has a connotation of normal or immoral.

720
01:18:36,060 --> 01:18:40,380
It's just, how does your behavior change when somebody else is paying part or all of the bill for you?

721
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:51,040
That's all it really means. So you can also think about, you know, people getting, quote, rich or exactly what we want them to become richer.

722
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:57,460
Maybe you can't afford a liver transplant if you don't have insurance and now your liver is failing and you'll die without it.

723
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:04,060
If you have insurance, you're going to get you're going to get that liver transplant.

724
01:19:04,670 --> 01:19:10,160
So insurance plan, it functions a lot like that kind of ideal sort of auto insurance type that we talked about.

725
01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:15,730
It transfers purchasing power to you in a state of the world where money is really valuable.

726
01:19:16,060 --> 01:19:19,450
You don't have $400,000 sitting around for a liver transplant.

727
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:25,100
And if you don't get it, you're going to die. That may be very efficient.

728
01:19:25,110 --> 01:19:28,139
That may be so. Is it moral hazard in some sense?

729
01:19:28,140 --> 01:19:33,960
Yeah. You wouldn't have gotten the liver transplant if you didn't have the policy. So you can sue for $100,000 in extra care.

730
01:19:35,490 --> 01:19:43,020
But are you are you willing to pay a little extra premium to make sure that transplants are covered in your policy in case you're that person?

731
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:52,340
Probably are. It's probably acting exactly like that perfect insurance policy that we wished we had that identified.

732
01:19:52,340 --> 01:19:55,370
You know, here's a situation where income is really valuable to you.

733
01:19:56,570 --> 01:19:58,789
You'll die without our $400,000. And it looks.
