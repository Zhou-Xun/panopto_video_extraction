00:00:10,014 --> 00:00:11,749
Hey it's Matt Zawistowski.

2
00:00:11,749 --> 00:00:15,644
Welcome back to our discussion of
the random intercept mixed effect model.

3
00:00:15,644 --> 00:00:19,591
Now that we've established the framework
for the random intercept model,

4
00:00:19,591 --> 00:00:22,190
let's talk about how will
actually put it to use.

5
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:26,678
The random intercept version of the mixed
effect regression model contains a mixture

6
00:00:26,678 --> 00:00:27,558
of parameters.

7
00:00:27,558 --> 00:00:32,303
Fixed effect terms corresponding
to the population regression line,

8
00:00:32,303 --> 00:00:35,633
random effect terms, and
the random error term.

9
00:00:35,633 --> 00:00:39,647
Much like standard linear regression,
we are going to make assumptions for

10
00:00:39,647 --> 00:00:42,855
the mixed model that will allow for
statistical inference.

11
00:00:42,855 --> 00:00:47,546
The first two assumptions should look
quite familiar that the random error

12
00:00:47,546 --> 00:00:49,781
terms epsilon ij or independent and

13
00:00:49,781 --> 00:00:55,163
collectively follow a normal distribution
with constant variance sigma e squared.

14
00:00:55,163 --> 00:00:59,382
These are the exact same assumptions we
made regarding random errors in standard

15
00:00:59,382 --> 00:01:00,508
linear regression.

16
00:01:00,508 --> 00:01:05,688
Except now this distribution corresponds
to the spread of error around the subject

17
00:01:05,688 --> 00:01:10,205
specific regression lines instead
of the population regression line.

18
00:01:10,205 --> 00:01:14,048
Here are two new assumptions based
on the random intercept term.

19
00:01:14,048 --> 00:01:18,984
We assume that the random intercept
turns will follow a normal distribution,

20
00:01:18,984 --> 00:01:23,487
this one centered at zero and
denote the variance as sigma b0 squared.

21
00:01:23,487 --> 00:01:26,259
Finally, we assume that
the random intercepts and

22
00:01:26,259 --> 00:01:28,264
the random errors are independent.

23
00:01:28,264 --> 00:01:33,113
That is, the location of a subject
specific line relative to the population

24
00:01:33,113 --> 00:01:37,962
regression line has no bearing as to
how observations are distributed about

25
00:01:37,962 --> 00:01:40,556
the subject specific regression line.

26
00:01:40,556 --> 00:01:45,520
With the model equation an assumption set,
we can consider the fitted version of

27
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,322
a mixed model and
how we interpret the estimated parameters.

28
00:01:49,322 --> 00:01:53,412
Statistical software can be used to
fit the mixed model to the data,

29
00:01:53,412 --> 00:01:58,173
to compute estimates and corresponding
standard errors for the parameters.

30
00:01:58,173 --> 00:02:02,689
The point estimates for the beta values
defined the population regression line.

31
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:05,816
The other estimated parameters
are the variance terms for

32
00:02:05,816 --> 00:02:09,920
the distribution of the random
intercepts in the random errors.

33
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,600
Note that the actual random intercepts
are not usually estimated and

34
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,053
are not required to be estimated to use
the model for interpretation or inference.

35
00:02:18,053 --> 00:02:22,605
What is required is just those
estimates of the variance of the random

36
00:02:22,605 --> 00:02:24,262
intercepts and errors.

37
00:02:24,262 --> 00:02:28,411
The beta zero in beta one terms
have very familiar interpretations.

38
00:02:28,411 --> 00:02:32,583
They're the population intercept and
slope terms respectively.

39
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:36,808
Beta zero is the mean or
expected outcome value at time zero.

40
00:02:36,808 --> 00:02:42,343
In beta one is the change in the expected
outcome for a one unit increase in time.

41
00:02:42,343 --> 00:02:44,649
Note that these are population parameters,

42
00:02:44,649 --> 00:02:49,029
meaning that they are estimates averaged
across all individuals in the population.

43
00:02:49,029 --> 00:02:53,004
The quantity we are usually most
interested in here is the estimate of

44
00:02:53,004 --> 00:02:54,452
the slope term beta one.

45
00:02:54,452 --> 00:02:57,568
If the estimated value
beta one hat is positive,

46
00:02:57,568 --> 00:03:01,520
it indicates that the expected
outcomes increase overtime.

47
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,957
Whereas in negative value for beta,

48
00:03:03,957 --> 00:03:08,371
one hat indicates that the expected
outcome decreases overtime.

49
00:03:08,371 --> 00:03:12,887
The interpretations of the fixed effect
beta parameters are precisely the same as

50
00:03:12,887 --> 00:03:16,429
the interpretations were for
the standard linear regression.

51
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:19,905
As we will see in data examples,
the numerical estimates for

52
00:03:19,905 --> 00:03:22,223
the beta parameters are quite similar,

53
00:03:22,223 --> 00:03:26,263
regardless of whether one uses
standard regression or a mixed model.

54
00:03:26,263 --> 00:03:30,074
One common use for a fitted
regression model's prediction, for

55
00:03:30,074 --> 00:03:34,726
example, to compute the predicted outcome
value at a specified point in time.

56
00:03:34,726 --> 00:03:39,154
Since we're usually interested in the
predicted value for a population rather

57
00:03:39,154 --> 00:03:43,844
than for a specific individual in our data
set, we can use the population regression

58
00:03:43,844 --> 00:03:47,964
line in the same manner as it's done for
the standard linear regression.

59
00:03:47,964 --> 00:03:52,901
That is, we simply plug the time of
interest t0 into the population regression

60
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:56,816
equation to get the predicted
outcome within the population.

61
00:03:56,816 --> 00:04:01,679
Note that this property is the result of
the random intercepts and random errors,

62
00:04:01,679 --> 00:04:03,801
each having expected values of 0.

63
00:04:03,801 --> 00:04:06,301
So in terms of prediction, we again,

64
00:04:06,301 --> 00:04:11,393
find that the mixed model has a similarity
with standard linear regression.

65
00:04:11,393 --> 00:04:12,945
What about inference?

66
00:04:12,945 --> 00:04:18,186
For example, whether we have sufficient
evidence to reject the null hypothesis

67
00:04:18,186 --> 00:04:23,052
that beta one and zero, implying that
the mean outcome changes overtime?

68
00:04:23,052 --> 00:04:27,939
Think about how you performed hypothesis
testing on regression parameters

69
00:04:27,939 --> 00:04:30,082
in standard linear regression.

70
00:04:30,082 --> 00:04:34,809
You would probably go to an output table
from R and use the information in the row

71
00:04:34,809 --> 00:04:38,906
corresponding to your parameter
of interest to make the decision.

72
00:04:38,906 --> 00:04:42,146
The t statistic shown here is for
the wall test and

73
00:04:42,146 --> 00:04:47,770
consists of the point estimate divided by
the standard error of the point estimate.

74
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:52,233
The p value is based on a comparison
of the wall test statistic to its

75
00:04:52,233 --> 00:04:54,158
asymptotic distribution.

76
00:04:54,158 --> 00:04:59,084
If the P value is smaller than some
prespecified alpha level, say 5%,

77
00:04:59,084 --> 00:05:03,304
then we would reject the null
hypothesis at that alpha level.

78
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:08,037
In general, statistical inference
regarding a regression parameter relies

79
00:05:08,037 --> 00:05:09,406
upon two quantities.

80
00:05:09,406 --> 00:05:13,551
The estimate of the specific parameter and
the estimate of the random error

81
00:05:13,551 --> 00:05:18,360
unexplained by the model specifically,
the estimate of sigma e squared.

82
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,733
As we've noted, the estimate for fixed
effect regression parameters will be very

83
00:05:22,733 --> 00:05:25,610
similar for standard and
mixture regression models.

84
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:30,520
But the estimate of random error can be
quite different because of how the two

85
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,603
models approach random error.

86
00:05:32,603 --> 00:05:37,189
Recall that random error in the standard
regression framework is the distance

87
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:38,995
between observed outcomes and

88
00:05:38,995 --> 00:05:42,342
the population regression
lines shown here on the left.

89
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:46,944
Whereas in the mixed model random errors,
the distance between the observed

90
00:05:46,944 --> 00:05:51,561
outcomes in the subject specific
regression line, shown here on the right.

91
00:05:51,561 --> 00:05:56,070
We can think about how this different
approach to random error will impact

92
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:59,635
inference by considering
the same wall test statistic for

93
00:05:59,635 --> 00:06:02,703
the slope parameter in
a mixed regression model.

94
00:06:02,703 --> 00:06:07,552
The effect size estimate in the numerator
will be nearly the same as that from

95
00:06:07,552 --> 00:06:09,083
standard aggression.

96
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:13,823
But the standard error in the denominator,
which depends on the random

97
00:06:13,823 --> 00:06:18,728
error estimate sigma e squared can
differ potentially dramatically so.

98
00:06:18,728 --> 00:06:24,101
The result is that this wall t statistic
for establishing evidence against the null

99
00:06:24,101 --> 00:06:29,643
hypothesis will be different than the Wald
statistic based on standard regression.

100
00:06:29,643 --> 00:06:34,174
It's important to note however, that
while the wall t statistic is useful for

101
00:06:34,174 --> 00:06:37,815
making comparisons regarding
inference between standard and

102
00:06:37,815 --> 00:06:40,905
mixed regression models,
hypothesis testing based

103
00:06:40,905 --> 00:06:44,359
on the wall statistic is not
recommended for mixed models.

104
00:06:44,359 --> 00:06:46,805
The reason is that
the degrees of freedom for

105
00:06:46,805 --> 00:06:51,053
the distribution of the wall statistic
in the mixed model is not well known.

106
00:06:51,053 --> 00:06:54,388
That is, we don't quite know
what distribution to use for

107
00:06:54,388 --> 00:06:59,030
looking up the wall statistic to get a P
value like we do for standard aggression.

108
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:02,562
This is particularly problematic for
smaller data sets.

109
00:07:02,562 --> 00:07:07,421
In later lectures will introduce alternate
methods, including the likelihood

110
00:07:07,421 --> 00:07:12,143
ratio test for hypothesis testing of
regression parameters in mixed models.

111
00:07:12,143 --> 00:07:15,235
The take home message is that
although the estimates for

112
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:19,845
population regression parameters are
usually quite similar between standard and

113
00:07:19,845 --> 00:07:24,390
mixed effect regression, statistical
inference including hypothesis testing

114
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:28,435
in confidence intervals can be very
different between the two methods.

115
00:07:28,435 --> 00:07:33,497
That sums up our introduction to
random intercept mixed effect models.

116
00:07:33,497 --> 00:07:34,877
In this set of videos,

117
00:07:34,877 --> 00:07:40,039
we again emphasize that standard linear
regression is not appropriate for repeated

118
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:44,853
measures data due to the violation of
independent random errors assumption.

119
00:07:44,853 --> 00:07:49,721
We introduced the random intercept term
to accommodate the correlated outcomes by

120
00:07:49,721 --> 00:07:54,322
partitioning variation into between
subject and within subject variation.

121
00:07:54,322 --> 00:07:58,290
Finally, we discussed how fixed effect
parameters will be quite similar to

122
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:00,274
that of standard linear regression,

123
00:08:00,274 --> 00:08:05,141
but that inference will differ due
to the partitioning of variation.
