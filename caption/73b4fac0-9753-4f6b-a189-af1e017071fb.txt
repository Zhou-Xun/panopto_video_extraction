1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,280
Often we want to know the risk of getting an outcome over a certain period of time or

2
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:19,110
expressed another way how likely we are to be healthy by some certain time period.

3
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:28,470
For example, after experiencing a heart attack, I might ask my doctor, how likely is it that I will still be alive in another five or ten years?

4
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:35,910
Or if I've been born with a normal hyperplasia, which is basically a limited amount of normal on my teeth?

5
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,360
How likely is it in the next five years that I'll get a cavity?

6
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:45,240
Or how likely is it over the next 30 years that I'm still going to have all of my original teeth?

7
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:53,000
In previous lectures, we've talked a bit about how to use data on populations to identify risk,

8
00:00:53,510 --> 00:01:01,610
but we noted that there can be serious challenges when the populations we're following are dynamic and people are lost over time due to migration,

9
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:05,810
death or disinterest in continued participation in our studies.

10
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:13,640
We've also talked about the use of incidence rates as a way to address these kinds of losses in participation over time.

11
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:21,530
However, the truth is there's a different interpretation for an incidence rate than an incidence proportion,

12
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:26,990
and there's times that we want that really nice interpretation of risk of an event.

13
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:33,649
Therefore, in this video, I'm going to talk you through a second approach that allows us to calculate

14
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:40,129
cumulative incidence as proportions or risks at certain time points and its analog,

15
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:46,280
the cumulative probability of being disease free or surviving up until a certain point in time.

16
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:53,250
This approach, which is called the Kaplan-Meier approach, is a very common one in epidemiology,

17
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:58,650
and its survival curves frequently appear in the published literature and in scientific reports.

18
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:06,730
As you'll learn in this video, the Kaplan-Meier approach is especially desirable because of its flexibility that allows for

19
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:12,640
changing incidence as well as lost to follow up of individuals for any reason over time.

20
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,210
So let's get started.

21
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:24,510
We'll begin with an example of what survival curves generated using the Kaplan-Meier approach look like in order to help get ourselves oriented.

22
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:35,370
This example shows the cumulative probability of staying alive or surviving on the Y axis and the time since diagnosis on the X axis.

23
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:43,080
These data reflect the experience of a population of people that have been diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the liver,

24
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,890
a rare cancer of the lymphatic system focused on the liver.

25
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:52,140
As you can see, the authors have not just reported one survival curve,

26
00:02:52,590 --> 00:03:00,330
but rather they've split their survival curves up by age group in order to compare how different people fare over time.

27
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:08,520
From these curves, you can see that the older groups have much more rapid decline in survival over time than those who are younger.

28
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:14,209
So how are these curves generated? Well, just as before,

29
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:18,710
the Kaplan-Meier approach assumes that there's some group of a fixed number of people

30
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:23,900
at risk that are being followed over time to see who develops the outcome of interest.

31
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,720
The outcome could be deaths or caries or really any other outcome that interests you.

32
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:37,400
As time progresses, the exact time can be recorded when individuals in the group develop the outcome.

33
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:44,840
In other words, they turn orange or they leave the study through what we call censoring the ascension.

34
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:52,510
Essential individuals are marked with gray. Now at each time point where a person gets the disease.

35
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:58,180
The investigator can update the population at risk based on who is still present in the study.

36
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,860
They then estimate the conditional probability of survival.

37
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:10,900
Up until that time point, meaning what's the probability of survival at that time, given that a person was still alive at that time?

38
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:19,300
Finally, the investigator calculates the cumulative probability of survival from the start of the study until that time point.

39
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:28,419
Now, the way in which investigators update the curve at every time that an event occurs is the cause of this characteristic

40
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:35,590
bumpiness of the kaplan-meier curve and the way in which we can accommodate changing incidents over time.

41
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:44,460
Let's walk through the step by step process by which we generate kaplan-meier curves to really help you understand the strategy.

42
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:51,920
To do so we're going to use the following data from a population of 50 people who've been followed for 24 months.

43
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:58,340
The data that I'm showing here represents the time to event for each person who got an outcome.

44
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:02,210
Or the time to censoring for people who are lost to follow up.

45
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:09,170
All other individuals were assumed to have made it to the end of the study without dying or being censored.

46
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:20,050
In the first step of generating a kaplan-meier estimate, we update the population at risk for each time when an event occurs.

47
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:27,729
How do we do this? Well, we take the number at risk at the previous time period and subtract off all

48
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:32,650
of those people who had an event or were lost since the last event occurred.

49
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:37,570
Note that while we're updating the number of people at risk due to censoring,

50
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,700
we actually only update these estimates at the time when an event occurs.

51
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:50,960
Not one censoring occurs. Next, we calculate the conditional probability of survival when each event occurs.

52
00:05:51,530 --> 00:06:00,080
This is estimated as those without the outcome or the number at risk, minus the number of people who did get the outcome at that time.

53
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:06,440
Divided by the number of people at risk at that time, which is the number that we estimated in step one.

54
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:12,680
This estimate can also be imagined as one minus the incidence proportion.

55
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:21,530
In our third step, we now need to calculate the cumulative survival from the start of the study up until the time point of interest.

56
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:29,660
In other words, what's the chance that somebody stays alive in the current month as well as all other previous months?

57
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:38,480
Since we know that the probability of two things happening together is the multiplication of each of the individual probabilities,

58
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,330
you can see that we can estimate the human of survival by multiplying the conditional

59
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:50,270
survival at this time times the conditional survival at all times before that.

60
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:55,370
Excellent. Now we have generated our data for a kaplan-meier curve.

61
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:01,790
Here. I've plotted our numbers to obtain the kaplan-meier curve for this particular data set.

62
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:08,000
We can now use this graphic to extract the cumulative probability at any time point.

63
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:14,270
For example, you can see that the six month survival with this data is 96%.

64
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:23,770
Given that risk is the opposite of survival, we can estimate the cumulative risk by subtracting the cumulative survival probability from one.

65
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:29,620
In other words, we have a probability of survival at six months of 96%.

66
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:34,840
Therefore, we must have a cumulative risk at that same time of 4%.

67
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:44,170
Now that you've learned how to implement the Kaplan-Meier approach, I want to briefly touch upon a couple of assumptions that go into this estimation.

68
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:50,380
First, we assume that the reasons for censoring are unrelated to the risk of developing the outcome.

69
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,800
If they are not, then bias can ensue.

70
00:07:54,610 --> 00:08:02,680
Imagine, for example, that people who are sicker and at higher risk of death are much more likely to drop out of our study or be censored over time.

71
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:09,580
In this case, the population being followed is going to become healthier and healthier as time progresses,

72
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:14,710
and the estimates of survival in this group will become less reflective of the true population.

73
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:23,480
Now when we use data that's been collected from people at different time periods, there's also an assumption of a lack of secular trend.

74
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:29,419
The reason that this is important is because the kaplan-meier curves allow

75
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:34,970
for individuals to contribute person time at different actual physical times.

76
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:43,430
In other words, the follow up time of zero could be for 2012, for one participant, and in 2014 for another.

77
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:49,040
Yet this method assumes that the data from each of those individuals is the same.

78
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:53,600
In order for this to be true. There must not be any secular trends.

79
00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:03,740
Great. Congratulations. You've now calculated your very first chemother of survival estimates in dynamic populations using kaplan-meier curves.

80
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:12,170
Hopefully you've now seen how survival will decline over time and how this approach allows for flexibility in that decline over time.

81
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:18,910
You also should now know how to predict cumulative incidence at set time points using this approach.
