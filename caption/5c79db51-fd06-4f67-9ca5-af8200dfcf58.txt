1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:06,480
Like fun, but also it's really hard.

2
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:18,120
Yes. Like, sounds like you might have a kid and I'm not.

3
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,390
That's good to know.

4
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:32,850
Every over years. Okay.

5
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:43,210
Well, we're going to be a married group down here. Well, happy New Year, everyone.

6
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:54,810
Welcome back. I don't mind me. I'm really honest with you.

7
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:16,910
You can have a good break. I mean, it's okay if you're here.

8
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:23,050
You're here for return and child nutrition. So welcome.

9
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:30,520
What I want to do today is just go through the format of the class.

10
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:38,500
We'll go through the syllabus a little bit and then we're going to talk about pre-conception health and start moving into if we have time.

11
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:44,440
Metabolic adaptation of our metabolic adaptations that occur in pregnancy.

12
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,590
And if I don't get to metabolic adaptations in pregnancy,

13
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:55,630
I will do a Panopto recording for you guys to just watch as it's only about 12 slides so you guys can watch it.

14
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:01,350
Sometime this weekend, next week.

15
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,970
I get to watch it before next Friday.

16
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:11,580
That will work. So and then after we get done talking about the course, the syllabus,

17
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:22,469
we're going to do a round of introductions because first and foremost, this class is a required course for nutritional science.

18
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:27,540
Dietetic student studies course is available for them.

19
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:35,820
That being said, I take students from other departments and I think we might even have one or two undergrad students in here.

20
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:42,180
So we've got our mix of folks. And so I would like to just do a quick round of intros.

21
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,810
Okay. And then we'll move on to Pre-conception Health.

22
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:59,910
So most important point point here was to just highlight for those of you who have not had, of course, with me, feel free to reach out to me.

23
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:03,320
Any time you have questions, you can also grab me after class.

24
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:08,810
That's actually a great time too, but just send me an email if you want to meet.

25
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:15,300
I'm happy to meet. Okay, so just feel free to reach out.

26
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:23,910
We have a greater those of you who were committed nutrition Liz Petite or Elizabeth.

27
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:33,180
She goes by Liz was the greater for our whole class and she's fabulous so she's going to be our creator for this course.

28
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:45,210
So this course focuses on the nutritional requirements of the nutritional needs in pregnancy.

29
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:54,690
Actually, we're going to talk about a pre-conception, a very linear pre-conception, pregnancy, lactation, infancy, and children.

30
00:03:55,710 --> 00:04:00,090
You can see very linear. So we're just going to follow that.

31
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:07,040
Let's stage. We do spend actually a fair amount of time in pregnancy.

32
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:18,810
I think six classes we spend in pregnancy, we'll spend roughly three or four, maybe three in like four lactation and we have plenty of sleep.

33
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:22,710
So there's some up here and over here.

34
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:33,320
We only spend two. Focuses on infants and child.

35
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:39,260
But I think and I do have the resources for those of you who are interested in adolescent nutrition,

36
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:42,920
and I have resources for you to use after the class.

37
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:49,090
So this is a science based course.

38
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:54,950
Most of all of our nutritional sciences students have a science background.

39
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:05,920
If you have not had human physiology. And there are terms or concepts that you're not familiar with.

40
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,390
I encourage you to get online.

41
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:15,730
There are physiology, resources, make sure they're scholarly or from a university or college.

42
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:23,140
After you do that, if you're still confused about what was covered in class, then grab me.

43
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:32,740
My expectation is, since most of our students have already had physiology, not most all of our students that have physiology and biochemistry.

44
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:47,739
I don't stop to explain things, but those of you who have not have any of those courses, again, see if you can answer it using some resources online.

45
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,930
And if you can't, then please feel free to reach out to me, okay?

46
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:56,080
Okay. I think that's all I need to say there.

47
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:09,160
The course. Oh, also, as you saw on the syllabus, there's no textbooks, so all the readings will always be posted.

48
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:14,170
The only readings that aren't posted is if they're Academy Papers.

49
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:20,010
And that's simply because the National Academy asks that we not post.

50
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:24,340
But I will have a link for you and you can just go to the National Academy.

51
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:28,030
Even though the workshop reports will have a price.

52
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:35,620
They're readily downloadable for the public which were published, so you can easily download them.

53
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:44,589
You might have to include your University of Michigan email, address and a password, but other than that, you can easily download the workshop report.

54
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:47,260
So I'll give you a link if you need to.

55
00:06:48,220 --> 00:07:01,720
If I'm referring to Academy Report also I will provide a PDF of the slides as well as a slide handout for those who want to print slides.

56
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:16,689
Okay. So you'll be evaluated in this course with two projects and two exams, a midterm and final, and the two projects are developing a meal plan.

57
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:22,390
So it will be pregnancy based meal plan that then Segways to gestational diabetes.

58
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:35,320
And the second project is a mini review paper that you will I'll assign it after winter break and you have three or four weeks to work on it.

59
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:46,010
Okay. So those are the. Projects and how you're evaluated in.

60
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:54,040
That's one thing I do want to point out for the wanted term.

61
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:57,910
When I take a step back, there was flexibility in the fall.

62
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:09,429
There is flexibility always, but it's important to start developing better time management skills or developing time

63
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:16,180
management skills so that you don't have any issues meeting deadlines for the assignments.

64
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:16,720
Okay.

65
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:27,340
So but that being said, I do understand that things can happen, but if you have a sense that you may not be able to turn in either project on time,

66
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:38,650
please give me five days notice so that we can meet and come up with a plan so that you have a deadline that's achievable and timely.

67
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:45,879
Okay. So that being said, I also understand that there'll be illnesses, there can be family emergencies.

68
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:56,380
So obviously that's not an issue. But I think it's time for all of our sciences second semester work on those time management skills.

69
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:01,030
Yeah. Also, if anyone is feeling ill, please don't come.

70
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:12,670
We love you, but don't come. And I record the lectures on Panopto so you'll always be able to review or listen to the lecture,

71
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:19,640
especially in this class, because we don't have much of a buffer. So.

72
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:31,880
Okay, any questions so far? If, for example, the is lost or pardon me, sales and resorts are closed.

73
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:43,370
Oh, no, they're closed. Yeah. I'll talk a little bit more about the final when I get the exams, when we get to when we get to the exams.

74
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:49,550
I'm not being articulate, smart, and I can tell it's Friday.

75
00:09:50,360 --> 00:10:02,660
It's 830 in the morning. Okay. So the syllabus, the course calendar will have your when assignments or projects are assigned as well as the due dates.

76
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:08,270
Note that these are not on your home page of.

77
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:12,580
Canvas. It's on the course syllabus.

78
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:16,030
The course syllabus is on canvas on the very first landing page.

79
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:20,800
So you can pull up the course syllabus and the calendar at any point.

80
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:30,220
Um, but in terms of the actual assignment, that being said, I always do sort of a looking ahead slide that when I,

81
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:35,530
when we have class so that everybody sort of has a heads up of when due dates are and so forth.

82
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:39,340
So it's not as though it's going to be a surprise.

83
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:51,850
Um, let's see. Anything else I need to point out now, other than just February ten, this is a guest who you do not want to miss,

84
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,870
especially those of you who are going to be practicing and patient care clients.

85
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:07,620
So so you söder has a long background in diabetes, especially gestational.

86
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:26,110
She's also really good at patient care and counseling, so she also can share her approaches about patient counseling, which is key.

87
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,790
So those of you, especially in dietetics, you want to make sure you attend.

88
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:36,970
I do record it, but it's not the same and it's a question and answer session.

89
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:45,430
So she does not give any presentation. So I will be going over you can see the week before I'll be going over gestational diabetes.

90
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:50,560
I'll be just talking about it in the context of what the recommendations are in the US.

91
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:56,350
I'll talk a little bit about globally, but Cecilia is going to talk about it from a practitioner standpoint.

92
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:02,370
Okay. So because I'm not a dietician, I have never worked clinically.

93
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:10,240
So she's going to be able to give you that perspective. And she's worked for a number of years in diabetes as well as gestational diabetes.

94
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:14,170
So this is a class you don't want to miss.

95
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:21,490
The midterm exam is on the 24th.

96
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:27,610
So your exams, both exams and then the final exam is on April 21st.

97
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:32,080
Both exams are not conducted in class.

98
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,450
You'll be taking them on canvas, actually a quiz, but it's your exam.

99
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:41,170
And what we'll be doing is we'll be doing it through Zoom.

100
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:51,790
So I will be proctoring you through a Zoom session so you guys can be home or on campus somewhere to take the exam.

101
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:55,660
You have the whole class time, so almost 2 hours.

102
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:59,440
Those of you who have special accommodations, you'll have extra time.

103
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:06,669
But that's essentially what it is. It's a zoom session. You'll work on canvas.

104
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:09,760
I'll see all your bright faces in the screen and.

105
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:15,410
That's how we're doing it. So it is close notes. Okay.

106
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,760
So I will next week we'll talk a little bit more about prepping.

107
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:31,370
But your. Learning objectives are a good resource for staying on top of the material and so forth.

108
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,240
But we'll talk more about that. I think that's it.

109
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:50,910
Any questions about what I've covered so far? If anyone has any conflicts with the midterm because it's right before winter break.

110
00:13:51,540 --> 00:14:00,570
I've already heard from one student, you need to reach out to me soon because I'm not going to have multiple alternative test dates.

111
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:06,030
But I also recognize that some of you may have plane tickets or train tickets.

112
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:10,950
And I know that, you know, at the time when you purchased them, you didn't know what the schedule is going to be.

113
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,120
So I understand.

114
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:23,190
But you need to see me soon because I need to sort of coordinate an alternative test date and I have to get that all set up and canvas and so forth.

115
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:28,320
So please reach out to me if this is not going to work for you on Zoom.

116
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:35,150
So. Okay. All right.

117
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:42,420
Done with the syllabus. I mean, be sure to go through and just review other aspects of the syllabus,

118
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:52,920
but I think I hit the key points and I have any questions about what I covered for this form here.

119
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:58,520
Susan Aaronson had this class in the fall. So just a word of warning.

120
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:04,320
She said it can alternate between being very warm, which I'm finding it rather warm today and very cold.

121
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:08,700
So she said, always take layers because you never know what to expect in here.

122
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,280
So I'm just giving you a heads up. If she said These times it feels like an ice box in here.

123
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:22,980
So I'm like, okay, so be prepared for either let's go around the room and introduce ourselves.

124
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:29,040
So your name, you know what school or dress undergrad,

125
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:48,359
what program you're in so that we can get to learn everybody we the to students and the first year and the state I'm

126
00:15:48,360 --> 00:16:05,310
Hayley and so for sure that's how that there will be there are more than first signs on the page but not the topics.

127
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:14,490
Marilyn First year dietetics I'm I'm a first year nutrition and dietetics student

128
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:19,560
and we're here little the first year a little of a bit of biology student.

129
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:25,230
Question So your name again? Pretty. Will Pretty regular, pretty little.

130

Now I'm here. I'm a first year social science and Elizabeth, I'm a nutritional dietetics.

136
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:14,130
I'm in. I'm actually an undergrad, so I'm on the track.

137
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:21,880
So I am I am first year MPH at the Marion MPH extension.

138
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:29,500
Oh, I'm sorry. No, I'm embarrassed to some extent.

139
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:45,120
Although the first year graduate I'm a on big this is also the first year and then Ariana

140
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:54,810
Grande and then because of the the Brianna being Britney and Brianna I am Sabrina.

141
00:17:54,810 --> 00:18:01,290
I'm a first year MPH nutrition and dietetics student. I am I am a diabetic.

142
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:11,520
Jennifer. I'm a first year MPH dietetics student. I am a first year MSC student in nutritional science.

143
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:19,380
I'm doing MPH nutritional science and Alex and Addy and that's what I'm here for.

144
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:23,280
I'm a first year grad student in the Christian Science and I'm at Dietetics.

145
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:30,989
I'm Melissa. I am also MP in the world first year MPH.

146
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:39,570
And it's not that I'm in a I'm a first year MPH dietetics I'm Natalie I'm a second year at HP and dual.

147
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:47,440
Public policy. For those of you who don't know me, I'm Sue Cole.

148
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:50,950
I'm a lecturer in the Department of Nutritional Sciences.

149
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,600
I have a background.

150
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:02,680
I'm rather monotonous. My undergrad, my masters, and my Ph.D. are all in nutritional sciences.

151
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:11,020
But my Ph.D. actually was a multidisciplinary because I also did genetics, and that's what actually brought me to the University of Michigan.

152
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:17,230
I did my postdoc here in human genetics, and after three years of genetics, which I loved,

153
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:24,190
I missed nutrition and took a teaching position, came up in school, public health.

154
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:28,030
At the time, nutritional sciences was an environmental health sciences.

155
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:35,800
And so I took that teaching job. And which is interesting because as a grad student, teaching was not on my radar at all.

156
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:45,700
So it just goes to show you never know. Your path can zig zag all over the place, but that's what brought me here so far.

157
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:58,270
And my work went. So I got my Ph.D. in University of Arizona and I did most of my work was with Native American

158
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:05,080
indigenous communities and in particular one of the projects I was working hours with adolescent.

159
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:15,610
So I have a particular passion for women, children and infants, as well as community nutrition, too.

160
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:20,590
So. All right. How we doing?

161
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:28,840
9:00. Do we want to get up a stretch for a minute before I launch into preconception?

162
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:39,710
Let's just do yet. Stretch and then we'll start.

163
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:48,260
Do you really mean that?

164
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:55,670
This is my car.

165
00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:00,720
Most of the people around here. I mean, honestly, I'm sorry.

166
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:10,340
I kind of have to be happy that I wasn't.

167
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:22,510
And not also that this is about how really changed my.

168
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:40,140
I don't like the idea that, you know, I don't know.

169
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:52,380
He wanted to say it and I knew that.

170
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,570
I know because I read it yesterday and I just I still can't shake.

171
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,720
There it is. And I was like, Oh, my God.

172
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:47,670
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

173
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:54,390
You're out. Literally. Okay, let's go, sir.

174
00:22:56,010 --> 00:23:00,930
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

175
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:14,730
It's kind of like we're going to go ahead and get started.

176
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:22,410
Like I said, I was like, what? I have been like, okay.

177
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:27,809
So I guess one preconception is we're going to be focusing on this,

178
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:34,530
but it's also an opportunity to introduce some terms that we're going to be using throughout the semester.

179
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:38,790
There'll be other terms that have been introduced next week, but.

180
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:48,340
That's essentially what this presentation this morning addresses is just sort of an introduction.

181
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:56,140
So in terms of learning objectives, it's important that you can articulate the rationale for pre-conception care.

182
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:09,750
Relative to prenatal. In other words, what is so important about care prior to conception versus care during gestation or with prenatal?

183
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,129
Understand the historical perspective. So I and I'm not going to go into it a lot,

184
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:24,210
but it just gives you a little bit of idea about where we were at with preconception and where we're heading, as well as understanding the risks,

185
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:31,260
preconception risks that are important targets or interventions in care during the pre-conception period,

186
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:35,610
as well as explain how it can improve pregnancy and infant outcomes.

187
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:42,630
So these are just some terms that it's important to get comfortable with.

188
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:50,850
I will tell you that despite how this is my 15th year of teaching this course, I still sometimes stubbornly stumble on these terms.

189
00:24:50,850 --> 00:25:00,299
So no worries. But still, it's important for all of us to get comfortable with the various terms in our conception is before conception,

190
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:06,480
but in between in between the link between pregnancies and prenatal is during.

191
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:13,620
And then we have perinatal neonatal first 20 days after birth and then post neonatal,

192
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:18,900
which is the 28th their after birth up until under one year of age.

193
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:23,820
Okay. So again, these are just terms to just get comfortable with.

194
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:29,830
The other point that I want to bring up now, um,

195
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:38,969
and it's something that I will be utilizing throughout the semester is using gender inclusive

196
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:48,330
language when I'm talking about concepts as well as just talking about life stages.

197
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:57,060
So when I'm talking about pregnancy, I may use the term maternal, but that's actually not considered a gender inclusive term.

198
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:02,280
So if I do use it, I will also use a pregnant individual.

199
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:06,570
Pregnant person. Pregnant people, likewise with lactation.

200
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:19,980
Okay. And then when we get to discussing breastfeeding and so there are some other terms that are more gender inclusive.

201
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:24,390
So I just wanted to just share that with you.

202
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:33,570
Okay. So until recently, health care.

203
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,380
Has focused primarily on the prenatal care type.

204
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:50,150
An individual is pregnant. They go to their first prenatal visit and then they're followed by a health care professional.

205
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,240
And in fact, there's even neonatal and postnatal care.

206
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:07,610
The important point here I'm going to jump down to the last one is that in the early 2000s,

207
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:18,650
there was a call for shifting prenatal management, shifting from prenatal management to preconception care.

208
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:22,310
In other words, when it comes to promoting health, preventing.

209
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:36,040
Concerns. It's important that there started in the pre-conception period, not during pregnancy.

210
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:42,410
And we're going to talk about those risks or concerns, but what might we be talking about here?

211
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:52,300
Why what what kind of risks could happen or what kind of risks warrant preconception attention versus prenatal attention?

212
00:27:55,870 --> 00:28:00,729
Vitamin deficiencies. Right. So vitamin deficiencies and just.

213
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:13,050
Yes, but definitely some of those nutrients that we know can lead to congenital birth defects as well as adverse fetal development.

214
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:21,850
So, yes, nutrient deficiencies and we can take that even a step further, not just nutrient but energy, adequate energy intake.

215
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:30,040
So if the individual who's considering pregnancy is underweight, that's a concern.

216
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:31,060
Right.

217
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:42,130
What else should be would want to be addressed during the pre-conception period and not necessarily during the prenatal because they like smoking.

218
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:51,100
Yes, smoking. Yeah. Things like high risk and concerns that are disease concerns.

219
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:54,520
Yes. Anything chronic disease relate.

220
00:28:54,520 --> 00:29:06,099
Well. Any. Yes. Any kind of chronic diseases, condition or disease needs to be addressed prior to pregnancy,

221
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:13,750
especially our chronic diseases like cardiovascular, hypertension, diabetes and so forth.

222
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:20,410
Yeah. What else would environmental toxicants be included in that?

223
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:28,110
Yes. Yes. And in addition to environmental toxicants that are known toxic medications,

224
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:33,910
there are certain medications that should not be consumed during pregnancy.

225
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:39,460
And actually, there needs to be a period where those wash out prior to pregnancy.

226
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:49,120
Anybody can anybody think of this one that comes to mind that can result in congenital and Accutane?

227
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:55,120
Yeah. Yeah. So that's a medication for blemishes and so forth.

228
00:29:56,230 --> 00:30:01,930
And it's in the vitamin E family and they can cause birth defects.

229
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:09,440
So, yeah, the simple question, does preconception mean like someone who's trying to get pregnant or is it just like any,

230
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:13,710
any so in any of their readings?

231
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:20,200
I think if you had an opportunity to read the first article in particular,

232
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:29,050
there is emphasis or focus that instead of just thinking about someone who's thinking of pregnancy, that it's all part of health.

233
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:35,710
Right. But it's a good question because.

234
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:46,210
I think I can't. I haven't looked at a recent statistic, but I think the last one I saw, 50% of pregnancies were unplanned.

235
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:51,730
So 50% of people aren't planning and it happens.

236
00:30:52,120 --> 00:31:02,589
So preconception. It's one thing if you're thinking about pregnancy and then you have those conversations

237
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:07,780
with your health care provider to address preconception concerns early on.

238
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:15,430
But if you're not thinking about pregnancy and what happens, Pre-conception Period has left the station.

239
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:21,790
So that's one of the reasons why they talk about preconception as part of just health overall health.

240
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:37,020
Now. The bullet I want to circle back to is this despite a decline in infant mortality in the United States since the 1960s?

241
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,480
And I'll show you a trend figure in a minute.

242
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:48,360
The U.S. has a high infant mortality rate when you compare to other industrialized countries, European countries.

243
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:55,709
And so that's been another driving force for this shift from focusing on

244
00:31:55,710 --> 00:32:02,220
prenatal care to we need to shift health to the pre-conception period as well.

245
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:10,050
In other words, we need to have what we need both. That's what we're saying instead of the focus on prenatal care.

246
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:19,500
Okay. So this is a figure that just shows on the x axis we have from 1915 to 2011.

247
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:25,830
And on the Y axis is the rate of infant mortality.

248
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:39,510
Out of a thousand live births. So infant mortality is roughly of the infant in that first year, just under one year.

249
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:45,479
So it's not to one year. It's just under one year. And then we have subcategories.

250
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:56,070
We have neonatal postnatal. And you can see that we had very high rates in the early 1900s.

251
00:32:56,970 --> 00:33:07,590
And, you know, they dramatically improved as health and our understanding of nutrition and other factors came into play.

252
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:12,700
But you can see that even in 1965, we still had high rates.

253
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:22,290
This is just under 30% and not 30%, but 30 out of a thousand and in end of 1960.

254
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:28,649
By 1967 or 68, we had a big summit, the White House summit.

255
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:37,170
But there was also another big meeting that because the infant mortality rate is still so high.

256
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:43,200
There was an effort of health care practitioners and professionals as well as researchers.

257
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:47,730
You know, we need to address this. We need to understand why.

258
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:54,140
And you can see that over time, we have reduction and it's been steadily decreasing,

259
00:33:54,150 --> 00:34:00,090
but we still have a higher rate in this country relative to other countries.

260
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:12,530
Yeah. Are there any are there any studies that look at kind of pregnant persons like mortality in terms of like.

261
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:21,360
Yes, I don't have the data, but if you go to the next slide, what's the bottom?

262
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:26,440
So where you get all that data is the National Center for Health Statistics.

263
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:31,350
So this is a national vital statistics report is lag time.

264
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:37,520
So this is put out in 19. This is this is 2022 and it's reporting 2020 data.

265
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:41,970
But yes, there is. They call it maternal mortality.

266
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,070
Yes. This other data, I don't have that.

267
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:57,250
So reference to that. This is just a more recent snapshot of infant mortality rates.

268
00:34:57,270 --> 00:35:00,300
Again, you can see it is declining, I think.

269
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:06,960
Every year we drop two or 3%, but it is still higher.

270
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:11,969
I looked at where we rank as an organization.

271
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:16,020
It's like OECD. It's organization and economic.

272
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:25,440
And I can't remember what the next the CD stands for, but they rank countries and we're 36 out of 49 in terms of infant mortality rates.

273
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:37,049
So it's like anybody have an idea what is the primary factor factors that are contributing to

274
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:46,200
our high infant mortality rate and high risk pregnancies have anybody to do with teen pregnancy.

275
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:54,600
So, yes, absolutely. But just in terms of the infant, what is the factor leading to infant mortality?

276
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:59,070
What's driving this increase? Like health care?

277
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:03,780
Yes. Yep. All of that. Is it preterm?

278
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:08,700
Yes. So preterm is one of the key factors.

279
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:16,910
Preterm and low birth weight, in addition to those, are sort of intertwined unless you stipulate term.

280
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:24,930
So low birth weight cause can occur because the infant was born.

281
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:33,660
Return and its low in weight thus low birth weight or low birth weight that term.

282
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:43,690
So I will always try to stipulate if I'm talking about low birth weight of term infants or low birth weight,

283
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:47,920
that could be both term infants as well as preterm.

284
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:55,690
That makes sense. Yeah. And how is that different than neonatal or is it after one year?

285
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:59,930
So infant is just the summation of these two. Yeah.

286
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:09,460
Yeah. And post neonatal natal just breaks up that first year of life into two different neonatal is the first 28 days after birth.

287
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:18,970
And post-natal is 29 days to just one year and then infant is just the summation of those two.

288
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:37,120
Okay. There is the racial disparity in the infant mortality rate is higher among African American indentured indigenous,

289
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:43,000
both American Indian or native Alaskan as well as Native Hawaiian.

290
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:49,510
And there's so many factors that contribute.

291
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:59,050
This is a great article. If you just lift this from your slide, you can get the PDF.

292
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:04,660
So I encourage those of you interested in understanding why we have these racial disparities.

293
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:07,840
This is a great article.

294
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:19,780
I also posted an article just this morning under optional readings that also covers racial disparities of the infant mortality rate.

295
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:24,010
So that too is and that's it's a 2022 article.

296
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:29,800
So they have two resources if you want to learn more about why it's complex.

297
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:39,790
There are many factors, including, you know, we talked about it last semester,

298
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:51,760
but those of you social determinants and racism, stress, women's experience and so forth.

299
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:59,500
As I said, there's just so many factors that come into play as well as access to health care.

300
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:07,479
I teach a similar course in the fall for our online age,

301
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:18,790
and I had a student that was really interested in care, prenatal care in rural areas in the United States.

302
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:22,390
And it's it's like a dessert.

303
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:27,310
It's not a food desert. It's a health care desert in rural America.

304
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:35,140
How far pregnant individuals have to drive or to just access care?

305
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:40,270
So, again, these factors are many.

306
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:48,640
But I think both of these articles, this one and the one that's on the campus, does a nice job of walking you through those factors.

307
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:54,220
Any questions about what I've covered so far? Yeah.

308
00:39:54,600 --> 00:40:00,159
Well, when you're talking about, like, why it was so bad, like the infant mortality rate is so high in America.

309
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,360
And you talk about like the low birth weight. Is that like the mean?

310
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:07,360
And why is that so bad in the U.S.? Because of preterm birth.

311
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:23,020
Oh, gotcha. Yeah. And so preterm infants are at significantly higher risk of mortality in the first year.

312
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:33,220
There's other reasons for low birth weight that aren't related to preterm, but preterm is one of the most significant factors for infant mortality.

313
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:44,500
Yeah. And the risk factors for preterm.

314
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:57,290
So for individuals in pregnancy, the list of preterm is long for those of you interested.

315
00:40:57,310 --> 00:41:02,110
If you just type in preterm risk factors and age, you will get take.

316
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:08,110
You'll land on a site that covers it. I mean, it ranges from so multiple gestation.

317
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:18,070
So twins. So twins. Your fifth your risk of the risk of a pre preterm birth is 50% higher.

318
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:31,510
Just going from a singleton to a twin gestation chronic disease burden of the individual who's

319
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:39,250
pregnant is a very high risk factor diet and exposure to environmental pollutants and toxicants.

320
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:50,800
And the list is long and I'm stumbling, trying to think through everything but hypertension, diabetes.

321
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:55,130
I don't know.

322
00:41:56,590 --> 00:42:08,860
Yeah, it's just a long list of risk factors for preterm, so I encourage you to, if I think of it, I'll put this link, the nature link on canvas.

323
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:15,960
Okay. Useful. Okay. I just wanted to very quickly go through a historical perspective of pre-conception care.

324
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:17,490
The first.

325
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:31,280
Time that any kind of concessional care is discussed in in government documents is in 1979 where there was a call for inner conception care,

326
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:40,610
specifically care for women who had a had an adverse pregnancy outcome.

327
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:53,050
So this would be care inter conception care care prior to her becoming pregnant again if she chose to.

328
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:59,980
Then in 1985, Institute of Medicine National Academy issued a report on preventing low birth weight.

329
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:05,650
And again, it was a call attention to address the health of individuals before pregnancy.

330
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:16,480
And again, the reducing the risk of adverse pregnancy and fetal outcomes cannot be accomplished strictly strictly through prenatal care.

331
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:22,840
Right. That has some of this has to be done prior to pregnancy.

332
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:33,970
Yeah. Early 2000s.

333
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:44,139
Health care providers, researchers, those who work in maternal and child care,

334
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:52,600
and how they assembled a basically a workshop panel to address preconception care.

335
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:55,840
In the United States, we did not have a formal framework.

336
00:43:56,140 --> 00:44:08,110
We didn't have goals, we didn't have aims and so forth. So this is the group that really initiated it and the interventions were.

337
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:11,620
The aim was to identify and modify both biochemical,

338
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:17,470
behavioral and social risks to women's health pregnancy outcomes through prevention and management.

339
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:25,000
And that the preconception care needs to include both the prevention and management of health risks and conditions,

340
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:36,489
again, emphasizing that it needs to be done early or prior to conception for maximal impact.

341
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:42,810
And really when we're talking about maximal impact, we're actually talking about improving pregnancy and fetal outcomes.

342
00:44:47,650 --> 00:45:01,700
So this is just. The workshop report that came out of that initiative and again just reiterated prenatal care is too late for some health conditions.

343
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:11,450
If you haven't advanced to the next slide,

344
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:17,480
I was going to say what other health risks or what other risks should be addressed that the pre-conception period.

345
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:24,300
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.

346
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:32,210
But that being said, most of the time it's just a passing down between parents.

347
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:40,550
Yes. Yeah, absolutely. So if there's known, um, genetic disorders.

348
00:45:40,990 --> 00:45:47,060
Um, actually, my husband's family has. They are carriers for cystic fibrosis.

349
00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:51,620
And so my husband actually knows he's a carrier.

350
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:56,360
So I actually had to be tested to make sure that I didn't carry the gene.

351
00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:00,470
And so that's something that I did during the pre-conception period.

352
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:07,910
So that's exactly. And we have genetic counseling programs for exactly that.

353
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:19,460
Yeah. And then say this is more for individuals who are planning to become pregnant or looking to buy for any kind of intervention of a tiger type.

354
00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:30,050
Yeah. So folate and there are specific guidelines for when folate needs to be an issue of folic acid.

355
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:38,200
It's actually folic acid that has to be taken during the pre-conception period.

356
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,840
And as you will see in later,

357
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:47,120
there's other nutrients that now are recommended during the pre-conception period to make

358
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:53,870
sure that the person who is pregnant has adequate nutrients stores for fetal development,

359
00:46:54,410 --> 00:47:02,989
one of which is iodine, because the fetus even early prior to during I don't know quite how early,

360
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:11,899
but it's early in gestation that iodine plays a key role in development through the

361
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:20,360
production of thyroid hormone and thyroid hormones are key to the development of the fetus.

362
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:25,490
So that's another nutrient that now the recommendation is, is that women,

363
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:34,160
individuals who are thinking of pregnancy should need to get a source of iodine in the pre-conception period.

364
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:38,680
What else? Drug and alcohol smoking.

365
00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:43,480
Yeah. And really, that's true of any substance use.

366
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:47,370
Right. Yeah. Yeah.

367
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:51,290
A consolidation in the sense. Yep.

368
00:47:52,040 --> 00:48:07,439
Um, and that would be true of any infectious disease and immunizations updates to certain immunization.

369
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:12,000
So all of those issues need to be addressed.

370
00:48:12,950 --> 00:48:16,650
If you're diabetic. Yes. Right.

371
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:24,630
And during pregnancy with high glucose is extremely detrimental to the developing embryo.

372
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:28,440
Yeah. You need to heart effects.

373
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:31,560
We'll be talking about that when we talk about gestational diabetes. Yeah.

374
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:36,480
Is there anything with mental health?

375
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:42,690
So the short answer is yes, there should be.

376
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:46,890
And I'm sure there is. And there needs to be.

377
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:50,070
Right. Because mental health is part of our overall health.

378
00:48:50,490 --> 00:49:01,770
Yes. Actually, there is an issue with mental health because certain medications actually cannot be used to take in pregnancy.

379
00:49:02,370 --> 00:49:12,450
And so they would need to be separate to something else in terms of like receiving who's got the different countries that make it happen?

380
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:18,670
Yes. Yeah. And so. Yes.

381
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:29,159
Yeah. Yeah. Because there's parasitic infections that and bacterial that can be really problematic.

382
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:32,820
So I think you guys hit. All of them.

383
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:38,000
You did. And there's more, obviously, but. Yeah.

384
00:49:40,890 --> 00:49:50,700
Okay. In the years past, students some students have an interest in environmental toxicants and and the issue.

385
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:56,130
So I just wanted to provide you some resources. This is a great resource.

386
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,190
This is University of California at San Francisco.

387
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:03,840
They do a lot of work with reproductive health and the environment.

388
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:12,480
And then the American College of Obstetrics, Obstetricians and Gynecologists is a mouthful, and I'm always going to call it ACOG.

389
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:21,720
But this is the professional organization where a lot of the documents and articles

390
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:29,760
and committee opinion and expert opinions and so forth are very important for those

391
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,569
of you that are pursuing maternal and child nutrition and how they just came out

392
00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:37,920
with the document in 21 reducing prenatal exposure to toxic environmental agents.

393
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:43,470
So there's two resources to get you started if you're interested in that area.

394
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:55,740
Okay. I want to talk now about some of the risk factors that we're going to be touching upon in the next few weeks.

395
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:00,990
So that is just to provide you some background.

396
00:51:01,410 --> 00:51:09,030
And I just want to say at the onset that for the next few weeks and also even when we talk about gestational diabetes,

397
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:16,440
I will be talking about the risks of a large body size of obesity,

398
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:27,660
because it's important to understand that there is risk associated with large body size living with obesity.

399
00:51:28,910 --> 00:51:34,100
In pregnancy. Okay. That being said.

400
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:43,030
We'll be talking about ways. But actually,

401
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:57,010
I will provide you there's at least one or two articles that have to do with weight stigmatization and weight bias of individuals who are pregnant.

402
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:05,680
So as professionals in public health or in nutrition and both,

403
00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:14,590
this is something you have to be aware of that even though we are going to be talking about larger body sizes because of the risk that can that's

404
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:30,820
inherent with it in certain aspects of pregnancy and so forth of women experience or individuals experience bias in health care and settings.

405
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:38,650
And so we have to be very cognizant of that and recognize that interventions to

406
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:43,120
help the well-being of individuals who are thinking about becoming pregnant,

407
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:48,010
it's important that they're not necessarily weight focused.

408
00:52:48,070 --> 00:52:58,210
Right, that they're focused on other aspects of well-being, such as diet, such as healthy environment for exercise.

409
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:05,650
Do they have food access? Do they have health insurance and all the other social determinants and so forth?

410
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:11,790
Are they experiencing stress? So I just want that put out there.

411
00:53:12,970 --> 00:53:16,480
That again, I am going to be talking about the risks of obesity.

412
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:20,800
But I we have to understand it with the and the point that.

413
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:26,180
I want to make sure I understand we're discussing it in a.

414
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:38,010
Non biased manner is I guess what I'm saying. Sorry not being more articulate this morning, but you know where I'm going.

415
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:45,810
Okay. So high pre-pregnancy BMI, BMI being used.

416
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:52,490
So BMI is actually used well in my sorry.

417
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:54,630
We'll be discussing it next week.

418
00:53:55,110 --> 00:54:04,620
High pre-pregnancy BMI does increase the risk of adverse outcomes in pregnancy, so it increases the risk of gestational diabetes,

419
00:54:05,310 --> 00:54:15,810
hypertension, it's associated with miscarriage, higher risk of cesarean delivery as well as postpartum weight retention.

420
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:20,370
It's also associated with high birth weight or macro.

421
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:27,120
So, Mia, so we're going to be using this term high birth weight or Micro-sim and MICRO-SIM.

422
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:34,050
It refers to an infant whose birth weight is 4000 grams or more.

423
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:45,060
There is not a standardized definition of micro-sim and it can range from 4000 to 40 500 to 5000.

424
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:58,710
But what is generally common or universal is recognition that essentially greater than 4000 or 4500, an infant is considered high birth weight.

425
00:54:59,310 --> 00:55:07,680
And this is concerning because there's a whole cluster of adverse outcomes associated with an infant that has high birth weight.

426
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:14,130
And we'll be talking about that. So for the kids now, yeah, baby.

427
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:22,890
Yeah. The risk for mom or the person who is pregnant is.

428
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:36,120
C-section. But this high birthweight, the concern is the evidence that they can be short term and long term adverse outcomes.

429
00:55:36,130 --> 00:55:40,720
And what again, we'll talk more about that. And also congenital malformations.

430
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:45,030
So birth defects are associated with high pre-pregnancy.

431
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:50,890
So when I'm talking about high pre-pregnancy BMI, I'm talking about in the category of obesity.

432
00:55:51,310 --> 00:55:55,450
Okay. So large body weight. Okay.

433
00:55:56,710 --> 00:56:00,130
I want to make the distinction here. I'm talking about.

434
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:06,280
High pre-pregnancy BMI prior to pregnancy.

435
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:14,180
This is not talk. This is not referring to risk factors associated with high weight gain during pregnancy.

436
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:18,880
That is a whole nother a whole nother factor.

437
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:28,420
Why are we concerned about macro so many? It gets back to the concern with infants and adverse outcomes.

438
00:56:29,230 --> 00:56:42,940
This is just clarifying. In the United States we see a little bit of consistency that a birthweight of 4500 grams to a non-diabetic individual

439
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:54,460
has similar adverse outcomes to an infant that is born with 4000 grams but born to a diabetic individual.

440
00:56:54,790 --> 00:57:06,520
Okay. And that is because there's more risk just by the fact that the individual has diabetes higher rate.

441
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:11,139
We'll talk more about it with gestational diabetes.

442
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:16,420
But the problem is, is if they're not well managed, their results and elevated blood glucose levels,

443
00:57:17,050 --> 00:57:22,570
and that means then the infant or the fetus can take up more of that glucose.

444
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:30,250
And so it leads to overgrowth. And again, another other complications.

445
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:37,839
Infant child outcomes due to mechanism is increase in the unique morbidity and mortality,

446
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:42,220
and they also have a risk of obesity and insulin resistance later in life.

447
00:57:42,830 --> 00:57:50,380
Okay. So it is both short term and long term implications of infants that have high birth weight.

448
00:57:54,970 --> 00:58:04,360
And in 2018, just slightly under 8% of U.S. births were considered or 4000 grams or more.

449
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:14,140
So I don't think this will be a surprise to anyone.

450
00:58:14,170 --> 00:58:23,200
Nutrition in pregnancy is critical. An inadequate diet before and during pregnancy increases the risk of spontaneous abortions,

451
00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:30,310
congenital malformations or birth defects associated with low birth weight,

452
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:39,790
as well as which either can lead to preterm delivery that lead to it can be due to preterm delivery or fetal growth restriction.

453
00:58:42,550 --> 00:58:50,350
And this is just a little bit more about fetal growth restriction.

454
00:58:50,650 --> 00:58:54,700
In this case, I'm talking about term infants with low birth weight.

455
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:58,480
They have increased perinatal mortality and morbidity.

456
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:11,830
That's short term adverse outcome. Then there's a long term that's associated with, you know, developmental concerns, speech learning, reading,

457
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:20,830
deficits, and then there's chronic disease risk factors, hypertension, renal disease and so forth.

458
00:59:21,130 --> 00:59:25,060
So all of these long term outcomes have been.

459
00:59:27,770 --> 00:59:39,410
Identified in research as a consequence of fetal growth restriction or lower but or low birth weight.

460
00:59:44,210 --> 00:59:47,540
And these are factors that contribute to fetal growth restriction.

461
00:59:48,350 --> 00:59:57,140
So if the individual who is pregnant had low or excessive pre-pregnancy weight,

462
00:59:57,380 --> 01:00:06,320
both of those to low or excessive can contribute placental insufficiency,

463
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:17,450
poor diet, poor weight gain during pregnancy, as well as an individual who is pregnant if they have chronic disease used.

464
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:24,420
Substances, tobacco, alcohol and so forth, as well as infections.

465
01:00:28,470 --> 01:00:34,980
Yep. Is there, like, an increased risk during, like, energy restriction during certain trimesters?

466
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:39,790
Like. Is it like, are poor outcomes more likely?

467
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:45,690
Like there's energy restriction in like the third versus the first, I believe there is.

468
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:52,650
I, I don't remember the specifics, but I believe there is.

469
01:00:53,160 --> 01:01:06,840
Yeah. Yeah. Because there's going to be different developmental aspects that are being targeted early versus late that it has.

470
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:20,170
Yes. In fact, I know there is the they call it an energy deficit in cells.

471
01:01:20,190 --> 01:01:25,440
If that happens earlier on, I think the infant from the fetus develops.

472
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:40,680
But overall, it's the fee is a smaller portion of the insult that happens later.

473
01:01:41,310 --> 01:01:45,900
There's some disproportionate development. Don't hold me to that.

474
01:01:46,230 --> 01:01:51,110
There is such a poor. Have the proportions of things.

475
01:01:51,550 --> 01:01:56,880
Yeah. Yeah. But you'd want to get into the literature that if I don't.

476
01:01:57,010 --> 01:02:00,059
It's been a while since I've looked at that. Yeah. On what?

477
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:06,020
Link to the fact that there is I'm sure there is a link.

478
01:02:06,030 --> 01:02:10,560
I haven't looked at it, but. Yeah. That would be a great thing to look at.

479
01:02:11,290 --> 01:02:18,540
Yeah. Yeah. Views would be the right prescription because it says like instinctively like I

480
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:24,809
can understand like how well we pre-pregnancy weight would result in restriction,

481
01:02:24,810 --> 01:02:35,310
but it also says excessive pre-pregnancy weight and the fact that because isn't higher of pre-pregnancy weight related to the macro itself.

482
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:45,450
It is. But think about what, um, what kind of risks can occur if somebody has a larger body just in general,

483
01:02:46,050 --> 01:02:49,350
chronic disease risk, that kind of thing can happen.

484
01:02:49,830 --> 01:02:57,959
So diabetes, hypertension, larger body might be at greater risk for developing hypertension.

485
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:02,820
So pregnancy hypertension is often associated with low birth weight.

486
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:10,110
Yeah. Especially if it's not managed. Yeah.

487
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:23,880
I'm not saying that hypertension is the only factor, but it's, it's, it's that's one of the examples to think through in terms of how that can happen.

488
01:03:24,620 --> 01:03:28,730
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I was just kind of asking, you know, like,

489
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:35,430
how much of that is due to the correlation between poor diet and weight and how much is due like solely due to wave?

490
01:03:36,990 --> 01:03:42,220
There's probably papers that have. You know, passed it out.

491
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:46,630
I can't remember, but it'd be great thing to look up.

492
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:54,220
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

493
01:03:56,020 --> 01:04:01,360
In terms of nutrients, we already talked about this, but folic acid.

494
01:04:02,050 --> 01:04:08,570
So our U.S. Preventative Services Task Force in 2017.

495
01:04:08,590 --> 01:04:13,809
This is consistent with what ACOG. American Academy of Pediatrics.

496
01:04:13,810 --> 01:04:19,480
National Academy. 400 micrograms of folic acid.

497
01:04:21,790 --> 01:04:27,410
Started during the pre pregnancy period and I think it's 1 to 2 months.

498
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:29,890
Let me see if I have it down. I just have to look it up.

499
01:04:35,420 --> 01:04:45,360
That started at least one month before conception continue into the first 2 to 3 months of pregnancy, which, if the individual is pregnant,

500
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:49,740
is taking once they become pregnant, if they take the prenatal vitamin,

501
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:57,300
they all usually all have folic acid so they can just transition to the prenatal.

502
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:01,590
And the reason for that is because of neural tube defects.

503
01:05:02,010 --> 01:05:08,670
We know that folic acid or a low intake of folic acid can lead to neural tube defects.

504
01:05:10,350 --> 01:05:20,190
Women and individuals who have had a pregnancy in which a neural tube defects, in which the infant had a neural tube defect.

505
01:05:20,580 --> 01:05:24,570
Their recommendation is even higher for folic acid.

506
01:05:24,990 --> 01:05:28,340
I can't remember what it is, but I think it's either 800 or no.

507
01:05:28,350 --> 01:05:33,030
I think it's even more than that. So if anybody's interested.

508
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:41,580
They would have a much higher dose of folic acid during the pre-conception period

509
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:46,950
if they had a prior pregnancy in which the infant had a neural tube defect.

510
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:57,689
And I want to just emphasize that the the research that links folic acid use

511
01:05:57,690 --> 01:06:02,849
to reduction of neural tubes has really only been examined with folic acid.

512
01:06:02,850 --> 01:06:15,690
So that's why it's folic acid and not folate, not food folate in part two, because food folate, its bioavailability is less.

513
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:21,380
That is the amount that's actually absorbed, the proportion that's absorbed, that's consumed.

514
01:06:21,450 --> 01:06:26,760
So food folate has a lower bioavailability relative to folic acid.

515
01:06:32,610 --> 01:06:35,939
I have to update this slide because I'm sure it's probably changed a little bit.

516
01:06:35,940 --> 01:06:43,929
But one important point is that in Heinz 2007 to 2012,

517
01:06:43,930 --> 01:06:56,040
they indicated that only 28 of slightly less than nine, 29% of individuals actually were taking folic acid.

518
01:06:56,610 --> 01:07:05,250
So that's concerning, right. So this is obviously an area of public health and.

519
01:07:06,490 --> 01:07:10,960
Nutrition education during the pre-conception period.

520
01:07:15,190 --> 01:07:22,570
These are just some resources related to the preconception framework in the United States.

521
01:07:24,130 --> 01:07:29,680
And I just wanted to highlight that some of the goals that came out of that initiative was to improve knowledge,

522
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:35,110
attitudes and behaviors of both men and women related to pre-conception,

523
01:07:35,110 --> 01:07:47,860
how to create health equity, eliminate disparities, ensure that all individuals of childbearing age receive pre-conception care.

524
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:55,520
As well as reducing risk during the postpartum and inner conception.

525
01:07:58,580 --> 01:08:04,880
So this was the original workshop report and goals and this has been updated in 2012.

526
01:08:05,270 --> 01:08:09,590
So this is updated goals for the framework in the United States.

527
01:08:10,250 --> 01:08:18,770
And what they actually created was a series of workshop groups, everything from clinical to the consumer to public health policy,

528
01:08:18,770 --> 01:08:25,730
finance and then research and surveillance, even though we don't have really documents that.

529
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:36,780
Well, I have to say this. I'm not sure that they're formally working together anymore,

530
01:08:36,990 --> 01:08:43,410
but they do still seem to be working because we still I still see papers coming out from the research work group.

531
01:08:43,410 --> 01:08:53,880
I see papers coming out from the public health. And so these were important sort of sectors to address within the framework.

532
01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:02,670
And then today is one of today's readings, both involving pre-conception health framework and I.

533
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:04,709
If you haven't had a chance to read it, please do.

534
01:09:04,710 --> 01:09:14,160
Because this I think that is an important job in terms of health equity, especially among African American individuals.

535
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:23,130
And again, this is also at the University of California at San Francisco.

536
01:09:23,670 --> 01:09:34,979
Link has really important resources to for pre-conception health and those of you who are going to be working internationally.

537
01:09:34,980 --> 01:09:41,310
I just wanted to point out that the World Health Organization also has pre-conception resources.

538
01:09:42,780 --> 01:09:48,240
So here's the link. And that's all I have.

539
01:09:51,780 --> 01:09:56,820
Anybody have any questions? Yes.

540
01:09:57,240 --> 01:10:01,680
Are there any, like things related to, like parody or.

541
01:10:02,370 --> 01:10:07,330
I can't think of like what the is going on in times like pregnant.

542
01:10:07,380 --> 01:10:11,280
Like, are there any, like, risks? Like, is it like a positive or like.

543
01:10:11,730 --> 01:10:18,450
Depends on what your question is. Like it depends on what you think and in the context.

544
01:10:19,620 --> 01:10:32,990
So. Try to remember and prepare if there's an increased risk in parenting and pre-term.

545
01:10:34,710 --> 01:10:39,410
So actually, unless there was complications in pregnancy.

546
01:10:40,250 --> 01:10:45,590
But it just depends on what your what you're considering and.

547
01:10:49,380 --> 01:10:53,220
If you talk about nutrition, that has a caveat.

548
01:10:53,490 --> 01:10:57,600
It just depends on if they have the individual has a healthy diet.

549
01:10:57,900 --> 01:11:07,140
If they don't have a healthy diet, then parity is a problem because especially depending on how soon they become pregnant again,

550
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:12,540
there's not enough time to restore the levels of nutrients.

551
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:22,470
And so they may enter the pregnancy with low energy as well as vitamin D and vitamin and mineral reserves.

552
01:11:23,850 --> 01:11:29,490
Not reserves, but levels. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

553
01:11:33,730 --> 01:11:38,330
Yeah. Yeah, it's just a general question.

554
01:11:38,330 --> 01:11:42,250
But further readings that you put on for each week are those like fair game?

555
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:47,140
Do the exams. Like, I'm never going to ask you questions from the readings.

556
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:51,169
But I, I can only cover so much.

557
01:11:51,170 --> 01:11:58,340
And so the readings I. Are important because I feel like it gives you a broader background and foundation.

558
01:11:58,340 --> 01:12:06,310
So it's important to try to get through. Even if you can't read it from cover to cover, read the abstract or skim it so that you know what's in it.

559
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:15,410
So that if you want to use it later or as a resource, I'm never going to ask exam questions from a reader.

560
01:12:15,890 --> 01:12:21,960
Yes, some of the readings are just so involved and I have enough for science.

561
01:12:22,610 --> 01:12:28,280
So yeah, I was just looking at goal number three where it says receive pre-conception care services such as screening,

562
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:29,780
health promotion and interventions.

563
01:12:31,220 --> 01:12:37,250
I was just wondering, are like in rural areas where you were talking about earlier how they have less access to hospitals,

564
01:12:37,550 --> 01:12:41,810
how are they providing that type of intervention?

565
01:12:41,810 --> 01:12:47,300
Are they building hospitals in a rural area that is providing transport back and forth and how do they fulfill this goal?

566
01:12:47,630 --> 01:12:58,220
So it's interventions that might be a mobile prenatal care unit because in some communities,

567
01:12:58,220 --> 01:13:01,670
hospitals are disappearing, not being necessarily being built.

568
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:05,260
I was just listening to NPR probably three or four months ago,

569
01:13:05,270 --> 01:13:12,020
and they were talking about hospitals just closing in some rural area that had nothing to do with pregnancy.

570
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:20,180
But and so if you've got hospitals closing in rural areas, you just have less prenatal care, let alone preconception care.

571
01:13:20,390 --> 01:13:31,220
But one intervention that has been utilized to meet that health care desert is these mobile units, which is very cool.

572
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:36,830
And then do they charge like your own health care or like variable consideration or how does that.

573
01:13:36,950 --> 01:13:45,050
I'm not familiar with them enough to know. I mean, because they often are serving underserved, low income areas.

574
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:53,370
My sense is that. The funding is supported somehow.

575
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:57,300
Yeah, but I would that would be great.

576
01:13:57,390 --> 01:14:08,190
Just kind of Google, you know, interventions for health care or like rural and I would say lack of health care and rural and interventions,

577
01:14:08,190 --> 01:14:12,360
prenatal, you might be able to find some of the units.

578
01:14:12,390 --> 01:14:17,640
Yeah, I think that was the intervention I use for my community nutrition segment.

579
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:22,800
So sorry.

580
01:14:23,130 --> 01:14:28,560
Yeah. I think it was called Helping Families.

581
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:31,710
Arkansas was the one that I use for it. Yeah.

582
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:38,400
Yeah. I think Detroit has a mobile unit for prenatal care.

583
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:49,050
And I've seen, as I said, the student in this past fall was really interested in interventions for these health care deserts and.

584
01:14:51,490 --> 01:14:56,950
So she was. She reminded me of the more mobile units, but.

585
01:14:58,990 --> 01:15:07,480
Yeah, I'm sure there's other interventions out there, but I thought the mobile unit was a great approach.

586
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:14,700
Anything else? Yeah, I have a question about some of these hybrid.

587
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:25,000
So is the reason that their work was for highway later in life, is that because probably genetics or is it because they were born at a higher rate?

588
01:15:25,150 --> 01:15:31,720
They were born at a higher wage. And so is when they've done stands as infants.

589
01:15:32,140 --> 01:15:44,320
So they can either be identified as high birthweight based on Mac or something that is, you know, birth weight greater than 4000 or 4500.

590
01:15:44,590 --> 01:15:48,160
We also had another term large for gestational age.

591
01:15:48,310 --> 01:15:58,030
So that's another term that you might see. And that is if they're greater than the 90th percentile for weight, for gestational age,

592
01:15:58,690 --> 01:16:07,140
for either of those classifications they have identified there, they tend to have more adiposity.

593
01:16:07,150 --> 01:16:19,210
So it's not as though they have more lean mass and they tend to have more adiposity, especially in the abdominal area and.

594
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:31,250
I'm sure that there are metabolic issues that are ongoing when they have access to access and that's exactly what happens with high.

595
01:16:32,660 --> 01:16:39,320
So during pregnancy, if a pregnant individual has hired glucose levels than normal,

596
01:16:39,830 --> 01:16:47,780
that's going to then they have a reduced insulin sensitivity in their peripheral tissues, muscle adipose and so forth.

597
01:16:48,380 --> 01:16:59,480
Then the higher glucose levels, in addition to other fuels like fatty acids, is going to be taken up readily by the placenta for the fetus.

598
01:16:59,870 --> 01:17:09,140
And so they undergo overgrowth and in particular, they put on adiposity in the abdominal area.

599
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:16,329
So. They know that there may be papers that dig into this or that deeper,

600
01:17:16,330 --> 01:17:25,330
but you can imagine that there's metabolic alterations that occur as the fetus is developing

601
01:17:25,330 --> 01:17:32,770
through those last stages that may also result from epigenetic changes that could contribute.

602
01:17:33,070 --> 01:17:36,460
And I'm sure there's genetic factors beyond epigenetic.

603
01:17:36,690 --> 01:17:39,730
Yeah. Or is that after them or.

604
01:17:39,910 --> 01:17:49,820
ED Okay. So there is a kind of flavor to, for example, what it's like to use after term without food.

605
01:17:50,380 --> 01:17:56,470
So there's a whole nother issue about high infant weight during the first year of life.

606
01:17:57,060 --> 01:18:02,290
And yeah, that in itself also carries risk later in life.

607
01:18:02,590 --> 01:18:05,820
Okay. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

608
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:16,899
Okay. I'm going to call it a day because it's we're not going to get through the metabolic adaptation.

609
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:26,170
So I will just do a Panopto recording of that. And then if anybody has questions after reviewing it, I'm happy to go over it.

610
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:32,680
So thank you.

611
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:35,500
You're welcome. McCullough today.
