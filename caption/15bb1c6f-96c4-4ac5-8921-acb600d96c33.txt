1
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:11,280
In this module, I'm
going to be describing

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,270
some environmental
health policy impacts,

3
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:16,665
focused specifically on
motor vehicle safety.

4
00:00:16,665 --> 00:00:19,230
If I asked you what the
most dangerous thing

5
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,930
you do is on a daily
basis, what would you say?

6
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,650
The fact is that for most of us,

7
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:25,020
getting into a motor vehicle is

8
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,405
actually the most
dangerous activity we do.

9
00:00:27,405 --> 00:00:29,770
But fortunately, that
activity is much,

10
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:31,020
much safer today than it

11
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,850
was even a couple of decades ago.

12
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,515
So in this module,
I'm going to give you

13
00:00:34,515 --> 00:00:36,510
a crash course on how we've

14
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,265
gone about making
motor vehicles safer.

15
00:00:39,265 --> 00:00:42,320
So the National
Highway Safety Bureau

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,540
was established in 1966,

17
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,220
and charged by the
federal government with

18
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:49,030
coordinating our national
highway safety program.

19
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:51,710
Now, the federal government
has established a number of

20
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,425
policies to make vehicles
and roadways safer.

21
00:00:54,425 --> 00:00:55,940
So this has resulted
in things like

22
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,890
requirements for safety glass,

23
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:01,670
non-flammable materials,
seat-belts, airbags,

24
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,500
anti-lock brakes,
and a whole host

25
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,500
of other safety improvements.

26
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,275
That's happened at
the federal level,

27
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:10,250
but the states and the local
municipalities have also

28
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,020
established policies to address

29
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,120
behaviors in the
usage of vehicle.

30
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,890
These actually vary considerably

31
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:18,350
compared to those uniform
federal standards.

32
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,760
So for example, states have

33
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,450
different requirements for
the use of safety equipment,

34
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,684
different driver
licensing requirements,

35
00:01:24,684 --> 00:01:27,409
different standards for
drunk driving in some cases,

36
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:29,860
and also different speed limits.

37
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,630
I'm going to give you
now just a few examples

38
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:34,820
of policies that have
been implemented.

39
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,235
So in the 1960s and '70s,

40
00:01:37,235 --> 00:01:38,720
there were requirements passed by

41
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,295
nearly all states that

42
00:01:40,295 --> 00:01:42,665
required motorcyclists
to wear helmets.

43
00:01:42,665 --> 00:01:44,150
Unfortunately, since then,

44
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,590
about half of those states have

45
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,149
repealed or weakened

46
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:49,355
their motorcycle
helmet requirements.

47
00:01:49,355 --> 00:01:51,185
Another type of policy has been

48
00:01:51,185 --> 00:01:53,390
allowable blood alcohol content.

49
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:55,010
Nationally, you're allowed a

50
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:58,010
0.08 percent blood
alcohol content,

51
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:00,995
or less, to be legally
driving on the road.

52
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:02,900
However, there are exceptions,

53
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,090
and lower limits for
younger drivers,

54
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:06,770
and for commercial drivers.

55
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:09,350
Now, today, we're faced
with new questions.

56
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:11,330
How would we establish
an allowable level

57
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,465
of marijuana in a
person's system?

58
00:02:13,465 --> 00:02:15,590
There are policies
related to speed limits.

59
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:18,170
So if we roll back to 1974,

60
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,585
between then and 1995,

61
00:02:20,585 --> 00:02:22,580
the speed limit on
national highways was

62
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,760
[inaudible] 55 miles per hour.

63
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,500
With improvements
in vehicle design,

64
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,970
we've actually been able to
increase the speed limit to

65
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:32,000
now 65 to 85 miles per hour.

66
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,385
We've got different sorts of

67
00:02:33,385 --> 00:02:35,750
educational and
enforcement campaigns.

68
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,610
Many of you will live
in states that have a

69
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,800
click it or ticket
campaign that allows

70
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,390
the state police to pull you

71
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:44,575
over and give you a ticket
for not wearing a seat belt.

72
00:02:44,575 --> 00:02:47,450
Finally, I already mentioned
licensing requirements.

73
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:50,210
So virtually all states now have

74
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:53,555
some type of three-stage
graduated driver's license,

75
00:02:53,555 --> 00:02:56,269
so we can ease them into
dangerous driving situations,

76
00:02:56,269 --> 00:02:57,710
instead of just dumping them into

77
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,500
the deep end with a
single-stage license.

78
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,360
So I'd like to focus in

79
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,135
the next few slides about
some examples of how we can

80
00:03:05,135 --> 00:03:07,430
evaluate the
effectiveness of some

81
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,980
of these policies in
terms of health outcomes.

82
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,840
The graphic we're
looking at here shows

83
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,850
rates of deaths per million miles

84
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:17,750
driven between 1925 and 1995.

85
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,745
So if we look at 1925,

86
00:03:19,745 --> 00:03:22,580
you can see there were very
few vehicle miles traveled,

87
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:25,705
and a very high death
rate, relatively speaking.

88
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:28,580
The vehicle miles traveled
increased over time,

89
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,320
and the death rate
decreased over time.

90
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,095
Those two crossed in about 1960.

91
00:03:33,095 --> 00:03:35,270
Now, if we look at 1995,

92
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,560
we can see that the vehicle miles

93
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,660
traveled has gone
up tremendously,

94
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,980
and we've seen an equally

95
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,960
tremendous drop in
the rate of death.

96
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,350
So this is an example of
increasing usage of the roadway,

97
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,850
more exposure to this
public health issue,

98
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:51,065
but a much reduced
impact on public health.

99
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:53,360
Here's another example
of a health outcome.

100
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,440
So this map is showing

101
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,990
the percentage of
motorcyclists killed on

102
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,340
the road who were not wearing

103
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:01,535
helmets over a four-year
period in the US.

104
00:04:01,535 --> 00:04:03,890
So the states colored
in purple have

105
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,060
the highest percentage of

106
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,650
motorcyclists who died who
weren't wearing helmets.

107
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:10,790
The states in teal
or light green had

108
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,035
the lowest percentage of

109
00:04:12,035 --> 00:04:14,300
motorcyclists killed
not wearing a helmet.

110
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,180
You'll also see in
some of these states,

111
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,370
there's a black dot,

112
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:19,070
that indicates that
those states have

113
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,740
a universal motorcycle
helmet law.

114
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,990
So what you'll notice
here is that the states

115
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:26,150
that have a motorcycle
helmet requirement,

116
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:28,580
that black dot,
also, by and large,

117
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,715
have the lowest rates of
motorcyclists fatalities.

118
00:04:31,715 --> 00:04:33,530
Again, motorcyclists not wearing

119
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:35,015
helmets killed on the road.

120
00:04:35,015 --> 00:04:37,310
So here's a direct
example of the impact of

121
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:40,660
that policy on
motorcyclists deaths.

122
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,610
We can also think not just
about health outcomes,

123
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,080
but about behavior changes.

124
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,995
So this graph here shows
self-reported drunk driving.

125
00:04:48,995 --> 00:04:50,720
So this is the
percentage of adults who

126
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,760
reported driving
after drinking too

127
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,465
much in the past month
from a survey in 2012.

128
00:04:56,465 --> 00:04:57,970
The purple states here, again,

129
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,615
have the highest percentage

130
00:04:59,615 --> 00:05:01,125
of self-reported drunk driving,

131
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:03,620
and in this case, the
yellow or orange states

132
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,285
have the lowest percentage.

133
00:05:05,285 --> 00:05:07,430
The states with the
highest percentage of

134
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:10,100
drunk drivers tend to be
in the upper Midwest,

135
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,270
in the plains, and

136
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,950
the states with some
of the lowest rates

137
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:17,105
are down actually in the
Southeast, Alaska and Maine.

138
00:05:17,105 --> 00:05:19,940
Here's another example
of behavior change.

139
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,980
So this is the
percentage of teens in

140
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:25,040
high-school aged 16 years
or older who drink,

141
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,720
and drive and in this case,

142
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,249
we can say overall,

143
00:05:28,249 --> 00:05:29,340
in the United States,

144
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,710
the fraction of teens who

145
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,120
are drinking and
driving has actually

146
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,750
dropped pretty substantially
from 1991 to 2011.

147
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:39,170
We've had almost a 10
percent absolute reduction,

148
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,780
and about a 54 percent
relative drop.

149
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,850
So that's a tremendous
improvement that we

150
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:47,255
can largely attribute
to policy changes.

151
00:05:47,255 --> 00:05:50,135
So here's another example of

152
00:05:50,135 --> 00:05:51,440
a behavior change that's very

153
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,585
tightly linked to
health outcomes,

154
00:05:53,585 --> 00:05:55,100
that's seat belt use.

155
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,570
So it turns out seat belt use

156
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,610
peaked in the United
States in 2008,

157
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:01,100
with 85 percent of
drivers using them.

158
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,720
That's pretty substantial when

159
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,610
you compare it back to 1982,

160
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:07,430
when only 11 percent of
drivers were using them.

161
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,110
Or even 1984, when

162
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,510
15 per cent of drivers
were using seat belts,

163
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:15,245
and the first mandatory
seat-belt law came into effect.

164
00:06:15,245 --> 00:06:17,640
Between 2001 and 2009,

165
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,840
14 additional states passed
primary seat belt laws,

166
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,995
primary meaning this is

167
00:06:21,995 --> 00:06:23,540
something you can
get pulled over for,

168
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,655
even if you're not doing
anything else wrong.

169
00:06:25,655 --> 00:06:29,000
The graph shown here on
the left actually shows

170
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,015
injury rates among motor
vehicle occupants for men,

171
00:06:32,015 --> 00:06:36,890
for women, and overall over
that same 2001-2009 period.

172
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:38,690
You can see, indeed,
the injury rate

173
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,040
continued to decline over

174
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,505
that time as we had additional
laws come into place.

175
00:06:43,505 --> 00:06:46,720
So over that period, 2001-2009,

176
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,020
seat belt use went up
almost six percent,

177
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,495
and injury rates went down

178
00:06:50,495 --> 00:06:54,410
almost 16 percent, a
tremendous benefit.

179
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:57,240
When we think about
policy evaluation,

180
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,510
we have to think about
vulnerable groups as well.

181
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:02,810
So this is a map of states
requiring car seat use,

182
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,790
and the ages they
require it through.

183
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,530
The good news is all states

184
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:09,245
require car seat use
for young children now.

185
00:07:09,245 --> 00:07:11,120
But the states in
purple require them

186
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,009
only until the age of five,

187
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:14,840
the states in yellow
or orange require

188
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,995
it all the way through
the age of eight.

189
00:07:16,995 --> 00:07:19,885
So everyone has some
protection here.

190
00:07:19,885 --> 00:07:22,705
Nevertheless, car seats
are not uniformly used,

191
00:07:22,705 --> 00:07:24,590
despite the law requiring them.

192
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:25,970
We have seen that motor vehicle

193
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:27,680
crash deaths have gone down

194
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,620
among children between
2002 and 2011.

195
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,925
That's the graph on the right.

196
00:07:31,925 --> 00:07:35,210
But 800 additional lives
could have been saved

197
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:39,485
if we had had better car seat
US laws over that period.

198
00:07:39,485 --> 00:07:42,380
Another type of
policy evaluation we

199
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,360
can look at our economic impacts.

200
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,100
So the Centers for
Disease Control and

201
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,870
Prevention has looked at

202
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:50,360
14 different evidence-based
interventions

203
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,090
designed to improve
motor vehicle safety,

204
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:54,440
and from each of
those interventions,

205
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,150
they've come up with
estimates of the number of

206
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,965
injuries that could be prevented,

207
00:07:57,965 --> 00:08:00,425
the number of lives
that could be saved,

208
00:08:00,425 --> 00:08:03,410
the monetary benefits of
implementing that intervention,

209
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:06,395
as well as the cost to
implement that intervention.

210
00:08:06,395 --> 00:08:08,210
So I'd like to highlight
the results of

211
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:10,070
this CDC Analysis for Michigan.

212
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,480
That's the graphic
on the right here.

213
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,575
So out of these 14 interventions
that are possible,

214
00:08:14,575 --> 00:08:16,790
Michigan unfortunately
only uses three,

215
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:19,760
and the CDC estimates
for Michigan that if we

216
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,910
put the other 11
strategies into place,

217
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,290
we could save about

218
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:27,485
14,000 people from being
injured every year,

219
00:08:27,485 --> 00:08:30,005
save about 260 lives.

220
00:08:30,005 --> 00:08:35,330
The estimated monetary benefit
is $684 million per year,

221
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,770
and the cost to implement it is

222
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:39,740
only $67 million per year.

223
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:43,010
So here's an example of
economic impacts that we can

224
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:47,005
use to drive policy changes
in places like Michigan.

225
00:08:47,005 --> 00:08:49,580
We also, of course,
always want to focus on

226
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:52,040
health disparities and
minimizing those disparities.

227
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,890
Unfortunately, these
disparities continue today.

228
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:57,485
So if we look at infants
less than one year,

229
00:08:57,485 --> 00:08:58,850
their rate of dying from

230
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:01,310
traffic accidents among
American Indians and

231
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,990
Alaskan natives is eight times

232
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:05,180
higher than non-Hispanic whites.

233
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,475
The same holds true for adults.

234
00:09:07,475 --> 00:09:09,290
Adults who are
American Indians or

235
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:11,090
Alaskan natives
are two times more

236
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:12,320
likely to die in

237
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,395
traffic accidents than
non-Hispanic whites or Blacks.

238
00:09:15,395 --> 00:09:18,050
We can see in the graphic
here that we have

239
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:20,240
more Black and Hispanic children

240
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,030
dying on the road compared
to White children,

241
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,530
just from not being buckled up.

242
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,250
So despite the presence
of these policies,

243
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,730
of course, there continue to
be these health disparities.

244
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,470
These are opportunities
and needs that

245
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,065
we should address
with new policies.

246
00:09:33,065 --> 00:09:35,360
We also continue to have things

247
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,920
like differences
in seat belt use,

248
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,545
and differences in drunk
and impaired driving rates.

249
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:41,525
So these are disparities also.

250
00:09:41,525 --> 00:09:43,250
If we think about differences in

251
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,380
motor vehicle crash
and injury rates,

252
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,835
the graphic on the right here

253
00:09:46,835 --> 00:09:48,200
shows the differences between

254
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,440
males and females by
racial and ethnic groups.

255
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,865
So you'll see a couple
of things here.

256
00:09:52,865 --> 00:09:55,070
Males always have higher injury

257
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,480
and crash rates than females,

258
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,445
regardless of race or ethnicity.

259
00:09:58,445 --> 00:09:59,930
But again, American Indians and

260
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,280
Alaskan natives tend to have

261
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,080
the highest rates compared to

262
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,910
all the other racial
and ethnic groups.

263
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,260
So these are disabilities that we

264
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:09,075
can and must address
going forward.

265
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:11,870
Finally, I'd like to
finish this up by

266
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:14,450
encouraging you to watch
the video linked here,

267
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:17,090
and thinking whether you can
identify any differences

268
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:19,750
in the performance of
these two Chevy Malibus,

269
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:23,460
one from 1959, one from 2009,

270
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,280
that are purposely
crashed together by

271
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,620
the Insurance Institute
for Highway Safety.

272
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:30,912
So take a look, and I would
love to hear what you think.
