1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,580
Let's say you don't to like that.

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,750
Just like my face. It's hard not to.

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:19,080
All right. Hey, good morning, everyone. I have to admit, I'm a little bit sad this morning.

4
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:24,470
Our last big lesson here on my show, respect the.

5
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:29,740
That might not be totally mutual. So can you give me also be excited that it's in Alaska?

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:39,060
Uh, let's see. I sent out an announcement yesterday that we would plan to go ahead and start with our final group debate,

7
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:47,530
kind of first at the front end of the class period. And then that'll guarantee that we have plenty of time for discussion to follow up.

8
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:51,930
The only reminder I really have is just about the court valuations.

9
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:56,490
So then by the end of the week, thanks for this class for your other courses as well.

10
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:04,770
They're really valuable with that. Are there any questions about anything before we go ahead and start our final group debate?

11
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:32,570
All right. So with that, I will go ahead and invite the four group to come on up the floor is yours and please.

12
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:46,690
Okay. So our group is going to make the case to use geoengineering to combat the climate crisis.

13
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:50,080
So what's the issue? Our climate is in crisis.

14
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:56,799
The accumulated amount of manmade global warming pollution that is up in the atmosphere now traps as much extra heat

15
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:05,200
energy as would be released by 400,000 Hiroshima class atomic bombs exploding every 24 hours for 365 days a year.

16
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,069
All the extra heat is heating up Earth's atmosphere, as you can see,

17
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:13,120
by the increase in daily temperatures for summer months of major northern hemisphere cities.

18
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:20,080
These higher temperatures result in pervasive droughts and a greater frequency and intensity of wildfires.

19
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:26,140
Moreover, 93% of the extra heat trapped by manmade greenhouse gas pollution goes into the ocean.

20
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,880
And this heat capture is accelerating. Sea levels are rising,

21
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:35,190
and the consequences of hotter oceans and rising sea levels are that ocean based

22
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,120
storms get stronger and warmer oceans evaporate much more water into the sky,

23
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:46,750
where storm conditions create massive record breaking downpours, which in turn creates historic floods and mudslides.

24
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:52,300
The climate crisis impacts how in a myriad of ways that we don't have time to go into now.

25
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:58,780
The Paris Accords, the world's best global policy to combat the climate crisis, is a hollow accord that,

26
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:03,400
despite its perception, does nothing to address the existential threat of climate change.

27
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:08,049
But the Paris Agreement won't stave off the climate crisis because one carbon emission goals

28
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:13,010
are not nearly ambitious enough to the agreement doesn't include a global tax on carbon.

29
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:20,170
Three There's no way to punish countries that don't honor the agreement, for there aren't enough incentives for investing in sustainability.

30
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:29,470
And five, the agreement gives us false hope. The IPCC 2021 report shows anthropogenic greenhouse gas emission projections.

31
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:37,300
The white run line shows the emissions impact on climate change. If we remain at our current state without adding any further emission sources,

32
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:41,980
we therefore require immediate global action to counteract the climate crisis.

33
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:46,600
The light blue line shows what would happen if we took aggressive global action to

34
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:52,480
create net negative CO2 emissions through emerging technologies like geoengineering.

35
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:02,490
So what exactly is dual engineering? According to Harvard geoengineering,

36
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:12,360
it refers to emerging technologies that could manipulate and manipulate the environment and partially offset the impacts of climate change.

37
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:17,460
George Negus Classified into two groups. So the irrigation management and carbon dioxide reason.

38
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:21,450
There are many technologies that are currently being researched, the possibility of implementation.

39
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:31,080
But we believe that the following methods are most effective and cost efficient to ensure that resources otherwise afford stationary haulage.

40
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:37,080
These are cutting edge methods of carbon removal. Afforestation focuses on planting new trees and new areas.

41
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:40,080
Well, reforestation focuses on regrowth in different periods.

42
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,140
As these words develop and grow, the trees consume the carbon from the air and stored underneath the wood under the soil.

43
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:50,790
In other matter, without forests, carbon remains in the atmosphere in the form of CO2,

44
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:55,799
which is the most important greenhouse gas and is currently driving climate change. Another method is direct capture,

45
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:04,890
which is more expensive and see that the percentages of solar radiation in the process for offsetting temperature rise

46
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:10,350
caused by greenhouse gas emissions are better refers to the proportion of light or radiation as reflected by surface,

47
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:14,730
and we are able to modify albedo through artificial sectors such as widening roofs,

48
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,010
reflective pavement and some reflective years in this technology can also be used to implement new structures.

49
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,050
Any final, such as deserts with hundreds of others, are in development with strong promise.

50
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:28,410
So basically their little bubbles there are sent up into space.

51
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,700
They're very reflective and near the strong belief that they possibly can reverse today's global warming.

52
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,290
For the marine cloud,

53
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:41,280
brightening refers to the sprinkling of sea salt particles into marine clouds to make them thicker and making them more reflective.

54
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:50,880
So these methods have been proven to do little, to no risk towards safety and to lower temperatures through research.

55
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,760
And he also had the duality to be regional or global regions.

56
00:05:55,970 --> 00:06:01,940
So why do you need according to the United Nations we yet eight years left before climate change is potentially irreversible.

57
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:07,670
And for decades now human activities had been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like oil and gas.

58
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:13,610
And the controversy for engineering centered around ethical concerns and also the potential for irreversible damage.

59
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,510
But according to research with governance, many believed it is worth the risk at this point.

60
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:23,660
People are dying and suffering from the impacts of climate change on a daily basis, and even some animals are on the verge of extinction.

61
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:28,190
So we have gas emissions at an all time high and Teignbridge is going to continue with the increasing.

62
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:31,910
We need immediate mechanism for change and you think about that.

63
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:41,890
Okay. So the scientific evidence in support of geoengineering rests on a few key ideas.

64
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:45,490
The first being that current climate change progress is not enough.

65
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,280
We have reduced the rate at which the planet is warming, but not by much and not by enough.

66
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:57,220
Most of the current promises to reduce greenhouse emissions and improve the health of our planet are only on paper.

67
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,820
In fact, some climate scientists argue that even the two degree limit we have set for ourselves is too high.

68
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:11,620
Drastic measures are needed, and engineering is the answer. Scientific literature predicts that geoengineering would lower the average global

69
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:15,610
temperature by one degree or more and a short time span of only 1 to 2 years.

70
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:20,170
This allows for rapid action to keep the surface temperature well below the two degree threshold.

71
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:26,080
During geoengineering has other benefits like reducing and delaying sea level rise.

72
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:31,030
This is important because over 150 million people live within one mile of high tide.

73
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:35,170
Lastly, choosing not to invest in geoengineering is expensive.

74
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:43,540
Cost of repairing damage from the impacts of climate change are predicted to reach 10% of gross world product by the 2070s if no changes are made.

75
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:50,590
Although the other group may try to argue the effectiveness of geoengineering, it is clearly supported by scientific literature.

76
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:58,150
All right, analogies now home, some ethical factors that we've already mentioned.

77
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:03,280
So first, as Amy mentioned, there is an urgent and unavoidable need to address climate change.

78
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:07,899
And it's really apparent that mitigation and adaptation attempts may not be successful.

79
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:14,200
And if we don't act in time, then we may reach this tipping point with the accumulated emissions in the atmosphere.

80
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:18,549
And geoengineering may be the only way to avoid climate catastrophe.

81
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:25,870
And it may provide us with a lot of much needed extra time to launch effective and long lasting mitigation and adaptation plans.

82
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:30,040
And secondly, we think that technological solutions are key.

83
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:34,629
Geoengineering proposes some solutions and techniques that are simpler, quicker,

84
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:40,720
and demand less than some of the extensive social transformations that are inherent in adaptation.

85
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:45,490
And so we know that technology will only advance, advance and help us more and more in the future.

86
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,050
So we should take full advantage of it.

87
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:54,040
And thirdly, geoengineering may create political aversion and encourage individuals to do more to mitigate climate change.

88
00:08:54,610 --> 00:09:01,510
If policymakers and the public truly understand how pressing this issue is and how desperately actions need to take place,

89
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:10,570
then they may be more motivated to reduce emissions. And lastly, geoengineering offers a huge opportunity to bolster intergenerational justice.

90
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,660
And so if we just continue to kick the can down the road,

91
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:18,550
then future generations will inevitably bear the brunt of climate change's negative consequences.

92
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:26,500
And our current behavior really seems contrary to our responsibility of ensuring that the needs and interests of future generations are safeguarded.

93
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:34,750
So in the past, wealthier countries that have been unwilling or unable to cut emissions and this disproportionately impacts vulnerable populations,

94
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,090
could face higher rates of morbidity and mortality due to climate change complications.

95
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:46,810
And less developed countries which have contributed the least to anthropogenic warming, have been more effected.

96
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:53,740
And so overall, geoengineering has the potential to have this really great global positive impact for all people.

97
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:58,420
And we really think that there's a moral obligation for us to pursue it because it benefits all.

98
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:07,960
And that's the case for geoengineering. This next group of naysayers are going to come up and try to tell you that geoengineering is unethical,

99
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:13,600
that we should be focusing on decarbonization, methods and alternative energies, that we just don't know the long term effects.

100
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:19,839
Yet this precautionary principle of better safe than sorry isn't actually safer when it comes to the environment,

101
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:25,030
because at this point, not doing enough to combat the climate crisis is doing harm.

102
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:31,420
Moreover, humanity has been making choices that affect our environment for centuries, and we haven't regarded those consequences.

103
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:37,570
So it is now our responsibility to prevent further climate crisis harms that are a result of our past behavior.

104
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:42,970
Humanity engineered itself into the current climate crisis and it is time to geo engineer ourselves out.

105
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:48,820
With melting ice caps, erratic temperatures, pandemics, rising sea levels, ocean acidification,

106
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:53,230
superstorms, hurricanes, wildfires, disease, drought and mass species extinction.

107
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:57,250
Our climate is in crisis and the time for caution has long passed.

108
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:07,150
The Earth may not speak to us as humans do, but she has used her own language to tell us in no uncertain terms that time is running out.

109
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:12,160
The Paris Accords, the world's best global cooperative response to the climate crisis,

110
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,750
has proven to be a futile agreement, as is evident by the continued destruction of the planet.

111
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:21,880
In the years since the agreement was signed, global carbon emissions have risen by approximately 4%.

112
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:27,160
Emissions from all fossil fuel sources increased, and we haven't even reached the peak in carbon emissions.

113
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:32,500
The time to act to reverse climate change by decreasing emissions was yesterday.

114
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:39,830
To date, we must deliberately. To intervene on a planet wide scale to counteract the climate crisis, video engineering.

115
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:45,860
And then maybe, just maybe, all of our species will have a chance to see tomorrow.

116
00:11:54,220 --> 00:12:14,850
Some of friends we can now invite again to hurry up and make their house.

117
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:22,990
You want a chair? Yes.

118
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:49,600
No. I'm sick of thinking about eating it up and learning how much it costs.

119
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:03,460
All right. So we're here to talk about the harms and uncertainties of geoengineering.

120
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:08,680
So should we use geoengineering approaches to try to reverse the effects of human induced climate change?

121
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:13,420
And the answer for that is no. Geoengineering is like opening up Pandora's box.

122
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:16,780
It's something that will generate more complications and will help anything else.

123
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:20,620
So we're against geoengineering because there is insufficient science,

124
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:25,360
negative impacts on both human and environmental health at the political issues.

125
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,450
And lastly, geoengineering is just not a viable solution to climate change.

126
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,700
All right. So first, we'll just go through a quick introduction.

127
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:38,200
So geoengineering is the deliberate, large scale intervention in the Earth's natural system systems to counteract climate change.

128
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,340
Generally, there's two main ways that we do that. First is solar radiation management,

129
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:48,280
which is designed to reflect a portion of solar radiation away from the earth to counteract the rising temperatures caused by climate change.

130
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,960
And there's kind of three ways you can do that.

131
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:56,350
Injecting particles and gases into the stratosphere to block sunlight, increasing the reflectiveness of land and clouds to reflect solar heat,

132
00:13:56,830 --> 00:14:02,200
and deploying discs into the atmosphere designed to reflect sunlight but to block it from reaching earth.

133
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:09,400
So the next is carbon dioxide removal. Pretty self-explanatory, removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it for long periods of time.

134
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:12,670
There's many ways, different ways you can do that, but here are just a few to highlight.

135
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:16,600
This is called is. It refers to bioenergy with carbon capture and storage,

136
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:21,550
which is the process of burning biomass to create energy and capturing the released

137
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:26,020
carbon dioxide for storage and carbon capture against pretty self-explanatory.

138
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:30,159
And then carbon soil restoration, storing carbon in the soil.

139
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,360
And then there's natural methods mentioned in the other group like a forestation reforestation.

140
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:43,160
So our first main point that we'd like to discuss is that there's insufficient scientific understanding for geoengineering, for solar geoengineering.

141
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:49,389
The long term implications are insufficiently understood, but some evidence suggests that if carried out for over a century,

142
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:55,240
it would break up clouds and could cause an additional five degrees of warming for carbon dioxide removal.

143
00:14:56,590 --> 00:15:00,940
There is a lot of uncertainty of whether these methods can even capture or remove them out carbon.

144
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:07,630
That's some claim that they can. There's evidence to suggest that many studies overestimate the amount of carbon that can be captured.

145
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:12,999
One study looking at a carbon capture system associated with coal fired power station in Texas,

146
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:20,680
which is used as a model for other others in the country, claimed that it could reduce emissions by 90%, but only reduced it by 7% after three years.

147
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:26,139
There's also a problem with carbon emissions being more effective at increasing atmospheric carbon than equivalent.

148
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:32,980
Carbon removal is at lowering it. And this could lead to a different climate, a different outcome compared to avoiding emissions in the first place.

149
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,350
And there needs to be more research to better understand it.

150
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:41,750
And even with many carbon removal methods reporting being able to eliminate vast amounts of carbon from the atmosphere.

151
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:43,479
One study, looking specifically at Beccs,

152
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:49,390
estimated it could only remove 60 million tons of carbon a year without causing catastrophic damage to the earth,

153
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:54,400
which accounts for less than 1% of total global emissions per year.

154
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,549
And our last five uncertainty is that the lack of is a lack of adequate research and funding being provided for.

155
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:07,480
Challenging this pie chart visualizes the distribution of funding towards climate change technology and solutions.

156
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:11,680
And as you can see, only 12% of funding in the past three years has gone towards geoengineering.

157
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:16,960
And specifically, only 0.6% of climate funding has gone towards solar geoengineering research.

158
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,440
This is inadequate for a method already being promoted as being the solution for

159
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,980
climate change when we know there are negative impacts for health and the environment.

160
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:29,320
All right. So now we're going to get on to the impacts and human health and the climate.

161
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:34,149
So first, we're going to talk a lot about solar geoengineering because it's estimated

162
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:37,900
to have the highest cooling potential and also the most severe implications.

163
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:48,009
So when a solar roof, solar radiation management termination shock, which is if there was any ending abruptly to the use of SRM methods,

164
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:53,470
there would be a rapid and dangerous warming of the earth, which would have countless implications.

165
00:16:53,980 --> 00:17:01,030
That's because our solar engineering the effects are only temporary and uneven.

166
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:05,290
Impacts from solar geoengineering would cause regional discrepancies and anomalies.

167
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:12,160
Precipitation, other wetter weather patterns. Sorry, this is an issue for an equity of globally.

168
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:17,920
In addition, stratospheric aerosol injection could actually delay the restoration of ozone in the stratosphere.

169
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:27,300
And so it's been determined that between 1.2 and 4.1 billion people would be adversely affected by changes in rainfall patterns.

170
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:30,410
This includes this entire region in Africa.

171
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:34,630
This entire area would completely run out of water due to solar geoengineering.

172
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:41,980
Other environmental implications include from carbon dioxide removal, greater air pollution damage.

173
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:51,969
Previous studies investigating the topic don't consider upstream fossil emissions and the air pollutants that aren't included in carbon capture,

174
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:56,200
obviously like carbon monoxide oxides, sulfur dioxide, etc.

175
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:01,030
There's significant evidence that we just don't know what else will happen.

176
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:05,580
There's a lot of concern, just like other devastating implications.

177
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,930
So the occupational and population exposures of SRM are of grave concern.

178
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,420
So there's risk of exposure via installation, during manufacture, transport,

179
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:20,770
deployment and thereafter for workers manufacturing and deploying pressure.

180
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:27,300
So acute and chronic effects are of concern for exposures to sulfuric acid, hydrogen sulfide, sulfide,

181
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:35,110
black carbon or more and of even more concern are the population exposures because these exist on a global scale.

182
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:42,190
So SRM materials inject into the atmosphere, almost certainly eventually settle and lead to large scale population exposures.

183
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:51,340
That's due to atmospheric circulation and gravity. And so this will occur, these exposures will occur via inhalation ingestion and dermal absorption.

184
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:57,790
So the issue here is chronic exposures and their potential effects, which are insufficiently researched.

185
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,790
But it's likely that there will be carcinogenic implications, respiratory distress and irritation.

186
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:13,150
And so this chart shows all the list body systems and SRM aerosols and all the social negative health implications.

187
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:18,580
So that's a lot of access. So next, ethical and political issues.

188
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:22,870
So the first time geoengineering was addressed on international scale was only 12 years ago.

189
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:27,940
There are still no international policies, regulations or institutions to regulate geoengineering.

190
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:32,620
So this is something that occurs at a planetary scale. It has global effects.

191
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:37,420
So it require entirely new international organizations to even administer this.

192
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:42,620
And that's because there are extreme concerns with unilateral geoengineering deployment.

193
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:48,070
That's because any country could just decide to roll it out without the consent of everyone else.

194
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:52,060
In addition, without understanding or caring about the inequities it could cause.

195
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:57,790
So there's a significant risk that there could just be too much, which would cause to accessible.

196
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:06,820
And so this shows that the disproportionate amount of research on climate change that's come from like wealthier nations.

197
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:15,070
Whereas they're the ones that would hypothetically benefit the most from geoengineering and low income nations would be harmed the most.

198
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:25,090
And something else we found is that do engineering is widely supported by right wing think tanks and climate denialism groups.

199
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:33,130
So one group that's funded by ExxonMobil was offering money to scientists to write papers debunking the IPCC.

200
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:36,820
And they also ran a high profile campaign to promote geoengineering.

201
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:42,219
That's because geoengineering protects your supporters and their financiers in the fossil industries

202
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:47,140
because it would cause a creative substitution for reductions and would save them money.

203
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:53,080
So geoengineering is not a solution, but rather it's a problem in terms of cost.

204
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:56,770
Many proponents of geoengineering are in support of it because of its affordability.

205
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:00,460
And they'll tell you that compared to traditional methods of climate change mitigation,

206
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:04,810
geoengineering expected to be relatively inexpensive, effective and fast acting.

207
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:08,440
But affordability means that what the lack of governance and we previously discussed

208
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:12,100
geoengineering could be rolled out by any nation in a quick and cheap manner,

209
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,880
which increases the risk of over deployment, termination, shock and other harms.

210
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:21,370
So affordability should not be the basis of a decision as to whether or not we should implement geoengineering approaches.

211
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:24,730
Overall, mitigation is the only true solution that we have.

212
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:30,550
There is universal scientific consensus that the only way to stop anthropogenic climate change is through mitigation efforts.

213
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,720
But it's important to point out that mitigation efforts may be compromised by geoengineering.

214
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:39,970
From our research, we found that the data demonstrates the benefits of geoengineering are inconsistent at best.

215
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:44,829
Meanwhile, there is conclusive evidence that taking aggressive measures to eliminate or substitute

216
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:48,430
practices and materials that lead to climate change will achieve lasting effects.

217
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:53,979
So arbitrarily, so stubborn and set in our ways that we propose such dangerous interventions.

218
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,080
Rather than addressing the root cause of the problem,

219
00:21:56,530 --> 00:22:02,680
we as public health professionals understand that mitigation and preventing the problem in the first place is the best way to fix the problem.

220
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:07,420
So due to what we presented today with there being a lack of science at the political issues,

221
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:12,730
devastating implications, and this being a temporary fix, we should all say no to geoengineering.

222
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:28,710
All right. Excellent job to both groups. So as we've done with the first two debates, I'll ask the pro group.

223
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:33,000
You can step out and kind of go it to the right towards the cafe area.

224
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,510
You'll have 2 minutes that can kind of prepare for your rebuttal.

225
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:42,110
He again threw it out the door and left for the duration.

226
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:48,320
You got 7 minutes and I'll give you a 32nd one here.

227
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:23,190
Thank you. That's a great question. It was kind of like a little think about I you have something here that you can do.

228
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:30,700
And I guess I realized that because it's interesting.

229
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:40,410
I think they said gas or whatever.

230
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:43,630
Yeah. I want to know if it's being done artificially.

231
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:51,090
Kind of like so. I'm sure.

232
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:55,430
Anything on this scale, maybe.

233
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:02,580
I said no, it wasn't in there, but it was shocking.

234
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:13,650
I would be clearly exhausted, but that wouldn't exist.

235
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:26,550
I also think it's like you never speak to the basketball player so that the ability to get hydropower.

236
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,770
But, you know, the thing is, I wish they would have talked more about this.

237
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:41,000
I think this is one of the first things to seems like it's five degrees Celsius or something if they stop dancing in the street.

238
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:46,020
So I would love to know what water and it's like.

239
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:47,960
Yeah, those are kind of just thrown in there.

240
00:24:49,310 --> 00:25:02,220
And we do this in isolation, you know, to say anything, but it's like you do cause you would just be 16, 25.

241
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:17,610
He started it like six to do it and nobody thinks like something good they can do.

242
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:28,240
So I think we can continue this because I just figured it out.

243
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:38,100
I don't think so. I think it has the potential for smaller discrepancies in the state because of flights.

244
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:46,170
I think they made a good experience.

245
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:51,870
How about just duty to visit this place?

246
00:25:51,870 --> 00:26:08,150
My situation is really add to this problem because we were two years ago when I know we had to try to fix the problem, but it's like it's natural.

247
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:08,760
Yeah,

248
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:28,170
I think we should live with it because he tried to think it was good to just talk about people's lives can be a little when I interviewed with them,

249
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:40,590
just like a master's hearing that needs to be such a great guy, like you said, you know, and then it was my name or whatever.

250
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:55,360
I had to go, Oh my God, he says, if I get my job back, told otherwise that this sounds like a lot of hours.

251
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:05,330
And he says yes to Greg, literally, you know,

252
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:26,080
you can take how we proceed in this kind of moment that but I mean, I don't know what I'd like you to think.

253
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:43,200
This is the first time New York Times.

254
00:27:46,750 --> 00:28:01,470
I don't look at it like that's just crazy, this situation.

255
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:06,050
But I don't like that.

256
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:15,240
All right. Welcome back to both groups. So let's have the pro group.

257
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,700
You now have 2 minutes for your rebuttal.

258
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:26,610
So we just wanted to mention that the other group only mentioned some options for geoengineering and focused on the most extreme ones.

259
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:31,290
But there are also less extreme options that also have a positive impact.

260
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:33,629
And we could have a positive impact on climate change.

261
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:40,890
And we shouldn't write off geoengineering for good just because of our feelings towards one or a couple of dramatic options.

262
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:47,070
So one alternative is mirrors in space, which can decrease or increase the amount of energy that reaches the earth.

263
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:53,370
And this can be easily controlled and. A smaller way to ease our way into geo engineering.

264
00:28:54,900 --> 00:29:00,479
And secondly, we understand that geo engineering provides only temporary relief for global warming.

265
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:09,360
But this relief could really buy us a lot of time for better mitigation efforts and changing to alternative energy sources.

266
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:16,950
And then the other group mentioned that inadequate research has been performed in only about 12% of funding has gone towards geoengineering.

267
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:23,069
But we just want to say that obviously this isn't enough money and the effects of geo engineering could be a lot more positive if we

268
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:30,180
actually invested a lot more money in it and figured out how these techniques worked well for certain populations and graphical areas,

269
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:34,010
but it just hasn't been done yet. So that's what we're pushing for.

270
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:41,490
Then lastly, we are out of time. We do not have time to get every nation on board, as is evident by the Paris Accords,

271
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:46,690
which has shown us that the world's best global response to the climate crisis is simply too little, too late.

272
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:53,760
Are we so dangerous and set in our ways that we are willing to barrel headfirst into a climate apocalypse if we wait to get

273
00:29:53,760 --> 00:30:00,630
everybody on board to mitigate climate change when people are still considering climate crisis as a political issue to be debated.

274
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:02,150
We don't have time.

275
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:13,530
We need to start geoengineering, the environment now so that we can actually use the resources to mitigate carbon and make the earth cool again.

276
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:22,500
People and all that you can things through.

277
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:28,650
And now the against group, you had your 2 minutes for your rebuttal.

278
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:36,180
I'm sorry, just as a quick rebuttal to that.

279
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:39,959
If you consider that we're going to have to start doing geoengineering right now.

280
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:45,180
But the scientific funding hasn't come in yet. How are we supposed to start geoengineering right now?

281
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:49,620
If we haven't, we don't have the scientific evidence for at this moment.

282
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:57,480
So that's one thing. But the get or the pro group mentioned governance problems that are currently happening with climate change mitigation.

283
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:04,050
Those governance problems would be the same with geoengineering. We would see the same problem of trying to coordinate with other nations.

284
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:10,379
And then to the point of I'm only mentioning a few types of geoengineering,

285
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:13,440
those are the ones that are likely to have the biggest impact, which is why we mention them.

286
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:18,630
All these other ones that could have positive impact are not going to be enough to achieve our climate goals.

287
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:26,580
And so also you guys repeatedly said that it will possibly offset or possibly have positive implications.

288
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:29,519
Is that enough to take this get help when we know that?

289
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:37,440
And that could be subtle cause we know it'll dry out entire regions of the country, possibly destabilizing governance in nations and internationally.

290
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:46,050
So and this also incentivizes fossil fuel companies, polluters to continue doing what they're doing, because now they've got a Band-Aid.

291
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:51,120
They've got something like cleaning up what they're doing rather than actually stopping the problem.

292
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:58,380
So this means that those who are profiting right now off of causing this devastation are the ones that will profit off of this solution.

293
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:07,709
So in addition, the Earth is just it's not a laboratory like there is not enough science.

294
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:12,480
We've repeatedly said there's not enough science. And you part of your argument was that we need to invest more in research.

295
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,620
That's not the question. We're here to answer the question. We're here. The answer is if we should use it.

296
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:19,859
And all indications right now saying, no, it's not safe.

297
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:27,269
There's not enough information in the socio economic and global disparities that you've talked about of climate change.

298
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:31,740
Those are true of this, too. This is not going to solve it. Do engineering will only make it worse?

299
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:53,520
All right. So let's go ahead and take a look at the fantastic imagery from both groups and this debate in particular.

300
00:32:53,670 --> 00:33:02,190
Really cool. Oh, I know. All right.

301
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:05,540
So let's let's follow up on our our usual protocol.

302
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:13,710
Right? So we have to vote by a show of hands just in terms of like quality and argument of the debate put forth.

303
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:22,560
Who thinks the program won the debate about who thinks the against group won the debate.

304
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:29,310
Okay. And then you can barely vote unsure or anybody who's just really not quite sure yet.

305
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:33,060
Okay. Now let's go to the issues itself.

306
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:41,370
Right. So aside from the debate quality, who is in favor of geo engineering?

307
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:48,420
Okay. All right. We see ahead who's against geoengineering?

308
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:54,240
How about third option, who's like kind of waffling and not really sure.

309
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,380
We're not very like and against, but I know it's probably going to happen.

310
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:05,040
All right. So let's go ahead and open things up.

311
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:13,350
Questions, comments, you know, not just audience members, but debate participants as well.

312
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:17,330
Yes. Question.

313
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:24,940
There's a couple of like geoengineering efforts where you're like reflecting stuff back into space or like putting stuff back in the atmosphere.

314
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:33,340
What kind of implications would this have on the universe and why does the earth get precedence over everything else that's out there?

315
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:46,000
Good question. Either of the debate groups have any insight into an answer for that or I mean, we can't even take care of everybody on Earth.

316
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:52,809
Right? Right. And I'm not saying that from like a pro geoengineering perspective.

317
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:58,260
I'm just saying it like with all the people who are and, you know,

318
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:06,279
all the social determinants of health and things like that that are already dumping on populations like we should if we don't care enough about Earth,

319
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:12,400
I think, and its people to try to add the whole universe into it, I think is a hard sell for.

320
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:20,870
I just don't think that that's going to happen. But, yeah, it's an excellent point. Any any other responses to that question?

321
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:31,890
I think it's a that's a great question. I don't actually have like an informed answer to it, but just since you've asked for it,

322
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:36,790
like if you don't even know author coming something like there's like no light in the space.

323
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:42,939
Like, I don't even matter, you know? What about these? Oh, it's reflecting a key energy.

324
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:49,930
And so basically the cold, the space like, mitigates the heat from our own atmosphere if we reflect it back.

325
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:57,909
And so that's the main thing about using light. Now, how does that impact our our missions to Mars and the moon?

326
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:02,080
Right. Colonizing other planets? Okay, cool.

327
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:08,590
I can't keep we can't land the ship. Well, I was also wondering, like,

328
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:15,219
we there's like also a problem with having too many satellites currently orbiting the Earth so that we're like adding more stuff and like,

329
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:18,530
there's issues with, like, old ones running into things and like, causing problems.

330
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:21,579
So, like, I'm not that's not necessarily the universe.

331
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:24,760
That's just a problem with our atmosphere with this solution.

332
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:31,850
And also, I don't think space isn't the solution for climate change, that's for sure.

333
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:39,710
Great question. Thanks for thanks for asking that. Any any other thoughts, comments, questions that folks have?

334
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,760
Just a thought, because so much of the talk was about carbon dioxide.

335
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:53,120
And obviously carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas and it is a problem and levels are rising.

336
00:36:53,750 --> 00:37:02,989
But I also think about other greenhouse gases like methane is so much more like has such a higher warming potential than carbon dioxide,

337
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:04,660
even though there's technically like less of it.

338
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:14,540
And I just wonder if there are other even if it's geoengineering, just other options for other types of greenhouse gases besides just carbon dioxide?

339
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:21,400
I don't know. I don't know enough about it. Folks have thoughts on.

340
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:30,299
Q I was going to say, like, I didn't see a lot about other greenhouse gases.

341
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:34,560
Like literally everything was focused on either solar radiation or carbon dioxide removal.

342
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:37,350
So I don't know if they just like are ignoring it.

343
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:42,180
Like it was like I don't know if they're doing really, but it's like the hot topic now is carbon dioxide.

344
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:49,680
Yeah. So I don't know. I think methane has like a half life of like, like six or 12 years or something like that in the atmosphere.

345
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:53,520
And I think it also degrades into carbon dioxide. Gotcha.

346
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:59,159
I could be wrong about that. But also methane like it from agriculture.

347
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:05,930
I know they're doing a lot of stuff to try to like engineer food for cows that like makes them or at least my statement.

348
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:08,530
I don't think that counts as geoengineering, but like,

349
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:18,000
I know that is I guess I would consider it geoengineering because it involves space, but they're not.

350
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:22,719
Right. Good question.

351
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,440
Yeah. Oh, from like an engineers perspective.

352
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:37,310
It's bad. I know. I feel like everything you do is going to have a lot of bad side effects, like we learned a lot about.

353
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:44,450
Like, anytime you manufacture anything, it's going to have every side effect that you don't want to happen.

354
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:55,700
So it's a lot of like rebalancing. I know that one like a big topic now at least something like engineering side is doing carbon capture in factories.

355
00:38:56,300 --> 00:39:02,870
So the places that produce the most but also decrease but decrease their emissions the most.

356
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:09,590
But then the big issue with that is do you make more carbon making the devices that make the carbon capture.

357
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:23,179
It's like a big cycle. Yeah. It's, it's not much like, oh you don't have any comments or responses.

358
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:27,259
Um, yeah, this is just like off the record, not debating anymore.

359
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:33,799
I think when we got like we really didn't, we weren't really on board with like what we had to present.

360
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:40,459
But when I was looking at like the scientific literature, there really wasn't much to support geoengineering.

361
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:44,120
And so that was super concerning that this is even something that we are considering

362
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,810
strongly because it's like there really wasn't anything that was like concrete.

363
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:59,270
And it's more worrisome that this is like a consideration that people are really putting time into when I think we should be focusing on mitigation.

364
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:04,429
But it was also interesting and like sometimes we were like, wow, like maybe.

365
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:07,909
But it would have to be perfect. Like, right, right. To be worth it.

366
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:10,880
Yeah. Thank you.

367
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:20,240
I'm curious, neither of you really mentioned ocean fertilization, which I know there have been like some projects to try to do that already.

368
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:25,020
Like there's a theory that basically because we killed the whales off,

369
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:30,110
we decreased plankton populations from oceans, from iron fertilization, from whales.

370
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:35,269
And I know that there's some areas where they actually have done it and there's data about what they've done.

371
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:42,110
But I don't know what that did. I really tried to look it up, but I was wondering if either of the groups had looked into that at all.

372
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:44,770
Yeah, I did read an article in essence in the research.

373
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:48,470
I can't remember where it was, but it was one of the projects they did that was like a total flop.

374
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:54,440
I mean, that was just one. I don't know about the rest, but but very well,

375
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:00,469
it doesn't make sense to me because like some of them are like, we should put more phosphorus in nitrogen.

376
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:03,490
And I'm like, that's what happened in the Gulf of Mexico. We don't have any.

377
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:06,950
We have a dead zone there now. So like that wasn't trying to do engineer.

378
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:13,320
That was just been farming. Like it's like anyway, strange.

379
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:22,610
And then I also I'm curious, like you mentioned in your presentation, the scale of social transformation that's required for all the other plans.

380
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:25,640
But I think also those things have so many more benefits than.

381
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:28,759
Yeah. Like social transformation like. Well,

382
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:35,270
it might solve climate change is also going to solve like in theory would solve a lot of other issues we have other than just like a change though.

383
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:46,680
I think like the whole theory behind you, engineering in general is like based on like pessimism, like climate change.

384
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:52,020
So just like there's no we have no solution other than like this desperate measure,

385
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:57,150
like all the articles that over it's like geoengineering is a bad idea.

386
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:01,410
They're all like, but we just may have to do it. It's like, that's crazy.

387
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:08,379
When you literally present all this data on how it's an awful idea and then like, but we might have to.

388
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:14,550
And I think a lot of that problem is because of like the influence of industry and like Elon Musk types,

389
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:22,020
like people who want to just accommodate their own misbehavior when like the real problem is a lot of like international

390
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:29,249
governments and corporations and like simply like overproduction and like the exploitation of low income countries.

391
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:35,370
Like if we actually just like stopped making all this crap, this problem will just go away.

392
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:41,640
Like, that's the whole, the whole issue here. And so, like, I feel like a lot of it is just like this.

393
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:46,950
Pessimism led by capitalism. We're.

394
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:55,210
Great, great points. What is any other like?

395
00:42:55,250 --> 00:43:04,480
Opinions, views, questions? Because it means each of these individuals.

396
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:12,820
I can I can weigh in with a little bit of of my own, just based on some of the conversations that were coming to mind.

397
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:18,760
The comment about like, yeah, engineering often ends poorly.

398
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:21,830
We do have a track record of that, right?

399
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:28,750
I mean, even in this class, we've discussed some of these topics where, you know, with the absolute best intentions.

400
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,350
Right. Uh, with refrigerants.

401
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:40,890
Right. This is like progress. Like the ability to, to store food at an a frozen temperature or even a refrigerated temperature.

402
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:45,970
Right. Versus the more archaic, you know, blocks of ice in a cold room and that type of thing.

403
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,030
Um, and they were studied.

404
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:59,050
We studied these refrigerants that were going to be used and they're, they're, they're non-reactive, they're stable at atmospheric conditions.

405
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:09,430
Okay, great. What's widely dispersed these around the planet only to find out a couple of decades later that those systems leak.

406
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:14,400
Okay. Maybe we considered that wasn't considered.

407
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:20,830
Was those chemicals then reaching up into higher levels in the atmosphere right above the

408
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:27,190
surface layer where those chemicals are exposed to different wavelengths of ultraviolet light,

409
00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:32,980
where now they do, they're no longer stable and they become photo reactive and they break down.

410
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:37,720
Right. So that was, you know, the ozone layer destruction in the stratosphere.

411
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:41,800
We also talked in this class about flame retardants.

412
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:45,250
Right. Total well-intended. Right.

413
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:55,900
You know, fire safety, you know, deaths, uh, lots of terrible things that happen from, you know, candle based fires.

414
00:44:56,530 --> 00:45:01,050
And okay, we have we have these chemicals that we can, you know,

415
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:12,340
basically coat surfaces and products with that can reduce the incidence of fires and improve safety and then widely distribute that right,

416
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:18,460
you know, across the globe and then finding out, you know, some some time later.

417
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:24,849
Okay, it turns out that these chemicals don't actually stay attached to the things that they were applied to.

418
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:28,149
Um, they distribute themselves very effectively.

419
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:30,970
They're in everyone's bloodstream, you know, etc.

420
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:38,740
So yeah, even with like the best intentions, we, society wise, we don't have, you know, a great track record.

421
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:44,530
So, you know, there's some, I think some really healthy caution, uh, to be,

422
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:50,470
to be thrown at this, right, uh, in considering some of these geoengineering approaches.

423
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:55,200
But at the same time, I think you guys are absolutely right. Like you're, you're nailing it.

424
00:45:55,240 --> 00:46:05,080
Uh, probably the biggest challenge or the biggest. Uh, fear really is, is the capitalism component of it.

425
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:14,350
Uh, because, like, you can almost see us swing like for a group of folks that have been kind of like denying,

426
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:22,840
you know, changing climate for a long time. Eventually it's going to be recognized, like, oh, my gosh, like, this actually is really bad.

427
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:26,620
But the solution is do something else right away.

428
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:30,010
Right. And it's fed by the opportunity to make money.

429
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:36,190
So all it will take is some convincing that, yes, we do need more research dollars.

430
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:40,870
Right. And so here is government subsidies to help speed up the process.

431
00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:44,340
And there's an entire industry waiting to kind of, like, capitalize on it.

432
00:46:44,350 --> 00:46:50,110
Right. Regardless of what that, you know, downstream, ill intended effect is going to be.

433
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:57,970
Uh, that's, that's one of my own personal, you know, kind of fears and how that's how this plays out, uh, going forward.

434
00:46:58,210 --> 00:46:59,820
Let's actually, let's circle back.

435
00:46:59,830 --> 00:47:08,350
There was a really great comment that was suggested that we didn't really touch on, but the suggestion to focus on mitigation.

436
00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:17,260
Right. What do you folks think about this that we talked about in class about both mitigation and adaptation?

437
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:23,160
And what's what's the healthy mix there, folks?

438
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:31,020
I think everyone's probably on board that there is no we can solve the problem tomorrow.

439
00:47:31,290 --> 00:47:35,610
Right. We have something facing us that's relatively long term.

440
00:47:36,450 --> 00:47:41,370
What do folks think are the best actions to take?

441
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:49,620
You know? Knowing what all of the challenges are that are out there.

442
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:11,110
I guess it's a combination of like mitigation and then creating carbon sink.

443
00:48:11,110 --> 00:48:18,459
So like to actually sequester carbon so by like reforestation or using better agricultural

444
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:23,560
methods so that you're not losing CO2 in the atmosphere every time you tail things like that.

445
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:28,030
If you start using sequestering technology in combination with mitigation efforts,

446
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:36,850
then I think that there's a chance and like the Biden-Harris administration has a whole focus on nature based solutions towards climate change,

447
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:40,840
which is basically just planting a bunch of trees and things like that.

448
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:44,980
And so those are the kind of, I think a combination of those two verses.

449
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:50,559
Setting off false volcanic eruptions in our atmosphere to make clouds.

450
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:54,070
Right. Like we get it. We yeah. It's a hard sell, so we're trying.

451
00:48:54,340 --> 00:49:01,810
But I think that yeah, those things are probably our best efforts based off the research I did for this project.

452
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,800
How can I photograph one? Yeah, of course.

453
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:12,800
I just showed you. They thought Instagram.

454
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:28,940
Basically this is about the actual share of wealth share and how a lot of birds are.

455
00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:37,229
A lot of things are like a lot of solutions that are proposed are like, Oh, everyone just needs to like stop emitting things.

456
00:49:37,230 --> 00:49:38,020
But like, you know,

457
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:47,369
we have celebrities taking ten minute plane rides that are emitting more fossil fuels in some countries in those plane rides themselves.

458
00:49:47,370 --> 00:49:56,870
And the outcome is that people who are of higher classes are actually contributing

459
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:03,000
way more to the problem than even people like us in a wealthy nation.

460
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:14,950
So this is like if per capita carbon footprints were the same across the forest,

461
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:21,490
50% in the world, 40%, 9% like obviously you would say the percentage of the population.

462
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:25,570
It should look like that. But this is what it actually looks like.

463
00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:34,839
So the richest 1% are emitting 15% of the carbon or just 9% or 37% of the middle.

464
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:38,710
40% are almost like a fair share.

465
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:44,000
And 41% and then the poorest 50% of the world are only emitting 7%.

466
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:49,810
So when we talk about how countries like India need to change things like their

467
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:55,900
population is mostly in this poor is 50% and 7% of the global carbon emissions.

468
00:50:55,930 --> 00:51:02,440
So I think some of the stuff is like having gone to other climate negotiations like that.

469
00:51:02,830 --> 00:51:08,020
The a lot of the debate is called into like, oh, everybody has to reduce emissions.

470
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:12,280
But at the same time it's like, no, we in the United States really need to reduce emissions.

471
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:15,510
And also the richest 10% really can't live the lifestyle that they.

472
00:51:22,730 --> 00:51:29,820
Now. Thanks for highlighting that. Absolutely. It points to.

473
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:33,979
Right. You know, kind of like social classes.

474
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:35,930
They should be bearing responsibility.

475
00:51:36,350 --> 00:51:44,450
But also, I think, you know, to the point that, uh, campus, I should give credit to the debate team or to Morgan's comment as part of the discussion.

476
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:52,910
But the contention that, uh, you know, geoengineering is an excuse, uh, or like a Band-Aid,

477
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:58,160
so that those continuing to make money hand over foot can continue to make money hand over foot.

478
00:51:58,850 --> 00:52:04,820
At present, at a carbon footprints were invented by BP which is.

479
00:52:04,970 --> 00:52:12,920
Yeah, because they wanted to shift the blame onto individuals rather than what are ways that individuals can, you know, offset.

480
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:24,950
What about I want it to maybe end with this and it really wasn't the focus of the debate,

481
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:29,750
but, uh, I think it still kind of fits into, uh, you know, engineering approaches.

482
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:34,640
Can we, can we engineer our way out from an adaptation perspective?

483
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:51,240
If we can't stop what's coming in terms of climate change, can we adapt and, you know, truly unique, advanced ways.

484
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:59,840
Yes. The concerning aspect is the market will adapt to our adaptations.

485
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:09,450
So as I believe was mentioned, I think it was mentioned like as these companies are like sequestering all of these things,

486
00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:16,380
the bar is just going to remain constant as as our efforts increase as a society and

487
00:53:16,550 --> 00:53:21,840
companies are just going to become more and more productive because of these adaptations.

488
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:31,530
I don't know. I feel like there's a there's a Futurama episode about this and like all of robots gathered in a specific spot,

489
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:34,560
but then like nothing changed at the end.

490
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:46,889
And I don't know what it was called, but yeah, I feel like it would be super interesting to be able to do this.

491
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:52,020
And I think like we do have the technology that like maybe we could do this, but who would this benefit?

492
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:55,390
Probably again, the richest people like it.

493
00:53:55,590 --> 00:54:01,440
If the people who are disproportionately impacted would continue to bear the brunt like they

494
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:07,320
probably wouldn't have access to whatever these are adaptation tools or whatever it looks like is.

495
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:12,810
So it's like. Yes, we could go down that path, but I wonder if it would just be.

496
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:23,630
Just as bad. Right. Right. Great point. And I also think it depends on what you mean by engineering is one thing.

497
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:28,970
Like if you're talking like only about technological solutions, like the.

498
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:34,060
The way they're trying to protect Venice from sea level rise,

499
00:54:34,210 --> 00:54:39,340
that's not necessarily going to be able to be used on a larger scale to prevent sea level rise globally.

500
00:54:39,730 --> 00:54:45,370
But then there's things like rebuilding oyster reefs, which are beneficial for so many reasons,

501
00:54:45,370 --> 00:54:49,000
other than just protecting land against sea level rise.

502
00:54:50,230 --> 00:54:56,860
Like it's beneficial for like the water quality, it's beneficial for like protecting areas from storms.

503
00:54:56,860 --> 00:55:00,400
It's beneficial for so many reasons. It also can provide food.

504
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:05,019
And then there's things like reforestation, which also are like providing things.

505
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:13,090
And it. That was an interesting thing. I read the Biden-Harris nature based solutions like Plan yesterday,

506
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:22,120
and they were talking a lot about oyster reefs and like kind of building natural buffers to help deal with adaptation, adapting to these things.

507
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:25,149
And some of them are also things like going back to prescribed burning,

508
00:55:25,150 --> 00:55:35,530
which indigenous people did here in the United States for many years before Europeans came and colonized and helped manage the ecosystem.

509
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:44,950
So some of these things are accessible solutions that don't require tons of money, and they just require us not allowing companies to destroy things.

510
00:55:45,130 --> 00:55:52,690
So which is politically hard, but not financially difficult right now.

511
00:55:53,230 --> 00:55:58,300
Thank you, Kate. Any any other comments or questions?

512
00:55:59,170 --> 00:56:07,270
Yes. Also, I think if you actually really implement a carbon tax, it would, I think, start hitting these 1%, top 10%.

513
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:12,550
You know, if if we start making people pay for what they put into the atmosphere.

514
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:20,990
So if you're taking to private jets for a 15 minute plane ride to the same location, you know that it's going to cost you.

515
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:27,040
I mean, that could also just be a slight deterrent. I don't think we'll ever see it because who are the, you know, people making policies.

516
00:56:28,990 --> 00:56:32,620
But I think that could be a big help.

517
00:56:33,310 --> 00:56:41,440
Yeah. If you have to pay for the nose. And I guess also the geo engineering perspective, the main thing, it was about parallel processing, right?

518
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:45,400
It's not just about doing geo engineering as a saw.

519
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:54,340
So like response like way to fix the environment, it's to buy time for mitigation efforts.

520
00:56:54,700 --> 00:57:00,069
And I think that the articles we are reading too are basically like Dune engineering's the worst,

521
00:57:00,070 --> 00:57:06,850
but there's going to come a time where that's all we're going to have to buy us time to like make changes.

522
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:14,050
And so, yeah, that's kind of I think all of us kind of hope that we don't get to that point.

523
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:18,490
But that's just something that's another thing.

524
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:23,350
I, I have a question in response.

525
00:57:23,450 --> 00:57:36,260
I think I saw your hand for case. So if the if the goal of a carbon tax is to deter that, then I can definitely see the effectiveness.

526
00:57:36,950 --> 00:57:40,970
If it's not a deterrent and simply a revenue generator.

527
00:57:41,210 --> 00:57:46,170
Yeah. Does that work and what what's done with that tax?

528
00:57:46,350 --> 00:57:53,790
Yeah. If you pipeline it into technology like alternative energies and if you put it into mitigation efforts,

529
00:57:53,790 --> 00:58:02,970
reforestation efforts, if it research towards the climate crisis, that could also have a lot of impacts as well, you know?

530
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:12,350
Yeah, hopefully. Well, my worry was less about that was more the the short term.

531
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:20,370
One thing France recently did was ban domestic flights that were like less than 2 hours were 2 hours long or something like that,

532
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:23,880
which is something we could also do here.

533
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:30,540
Like there's a lot of short term flights, which I know that doesn't get at the richest 1% necessarily because it's commercial flights,

534
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:37,650
not private flights, but there are things like that that are very usable.

535
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:45,330
But with I don't like carbon taxes so much as I think that we need to be like pricing carbon higher before like with actual effect.

536
00:58:45,330 --> 00:58:49,260
But I also know that that has disproportionate effects on people as well.

537
00:58:49,560 --> 00:59:00,240
So. I like that that the France policy, there's also a legitimate real alternative.

538
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:03,890
Right, for those to our left. Yeah. We don't have a lot.

539
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:16,040
Looking for any other hand that's climbing to like the nature based solutions.

540
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:21,200
I think I have come to like plant trees as like an offset to get through like net zero.

541
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:26,450
And so I wonder that a risk being like obviously reforestation is great,

542
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:32,960
but like how does that really measure up to like the affects of maintaining carbon emissions?

543
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:38,209
And so I can see a world in which you have a company that has your CSR waiting and they

544
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:43,150
pay for like an oyster restoration and then turn around and just keep going and you know,

545
00:59:43,770 --> 00:59:49,309
you'll it's not something that concerns me and I agree go with the nature based solutions there's a big risk as well.

546
00:59:49,310 --> 00:59:55,790
It those like things like green space and all sorts of like nature revitalization is going into communities

547
00:59:55,790 --> 01:00:03,500
that already benefit and it actually exacerbating environmental injustices as opposed to letting it go.

548
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:14,049
Great comment. Thanks very. All right.

549
01:00:14,050 --> 01:00:18,340
Well, fantastic job. Thanks again to both both groups.

550
01:00:19,090 --> 01:00:22,930
We do have a few minutes left. I wanted to just offer up.

551
01:00:23,050 --> 01:00:27,130
You know what? The few minutes we have left in the class, just a chance for reflection.

552
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:35,620
Um, I want to say thank you so much for bringing your, your own passions to this class.

553
01:00:35,770 --> 01:00:41,800
It's really, really appreciated. I think I ended up front that, you know, I would be valuing that.

554
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:47,680
And, you know, it's so cool to actually see it happen and for you to all bring your your perspectives.

555
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:49,600
You have very different backgrounds, right?

556
01:00:49,870 --> 01:00:55,410
Whether it's formal education or, you know, just like your upbringing, geographic location, whatever it is.

557
01:00:55,420 --> 01:01:02,720
Right. And your willingness to bring those perspectives and share them is, uh, is wonderful to see.

558
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:06,640
It's really, really cool from my own perspective, from a selfish perspective.

559
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:21,340
Um, so some of you, uh, this class rate on exposure and health is, is maybe the beginning you're going to continue on studying this type of stuff.

560
01:01:21,790 --> 01:01:24,780
For others of you, this is a little bit more of like a one off, right?

561
01:01:24,790 --> 01:01:29,160
It's kind of like some some background information to go do what you really want to do.

562
01:01:29,590 --> 01:01:32,170
Or maybe you've had to take this class and you really want to be here.

563
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:44,049
And thanks as well for for for managing through it, but just a chance to reflect on what is it in this in this broader area,

564
01:01:44,050 --> 01:01:48,640
whether it's something we specifically covered in class or not, something that you brought as a perspective,

565
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:57,540
what is it that you're most hopeful for, even excited about and or, you know,

566
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:05,709
concerned or worried about from a perspective of yours that's become more informed over the last couple of months.

567
01:02:05,710 --> 01:02:08,080
Right. And it doesn't have to be specific to this class. Right.

568
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:13,990
It's it's more broadly to your your continued experience in your in your program of study.

569
01:02:19,590 --> 01:02:23,700
And it can run the gamut. Right. Like in this class, we talked about sources.

570
01:02:24,030 --> 01:02:28,320
Right. We've talked about these, uh, environmental pathways.

571
01:02:29,310 --> 01:02:40,110
And then, you know, the actual roots of exposure that lead to, you know, eventual harm on us as people in any aspect along that entire.

572
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:52,910
Process. And it's totally fair.

573
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:57,540
Your response is like, Holy cow, professor, we're like, at the end of the semester, we do exams.

574
01:02:57,540 --> 01:03:00,790
I get a paper, I got to study and you're asking me, you're like, Yeah.

575
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:06,629
Cassie I feel like this class just made me feel able to think like a lot deeper about like what I'm putting

576
01:03:06,630 --> 01:03:11,370
into my body and how there are so many things that I'm exposed to every day that I didn't realize,

577
01:03:11,780 --> 01:03:13,829
especially about like products that I'm using.

578
01:03:13,830 --> 01:03:20,010
Like before this, I feel like I was kind of avoidant of knowing what's in them because I know it was probably not a good thing.

579
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:24,210
But now that we've like learned about it and like trying to find alternatives or like,

580
01:03:24,540 --> 01:03:29,759
I don't know the things that we learned in class, I usually tell my family and I'm like, I didn't know this before now.

581
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:35,700
And like, I feel like just sharing the information that we've learned with other people is so important because as we've talked about a lot,

582
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:41,879
like so much of it is known that like we're using a lot of harmful products most of the time.

583
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:45,390
But I don't know, that's just one take or you don't have. Yeah, no, that's great.

584
01:03:45,390 --> 01:03:50,020
Thanks so much for sharing, Cassie. The building of the Cassidy side.

585
01:03:50,070 --> 01:03:55,920
And I'd like to get your point a little. I feel like I had a super understanding of like a biological side.

586
01:03:55,920 --> 01:04:01,680
I didn't really know what exposures science was going in, and I didn't read the class description, of course them and it was part of the program.

587
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:06,839
But I was like, I was excited to learn all these things and just kind of learn how to like evaluate all these

588
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:10,710
environmental exposures and occupational and community settings and that sort of thing.

589
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:17,730
But I think it really helped enlighten in a way like how much there is to know about like environmental health overall.

590
01:04:17,970 --> 01:04:21,240
And like as someone who is like trained in biology,

591
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:25,590
like how much I didn't know and like how can we expect like the public to know so many things about this?

592
01:04:25,590 --> 01:04:31,440
And I think it really just for me to emphasize the importance of like education and public education and just kind of spreading awareness.

593
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:35,969
So I really appreciate it lot. That's great.

594
01:04:35,970 --> 01:04:47,850
Thanks, Kat. I guess that I what I appreciate about this classes like this is the harmony class between all the other classes that I'm taking.

595
01:04:47,860 --> 01:04:54,000
So like between like toxicology and like bio stats and, you know,

596
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:57,879
social determinants of health, like all these things kind of come together in this class.

597
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:01,610
I'm able to, like, be like, oh, okay. So I'm in toxicology.

598
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:05,290
We're talking about oh, we're talking about hierarchies of control or, you know, things like that.

599
01:05:05,290 --> 01:05:09,069
So I appreciate that this class kind of yeah,

600
01:05:09,070 --> 01:05:15,760
it melts everything together and harmonizes it in a very in a nice way that makes my other courses kind of makes sense.

601
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:21,280
So that's great. That's absolutely wonderful to hear.

602
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:25,030
Can I put that in the course description? The Harmony Group.

603
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:28,030
If you want to know what other classes are talking about,

604
01:05:31,780 --> 01:05:39,429
I see myself applying the knowledge I learned this class more so than my other classes just because like I'm not a biles, like I'm a dietitian.

605
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:41,260
I'm not going to be like in everyday life.

606
01:05:41,650 --> 01:05:45,879
And I just think it's interesting because I don't come from a background of environmental science like I'm an HBCU,

607
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:49,210
so this isn't a course that I would normally take. So I'm just like appreciative of this class.

608
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:53,260
I chose this as an elective, so thank you. It's awesome.

609
01:05:53,530 --> 01:05:58,780
Thank you so much. Yeah, I felt like actual exposures like exposure, assessment process.

610
01:05:59,170 --> 01:06:02,740
Where is that happening? Like is that most of the happening in health departments?

611
01:06:03,430 --> 01:06:11,110
Like where in the real world? Yeah. Yeah, no great great questions come in the episode where you just gave two examples.

612
01:06:11,590 --> 01:06:18,700
Um, it absolutely happens in research, right? I think, you know, you probably all can see that just from some of the papers you read or even the, um,

613
01:06:18,740 --> 01:06:23,559
s in the news articles that you brought right of reporting on research studies or something like that,

614
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:29,440
where scientists are specifically asking a, a hypothesis based research question, right.

615
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:34,420
About what happens when someone is exposed to this, you know, what impact does it have on X,

616
01:06:34,420 --> 01:06:38,320
Y or Z and then doing some some analysis of that data collected.

617
01:06:41,170 --> 01:06:49,320
But I'm going to use as an example, to answer your question, the the proposal that you all wrote right on on POS.

618
01:06:49,570 --> 01:06:57,280
Right. And coming up, an exposure assessment methodology and then that what it's called like workshop or something that's happening I think next week.

619
01:06:57,460 --> 01:07:02,050
Right, right here in the in the Great Lakes region. I think it's led by the state of Michigan.

620
01:07:02,050 --> 01:07:12,100
Somehow. I'm not really I don't know who's behind it all. But those are the a lot of the questions to be discussed is,

621
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:20,290
is applying the best ways to apply those exposure assessment, um, approaches in the real world.

622
01:07:20,350 --> 01:07:25,240
Right. That's not someone, you know, doing research to answer a research question.

623
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:32,410
It's, it's from a public health perspective in communities, you know, how do we best protect communities?

624
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:38,880
Right, by being able to, to identify, to monitor, right.

625
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:42,640
To intervene, uh, to follow up and monitor and so forth.

626
01:07:44,380 --> 01:07:50,170
So, so and this is hopefully what will continue is that it's, you know, it's a, it's across the gamut.

627
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:54,280
There's a very important research component, you know, to doing exposure assessment.

628
01:07:54,850 --> 01:07:59,620
Uh, but there's a huge need, right, in terms of,

629
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:06,810
in the real world that you can make an argument or a case that there's not not enough of it at present.

630
01:08:07,340 --> 01:08:11,460
Does that does that answer your question or you, you? Yeah.

631
01:08:12,010 --> 01:08:17,770
Yeah, like that. So it's mostly like government or is it like yeah.

632
01:08:18,390 --> 01:08:23,980
So that is that's the basis of most public health, right?

633
01:08:23,980 --> 01:08:32,620
I mean, I take a step back and say within occupational settings there are very formalized plans like for worker health and

634
01:08:32,620 --> 01:08:40,779
safety within a workplace setting that are while there might be some standards or even regulations in place from a,

635
01:08:40,780 --> 01:08:47,769
from a government, uh, over site perspective that are actually implemented by,

636
01:08:47,770 --> 01:08:51,880
you know, very private industries with their own self-interest of their workers.

637
01:08:52,370 --> 01:08:53,950
Uh, and that's, that's great.

638
01:08:54,730 --> 01:09:03,850
Outside of that workplace, yeah, there's not so much of, you know, some wonderful organization that's come along and says, we just want to do good.

639
01:09:04,510 --> 01:09:12,250
It's usually from, you know, government and taxpayer dollars that are the source of support for that.

640
01:09:12,610 --> 01:09:18,220
And that's that's more broadly to public health, not just, you know, environmental health or or exposure or science.

641
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:23,820
Yes. Just to touch on that a little bit, if you're interested,

642
01:09:23,820 --> 01:09:31,680
like Ann Arbor has the ecology center and they do a ton of like exposure science and particularly like a

643
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:38,160
lot of their most recent stuff is like let employees in like the different exposures that can come across,

644
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:44,070
even not just like in toys or for children. So they're constantly doing stuff like that.

645
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:53,410
They're are more risk assessment. But do you think exposure enhancements are also used in like environmental impact assessments?

646
01:09:53,420 --> 01:09:57,520
And yeah, they they are expected to be.

647
01:09:57,700 --> 01:10:05,620
And so I mean, it's a fair question is, you know, is the quality there and and the resulting environmental impact assessment.

648
01:10:07,470 --> 01:10:11,280
There's a mandated federal law. That's right.

649
01:10:12,270 --> 01:10:18,479
Absolutely. I see your hamlet. I was going to touch on the ecologist thing, actually work at the Ann Arbor location.

650
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:23,400
And we have a lot of we just released a report from the Healthy Stuff Lab that says car

651
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:30,420
seats contain like pufas and fire retardant or fire flame retardant and stuff like that.

652
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:35,670
And so you get a lot of parents like bring up the cooler moral debate, like, do I protect my child from this terrible,

653
01:10:35,670 --> 01:10:40,650
horrible car crash that might happen or do I protect them from the substance exposure?

654
01:10:40,950 --> 01:10:44,399
So I think that that's something that, you know, I notice from the ecologists that are working there,

655
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:48,299
but then also from this class, it brought up the moral and ethical side of exposure science.

656
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:51,950
But I didn't expect to gain. Yeah.

657
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:53,510
Thanks for that comment, Leah.

658
01:10:53,540 --> 01:11:01,280
And, yeah, it's, uh, it's, I mean, it's even becoming more relevant to this, you know, the climate discussion that we just had,

659
01:11:01,430 --> 01:11:06,440
uh, once things become so much more obvious and tangible and ah, ah, more of an acute risk.

660
01:11:06,590 --> 01:11:15,740
Right. That, that kind of like from a, from a marketing, uh, perception perspective, it is really influential.

661
01:11:15,770 --> 01:11:20,719
And if you think back to that video, that short video we watched with Arlene Blume, right, talking about the flame retardants,

662
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:26,000
and she was talking about how these organizations were kind of lined up against her advocacy group.

663
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:32,900
And all you need to do is like show a picture of, you know, a baby being saved from a burning house fire.

664
01:11:32,930 --> 01:11:44,959
Right. And that is going to resonate so much generally, so much more strongly with people than some, you know, 20 years down the road,

665
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:51,470
risk of a chronic health condition from, you know, from exposure to those, uh, flame retardants that are in place.

666
01:11:53,320 --> 01:12:00,160
But there's lots of good examples of that. Challenging dynamic.

667
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:11,120
Oh, curiosity, was that dynamic like your motivation and these debate topics like acute versus product in itself?

668
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:21,200
No, the enemy. The debate topics are chosen as hopefully ones that weren't clear cut, you know, yay or nay,

669
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:26,659
that they really that you end up with people that are kind of waffling or are not people that are waffling

670
01:12:26,660 --> 01:12:33,860
that it that it generates perspectives and really good discussion and insight being shared on it.

671
01:12:34,670 --> 01:12:39,799
But I think your you know, your observation and your question is, is probably pretty accurate.

672
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:47,290
But this is this is one of the. A common theme, right?

673
01:12:47,350 --> 01:12:54,820
This part of the context is weighing something that is an apparent immediate risk with

674
01:12:55,060 --> 01:13:02,080
something that is a further down the road risk and is the result of repeated contact exposure,

675
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:08,810
etc. Which is which is how? Which is good that we've come this far.

676
01:13:09,170 --> 01:13:17,700
We have standards and protections, you know, quality standards in place that generally do a pretty good job of preventing us from,

677
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:26,490
you know, walking out of this room and dying from from some sort of exposure or exposure today that we die from tomorrow with.

678
01:13:26,570 --> 01:13:31,190
And that didn't used to be the case. So we've made great progress as a society.

679
01:13:32,060 --> 01:13:37,280
But what's what's still left as a concern are these ones that are less obvious, right?

680
01:13:37,310 --> 01:13:46,000
Like you all are educated on this stuff and you understand how you know what you what you eat is going to impact you down the road.

681
01:13:46,010 --> 01:13:49,340
But the general public, it's not very tangible.

682
01:13:49,370 --> 01:13:53,750
Right. They don't those connections aren't easily made by people.

683
01:13:54,110 --> 01:14:02,210
And so, yeah, that ends up being the more common concern of, like, our present day kind of environmental exposure.

684
01:14:02,690 --> 01:14:09,010
Concern and consideration is what I eat for breakfast or what I inhale.

685
01:14:09,020 --> 01:14:15,140
You know, this morning probably isn't going to have a huge impact on my health tomorrow or even this week.

686
01:14:15,420 --> 01:14:20,300
I, you know, repeating that over time is where the concern is.

687
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:33,620
A very, very insightful question. Thank you for that. And the other comments, questions, just reflections and general.

688
01:14:36,260 --> 01:14:38,020
I just have a quick question for you.

689
01:14:38,030 --> 01:14:44,030
Like, how do you stay motivated in this field when you feel like and I know this is like the question lots of people ask in public health,

690
01:14:44,030 --> 01:14:49,670
but like, I really I'm just curious about your take because sometimes it feels like, okay, well, we're just like killing ourselves.

691
01:14:51,270 --> 01:14:54,490
Yeah. It's like, how do we like. Yeah.

692
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:59,600
Yeah. Yeah. Great question. So this is, you know, this is just me talking, right?

693
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:07,820
And there's 2 minutes left. I get to be brief here. First off, the motivation, honestly speaking, is all of you.

694
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:16,999
It's really easy. Like, it doesn't take much effort for me to be motivated to come into class, to have a research group, right.

695
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:21,080
To do work, to try to improve things like the motivation.

696
01:15:21,830 --> 01:15:26,420
I don't feel like I'm like just this person who's alone in this struggle.

697
01:15:26,450 --> 01:15:31,400
Right? There's a lot of people that are very passionate and they care deeply about it.

698
01:15:31,410 --> 01:15:36,320
So that's that is easy motivation for me.

699
01:15:36,950 --> 01:15:44,770
Um, in terms of, you know, more broadly speaking, you know, why do we wake up in the morning and say, I want to keep doing that?

700
01:15:45,710 --> 01:15:51,860
It's kind of like it's based on the concerns that you all have shared in a lot of the perspectives in class.

701
01:15:51,890 --> 01:16:01,340
Yes. And the news articles, even what we're shared in these debates is if we weren't doing what we are currently doing,

702
01:16:02,270 --> 01:16:08,180
things would likely be already a lot worse. And going into the future would be a lot worse.

703
01:16:08,270 --> 01:16:15,049
Right. If we're not at least maintaining, you know, what we're able to do from a workplace perspective, right,

704
01:16:15,050 --> 01:16:20,780
from a more of a community health perspective, looking into the future across all of these topics.

705
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:31,790
So, you know, I'm hopeful that the my own personal contribution and what I can motivate or facilitate right in interactions with others is,

706
01:16:31,790 --> 01:16:43,310
is providing, you know, um, knowledge, you know, action, uh, to help at least mitigate the speed at which we are,

707
01:16:43,340 --> 01:16:46,470
you know, heading towards a crisis so that maybe we don't get it.

708
01:16:46,630 --> 01:16:50,900
I love that cartoon of the never ending views on the bomb.

709
01:16:50,900 --> 01:16:56,240
Right. That was awesome. All right, you guys, we are at the end of it.

710
01:16:56,240 --> 01:17:00,560
I want to wish you best of luck to all of you as you finish your semester.

711
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:06,770
I do well on your exam because submitted enjoy a wonderful, wonderful break.

712
01:17:07,430 --> 01:17:10,549
I hope to see many of you in the new year.

713
01:17:10,550 --> 01:17:17,390
And thank you again so much for all of your effort, engagement and of course, the great, uh, holiday.

714
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:23,240
Thank you. Pleasure.

715
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:30,600
Which is a great way to go.

716
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:40,310
Change. I didn't think I was.

717
01:17:41,130 --> 01:17:46,760
I don't know what.

718
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:53,980
God help us. You are. No, but that's.
