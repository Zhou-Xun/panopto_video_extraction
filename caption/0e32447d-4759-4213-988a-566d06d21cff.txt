1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,140
In this video, we will talk about calculating life expectancies.

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:06,101
There are two methods.

3
00:00:06,101 --> 00:00:10,640
One is a life table method and two is a Markov model.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,322
What life tables do are they show population level mortality and

5
00:00:14,322 --> 00:00:16,340
life expectancy by age.

6
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:21,340
And the US Life tables can be found in the National Vital Statistics report.

7
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:25,340
So here's an example of a Life Table from 2008.

8
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,118
It lists ages here as different rows and

9
00:00:28,118 --> 00:00:33,168
it tells us the probability of dying number surviving number of dying,

10
00:00:33,168 --> 00:00:37,490
person years lived, person years and expectation of life.

11
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:40,940
Let's take a look at these individually here.

12
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:47,287
So first we have aged 0-1 and the probability of dying here is

13
00:00:47,287 --> 00:00:53,640
about 6.593 out of 1000 or 0.006593.

14
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,040
So mortality is is low but it's it's kind of high in the first year of life,

15
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,340
all things considered.

16
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:06,340
And it starts with a sample population of 100,000 people.

17
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:10,733
And so if you had a sample population of 100,000 people, they say if

18
00:01:10,733 --> 00:01:15,686
you had that probability of dying then 659 people would have died Between age 0 or

19
00:01:15,686 --> 00:01:18,240
birth and age 1.

20
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,461
If you had a population of 100,000 people, then about 99,425 years of life,

21
00:01:24,461 --> 00:01:31,540
person years of life would have been lived between time 0 and time 1.

22
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:35,710
The total number of person years lived above age x is calculated here Tx.

23
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:39,350
And the last thing is the expectation of life at age x.

24
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:45,788
So this is saying if all the mortality in all the ages were to hold,

25
00:01:45,788 --> 00:01:54,040
then someone born at age 0 here would live 78.1 years.

26
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,031
So let's walk through an example of how this kind of thing gets filled out.

27
00:01:57,031 --> 00:01:58,420
And so here's an example.

28
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,451
You've been going, your project meeting and

29
00:02:00,451 --> 00:02:03,230
your job is to calculate life expectancies for 95 year olds.

30
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,956
You have the life table, what you spell red bull on it and

31
00:02:05,956 --> 00:02:09,240
the toxic substances and red bull turning the paper green.

32
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,440
Now you're only left with the following information.

33
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,981
We want to calculate life expectancy.

34
00:02:14,981 --> 00:02:18,068
So you're left with the following information that looks something like this

35
00:02:18,068 --> 00:02:19,020
probability of dying.

36
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:26,840
And you know the expectation of life at age 100 is 2.3 years.

37
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,162
So we can actually back calculate this and figure out the expectation of life at

38
00:02:31,162 --> 00:02:35,550
age 95 by back calculating knowing how long someone will live at age 100 and

39
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:38,840
their mortality each year between 95 and 100.

40
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,515
So what we're gonna do is add a couple of columns here for person years lived and

41
00:02:42,515 --> 00:02:46,321
counted the person years lived for those who lived, and also for those who died.

42
00:02:46,321 --> 00:02:50,271
So people who die in a year may live partially during that year.

43
00:02:50,271 --> 00:02:53,440
And so their life expectancy would count for part of a year.

44
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,631
So let's go through this here.

45
00:02:54,631 --> 00:02:58,411
If someone is age 99 and they live to age 100,

46
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:03,452
we think their life expectancy would be one year from 99 to 100

47
00:03:03,452 --> 00:03:09,240
plus the 2.3 years they would live if they were 100 and older.

48
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,181
Now, someone who died is going to live there, not going to get zero life years.

49
00:03:13,181 --> 00:03:15,041
Maybe they die about halfway through the year.

50
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:21,440
So we'll give them about half a year of life expectancy if they die.

51
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,275
So the question is, what's the overall expected life expectancy for

52
00:03:25,275 --> 00:03:26,390
someone aged 99?

53
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:30,210
Well here we're saying, there's about a 30% chance they'll die and

54
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,520
a 70 chance they will live to 100.

55
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:37,225
So we take 70 chance that they'll live to 100 times the 3.3

56
00:03:37,225 --> 00:03:42,240
life years they'll live or they'll get from age 99 and above.

57
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:47,833
And then we add that to the 30 who will die the 0.3 times the 0.5

58
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:53,440
life years they would live if they died between 99 and 100.

59
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,855
And that gives us an average of 2.4 life years lived.

60
00:03:57,855 --> 00:04:01,771
And we can do an iterative process and go back.

61
00:04:01,771 --> 00:04:06,487
So let's walk through this what it would look like for someone aged 98 while

62
00:04:06,487 --> 00:04:11,221
someone age 98 who lives to 99 would live that year between 98 and 99.

63
00:04:11,221 --> 00:04:15,424
That's one life here plus an additional 2.4 years on average,

64
00:04:15,424 --> 00:04:18,640
which someone who turns 99 would live.

65
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,344
So I'd be 3.4 life years that they would live.

66
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:25,394
NowiIf someone is unfortunate enough to die between age 98 and

67
00:04:25,394 --> 00:04:29,760
99, we think they live for about half a year so they get a half year.

68
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:35,317
And so then the average life expectancy for someone aged 98 is gonna be 72%

69
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:40,536
chance they don't die times 3.4 life years they'd get plus the 28%

70
00:04:40,536 --> 00:04:45,620
chance that person would die times the half of life here they would get.

71
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:50,620
So we can go back and forth here and go all the way back to age 95.

72
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:55,067
And we can calculate that someone aged 95 has

73
00:04:55,067 --> 00:05:00,340
average life expectancy of three 0.2 years.

74
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:05,216
And that's how the CDC calculates those life tables is they figure out

75
00:05:05,216 --> 00:05:09,927
what's the mortality in each age by looking at population death and

76
00:05:09,927 --> 00:05:12,251
population census statistics.

77
00:05:12,251 --> 00:05:14,970
And figure out what's the chance that someone dies between a certain age?

78
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:18,887
And then they fill out this table in this manner to calculate what is life

79
00:05:18,887 --> 00:05:20,940
expectancy at any particular age.

80
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,761
These life expectancies are useful.

81
00:05:22,761 --> 00:05:28,740
So let's say we had an intervention that would reduce the risk of dying at age 95.

82
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,896
Where we can figure out if someone doesn't die at age 95 what is their

83
00:05:31,896 --> 00:05:32,770
life expectancy?

84
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:41,440
So for every person saved from death at age 95 we're adding about 3.2 life years.

85
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,831
Now we can walk through a Markov Model Example.

86
00:05:43,831 --> 00:05:48,136
So let's figure out life expectancy with a disease not so

87
00:05:48,136 --> 00:05:53,640
horrible disease where you have a 10% chance of dying each year.

88
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,016
And the question then, is what fraction of people with not so

89
00:05:56,016 --> 00:05:57,841
horrible disease will be alive in 10 years?

90
00:05:57,841 --> 00:06:02,140
And what's the life expectancy for someone with not so horrible disease?

91
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,894
So we can build a Markov model here, we'll build a very simple Markov model

92
00:06:05,894 --> 00:06:09,590
with two health states alive and dead, and in any particular year you have

93
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:13,940
a 10% chance of dying if you have not so horrible disease.

94
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,268
So here we can build the Markov model, the Markov model here,

95
00:06:17,268 --> 00:06:18,807
each row represents a year.

96
00:06:18,807 --> 00:06:21,281
And the columns representing health states alive and dead.

97
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:25,784
And you can see after one year, 10% have died and

98
00:06:25,784 --> 00:06:33,031
90% are still alive in year two, 10% of the 90 which is 9% overall died.

99
00:06:33,031 --> 00:06:39,440
So now we're left with after two years, 19% dead, 81% alive and so forth.

100
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,345
So how do we calculate life expectancies with these market models

101
00:06:44,345 --> 00:06:49,069
when we go out of a sufficient period of time to figure out how and

102
00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:52,670
give people one year of life if they're alive.

103
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:56,271
And if you want to, you can give half a year to those who die in that particular

104
00:06:56,271 --> 00:06:58,040
year, then we add up the life years.

105
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,841
So here we'll just do a simple example.

106
00:06:59,841 --> 00:07:02,845
We won't add in a half a year of life for the people who died, but

107
00:07:02,845 --> 00:07:04,161
just do something simple.

108
00:07:04,161 --> 00:07:10,590
So here at time zero we have 100% is alive, so we'll give them one life here.

109
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,671
Time 1, 90% alive.

110
00:07:12,671 --> 00:07:18,191
So on average where the people in this population would be living 0.9 life years

111
00:07:18,191 --> 00:07:24,340
and we go down the line here until year 10, 35% of the population is still alive.

112
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:29,162
And so we get a population average of .35 life years lived

113
00:07:29,162 --> 00:07:31,880
in that population at year 10.

114
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:37,401
So if we want to add up the total life years lived in here adding it from time

115
00:07:37,401 --> 00:07:42,950
0 to 10, we get 6.87 life years lived over this this time period.

116
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:46,441
The life expectancy is 6.87 or so.

117
00:07:46,441 --> 00:07:52,540
So this is one way we can calculate life expectancy using a Markov model.

118
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,914
And so those are some methods for calculating life expectancy,

119
00:07:55,914 --> 00:07:59,013
which are useful in cost effectiveness analysis.
