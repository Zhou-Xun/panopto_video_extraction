1
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:10,430
So the idea of having a central message,
isn't just about text.

2
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:12,926
It also applies to data graphics.

3
00:00:12,926 --> 00:00:16,951
Remember, we've always asked this question
of why should your audience care,

4
00:00:16,951 --> 00:00:19,389
when thinking about
finding a central message.

5
00:00:19,389 --> 00:00:22,330
You have the same question when
you're trying to present data.

6
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:25,970
Why should your audience
care about these data?

7
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:29,290
What should they remember
about these data?

8
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:33,390
There are many ways to represent the same
data, many different kinds of formats and

9
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:38,990
designs, that can represent
the same data points,.

10
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:43,601
Choosing among these formats,
ought to be done based upon the exact same

11
00:00:43,601 --> 00:00:47,396
factors ,that we've been talking about for
any message.

12
00:00:47,396 --> 00:00:48,750
Who's your audience?

13
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,890
Who are you trying to reach?

14
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,840
What is the context?

15
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,860
Where are they going to be
interacting with this data graphic?

16
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,560
And what is your goal?

17
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:03,980
What do you want them to get
from looking at this graphic?

18
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:08,173
What's the takeaway, what's the big point?

19
00:01:08,173 --> 00:01:10,700
So, here's an example.

20
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,127
This is one simple data point.

21
00:01:12,127 --> 00:01:17,565
At 18 months, whatever this is
that I'm representing here,

22
00:01:17,565 --> 00:01:20,393
was something like 36 or 37.

23
00:01:20,393 --> 00:01:22,960
But is that good or bad?

24
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,140
I don't know, because I have no other
information other than the fact that

25
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,330
this measurement was 36.

26
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:36,750
But we often don't just give people one
data point, we give them more, right?

27
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,000
So let's say there was measurements
at 12 months, and at 18 months.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,420
Now what I see is that
the 18 month measurement,

29
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:47,170
was a lot higher than the 12
month measurement was.

30
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:51,640
So I've already gotten one message,
it's higher.

31
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,710
I don't necessarily know
whether it's good or bad.

32
00:01:54,710 --> 00:02:00,980
And so, without any more context, I might
not actually remember this graphic.

33
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:04,030
I might not be able to use this graphic.

34
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:07,460
Notice what happens if I put one
more piece of information, however,

35
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,810
into this graphic.

36
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:12,210
Let's say there's some maximal level.

37
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:18,000
Well now, I start to recognize
that the 18 month measurement,

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,880
is approaching that maximum level.

39
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,160
The 12 month wasn't.

40
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,600
I might have concern about that.

41
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:33,456
I'm noticing a trend,
notice the words I'm using, approaching,

42
00:02:33,456 --> 00:02:39,330
I'm Interpreting from the trend between
that twelfth and eighteenth month data.

43
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,455
The idea of the values are going up.

44
00:02:42,455 --> 00:02:45,939
I still may not know whether
this is good or bad, but

45
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:50,573
I'm getting a lot more information
consciously from the context.

46
00:02:50,573 --> 00:02:56,693
The comparison between those two data
points, and that reference point.

47
00:02:56,693 --> 00:03:00,710
Now, I've been talking about this
like there's a trend, right?

48
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:03,090
The values are going up.

49
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:06,200
Except, maybe they aren't.

50
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,870
So here's the same two points.

51
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,550
That 12 month and

52
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:16,770
18 month point put into a trend of data,
that goes back to the zero point.

53
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:21,040
What you see here in this graphic on
the right, is that In fact, over time,

54
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,250
the values have been going down, and only
ticked back up in that last little bit.

55
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:32,090
And put into that larger context,
you might or might not think the same

56
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:37,750
thing about the difference, between that
12-month point and the 18-month point.

57
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:41,000
Again I'm not saying one is right or
wrong here, I'm just saying

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,390
notice that just simply by adding a little
bit more contextual information, or

59
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,780
historical data.

60
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:53,900
I'm actually changing the way you
interpret that 18 months observation.

61
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,300
So, I'll let' me make concrete,

62
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,700
in the context that actually I've
been studying in my own research.

63
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,920
So when we're communicating to patients,

64
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,800
laboratory test results,
we have the same problems.

65
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:10,650
So here's a graphic that shows a variety
of hemoglobin A1c test results.

66
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:16,270
Now hemoglobin A1c is a test that's
often done on people with diabetes.

67
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:21,294
To measure how well they're managing
their blood glucose, their blood sugars.

68
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:24,677
Which is a measure that
helps you to know how much,

69
00:04:24,677 --> 00:04:30,320
their diabetes might be affecting
their future health risks.

70
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,940
So what do you see in this graphic?

71
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:39,730
Well, what I see is a lot of up and
down, a lot of variance.

72
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:45,400
And so the center message of this
graphic is that the data varied.

73
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,780
It goes up and down.

74
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:51,950
Now, let me compare this
graphic to a few other ones.

75
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:52,940
And I wanna be clear here.

76
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,410
I'm not gonna change the data.

77
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:59,880
I'm just gonna change the format,
the way it's represented.

78
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,620
So one thing I'm gonna do here,
is to show you this one.

79
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,500
Is this the same data?

80
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,320
It actually is the same data, but
boy, it doesn't look the same.

81
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,660
Here's another one.

82
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:17,160
Same It is the same data, but again,
it doesn't look the same, why?

83
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,920
Well, let's look at
the central messages here.

84
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,960
Right, the central message of
the graphic on the left is variability,

85
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,970
it goes up and down.

86
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:30,440
The central message on the one at
the top right, is that it's stable.

87
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,980
It's in the middle of the graphic,

88
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:38,020
and it doesn't move much compared to the
way in which we've laid out the graphic.

89
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:42,490
The one at the bottom, I think the central
message here is that it's high, right?

90
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:47,101
The scale gives me an impression
that the values are high.

91
00:05:47,101 --> 00:05:49,588
Again, I haven't change the data here,

92
00:05:49,588 --> 00:05:52,581
I'm just changing
the structure of the graphic.

93
00:05:52,581 --> 00:05:58,120
And I'm taking away different
central messages because of that.

94
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,850
What did I do?

95
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:05,840
Well, the one on the left one is scaled
to this particular patient's data.

96
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,164
The one on the top right,

97
00:06:07,164 --> 00:06:11,155
is scaled to the variations that
are commonly observed in the population.

98
00:06:11,155 --> 00:06:15,955
We see people regularly with
values up around 9 or 10,

99
00:06:15,955 --> 00:06:19,060
we see people down around to 4 or 5.

100
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:22,630
And so the data are represented compared
to the population distribution.

101
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:27,720
The one on the bottom is just scaled
down to 0, now it happens to be in

102
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:33,630
this context, you don't tend to see,
people don't have 0, A, 1, C.

103
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:36,950
So that may or may not be an appropriate
way of scaling it, but for

104
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,880
many measurements scaling down to zero,

105
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,980
is commonly the way we think about
how a graphic ought to be scaled.

106
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:50,190
Notice what I'm doing here, I'm making
a choice about which reference scale,

107
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:56,650
to use that changes the central message,
that I take away from the data.

108
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:00,250
So is these values good or bad?

109
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,270
If this is all I give you,
you don't really know,

110
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:07,090
because you don't have a clear
reference point as to what is good.

111
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:10,020
I can do one other thing though,
which is what's commonly done

112
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:14,710
in test results communications,
which is to give you a reference standard.

113
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,590
A Standard range.

114
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:22,280
Just adding that single reference point,
instantly makes me think,

115
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,280
man, my values are too high.

116
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,510
Again, I haven't changed the graphic here.

117
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:31,410
I've just given you a reference point.

118
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:36,961
Notice that the choice of the reference
point though, is really important.

119
00:07:36,961 --> 00:07:39,629
In this case,
I gave you the standard range,

120
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:43,950
which is what applies to people
who do not have diabetes.

121
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:47,500
But, let's say you've
already been diagnosed.

122
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,020
You know that that standard
range doesn't apply to you.

123
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:55,090
You've been diagnosed with diabetes,
so now let me change it.

124
00:07:55,090 --> 00:08:00,880
Here is let's say a target range for
patients with type two diabetes.

125
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,460
What's the central
message of this graphic?

126
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:06,360
I don't know about you, but
what I get is I'm doing great.

127
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,180
All my values are right
in the target range.

128
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:16,568
Notice how differently that feels,
compared to the graphic we saw just before

129
00:08:16,568 --> 00:08:21,870
The point here is simple,
visual context matters.

130
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:25,400
Many different things
determine the central message,

131
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,320
that we see in a data graphic.

132
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,420
Yes, the data points also
are a critical point.

133
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:35,890
They're the actual information, that
are being presented in that data graphic.

134
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:40,000
But the central message is also
determined by comparison data.

135
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,910
That historical data, or not.

136
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:45,570
The access scale that we choose to use.

137
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,680
And there's not one right answer.

138
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,990
There are many different access scales,
that might be considered appropriate.

139
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,690
And reference standards.

140
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:57,210
What reference points do
we want people comparing,

141
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:03,250
the data that are showing to, in order to
get the message that we want to give them.

142
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,730
There's no single answer for
what is best here.

143
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:11,860
It's gonna have to depend on a situation,
and yes, I know some of you are thinking,

144
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:15,280
whoa, you're manipulating the data here.

145
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,680
Yeah, in one sense, I am.

146
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,460
There's an old book, How to Lie with
Statistics, from 1953 that talks about

147
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:26,030
exactly what I'm talking about here,
it still applies today.

148
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:30,960
But, the honest truth is
there is no such thing as

149
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:36,870
a neutral data graphic,
it doesn't exist, it can't exist.

150
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:41,730
It can't exist because we always
have to make design choices about

151
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:46,514
reference standards, or
axis scaling, or comparison points.

152
00:09:46,514 --> 00:09:51,619
And these choices determine
the central takeaway message,

153
00:09:51,619 --> 00:09:58,431
that our audience is going to interpret
from the data graphics that we give them.

154
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:05,544
The best thing that you can do, is simply
to be intentional know before you start.

155
00:10:05,544 --> 00:10:09,747
What is that one central message that
you want your audience to get from your

156
00:10:09,747 --> 00:10:10,840
graphic?

157
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:15,050
Not just about presenting the data,
you're giving people a message and

158
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:17,570
you better know what that message is.

159
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:19,730
And then make those choices.

160
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:22,990
Design the graphic to
highlight that message.

161
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:29,080
Maximize the chance that
the audience gets what you intended,

162
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,620
when you designed that graphic.

163
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:34,190
That's when you can use
the data graphic process,

164
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:37,637
the communication to achieve
your communication goals.
