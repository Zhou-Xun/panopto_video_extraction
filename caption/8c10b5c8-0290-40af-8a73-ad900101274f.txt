00:00:04,243 --> 00:00:10,243
One tool I have here on the Windows computers in SPH classrooms.

2
00:00:10,243 --> 00:00:15,243
Is this screen is a screen that I can write on.

3
00:00:15,243 --> 00:00:31,243
I have a little pen here, it's a little tangled up. I have a pen device here by the computer that is a stylus to use on this computer screen.

4
00:00:31,243 --> 00:00:37,243
It's currently plugged in, but I can disconnect that.

5
00:00:37,243 --> 00:00:48,243
And if I was using PowerPoint. I'm using Google Slides today so it's not a good example because Google Slides does not have an annotation/draw tool.

6
00:00:48,243 --> 00:00:57,243
If I were using PowerPoint that does have a pen tool integrated, I could write on this screen.

7
00:00:57,243 --> 00:01:01,243
If you.

8
00:01:01,243 --> 00:01:59,164
Yeah, so any program that has an annotation tool I'm going to jump ahead a little bit,

9
00:01:08,243 --> 00:01:15,243
because I set up a Jamboard example.

10
00:01:15,243 --> 00:01:26,243
As an alternative, so if you're a Google Slides user, Jamboard could potentially be an option to get those annotation features.

11
00:01:26,243 --> 00:01:37,243
One thing I want to notice is the position of this screen, isn't that conducive for drawing on. But another nice feature of these screens if they have a latch on the back.

12
00:01:37,243 --> 00:01:44,243
It's going to let me just lifted and lay the screen down a little flatter so that I can write a little easier.

13
00:01:44,243 --> 00:01:56,243
So, this is going to mess up my webcam position for those viewing online, but it shouldn't make my writing a little easier.

14
00:01:56,243 --> 00:01:59,164
So.

15
00:02:01,059 --> 00:02:10,059
So just to reiterate a little bit of what you can do in Jamboard. We typically talk about Jamboard in a collaborative sense, here's a link to the Jamboard,

16
00:02:10,059 --> 00:02:17,059
everyone drop a sticky note about this, a brainstorm, or almost like a flip chart type activity.

17
00:02:17,059 --> 00:02:27,059
But this is a Jamboard that's only for me. I haven't shared it with anyone but it allows me to utilize the draw tools

18
00:02:27,059 --> 00:02:35,059
that I might need if I was using a whiteboard.

19
00:02:35,059 --> 00:02:43,059
And then, so this text I set up in advance, using the text tool and Jamboard.

20
00:02:43,059 --> 00:02:48,059
So that I didn't have to hand write everything out.

21
00:02:48,059 --> 00:03:08,059
And then I can also in Jamboard, it's a little hard to see on the screen in the room, but Jamboard allows you to change the background of the page to a dark, a lined paper, a graph paper, or you could even upload a specific image.

22
00:03:08,059 --> 00:03:17,059
So maybe we need to

23
00:03:17,059 --> 00:03:23,059
work with points on a graph,

24
00:03:23,059 --> 00:03:29,059
and demonstrate something that way.

25
00:03:29,059 --> 00:03:31,059
So this is one option.

26
00:03:31,059 --> 00:03:41,782
And then one thing I did for myself was I put that jam board link in my slides, kind of trying to set myself up for a seamless transition.
