1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,950
For sure. Yeah. Okay. So. Here.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:09,550
You can see this view. I'm just going to be like a legend, but just fun.

3
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:15,690
All right, let me get my papers out.

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,360
I was just having a really hard time getting out of the house this morning.

5
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:27,190
I'm not sure what's going on, but it's one of those things where it's like, isn't seasonal affective disorder more that, like, we should be?

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,780
I do. But after that, I was like, Oh, that's a good question.

7
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:39,180
I think that yeah, because I know for me, if it's not later out, oh, it's hard.

8
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:49,319
It's hard times, you know, or to recovery. And I just like I just sat there and stared at my client because we may be going somewhere right after.

9
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,560
And I was like, So what temperatures are going to run down?

10
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:59,610
And I knew I was going to be of their own choice. I just kind of like live with that choice.

11
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:04,620
I guess it was enough. I can just go home and get appropriate shoes or whatever it is.

12
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:08,910
I messed up. So I my stuff.

13
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:17,940
So. Yeah. Okay, everybody, we're going to get started.

14
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:25,130
And then I have a couple of announcements, but I'm going to save them until later in case more people show up because we want everybody to hear.

15
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,100
All right. So, Sarah, go for it. All right.

16
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,700
So good morning, everyone. Ready to serve us? He broke down.

17
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:39,180
She hers. I'm so. I'm presenting on my medical study that looks at RSV infection and intergenerational trauma.

18
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,459
Also, I only have 10 minutes. I'm going to fast, but hopefully, hopefully you'll understand what I'm saying.

19
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,410
So why just this topic?

20
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:53,290
So I currently work in Dr. Martin's lab, so we study RSV and then I also have a long standing passion in terms of health disparities.

21
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:55,500
So let's combine those forces.

22
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:02,670
So I wanted to give of course the background on RSV as well as intergenerational trauma, and then we'll dive into the specific study design itself.

23
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:11,579
So respiratory syncytial virus is what RSV stands for and it's a common cause of respiratory infections around the world and it can affect infants,

24
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,840
adults and the elderly, but it predominantly affects infants and the elderly.

25
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:22,200
And in fact in the US, the main cause of respiratory hospitalizations for infants is RSV.

26
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:27,779
There's currently no vaccine there. Well, there's one in development, but it has not yet been authorized.

27
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,950
So for now what we have our preventative medications, there are basically two forms.

28
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:38,759
One, that's an IV immunoglobulin and one that is an intramuscular injection of a monoclonal antibody.

29
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:44,970
So both of them are pretty passive immunity. So because of that, it's helpful to know how we can prevent RSV infection in the first place,

30
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,870
especially given that infants are more likely to have that severe infection.

31
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:58,909
So in terms of the intergenerational trauma component, I think many of us are becoming increasingly familiar as the world of epigenetics expands about

32
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:04,160
how exposures can be transmitted intergenerationally as this infographic is trying to portray.

33
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:08,269
And exposure from the grandmother can be passed down to mother as well as daughter.

34
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:11,569
So you can have the genetic code remain the same, right?

35
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:16,100
But the expression of that genetic code is what's modified. In this case, they were showing smoking.

36
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:25,190
But we know from research as well as anecdotally that exposure is like famine and war and genocide can also affect people intergenerationally.

37
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:33,350
So why did I choose this based population? I actually haven't told you, but what it is, is the Alaska Native population in the US.

38
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:41,239
But more broadly, the research does show that severe RSV infection disproportionately affects Indigenous infants across the world.

39
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,809
So this can be in the US, Australia, Canada, Greenland.

40
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:46,670
I think there's also one in Russia.

41
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:53,570
So as these studies, although limited, are coming out, it's consistently showing that Indigenous infants are at higher risk,

42
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:59,840
as we know, because of the historical roots of health inequities, genocide, white settler colonialism, white supremacy, etc.

43
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:07,440
And then I have details, but like 10 minutes and then in terms of the mortality rate, so right.

44
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:12,650
An infant can get the infection, but do they die of various things, including RSV infection?

45
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:19,519
Unfortunately, yes. And the graph on the left I was putting in to show that in different countries you have indigenous

46
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:23,900
populations whose infant mortality rates are consistently higher than the general population.

47
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:26,269
Then the graph on the right hand side,

48
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:35,239
I think it shows this one is the red bar is the general population of Canada and the purple bar is for a specific region,

49
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:40,700
a province in Canada that has a strong presence of indigenous individuals and the purple bar

50
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:45,079
is showing their infant mortality rate and this one is showing from age 0 to 11 months.

51
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:51,650
So not just overall, but at every time point for some populations, the infant mortality rate of indigenous infants is higher.

52
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:58,100
So this sucks. We really want this obviously to be produced and we know it's not unique to Indigenous populations,

53
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:02,569
it's also other marginalized populations whenever we get the chance.

54
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:05,149
I think in a population pyramid, I love demography.

55
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:15,470
And so for those who aren't familiar on the left is showing male the percent of the population, on the right is female and the bars are Alaska native.

56
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:23,480
And then the gray line that kind of goes alongside is the US population and the vertical axis is age.

57
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,680
So I like to show these because it's helpful to understand our population's age distribution.

58
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:32,750
So you can see the US general population is relatively older than the Alaska Native.

59
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:38,899
So that means one that there are more infants coming into the world in this population at this current time as well as in the future.

60
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,830
The next couple of decades we know that there will be more infants perhaps in this population.

61
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:47,180
So that's another reason, aside from ethics, why it's important to study this.

62
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:55,940
So my conceptual model here for Dags, so the exposure to intergenerational trauma at the top is essentially the exposure I

63
00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:00,860
would like to study and the outcome of interest is hospitalization because of severe RSV.

64
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:07,699
I'm going to skip to premature birth here. We know that premature birth leads to incomplete airway development in children,

65
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,600
which puts them at higher risk for getting a severe infection and then getting hospitalized.

66
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,280
We also know that Alaska Native, as well as other ethnic and racial and marginalized groups,

67
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:20,600
have higher rates of exposure to environmental hazards because of environmental racism.

68
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,940
Presumably and anecdotally,

69
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:29,210
we believe that Alaska Native would have individuals would have a higher likelihood of being exposed to intergenerational trauma.

70
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,780
And so the question is like, let's do this, let's find out.

71
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:37,130
We also have some other things in there. But, you know, the sake of keeping the data relatively simple.

72
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:44,210
So in terms of the study itself, two things. The first one is basically trying to understand, like, what is the landscape?

73
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:49,250
Does intergenerational trauma have an effect on mothers in Alaska native populations

74
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:52,700
and see if there's any association with RSV severity in their children?

75
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:54,649
So that leads to the first hypothesis,

76
00:06:54,650 --> 00:07:02,510
which is we think might be more than 50% of Alaska Native Mothers will report some degree of intergenerational trauma.

77
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:05,510
It's tragic, but it's likely given the historical roots of this.

78
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,820
And the second aim is saying, okay, so if there is some difference, is there a differential association?

79
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:16,340
So if mothers have a higher self-reported perception of intergenerational trauma,

80
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:20,710
will their children be more likely to have severe RSV infection hypothesis?

81
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,930
As we think so. Overall study design, so close cohort.

82
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:29,650
We would love to have people, but like in and out, in and out, that'll be hard.

83
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:33,790
So we're going to do a close cohort. Our goal is to enroll a thousand mother infant pairs.

84
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,850
We would like to do because we're making our own study, we'll do a prospective one.

85
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:43,090
So that means I can get nasal pharyngeal specimens as well as do in real time interviews.

86
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:48,850
And then if an infant is hospitalized, getting a medical record, obstruction on the right hand side,

87
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:51,310
that's looking at the eligibility for both mothers and infants,

88
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:56,340
focusing on the mothers predominantly in terms of are they self-reported in terms of Alaska Native?

89
00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:03,280
Do they have a young child at the age of enrollment? And are they able to attend this annual qualitative data collection, which are interviews?

90
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:09,820
Our hope is to provide a travel voucher because as I will show shortly, Alaska is huge and it's kind of hard to get to places.

91
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,460
And then in terms of the infants, we want them to be infants as well as having no co-morbidities so that we can

92
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:21,489
reduce the likelihood of confounding mixed methods for the when quantitative.

93
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:26,889
Of course, we're going to have that baseline survey looking at demographics, but more importantly like the RSV information.

94
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:34,540
So the molecular testing be able to do next generation sequencing and then also having those associated like self-reported interviews and things.

95
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:41,110
That being said, qualitative data is super important because we don't have a molecular marker for intergenerational trauma at this point,

96
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:41,740
to my knowledge.

97
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:50,109
So we would like to talk with these mothers and understand what their perception of intergenerational trauma is, as well as use validated.

98
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:56,680
Intergenerational trauma assessments. Fitness goals do once a year during our season, as I mentioned.

99
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:00,730
So I also love storing maps when I can because it helps us understand where things are.

100
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:10,119
This is a population density map of Alaska is huge. And that being said, I wanted to focus on locations and hospitals that are Indian Health Service,

101
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:16,630
IHS funded and tribally managed in part to create that strong community based participatory research approach.

102
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:24,759
I selected these six cities in part because they have a strong indigenous Alaska Native population presence as well as they are all over the state.

103
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:32,620
So hopefully thank you. We will not be restricted to just like Anchorage or something of course, because we're talking about intergenerational trauma.

104
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:40,959
We do want to establish trust with our participants, but also with our communities and like obviously but maybe not obviously not retraumatizing them.

105
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,200
Like if someone comes to me whole and I break them down for the sake of research,

106
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,500
it is unethical for me to send them on their way without building them back up.

107
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:52,960
So making sure that we have trained and licensed specialists both in trauma but also in the specific community,

108
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:58,030
as well as making sure that we have external referrals and additional resources for them and then making sure that we

109
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:03,849
also follow up because we know things happen and so making sure that we do like a phone call or some kind of follow up.

110
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:08,400
One month after the interviews each year, data management, you know,

111
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:13,140
the spiel we love our so we're going to do a descriptive analysis first and then

112
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:18,700
regression if we have that information shouldn't take long between an hour and 11 months.

113
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:27,700
In my case, it's five years. So here one is to establish trust, recruit participants year two through three.

114
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:32,499
RSV season is just like flu season. So during the winter, collecting these a fringe specimens,

115
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,520
medical record information and doing those interviews and then when it's warm, that's what we do.

116
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:43,090
The data clear out and prepare for the next season. Last year is an abbreviated data collection, but then we'll be able to do study close up.

117
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:48,939
It's not perfect. I love this study, but it's not perfect. So one question is, are four seasons enough?

118
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:55,510
We don't know it probably. But given how COVID has changed the landscape of infectious disease and public health, maybe not.

119
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,590
We think we'll be using the most appropriate assessments for intergenerational trauma.

120
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:04,510
But once again, maybe not in this specific population. We might need to like validate a new one or something.

121
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:11,230
And then of course, because it's a huge state and we're doing this in winter, the challenges of geographic location and the possibility of attrition.

122
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:16,600
Young kids are super cute, but they take a lot of time. And so even if someone is interested, they might not be able to come back yet.

123
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:22,690
But like I said, I love the study, so there are some strengths. It is the first study, if it's hypothetical right now,

124
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:28,660
is the first study that combines molecular techniques and intergenerational trauma for this disease in this population.

125
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:36,069
Also, the emphasis on CPR, they use my last slide and then also sorry, I don't mean to stop.

126
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:39,490
Oh, they're perfect. So it's actually really wonderful.

127
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:44,200
And then also having that multiple season follow up, we're not just doing one seasonal RSV transmission.

128
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:53,670
And with that, thank you so much. That's all. Any pressure, and it's okay if you don't have anything.

129
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:59,800
Oh, okay. You mentioned my name that uses the new PR approach.

130
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:02,890
Could you talk a little bit more about, like, what that looks like? I would like to.

131
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:06,880
Yes, thank you. I think it's like, what do I put on the slides? But also making sure I'm in that ten minute time limit.

132
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:13,329
So the tentative plan right now is to partner like first approach tribal elders and leaders of

133
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:19,629
community hospitals and clinics within IHS and then from there going next to the community.

134
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:22,030
But first thing like, is this something you even want to do?

135
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:28,510
Because if if the tribal elders and leaders are like, this is not something we think our community would be interested in respecting that.

136
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:33,520
And then that that's when I have more in my paper.

137
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:36,400
But that was the main impetus that first of going to approach,

138
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:42,700
see if that's even possible and then dive in and use their guidance and understanding of the specific community.

139
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:50,380
Before we just. So I think, you know, probably the cultural competency.

140
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,620
A measure. A way to measure? Yes.

141
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:00,959
So I was lucky that up because I have no background in intergenerational trauma,

142
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,300
which is why I use this topic, because I was like, let's learn about it.

143
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:11,310
So from my understanding, in some especially for cultural competency or cultural relativism and intergenerational trauma,

144
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,549
I've seen in the literature getting focus groups.

145
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:21,690
So getting like 50 people from that specific community and asking questions or having some kind of questionnaire already established,

146
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:27,600
like using one that's already validated and then adapting it to that community based on their feedback from that focus group.

147
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:34,210
So that would probably be the approach at this point, but I would be happy to know if anyone else has an experience, what that would look like.

148
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:41,550
So. He has.

149
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:52,060
Great question. Logistics. We figured if the mothers are coming in to get test, if they're coming in to get interviewed,

150
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:57,580
then that's a perfect time that we can also test the kids and vice versa if they're coming into the clinic because their kids are sick.

151
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:03,100
We can conduct that interview either then or if it's not convenient, be able to follow up a little closer.

152
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,879
Basically trying to reduce the burden on the participants because yeah,

153
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,260
we'd love to do it when it's warm, but like, it's probably not as practical as we'd like it to be.

154
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:19,160
Thank you. Is there anything you want to do it with existing?

155
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,000
Yeah, that's that's a really good question.

156
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,979
I remember thinking about that when I was trying to design this where I was like, would it be worth enrolling like pregnant women,

157
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:38,410
like second try second and third trimester and then starting it once their infants are born?

158
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,089
I think that's definitely possible.

159
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:47,569
But I think then in my head it was like in terms of antenatal care, how would we partner with communities and the resources available to ensure?

160
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:50,140
Because I feel like ethically I would definitely want to have antenatal care.

161
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:59,110
And so at this point it was like if they're already here, let's just use that because practicality of course this role.

162
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:06,520
But I think next steps would be super helpful to have that in the next phase of it because it would be helpful to capture them earlier,

163
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:10,930
especially given that most infants who have a severe RSV infections typically within like the first six months.

164
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:20,810
You're also awake right now. Thank you. I got a couple for you.

165
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:24,660
Yes. Okay. So we only have a minute and 45 seconds. So you may not get all of them, but.

166
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:29,760
Okay. So there was I don't think there was an ero slam.

167
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:34,000
Alaska needed to be turned over. Yes. Is there no.

168
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,790
Is there no association there? Oh, I so I think there is.

169
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:43,720
Does it operate through prenatal care? That's the assumption right now.

170
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:47,740
I do look too deeply into the literature specific to this population, because absolutely,

171
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:53,240
like a lot of ethnic and racialized racial groups that have suffered like structural inequities often have premature.

172
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:57,259
But I didn't look too deeply. So I can update that because I agree.

173
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:00,879
It was like we definitely know the access is going to be compromised.

174
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,480
But in terms of the premature. So that's that's why I didn't put it yet. Okay. But yeah.

175
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:13,330
Yeah, I was curious to get that. And then do you think that there will be enough variation in intergenerational trauma in your sample?

176
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:21,009
I think you're talking about it as like, oh, like, do I want to do integrate like integrate like between Alaska Native and like white people?

177
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:25,600
Or do I want to look within the group? I think that was a question and that was helpful for me to understand.

178
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:33,250
I don't know. And that's part of why we want to do it, because maybe there is especially given like the physical locations,

179
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:40,420
perhaps like Alaska Native populations that are very far north have like sufficient variability compared to those in Anchorage.

180
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:47,590
I just don't know. And so it seemed like this would be a good starting point. Yeah, the qualitative piece would probably help you like get at that.

181
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:53,350
And it probably depends on how you ask the questions to like if they're huge.

182
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:57,490
And like I'm thinking about some of the existing intergenerational trauma scales.

183
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:05,350
I don't think you'd probably get a lot of variation because the experiences they're capturing were like almost universal.

184
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:13,080
And so the stuff is high anyway.

185
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:16,389
Okay, I'll add the other questions in your in your paper.

186
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:19,360
But I, I was and I'll just leave it with you. Oh, please. Yes.

187
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:25,780
I mean, like, have you thought about looking at native populations in Michigan as a comparison?

188
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:30,700
Yes. In theory, in practicality, I was like, this needs to be slightly feasible and we don't have any money.

189
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:35,890
But no, that would be awesome. I think it'd be super helpful to have that comparison, so I'll just make a no comment.

190
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:56,950
Thank you, everybody. Okay. Thank you for your. Hold on.

191
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:06,410
You can't stop looking at the screen, everybody. I can't cover it up.

192
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:19,090
Okay. No, no, no.

193
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:24,150
I don't want to do that. It's great.

194
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,530
Okay. And also my own.

195
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:43,430
Oh, okay. Good idea. Clearly can't work there.

196
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:48,470
So, everyone, my name is Bella. I know there are a lot of words on the slide,

197
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:57,650
but the title of my proposed study is The Psychiatric Physician Associated with Fallen Soldiers support a preliminary study,

198
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:00,770
possibly singular depression diagnosis.

199
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:04,340
This is very much a working title, so just keep that in mind.

200
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:09,920
So this is what I will attempt to present in 10 minutes. So we'll see how it goes.

201
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:15,440
Yeah, a little bit of background on depression. There are different types of depression.

202
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:21,739
There's major depressive disorder, there's seasonal affective disorder, there's the sign me up and a lot more my study.

203
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:28,219
I'm just trying to focus on the diagnosis of major depressive disorder, specifically in terms of the global burden.

204
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:30,530
About like 5% of the population,

205
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:39,500
the global population with the Depression and the Depression like heavily impacts quality of life functioning and has like adverse health outcomes.

206
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:45,719
I didn't know if I wanted to talk about multi dimensionality or multifaceted.

207
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,799
Yes, but we'll see if I decided to do that.

208
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:57,470
But I put that out there. Okay. So my science focusing on psychiatric readmission, but just about psychiatric admission in general.

209
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:00,340
There's inpatient and outpatient programs, too.

210
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:08,090
I'm focusing on inpatient outpatient programs affiliated with a hospital, but there are clinics that have kind of separate outpatient programs.

211
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:13,729
But essentially the difference between inpatient and outpatient programs is that in outpatient programs,

212
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:17,870
you are deemed safe enough to be able to go home and then come back for treatment the next day.

213
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:23,300
The meeting length of stay for I think this is specifically inpatient programs is around 15 days.

214
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:33,669
Purely anecdotally, it is variable. It depends on the severity, why you're there, your ability to be safe at home and how quick you can stabilize.

215
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:38,420
Essentially, the readmission rates in the US are about 30%.

216
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:48,370
So it's social support. So it's there's a lot of research that really supports that social support acts as a buffering

217
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:53,710
system and a buffering mechanism for depression and depressive episodes and depressive symptoms.

218
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,410
And so these I know tangible and emotional support. I lump sum together.

219
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:05,049
But these four aspects of social support are pretty commonly used to kind of measure

220
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:10,510
what social support is and how it's define online social support is relatively new,

221
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:15,490
which I thought is really interesting. So I decided to include that is how I define social support.

222
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:20,460
So yeah, for the sake of time I want to find them.

223
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:25,480
I guess I'm not saying, oh yeah, depression, social support,

224
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:31,209
it's complex and there's cultural differences, there's genetic factors, internal external factors.

225
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:34,360
I just really wanted to acknowledge that. Okay.

226
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:40,550
So my aim is to determine whether there is an association between social support and readmission,

227
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:49,660
whether it's dependent on that quality of social support. So I'm proposing that individuals who who have been admitted into psychiatric care for

228
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:54,250
depression and have a higher social support group for a fewer readmission status.

229
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,010
Okay. So this is my conceptual model. It's pretty simplified, but again, that's why I'm hitting on it.

230
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:08,310
Like the idea of multi dimensionality are just things that are really it's really complex, but essentially I'm just trying.

231
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:14,100
My exposure is social support and my outcome of psychiatric readmission.

232
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:21,780
I included the depressive episode as part of the causal pathway, but again, that's why I have arrows.

233
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:27,720
It's not really the focus of this study. And then I'm adjusting for age, gender, race and ethnicity.

234
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:31,380
Okay, so now for the actual study,

235
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:39,120
it's a prospective two year study and hopefully it's going to recruit people who have to be at least 18 years of age.

236
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,469
I'm recruiting from the city of Chicago from these three hospitals.

237
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:47,610
Just thought the top one to start Memorial Hospital, Northwestern.

238
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:52,079
And that's what I see. And they have to have a singular depression diagnosis.

239
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,549
And what I mean by that is they can't have any other co occurring diagnosis.

240
00:22:56,550 --> 00:23:02,220
So it's not uncommon for people who have depression to also be diagnosed with a generalized anxiety disorder.

241
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:08,660
But for the sake of just being, you know, being simple and I guess this being a preliminary study,

242
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:17,250
just they have to be diagnosed with major depressive disorder. And then I'm only focusing on inpatient programs specifically at these three hospitals.

243
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,850
So a psychiatric readmission will just be asked whether they were admitted or not.

244
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:31,020
The questionnaire will be online or mailed and be administered twice a year for two years.

245
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:35,969
And hopefully we're going to the goal is to recruit 50 people.

246
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:42,990
And the reason why it's relatively small is because hospitals don't have a lot of like beds for their psychiatric unit.

247
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:51,300
They're pretty small. So that's why, you know, in terms of scale, it's difficult to recruit a lot of people with budget and timing and everything.

248
00:23:52,560 --> 00:24:00,210
These are four aspects of social support that I'll be studying or measuring and how I'm defining social support.

249
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:08,339
Perceived social support is in terms of literature. It's pretty common to measure social support through that definition.

250
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:12,660
There's also tangible and emotional support, and then I just added on my social support.

251
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:18,690
And because it is relatively new in terms of how sulfur springs being.

252
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:27,509
Time for my analysis for hopefully going to use for logistic regression models again adjusting for age, gender, race and ethnicity.

253
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:31,530
And then because of perceived social support and online support or continuous variables,

254
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:37,440
we're going to see if distributions are needed for quarantine measures are needed or necessary.

255
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:45,630
So yeah, I'm expecting that individuals who have strong social support will report fewer psychiatric readmission status.

256
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:57,480
So in terms of human subjects, concern again since we are working with medical records, has to have a compliant we have to go through the RB process.

257
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:02,880
And then I do want to obviously to identify the data. Um.

258
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:12,950
Yeah, limitations. There are a lot. So in terms of like generalizability, I think it is very important to note that in terms of the global population,

259
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:16,060
people who live with depression, most of them do not have access to treatment.

260
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:22,360
Um, so that, right, literally right off the bat on this study really in terms of applicability,

261
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:27,790
it doesn't really apply to people or not really apply to people who don't even have access to treatment.

262
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:31,090
Because again, we are, um, oh wow.

263
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:36,490
I lot, we are recruiting for people who do have access to treatment.

264
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:45,100
Um, so there's also collecting from recruiting from a city versus like rural areas.

265
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:54,850
Um, I decided again to stick to one city both for feasibility and budget, um, but also because we can recruit from more diverse populations.

266
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:58,680
Um, let's see. Yeah. Um.

267
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:02,770
Depression is a mediator. I categorize depression as a mediator.

268
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:10,040
Um. Just because a lot of studies. Don't really see depression as a confounder, but again,

269
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:15,140
I overthink a lot of things and it can be justified to argue that depression could be a hundred.

270
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:19,010
But again, it's not really the focus of my study.

271
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:26,640
So. Yeah, I think it's worth everything. Um, yeah, I guess it, um.

272
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:31,800
Yeah, I would do that really fast. Yeah.

273
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:53,870
Yeah. I just want to make sure I understand what you're studying for and you're asking, have you been admitted again?

274
00:26:53,900 --> 00:27:00,260
Yes. Yes. Is there anything in particular by the that.

275
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:11,170
Yeah, I was interested in that. Purely anecdotally, I think a lot of people in my life who have been admitted for psychiatric reasons,

276
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:15,610
there's always the conversation of like, I don't want to go back.

277
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:21,350
So that's just why I was interested in what I was researching on readmission.

278
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:30,920
A lot of it, a lot of studies were on bipolar disorder or schizophrenic disorder or people who have more severe cases.

279
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:35,630
And then even there's also I don't know if you guys have heard the term frequent fliers,

280
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:40,639
which I actually just looked up how it's kind of an unethical and inappropriate term.

281
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,130
Now, I actually thought of the paper on why,

282
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:52,580
but there's a lot of studies on people who keep coming back and kind of risk factors associated with trying to figure out why people keep coming back.

283
00:27:52,610 --> 00:28:01,010
So I was just curious in terms of just studying social support and how that is related to, you know, possibly being readmitted.

284
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:14,030
No. Um.

285
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:19,050
Yeah, I guess. Yeah. Um, again, I chose a city.

286
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:26,910
Well, I'm from Chicago, so was like, why not Chicago? Um, but I chose the city again because we can recruit from a more diverse population.

287
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:33,810
Um, I chose these specific hospitals. Um, well, one, not a lot of hospitals actually have psychiatric programs.

288
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:37,110
Um, so, I mean, that's one thing to consider as well.

289
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,470
Um, I also try to pick, I don't know if this is like the correct way to look at it, but like non local hospital.

290
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:47,729
So these are affiliated walks up and talk but Northwestern UIC obviously are affiliated

291
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:54,270
with universities and so they pool people from all over the city because again,

292
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,979
Chicago is heavily segregated.

293
00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:04,800
So if I pool from like theoretically the north, east, west and south, I'm already, you know, picking people from very specific communities.

294
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:12,060
Um, like if I go directly east, then there's a little village right here in the park, which is a predominantly Puerto Rican community.

295
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:16,440
So. Which is why I chose these specific hospitals. Um, yeah.

296
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:24,490
Mission for depression. Yes.

297
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:34,660
Yeah. And and it gets kind of tricky because if somebody is readmitted again, they they could come out with a different diagnosis.

298
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:39,999
There also are some programs that ultimately don't end up diagnosing you either.

299
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,710
I have some people in my life who were admitted and never received a diagnosis.

300
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:50,079
I also I mean, I have opinions on diagnosis in general with the DSM five and how those diagnoses

301
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,160
were created and who they were created for so that there's the to consider as well.

302
00:29:55,130 --> 00:30:00,540
Yeah, there's a lot of moving parts that come in. And what happens when your.

303
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:06,690
I really feel that most of us.

304
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:21,320
I was wondering. Such was the temporality of. So does it matter how you're readmitted later?

305
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:25,730
Does it matter how long that is, whether it's like a week or six months versus.

306
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:34,250
Yeah. And when I was like looking at readmission, just readmission in general.

307
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,950
I think when I was looking at it last night,

308
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:44,420
I think there there are a percentage of people who ultimately end up being readmitted within the first 30 days.

309
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,700
So that, that is something also to consider.

310
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:55,490
Um, and I guess that also, I guess you kind of didn't think about the severity of why they ended up readmitted, whether voluntary or involuntary,

311
00:30:56,690 --> 00:31:02,840
which is why I just said it took two years because there's a high likelihood that they could be readmitted again.

312
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:08,280
But again, it's a preliminary study budget timeline.

313
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:11,760
Yeah, I would love to do like a longitudinal study because, you know,

314
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:15,950
there are people that are admitted that's only ten years later or something like that.

315
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:26,420
So yeah. Diagnosis.

316
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:33,490
Would you study or would that just be something, you know?

317
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:41,380
Yeah. I don't know. I would assume that I'd want to drop them from the side just because I really want to focus on,

318
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:45,010
you know, major depressive disorder and those who are diagnosed with that.

319
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:51,570
Um, but I guess it is something. I guess I could consider and talk about it in my paper.

320
00:31:52,080 --> 00:32:02,229
Yeah, because that is interesting. Yeah. On changing the slides.

321
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:06,790
The 30% readmission rate, is that lifetime readmission?

322
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:10,960
It's a great question I have. I just was curious. Probably, yeah.

323
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:17,590
Yeah, I was curious if that kind of relates to the question that I had about Ohio.

324
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:50,940
Gretchen. Do I start now?

325
00:32:52,070 --> 00:33:01,960
Yeah. Hi, everyone. My name is Jessie, and the topic that I'm going to present today is the impact of COVID 19 pandemic on the association between me,

326
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:09,150
socio economic status, chronic pain and obvious overdose, actual abuse or dependance.

327
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:16,660
So for the background is knowing that opioids usage is a big problem right now.

328
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:20,310
And according to the statistics, they are.

329
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:28,620
In May of 2019, over 70% of nearly 71,000 drug overdose deaths involved an opioid,

330
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:40,230
and previous research has already identified the association between SARS and chronic pain, SARS and opioids and chronic pain and opioids.

331
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:49,860
And also some recent study also find that COVID 19 pandemic has caused some impact on these associations.

332
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:58,469
So basically the people with lower SS tend to have an active paying beliefs and passive pain coping

333
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:06,390
strategies which could which could lead to a higher prevalence of chronic pain among people with lower SS.

334
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:12,530
And also there are patients who are suffering from pain because of their lower asks.

335
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:18,720
They are more likely to be prescribed always opioids instead of other prescriptions.

336
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:27,870
And this association is also modified by reach, gender, race, gender and age and also the chronic pain and opioids.

337
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:33,390
It's it's known that OBO is are commonly used for manage pain.

338
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:41,790
So people with chronic pain could tend to use opioids for a long time because it's a chronic issue.

339
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:51,990
And also the COVID 19 pandemic, the pandemic could directly increase the prevalence of chronic pain by limiting people's regular exercises.

340
00:34:52,230 --> 00:35:00,600
And also there is study finding that there is an increasing channel of prescription opioids during the pandemic,

341
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:07,140
and it's possibly due to the increasing prevalence of the chronic pain issues during the pandemic.

342
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:14,010
And based on those backgrounds. The A there are two aims of this study.

343
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:20,850
The first one is to identify an association between chronic pain and opioid abuse.

344
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:29,850
Dependance considering chronic pain as a potential mediator and this it will be adjusting for the age, race and gender.

345
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:37,770
So the hypothesis for this is that people with lower SS would be more likely to have chronic pain and will be always abuse.

346
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:46,470
Dependance, which is consistent with previous research and people with chronic pain would be more likely to have opioids, abuse or dependance.

347
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:56,160
And the second aim is to examine the differences in this association between the pre-pandemic scenario and after a post-pandemic scenario,

348
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:58,800
also controlling for age, race and gender.

349
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:07,920
And the hypothesis to this aim is the pandemic would accelerate the association between ACES and opioid abuse and dependance.

350
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:14,480
So this is my conceptual model. So basically the explore available is yes,

351
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:20,680
what you include occupation adaptation and the income and outcome variable is hoping always

352
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:27,810
appeals or dependance and chronic pain could be a potential mediator in this model.

353
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:37,129
And the data would be in two parts the pre-pandemic data and the post-pandemic data.

354
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:46,940
The pre-pandemic data would be extracted directly from the National Survey on drug bills in House in 2017 and 2018.

355
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:55,010
And self and the post-pandemic kit now would be self-collected in 2023 and 2024.

356
00:36:55,310 --> 00:37:05,480
And all the information on ISIS opioids utilization, whether or to use the same questionnaires that have been used in the past.

357
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:15,230
But we would add additional information on chronic pain for the post-pandemic data and the other questionnaire.

358
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:19,670
Some will be able to assess the chronic pain, at least in the table here.

359
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:29,540
So for the data analysis, the logistic regression will be applied to assess the associations of interest and mediation.

360
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:35,360
Analysis will be applied to identify the chronic pain role in this association

361
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:42,410
and the expected results and basically sing as they have hopefully before.

362
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:51,410
And for the mediation analysis, we expect that chronic pain does act as a mediator in this association.

363
00:37:53,180 --> 00:38:02,810
And the strength of this idea is that it's it will be a comparison between pre and post pandemic data and the mutation analysis.

364
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:10,819
Focusing on the chronic pain strongly in its association will help us further understand the existing health disparities

365
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:19,170
among the all the areas civilizations between people with different SARS status and the limitations of this study is for us.

366
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:23,239
First, why is that obvious? Abuse and dependance can be difficult to measure,

367
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:30,500
and in our study it will be self-reported data so we people could refuse to report

368
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:36,660
their actual situation due to considering the stigma of this kind of situation.

369
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:41,450
So we decided to use phone call interviews instead of face to face interviews.

370
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:48,230
And secondly, the honesty age, which is a pre-pandemic data and our self collect data,

371
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:58,400
collected data which is post-pandemic data, they are from different participants so it could be hard to make them comparable.

372
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:08,870
So we decided to general generate a rate waits for it so it will make it more generalizable and comparable between these two datasets.

373
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:19,889
And for the public health relevance considering how disparity in chronic pain and medical service utilizations it

374
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:29,190
could be necessary to identify the relationship between ASCs parking and LBO is utilization and of course ADD.

375
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:35,190
The opioid overdose has a slightly increasing trend during the pandemic.

376
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:40,860
It's kind of urgent to study this kind of underlying reason and take some interventions.

377
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:47,069
As for the WHO my subject customers, all the participants will have their rights,

378
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:52,410
informed consent, voluntary participation, and also the protection of their privacy.

379
00:39:53,840 --> 00:40:00,200
So they this have a timeline on this study. The first two years will be data collection and data extraction.

380
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:05,149
And for the third year, we'll start the reviewing and cleaning.

381
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:10,220
And also we could generate waste for later analysis.

382
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:17,120
And for the first year, they will be constructing the dataset and also the statistical analysis.

383
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:25,460
And for the fifth year, we will focus on the results of interpretation and manuscript writing and publication.

384
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:34,790
Yeah, and that's it. Do you have any questions?

385
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:44,860
I might be a lot more verbose, which you can see there.

386
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:48,030
In general, the differences. Yeah.

387
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:59,500
So the weights are actually they have this kind of study a has for how to generate a generate array weights for generalized your whole results.

388
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:01,839
It's kind of like, for example,

389
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:10,450
you have demographic information for your participants and the census would have some demographic information for the whole population,

390
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:13,330
for example, for the whole United States.

391
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:23,660
So you'll compare this to and you will find a difference in this and you kind of stress on formula, you generate some words for it.

392
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:29,210
Yeah. And the question.

393
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:33,800
Yeah. Oh, yes.

394
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:40,130
This one. The one before this one.

395
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:43,640
Yeah. Okay. So.

396
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:49,250
I see. Oh, sorry. Yeah, sorry.

397
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,670
The third. Right.

398
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:57,630
Describe. Get more of what we're. It's true.

399
00:41:57,770 --> 00:42:04,969
I just wonder. Yeah, that's a really good question. That's a really good question because when I did my literature review,

400
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:13,550
I'm also kind of surprised by this results because I found some studies identifying that people with low earnings,

401
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:19,880
yes, they are kind of they have different mold when they use the medical service,

402
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:25,969
like they go to the different medical service facilities, for example.

403
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:35,660
People always hire. Yes, they go to some big hospitals or nice I think territory hospitals in that matter.

404
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:46,370
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. And but for the people with lower yes they tend to go to like for example the drug stores, the clinics to get the prescriptions.

405
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:54,980
So that's the place where people would give them like opioids prescription to manage their pain instead of other prescriptions.

406
00:42:55,250 --> 00:43:05,360
And also during the pandemic, one problem is that the medical system kind of broke down for a little while and during that period,

407
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:08,480
the price for the drugs is also going up.

408
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:18,110
So for people with lower SS, they would tend to go to some prescription with lower price like opioids instead of other prescriptions.

409
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:25,430
That's also the reason. And and they in that study, they also find that for especially for Hispanic women,

410
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:38,870
I think they find that for this part of group of population, they have higher, higher chance to use a prescription instead of other drugs.

411
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:43,820
Yeah. That's pretty impressive. Thank you for bringing out this question. Yeah.

412
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:53,650
And now the question. Oh, yeah.

413
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:04,400
Yeah. I don't recall. You clarify what?

414
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:12,319
Passive pain. Oh I had the same question that the and the negative believes in passive coping strategy

415
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:19,610
is one of the which is it's kind of something related to the stress buffer mechanism.

416
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:26,389
So we have mentioned in this course before, it's kind of like you have less as a yes, a lower or less.

417
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:29,510
Yes. And you have less stress buffers.

418
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:34,370
So if you suffer from pain, you could have worse beliefs.

419
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:40,280
For example, if I have for example, if I have higher educational level,

420
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:46,220
I would know that if I have been, I will know kind of like why I have this kind of thing.

421
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:52,310
But if I have less education, I will think, wow, am I getting cancer or something like that?

422
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:58,160
And you could be get more stressed out because of this pain system's symptoms.

423
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:03,430
Yeah, something like that. And also for the passive coping strategies.

424
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:07,570
Strategies, for example, people with higher yes.

425
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:13,060
When they feel some something wrong going on with their body, they will go ask for help.

426
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:17,559
And but for other people with lower SS, for example,

427
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:23,890
I only have pain today and I will think that maybe if I don't have pain tomorrow, I will ask for help.

428
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:30,460
Or I would ask for how long till it's going to be a chronic issue or something like that.

429
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:34,160
Yeah. So some of it's related to like the sense of control, right?

430
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:38,270
Like over your health and other things that comes from having higher levels of it, right?

431
00:45:38,510 --> 00:46:09,719
Yeah. That makes sense. Yeah. Thank you. Sorry.

432
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:14,100
I really have a lot of words cause I got everything I'm feeling.

433
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,350
So my name is Paul.

434
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:29,160
My topic today is the association between duration of nighttime sleep and type two diabetes and adult and older age adults in China.

435
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:39,120
My contact will go through background hypothesis, research, defined limitations and timeline on diabetes,

436
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:45,300
a metabolic disease categorized by hyperglycemia caused by impairment of biological activity,

437
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:56,430
defective insulin secretion of both the chronic presence of hypoglycemia can cause chronic damage and dysfunction of our tissue,

438
00:46:56,430 --> 00:47:01,079
especially the kidney, heart, eyes, vessel and nerve system in China.

439
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:12,060
Study has shown that the prevalence of diabetes people over 18 rose rapidly from 4.2% in 2002 to 10.4% in 2013.

440
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:21,150
It's estimated that there are more than 97 million people with diabetes in China and about 150 million people with prediabetes.

441
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:25,500
The International Diabetes Federation estimates that the number of people with

442
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:34,700
diabetes in China will rise from 984 million in 2013 to 1.42 billion in 2035.

443
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:41,940
Diabetes is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.

444
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:48,030
So sleep duration as a life habit and environmental factor might be associated with development of diabetes.

445
00:47:48,810 --> 00:47:55,890
Studies have shown that the effective intervention in a high risk group can significantly reduce the incidence of diabetes,

446
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:01,050
so controllable risk factors for diabetes must be identified to reduce incidence.

447
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:07,920
The recommended nighttime sleep duration for us is around 7 to 8 hours per day for adults.

448
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:09,660
However, in recent decades,

449
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:17,400
the proportion of people with extreme sleep habit has increased and the quality of sleep has decreased with significant lifestyle changes.

450
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:25,540
Study have also reported that inappropriate sleep duration leads to metabolic and endocrine dysfunction such

451
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:32,590
as reduced blood but reduced glucose tolerance and increased sympathetic hormone cortisol concentrations.

452
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:43,990
Research published in 2018 indicates that an insufficient amount of sleep or sleep fragmentation resulting abnormal glucose metabolism,

453
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:50,230
a 20 to 30% reduction in sensitivity and increased risk of diabetes.

454
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:59,310
In China, little attention has been paid to sleep with insufficient attention to sleep interventions.

455
00:48:59,790 --> 00:49:08,220
Primary research analyzing the association between sleep duration and type two diabetes in the Chinese population mostly have like small sample size,

456
00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:15,870
which reflects regional limitations. Therefore, more study are needed to address the gaps and confirming the consistency between both side

457
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:21,000
of perspective and producing a more generalized evidence to support the association.

458
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:31,249
My aim is to analyze the association between my exposure and outcome among middle and older age.

459
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:39,409
And in China. We hypothesize that the association display of bell shape between these two and the duration

460
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:44,180
of nighttime sleep is negatively correlated to type two diabetes at the first stage,

461
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:48,050
then reach a minimum point and finally shows a positive association.

462
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:57,330
This is my conceptual model. Some possible confounders will be controlled in the study.

463
00:49:57,690 --> 00:50:01,649
Age. Sex drinking status. Smoking status. Obesity. Abdominal obesity.

464
00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:08,670
And sleep quality. This study will use secondary data.

465
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:16,620
It's a public data from China House and Retirement Longitudinal Study is a large scale interdisciplinary

466
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:21,690
survey project hosted by the National Development Research Institute of Peking University.

467
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:28,610
Its National Baseline survey was conducted in 2011 with follow up every two years.

468
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,920
The data are freely available to public for academic use one year after the surveys completed.

469
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:39,649
Charles conducted a survey in 150 counties and surrounding 50 communities.

470
00:50:39,650 --> 00:50:50,240
And by the time of national follow up in 2015, its sample have published 23,000 respondents in a total of 12,400 households.

471
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:59,339
Try. Sample is conducted through four stages at county, neighborhood, household and individual level,

472
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:04,530
using a simple math sampling method of probabilities proportional proportional to size.

473
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:15,570
The final survey has a valid sample of 17,587 people, and the distribution is shown in the table like this.

474
00:51:15,930 --> 00:51:19,890
50 miners is is like people who are younger than 50.

475
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:34,540
It's not the. My study is cross-sectional study by using the data from 2011 baseline survey from the original longitudinal study.

476
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:37,210
Considering the possible human subject concern,

477
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:45,580
the inclusion criteria are what those who had signed an informed consent in the database and were aged 45 years or older.

478
00:51:46,030 --> 00:51:52,630
The sample was missing. Information on age, sex and other relevant information were excluded.

479
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:59,120
Respondent's health condition will be measured in two ways.

480
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:05,290
The first one is result in self-report about having diabetes or elevated blood glucose,

481
00:52:05,290 --> 00:52:09,970
including abnormal glucose tolerance and elevated fasting blood glucose.

482
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:15,489
The second one is blood sample test. During the baseline survey,

483
00:52:15,490 --> 00:52:24,010
respondents will be invited to after the interview to go to a community hospital or local center for Disease Control and Prevention.

484
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:31,450
Will medical staff will use standard protocol to draw a litter blood sample fasting blood samples?

485
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:36,460
The result will be defined based on the American Diabetes Association risk criteria.

486
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:45,370
I categorize age into three groups gender are mouth female smoking study status will be

487
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:50,799
like nonsmoker smoker informal smoking drinking status is the same as smoking status.

488
00:52:50,800 --> 00:53:02,220
Obesity will be measured using BMI criteria, and abdominal obesity will use waist circumference like larger than 1.2.

489
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:12,970
Mel is what we considered abdominal obesity and 88 for female, the sleep quality will be measured, according to respondent.

490
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:20,380
Respondents self-report about how many days they feel their sleep was restless last week.

491
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:27,390
The Mass for the method seems to software variables.

492
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:33,480
All category categorical variables are the mental hansol chi square test will be used for this study.

493
00:53:33,930 --> 00:53:40,680
For the description of the measure measurement data. This study will use count and proportional for a single statistic.

494
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:50,009
Description. The association between night time, sleep duration and Diabetes was explored using a binomial regression analysis with a ratio and

495
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:55,590
95 confidence interval to express the strength of the association controlling for a confounders.

496
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:04,750
For some limitations of this study. Our first as a cross-sectional study,

497
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:13,990
it's impossible to infer whether the duration of sleep influences the occurrence of diabetes or the duration of sleep of diabetic patients.

498
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:22,330
Second, the length of nighttime sleep was obtained from the respondent's self-report, which may cause bias in the result of this study.

499
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:32,829
Third is the other factors that may affect diabetes in this study are not comprehensive, and many factors are like may affect diabetes,

500
00:54:32,830 --> 00:54:40,060
are not control included in the study, such as family history of diabetes, diet related factors, etc.

501
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:49,540
With a timeline a month, one, two, three will conduct, ask, research and collect research evidence related to the topic.

502
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:55,419
Months 4 to 7 will clean and aggregate the data obtained from the official

503
00:54:55,420 --> 00:55:00,100
website through analyzing the callback qualitative questionnaire and months.

504
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:05,709
8 to 11 will analyze data and make graphs using statistics method like regression

505
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:10,470
model models to finalize the manuscript against the mean for competition.

506
00:55:12,050 --> 00:55:23,390
Okay. Thank you. I probably cannot answer that.

507
00:55:23,530 --> 00:55:27,110
Yeah. Yeah. So why?

508
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:34,220
Was that correct? What was. Yeah. Yeah.

509
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:43,860
Because the incidence rate and prevalence rate is much higher for older age people and I think they have higher risk.

510
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:53,670
The reason why we want to do this is just one. I like to find out how to reduce and control the risk.

511
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:08,230
So because they have high risk, we want to like study on them. Another question is regarding so what do you.

512
00:56:10,010 --> 00:56:13,950
My understanding is that. Yeah.

513
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:19,930
Um, something else is.

514
00:56:19,930 --> 00:56:24,479
How were you? Yeah, that's a good question.

515
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:36,250
I, you know, think about that. But yeah, I think we'll look at the data set and see like the average for people like in different age,

516
00:56:36,870 --> 00:56:44,120
different age group and like just use the average the mean like mean available to compare that like.

517
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:46,740
Yeah, because I stratify.

518
00:56:47,310 --> 00:56:55,920
So I will exceed the mean value of each group and I will do a bit compared maybe have some statistical methods in that, but I don't know.

519
00:56:56,770 --> 00:57:02,740
So I think sometimes it's always like face.

520
00:57:02,850 --> 00:57:07,350
But um, I know that if I, I can see how much don't like.

521
00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:17,210
I know that it's something like 17,000 people, which is awesome.

522
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:23,750
Is that something you have for this one in? The self-important quality.

523
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:37,150
Um, I think it's self-reported. They have a questionnaire, so I read it in my so my limitation is kind of like self-report bias.

524
00:57:51,730 --> 00:58:01,050
Okay. Um, can you go back to the slide that shows the regional, um, prevalence of type two diabetes?

525
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:10,330
Did you know I was going to ask you because you're laughing. So Northeast China is so much higher.

526
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:17,200
Yeah. So everywhere else. Why is that? Um, I think as he mentioned that last time, the obesity rate.

527
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:21,280
Oh, okay. Because of this, where there's fewer vegetables.

528
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:27,730
Yeah, it's very cold there because of the weather. Yeah, but actually, I assume you were asking why they didn't control for a region.

529
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:39,160
Well, yeah, I didn't. You can say it's I think regions associated with for you that I don't know, but I think so.

530
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:45,370
Okay. Um, I, I thought about that last night, but I really, like, finished all my PowerPoint.

531
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:47,790
Is it okay? Let me add up later. Probably.

532
00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:57,189
But yeah, I think it's important thing to control because of like the culture and diet and where there are differences,

533
00:58:57,190 --> 00:59:02,140
it will cause like so many differences in region.

534
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:06,640
Yeah. Yeah. And they have higher obesity rates in this area.

535
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,570
And how why do you think reason would be associated with sleep?

536
00:59:11,770 --> 00:59:18,510
Like would it be associated with more sleep or less in China, we use this Beijing time for all regions.

537
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:24,610
Okay. Like I think in like if it's like 10 p.m. is still like right outside.

538
00:59:25,090 --> 00:59:30,970
Yeah. Different places have different kind of nightlife.

539
00:59:31,410 --> 00:59:40,690
It's like, yeah, in the northern part of China, people would stay up until like 12 a.m. at night and they'd go sleep.

540
00:59:40,690 --> 00:59:47,230
And then maybe you still hang out with friends. But in the south and part of China, people may go to sleep by ten.

541
00:59:48,910 --> 00:59:49,930
Oh, interesting.

542
00:59:49,990 --> 00:59:59,890
So it could be not just duration of sleep, but like when sleep occurs, that could be having an impact on obesity or other risk factors for diabetes.

543
01:00:00,110 --> 01:00:05,190
Yeah, that's super interesting. One more because.

544
01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:12,500
Oh, we only have 15 seconds, but I'll just leave you with. You said that extreme sleep habits have increased over time.

545
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:17,900
So I guess that means like short duration. Does that just mean short duration or also long duration?

546
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:29,450
I think shorter. Short duration and. And any ideas why that's happened is I don't know, like if that was like I can't explain.

547
01:00:29,450 --> 01:00:34,069
That was called culture. It means they could well keep working.

548
01:00:34,070 --> 01:00:39,410
If you work, I need to work more than you. Yeah. I think is very popular Asian culture.

549
01:00:39,890 --> 01:00:45,950
Okay. Yeah, that's so. So people, like, tend to, like, sleep late, like later and later.

550
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:52,820
Just want to be better than you. I feel like people between coworkers and maybe even sleep just in the coffee.

551
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:57,290
Yeah. They even they can sort of like I am going to go to sleep, but actually they're doing work.

552
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:05,420
Yeah. So it's kind of the common situation in especially in the middle or a younger age group.

553
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:09,490
Yeah. Are you guys saying that that happened in grad school that no.

554
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:18,560
Said Yeah. Yeah, no, I'm I'm an eight hour at night in person so I wouldn't I wouldn't make it okay.

555
01:01:22,270 --> 01:01:50,150
Yeah. Okay?

556
01:01:50,670 --> 01:01:55,440
I think so. That's it? Yeah. Okay.

557
01:02:03,510 --> 01:02:13,230
Hello, everyone. My name is Victoria. Today I'm going to present a hypothetical research that is the association between socio economic status,

558
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:19,950
ethics and the development of postpartum depression PPD, among others in Michigan, United States.

559
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:29,370
So firstly, full of background and significance, the postpartum depression symptoms include feelings of severe, severe sadness,

560
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:37,920
anxiety or despair, leading to impairments in daily activities which occur occur from a few weeks to one year after childbirth.

561
01:02:38,610 --> 01:02:46,200
And PPD symptoms are experienced by 10 to 20% of postpartum women, with implication on maternal and child well-being.

562
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:50,790
So the more specific preservative status can be seen in the.

563
01:02:52,610 --> 01:02:57,260
And I'll try to give you the result. You call maternal bonding and mother's substance.

564
01:02:57,410 --> 01:03:00,020
Substance abuse, infanticide and suicide.

565
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:09,140
And so the exposure is as, yes, the risk of both antenatal depression and PPD is higher for women with low as he does.

566
01:03:09,890 --> 01:03:13,820
Women with lower incomes are less likely to report symptoms of depression to

567
01:03:13,820 --> 01:03:18,470
their health care providers and have less access to mental health services.

568
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:24,950
And past theoretical empirical work has highlighted the importance of social status for depression.

569
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:30,590
Secondly, for the public health relevance,

570
01:03:30,950 --> 01:03:37,970
considering the prevalence of PPD among US mothers and the long term impairments on mothers and infant health and wellbeing,

571
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:42,620
so is urgent to minimize this harmful effects by taking preventive measures.

572
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:46,580
Identify the condition early and receiving treatment on time.

573
01:03:47,150 --> 01:03:52,040
But due to the cover nature of this disorder, early recognition is one of the most challenging parts.

574
01:03:52,790 --> 01:04:01,040
And because of the social stigma associated with PPD, many mothers are discouraged from seeking professional help when they are suffering for it.

575
01:04:02,510 --> 01:04:10,700
So more research is needed to determine the possible risk factors of human youth so that intervention can be initiated before the onset of puberty.

576
01:04:14,140 --> 01:04:14,410
Yeah.

577
01:04:14,410 --> 01:04:23,410
Thoroughly for the gaps in knowledge, there's carefully conflicting research evidence linking C.S. Lewis depressive symptoms into postpartum periods.

578
01:04:23,890 --> 01:04:32,930
So some studies have suggested prior losses is associated with the rest of PPD, but other studies have suggested that loss, yes,

579
01:04:33,010 --> 01:04:41,920
has had a small effect size of PPD, but that's maybe due to a limited number of studies were conducted with economically diverse samples.

580
01:04:42,340 --> 01:04:47,920
Like, for instance, other women recruited in the study belong to the low as groups.

581
01:04:48,890 --> 01:04:52,310
And besides few studies compare high versus low.

582
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:55,760
Yes, women from prenatal to three months after giving birth.

583
01:04:56,240 --> 01:05:02,210
And little is known about factors associated with depression that lasts for longer periods postpartum.

584
01:05:02,810 --> 01:05:09,950
So this research, which will address the gap by using a more diverse sample with various backgrounds

585
01:05:10,430 --> 01:05:13,820
throughout the prenatal period through three months after the delivery.

586
01:05:16,890 --> 01:05:23,760
And we also have two mediators included in the moto, the first wise ultimatum, stressful Afghans as well.

587
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:26,190
And the second one is social support.

588
01:05:26,970 --> 01:05:34,140
So researchers have found that when mother experienced stressful life events, both mothers and the child adversely affected,

589
01:05:34,620 --> 01:05:41,040
and in the postpartum periods, all the measures of social support when actively associated with depressive symptoms,

590
01:05:41,550 --> 01:05:46,560
the lack of social support networks was consistently related to maternal CVD,

591
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:54,060
and the onset of CVD may be influenced by stressors and social support among women from low, low socioeconomic backgrounds.

592
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:58,230
Since these women are more exposed to chronic stress and stressful situations,

593
01:05:58,530 --> 01:06:04,170
they tend to have limited social support, have more frequent conflicts with a number of the same social cycles.

594
01:06:07,230 --> 01:06:10,530
As well as the Cayman hypothesis, we have two aims.

595
01:06:11,070 --> 01:06:20,040
The first was to determine what are the different levels of UVB and the hypothesis that women with more access will have higher risk.

596
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:29,100
The second aim is to examine whether the association between us and the risk of PPD depends on social support and to ourselves.

597
01:06:29,670 --> 01:06:39,900
And the hypothesis is that women, women with lower social support or higher acne who are used to have higher risk of PPD than their opponents.

598
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:51,320
I'm for the perception that all we can see there are two mediators and also confounders which are marital status, maternal age, race and ethnicity.

599
01:06:51,590 --> 01:06:53,400
And a number of previous life versus.

600
01:06:57,180 --> 01:07:08,240
And for data set, we'll use established cross-sectional data from pregnancy risk assessment monitoring system from 2016 to 2020 in Michigan.

601
01:07:08,790 --> 01:07:13,469
And a wide range of topics can be explored from this dataset,

602
01:07:13,470 --> 01:07:19,830
which can be seen in the figures in a stratified sampling frame is used to draw

603
01:07:19,830 --> 01:07:25,920
some 400 to 250 new mothers monthly based on the eligible birth certificates.

604
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:33,510
And the surveys are conducted by mailing questionnaires and telephone telephone follow ups for nonresponders.

605
01:07:34,170 --> 01:07:39,990
This stretched standard standardized approach allows for comparison of all sites and for optimal use of the data.

606
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:49,200
And around 5000 responses were received from Michigan, perhaps increased age, with at least 56% response rates.

607
01:07:52,130 --> 01:07:56,870
And in order to measure exposure and outcome, as I see us here is measured.

608
01:07:56,870 --> 01:08:03,740
The education, income, the occupation based measure are major because of because they do not apply to unemployment.

609
01:08:03,770 --> 01:08:07,660
People like teenagers, mothers or mother that don't have jobs,

610
01:08:07,830 --> 01:08:15,409
they basically stay at home and the costs go up as high as is calculated by the total years of education multiplied

611
01:08:15,410 --> 01:08:21,709
by the quintiles of household income and poverty is measured by my mother's following three months off.

612
01:08:21,710 --> 01:08:29,990
The newborns of the following factors are five point microscope and mothers risk of PPD in their comes a score is larger.

613
01:08:34,770 --> 01:08:41,429
And to measure the two mediators and stressful life events were asked by asking mothers if they had

614
01:08:41,430 --> 01:08:47,670
experienced any of the 15 core questions from the questionnaire questionnaires in one year before delivery.

615
01:08:48,090 --> 01:08:50,610
Other questions can be also seen here.

616
01:08:53,220 --> 01:09:01,590
The domain specific approach is used, and this method categorize the PSL into four categories which are financial,

617
01:09:01,590 --> 01:09:04,130
relational, trauma related and emotional.

618
01:09:04,860 --> 01:09:15,180
And the social support is calculated by a 7.1% scale, with one represented very strong women and seven represented very strong agreement.

619
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:29,389
For that. His plan to fulfill a more logistic regression, just that the relationship between us and PPD adjusting for confounders such as race,

620
01:09:29,390 --> 01:09:37,220
ethnicity, maternal age, marital status and previous life versus and odds ratio, 95% confidence intervals are used.

621
01:09:37,710 --> 01:09:42,670
Weeks but also PPD are significantly decreased by ever increasing the index.

622
01:09:43,750 --> 01:09:51,460
I'm also into this the also the logistic regression is used was two mediators added to the previous model.

623
01:09:52,010 --> 01:10:01,630
Separately, I would expect also for the motive of social support and also to be strengthened for the mother with antenatal after.

624
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:13,730
For the potential problems versus the lack of generalizability since all the participants are from Michigan.

625
01:10:13,740 --> 01:10:19,010
So maybe the findings only degenerates about just after mistakes.

626
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:20,950
A second is up for grabs.

627
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:30,350
Tests have all measure variables so that the dataset do not capture information regarding possible depression or other stress types involving fathers.

628
01:10:31,070 --> 01:10:34,040
But due to a standardized data collection methodology,

629
01:10:34,790 --> 01:10:41,780
it has still remained the most comprehensive source of maternal and child health data in comparison across states.

630
01:10:44,410 --> 01:10:51,490
For the time, like the first three months, US is submitting a research proposal to a CDC to replace the current data set in Michigan

631
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:58,700
and following two months is data to determine management in the next six months.

632
01:10:58,780 --> 01:11:06,460
Out of date analysis and summarization of results in the final three months is to prepare for manuscripts and publication.

633
01:11:08,010 --> 01:11:32,490
Thank you very much. I have a couple.

634
01:11:32,940 --> 01:11:38,500
Okay. Um, so could you go back to the slide?

635
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:43,050
I'm interested in these regional differences again, just like with the US map.

636
01:11:43,650 --> 01:11:47,459
Yeah. So I noticed that a lot of them say no data.

637
01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:50,790
Do you know, like, is is premiums.

638
01:11:50,790 --> 01:11:55,440
It's so it's a CDC data and I assume it's national.

639
01:11:55,470 --> 01:12:00,240
Is it do states decide if they are willing to administer it or not?

640
01:12:00,270 --> 01:12:03,270
Do you know if that's why there's not information for some of these states?

641
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:12,570
I think if states decide whether they have to conduct this survey or not, and also it's that maybe this is not the most recent data.

642
01:12:12,780 --> 01:12:15,870
I think the most recent. They do it for most states. Okay.

643
01:12:19,050 --> 01:12:23,760
But it's still like the overall it's like 30% of women have.

644
01:12:38,810 --> 01:12:43,750
I have one where they small sort of thing. So if you go back to your aims.

645
01:12:48,230 --> 01:12:53,240
Yeah. So on this second wave.

646
01:12:53,450 --> 01:13:01,120
Yeah. The second aim to examine whether the association between the FDA and recent PPD depends on social support and neonatal support.

647
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:09,200
Do you mean there instead of depends on do you mean is explained by use?

648
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:13,250
Depends on the cause. I want to like analyze these two variables immediately.

649
01:13:13,820 --> 01:13:17,660
So yeah. So I think if you want to look at them as mediators,

650
01:13:17,660 --> 01:13:26,870
you want to say that it's explained by these approval and depends on would be more like effect modification that the association between

651
01:13:26,870 --> 01:13:34,909
the exposure and the outcome depends on the level of the third variable instead of explained by just like it's just a minor thing.

652
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:38,120
But yeah, I thought. Yeah, I thought you meant mediation.

653
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:46,700
Yeah. That shows you just.

654
01:13:47,950 --> 01:13:57,370
Christie being open minded about some of the data collection methods.

655
01:13:58,660 --> 01:14:08,340
So from the estimate of stressful life events, is that being measured by the quantity of items that they say yes to in one lesson?

656
01:14:08,950 --> 01:14:15,840
Yes by the quantities and value, like summarize it into four domains like that.

657
01:14:15,850 --> 01:14:20,110
Analyze it by domains just like a new method in 2012.

658
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:26,499
Because while you analyze the individual it you may miss the correlation between

659
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:31,540
individual stressors and also the this association may be overestimated.

660
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:50,170
So they come up with a new message of just. All right, let's take a five minute break and then we'll come back for the second half.

661
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:35,830
I don't know what happens.

662
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:46,340
You're not going anywhere.

663
01:15:47,330 --> 01:16:07,720
So I just wanted to let you know you have to get up right now. Yes.

664
01:16:21,250 --> 01:16:31,350
And that's why. Which is accompanied by.

665
01:16:35,190 --> 01:16:46,500
Well, I think is going to be a.

666
01:16:54,960 --> 01:17:03,280
But if you're here doing.

667
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:28,080
Yeah. I feel like I got another.

668
01:17:44,340 --> 01:17:51,820
You want. Went.

669
01:17:55,370 --> 01:18:03,860
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

670
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:53,270
I just. Yeah.

671
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:37,770
I'm in no hurry. I just wanted to get this one so good that I've got it.

672
01:19:43,730 --> 01:19:48,860
Yeah. Public speaking is really no one's favorite. Yeah. I don't know many people who like.

673
01:19:49,060 --> 01:19:55,970
Yeah. I wanted to, I think, you know, I just lost a lot of those, you know.

674
01:19:56,360 --> 01:20:00,980
Well, uncomfortability. Yeah. We all got very used to just being behind a screen.

675
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:04,750
Yeah. Which comes with its own, like, stress. I know. Yeah, yeah.

676
01:20:05,150 --> 01:20:08,660
But it's like. That's why it's good to do this, because it's totally low stakes.

677
01:20:09,020 --> 01:20:17,990
Right. I like to practice being in front of people, but it's like, even though it always feels scary, like it's a friendly.

678
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:21,800
How do you. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right.

679
01:20:23,030 --> 01:20:29,640
The tables and you can go ahead and start. And I'm sure a few people will still be okay.

680
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:40,730
Right. Hi. How you doing? So my name is Audra Proposal, which is also my I only project on cumulative made for later life household food insecurity.

681
01:20:40,970 --> 01:20:44,990
Kind of a mouthful as a predictor of cognitive function in world North African.

682
01:20:47,460 --> 01:20:51,330
All right. So here's the agenda, very similar to everyone else has been going through as well.

683
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:57,450
But to give a little bit of a background, I actually didn't know this until I was doing some research about global food insecurity.

684
01:20:57,450 --> 01:21:09,210
Just since 2019 has more than doubled across the world from 135 million people in 2019 to 345 million people as of 2022.

685
01:21:09,690 --> 01:21:17,790
And so when I say food, the inverse of food security, which a lot of folks in our field define as physical,

686
01:21:17,790 --> 01:21:21,570
social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritional foods.

687
01:21:22,830 --> 01:21:28,470
And a lot of folks are now getting into food preferences and dietary needs, as well as an aspect of food insecurity.

688
01:21:28,890 --> 01:21:35,550
So a lot goes into this definition. And I will say that this project is a very simplified version of looking at food insecurity.

689
01:21:36,090 --> 01:21:38,250
And I'll talk about that more once we get to the limitations.

690
01:21:39,660 --> 01:21:47,430
I was like, So for our published research on food, insecurity has been linked to cognitive.

691
01:21:50,580 --> 01:22:01,770
Destructive Hurricanes has been linked to similar chronic diseases in both childhood and adulthood later in life.

692
01:22:02,380 --> 01:22:06,060
So diabetes, cognition, mental health disorders, cardiovascular disease,

693
01:22:06,510 --> 01:22:15,090
obesity and hypertension have all been linked to sort of consequentially follow some types of food insecurity and research.

694
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:19,710
For this project, specifically, we're focusing on that food insecurity and cognition.

695
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:27,510
And the research here is that like food insecurity is thought to be related to cognitive function for several reasons.

696
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:34,020
The main ones being micronutrient content over time, sustained economic stress,

697
01:22:34,290 --> 01:22:38,760
which again is hard to map but we'll be talking about and then for eating habits over time as well.

698
01:22:39,510 --> 01:22:48,299
And so this relationship has been studied pretty frequently across the globe and in longitudinal ways that in low and middle income countries,

699
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:54,360
it really only has been studied cross-sectional. And so that's something that this study works to address a little bit in more detail.

700
01:22:56,250 --> 01:23:02,010
And so while addressing that gap is important in itself, it's especially important considering that by 2050,

701
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:06,780
80% of folks living with dementia are projected to be living in low and middle income countries.

702
01:23:07,530 --> 01:23:13,620
So this is a statistic that's backed up by a couple of studies, but then the World Health Organization is actually reporting this now as well.

703
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:21,629
And so I actually during the end of that, I did some research on HIV in South Africa.

704
01:23:21,630 --> 01:23:28,260
And so I had a a personal interest in the country, but specifically was interested in studying food insecurity and cognition due to

705
01:23:28,260 --> 01:23:32,430
the fact that the country has had some recent social history with apartheid,

706
01:23:32,970 --> 01:23:38,490
racial discrimination, land dispossession, a lot of which relates to socioeconomic status currently.

707
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:44,909
So I thought looking at food insecurity would be especially interesting in this population and that older

708
01:23:44,910 --> 01:23:50,130
adults too would be especially would have been especially exposed to food insecurity during this time,

709
01:23:50,580 --> 01:23:54,690
which I thought would be interesting to look at as well. And as of 2020 due this year,

710
01:23:55,080 --> 01:24:01,680
it's projected that about a quarter of South African the South African population is experiencing moderate to severe food insecurity.

711
01:24:06,310 --> 01:24:10,719
All right. So that brings me to the objectives of our specifically for charities to investigate

712
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:18,760
how for food insecurity is associated is associated associated with cognition

713
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:24,940
scores in the cohort which is an existing longitudinal cohort study that's matched

714
01:24:24,940 --> 01:24:30,370
and sympathize with our health and retirement survey and here in the United States.

715
01:24:31,060 --> 01:24:36,630
And so our hypothesis is that increased exposure to household food insecurity during ten years intermediate to

716
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:42,790
late in life will be associated with consequential lower cognitive function in the whole cohort specifically.

717
01:24:44,860 --> 01:24:51,249
And so in order to look at this objective and these hypotheses, so we'll have to synthesize two existing data sets.

718
01:24:51,250 --> 01:24:52,389
And so like, like I mentioned,

719
01:24:52,390 --> 01:25:01,330
housing is an existing cohort here with 5059 South American adults aged 40 and up because we will be looking at cognition.

720
01:25:01,330 --> 01:25:06,070
And that's actually one of the eligibility criteria for for how we overall.

721
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:08,080
But it does collect demographic,

722
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:14,740
psychosocial and self-reported health information that includes cognition and cognition because quite a few different options.

723
01:25:15,100 --> 01:25:21,610
We'll be looking at episodic memory specifically because that is a hallmark sign for dementia in older adults.

724
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:26,680
And then so in order to sort of get our food and security information that doesn't isn't.

725
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:34,660
Like lifted or I should say captured and healthy. And so food in theory is captured, though, by the census.

726
01:25:34,660 --> 01:25:44,290
And so we are able to use the census as the underlying population or the sampling frame and then sort of match folks information,

727
01:25:44,290 --> 01:25:54,929
food security with their cognition because. And so this is a better graphic sort of hopefully it's a little bit complicated,

728
01:25:54,930 --> 01:26:01,620
but this is sort of depicting at what point in time we're looking at food insecurity and then when we're later looking at cognition.

729
01:26:02,580 --> 01:26:07,740
And so then our exposure, like I mentioned, will be the percentage of time that households experience food insecurity.

730
01:26:08,220 --> 01:26:16,530
This isn't a foolproof way of doing this, I will admit. But so what we've sort of decided at this point is to basically just calculate a percentage.

731
01:26:16,530 --> 01:26:23,880
So, for example, of someone with food insecure at 2004, but not 27, ten or 13, they would have a 25%.

732
01:26:25,750 --> 01:26:28,750
You know, there were students there for 25% of that time.

733
01:26:29,590 --> 01:26:36,400
And we're strictly using the question in the census that was there any sort of differently in the household in the past month,

734
01:26:36,850 --> 01:26:40,420
which again is only really looking at that physical access to food,

735
01:26:40,780 --> 01:26:45,400
which isn't necessarily an all encompassing measure of food insecurity and then outcome.

736
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:50,470
Like I mentioned, we're going to be using episodic memory which incorporates immediate and delayed recall.

737
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:54,310
So that's like a word list that folks will be sort of asking them, you know,

738
01:26:54,580 --> 01:27:00,610
they have to repeat those words back and then we're going to combine those two measures into one score from zero 2 to

739
01:27:00,610 --> 01:27:10,100
20 intermediate and are in the immediate and delayed recall are both measured from 0 to 10 so can see zero the time.

740
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:17,850
And then so I don't know how much time I have necessarily, but like I won't go into eligibility in recruitment entirely.

741
01:27:17,850 --> 01:27:25,380
But just to give you a better idea, there's 100,016 people living in the Agincourt region and then from there we sort of

742
01:27:25,530 --> 01:27:31,700
are I think the whole cohort was sort of narrowed down based on eligibility criteria.

743
01:27:31,710 --> 01:27:39,630
So like I mentioned, folks were up as of July 2014 or are eligible to be in the study that folks also had to be living in the area,

744
01:27:40,770 --> 01:27:52,800
you know, basically in 2012 in order to have to be eligible to be matched, I should say I'm synthesized with the census and policy data.

745
01:27:53,460 --> 01:28:01,650
And then so recruitment I didn't mention this at the time, but there'll be at home interviews where they do all the interviews with policy and so.

746
01:28:05,050 --> 01:28:11,420
Yep. That is something that all the questions about cognition, psychosocial and health information are captured that way.

747
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:19,810
Informed consent is important in this population due to the fact that health literacy and literacy in general does vary in the population.

748
01:28:20,110 --> 01:28:24,000
And so thinking about the informed consent process and Josie, specifically,

749
01:28:24,010 --> 01:28:29,680
it was conducted in the local English language or English is preferred depending on what folks had a preference for.

750
01:28:29,980 --> 01:28:38,290
And then if folks were unable to read or write the when folks were able to have a witness and fingerprints, their fingerprints,

751
01:28:38,290 --> 01:28:47,920
the sort of sign and the confidentiality is maintained as data sets that I receive already de-identified and don't have that information in there.

752
01:28:49,700 --> 01:28:57,169
Here's my conceptual model. I definitely should have included this earlier, but sort of this is a socioeconomic status.

753
01:28:57,170 --> 01:29:02,480
Just the sort of confounding variables and includes is in education, parental education.

754
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:07,220
This is a statement for acquisition of equipment and household assets,

755
01:29:08,270 --> 01:29:13,669
which will sort of account for, in our model the demographic, covariance, age, gender and country.

756
01:29:13,670 --> 01:29:17,360
First of all, specifically for cognitive function and food.

757
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:26,880
And so here's our analytic model. We're just using a simple linear regression, which again comes with its connotations, which I'm about to talk about.

758
01:29:28,740 --> 01:29:33,000
So food insecurity, like I mentioned, is a very complex measure.

759
01:29:33,810 --> 01:29:38,610
And the way we're doing it doesn't necessarily capture this idea that food

760
01:29:38,610 --> 01:29:45,540
insecurity can vary and the relationship temporarily to temper at a temporal scale.

761
01:29:46,380 --> 01:29:53,460
So we'll sort of change an impact and we'll never get cognition at one point in time, which can vary as well.

762
01:29:53,610 --> 01:29:56,400
And so it doesn't necessarily capture what that relationship with the.

763
01:29:57,150 --> 01:30:01,830
So moving forward, we'd like to use more linear mixed effects models, which we could use,

764
01:30:01,830 --> 01:30:09,090
like the annual rate of change for cognition over time rather than just one episodic memory measurement.

765
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:17,640
And because there are many points in time where folks could be lost to follow, there is a lot of missing ness in this data.

766
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:24,240
And so if we were to do this study again, it would be important to look at multiple imputation methods to account for all of that missing this.

767
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:29,250
And then, like I mentioned, that time varying element is a big, big factor.

768
01:30:31,390 --> 01:30:37,860
Here's the general timeline. So this is when it's a recap of the study period here.

769
01:30:37,870 --> 01:30:42,310
So, yes, the census was conducted here with healthy baseline in cognition.

770
01:30:42,910 --> 01:30:45,820
And then this is just a recap of my timeline here for the so,

771
01:30:45,850 --> 01:30:55,330
so right here where we identified our data analysis plan and have some exploratory, exploratory analysis to do as well.

772
01:30:57,860 --> 01:31:01,639
Yeah. My credit references.

773
01:31:01,640 --> 01:31:17,230
But what questions do you have? That was part of.

774
01:31:18,590 --> 01:31:24,040
Yes. So to my knowledge, it's sort of this capture of more short term memory.

775
01:31:24,050 --> 01:31:28,100
So, for example, reading a word list of ten words and being able to recall them back,

776
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:33,840
that sort of is is supposed to capture that more short term or like memory of specific events for.

777
01:31:37,430 --> 01:31:37,700
Yeah.

778
01:31:38,450 --> 01:31:46,130
I know you mentioned that your measure of food insecurity isn't necessarily that, you know, capturing some of the complexities of food insecurity.

779
01:31:46,850 --> 01:31:52,490
I guess it's like you were not limited by what's available in your diet is that you have an idea like how you would like to measure that.

780
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,069
Yeah, I would love to look at nutritional content.

781
01:31:55,070 --> 01:31:59,540
That is something that's being done in food insecurity research, at least from what I was able to find.

782
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:05,920
And I think that would be really, really interesting. But of course that comes that some of us have taken the nutritional classes that comes with that

783
01:32:05,930 --> 01:32:11,930
whole sort of extra complexities in terms of finding out and doing all of those nutritional surveys.

784
01:32:11,930 --> 01:32:15,520
It's like, What did you eat today or how far back do you go? And those few diaries.

785
01:32:15,830 --> 01:32:37,000
But I would love to get more into that idea. For Holly.

786
01:32:37,390 --> 01:32:42,450
So Holly started in 2015 and they actually we're only using the first wave of houses.

787
01:32:42,450 --> 01:32:51,700
So that's just captured in 2015. There are three total holly waves, but the census data will provide that food insecurity data up until that point.

788
01:32:53,030 --> 01:32:58,950
Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. That was a group. Yeah.

789
01:32:59,230 --> 01:33:02,850
And of course, I saw that you controlled for the age.

790
01:33:03,060 --> 01:33:11,549
Yeah, I could understand that age is related to cognition because cognition decline is somehow a process.

791
01:33:11,550 --> 01:33:16,140
But could you explain how age is somehow related to that for.

792
01:33:17,700 --> 01:33:19,950
Yeah, absolutely. So at least to my knowledge, too,

793
01:33:19,950 --> 01:33:28,769
I think food security varies over the lifespan due to the fact that like socioeconomic status also does sort of vary throughout the lifespan.

794
01:33:28,770 --> 01:33:31,870
And so we don't want an employment status.

795
01:33:31,870 --> 01:33:33,570
So for example, when one retires,

796
01:33:33,780 --> 01:33:39,600
one's likely to have maybe less food security than they were if they were to have that more consistent job and income.

797
01:33:40,290 --> 01:33:46,920
But also, you could think of it the other way. So once folks do have retirement and coming in, like, are they more food insecure with those benefits?

798
01:33:47,340 --> 01:33:48,000
And I will say,

799
01:33:48,660 --> 01:33:56,400
Dr. Kobayashi is doing a lot of research with some of the food benefits that are older for older adults and are sort of eligible for it.

800
01:33:57,150 --> 01:34:08,590
But it's it's really interesting. So everybody else followed.

801
01:34:08,590 --> 01:34:12,620
My question for me was like,

802
01:34:12,730 --> 01:34:19,840
I was interested in this part about objective measures of diet quality because I think sometimes in measures of food insecurity,

803
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:23,290
not your measure specifically, but like the definition that you put up.

804
01:34:23,650 --> 01:34:27,580
Doesn't it also include not having access to the kinds of foods you want?

805
01:34:27,610 --> 01:34:35,499
Mm hmm. Yeah. And so I always wonder, like, with that kind of question, which, again, isn't really a problem for your study, but like,

806
01:34:35,500 --> 01:34:41,650
if you're thinking that the underlying mechanism is about micronutrient availability,

807
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:47,310
like not having access to the foods you want may not necessarily be associated with that.

808
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:50,800
And so I always wonder if there's another mechanism to like,

809
01:34:51,280 --> 01:35:00,610
is it stressful to people to not be able to eat what they want to eat and can that have impacts that operate like outside of nutritional pathways?

810
01:35:00,670 --> 01:35:02,520
Oh definitely. I thought about access as well.

811
01:35:02,530 --> 01:35:10,989
Even I how that could come into play and also how that would even be asked to folks, which I did a little bit more research and tried to find,

812
01:35:10,990 --> 01:35:15,760
but I wasn't able to find a good study that did that efficiently, but that looked at both,

813
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:22,360
yes, the nutritional and like access as well as more of those qualitative questions I guess.

814
01:35:22,750 --> 01:35:26,680
Yeah, I know like in Hans has questions about food insecurity,

815
01:35:26,680 --> 01:35:34,750
but I think it's that one that like asks about all like all different kinds of reasons why you would be classified as food insecure.

816
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:42,770
And then they do have more of that like, you know, nutrition, like data on nutrition.

817
01:35:43,420 --> 01:35:46,180
So it might be like a source where you could look at that,

818
01:35:46,180 --> 01:35:53,110
but it doesn't I don't think that it has it might have some cognition measures, but I'm not sure what they are.

819
01:35:53,110 --> 01:35:57,460
And of course, it's cross-sectional. So there's a lot of things now interesting for sure.

820
01:35:58,260 --> 01:36:06,860
Think. Okay.

821
01:36:07,410 --> 01:36:17,020
Justin. Oh, he's ready. You want to go over with one of those people?

822
01:36:38,690 --> 01:36:44,060
All right. Hey, everyone. So my presentation is going to be on widespread pain and adolescence, the world of puberty.

823
01:36:44,420 --> 01:36:50,240
And that included in that title is also just some other symptom domains that have been associated with widespread pain in the past as well.

824
01:36:51,110 --> 01:36:53,489
Just for full disclosure to this isn't my only project,

825
01:36:53,490 --> 01:36:59,000
but this is also a project that I have been working on throughout the semester, so I have some familiarity with it already.

826
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:05,710
So just for some signposting of where we're going today, so I'll begin by talking about some background information about pain,

827
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:11,270
other symptoms related to pain, and some sex differences that we see in the data specific aim for this proposal.

828
01:37:11,270 --> 01:37:17,390
The data set I'll be using to answer these aims the statistical approach as well as the timeline for the overall project as a whole.

829
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:23,900
So just more like that broad kind of question to begin simply what is pain?

830
01:37:24,620 --> 01:37:30,170
So pain is not one size fits all. There is not one mechanism that describes all pain.

831
01:37:30,530 --> 01:37:36,680
Instead, there are various mechanisms that can price the different types of pain that have different types of treatments and causes.

832
01:37:37,400 --> 01:37:44,150
One that we're probably all more familiar with is Gnosis After Pain, which is due to inflammation or damage in the joints potentially due to injury.

833
01:37:44,720 --> 01:37:50,690
And this is your headache that you typically have or injuries that you may have had, you know, playing sports or for other things as well.

834
01:37:51,020 --> 01:37:54,950
You know, typically you might just take like an ibuprofen and be good over a short period of time.

835
01:37:55,430 --> 01:38:01,520
It can also be shown in chronic pain as well, which we can see in osteoarthritis and other types of pain.

836
01:38:01,700 --> 01:38:10,220
Also, there's also neuropathic pain. So we see this in patients that maybe have a diabetes where we see a damage or a of peripheral nerves.

837
01:38:10,940 --> 01:38:17,420
And one type of pain that we might not be as familiar with is centralize pain, which will be the focus of my proposal.

838
01:38:17,870 --> 01:38:21,320
So central is pain is the pain that we kind of associate with fibromyalgia.

839
01:38:22,130 --> 01:38:25,220
It is caused by central disturbances in pain processing.

840
01:38:25,220 --> 01:38:33,860
And some researchers have coined this as brain pain. So centralized or widespread pain can be thought of as historically individuals.

841
01:38:33,860 --> 01:38:36,380
With these conditions or widespread pain, fibromyalgia,

842
01:38:37,130 --> 01:38:44,540
they typically were dismissed and faced stigma in medical settings because when they went to a doctor and doctors ran tests or took X-rays,

843
01:38:44,840 --> 01:38:48,080
it appears that there's nothing actually wrong with them, even though they feel pain.

844
01:38:48,590 --> 01:38:52,579
So we can think of this as like somebody getting an x ray on like a knee and

845
01:38:52,580 --> 01:38:55,760
the rheumatologist see that there's still cartilage in that joint and saying,

846
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:59,060
Well, there's nothing wrong with you, but in reality they feel pain.

847
01:39:01,310 --> 01:39:07,460
So going back to that thought of centralized pain being a brain processing problem,

848
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:12,860
we can think of centralized pain as an increased volume setting in the processing system.

849
01:39:12,860 --> 01:39:16,970
So a good analogy is a guitar with an amplifier attached.

850
01:39:17,720 --> 01:39:23,540
Some of us might have amplifier settings that are set low and we are not really susceptible to pain, generally speaking.

851
01:39:23,540 --> 01:39:30,680
And for others of us, little touches, bright lights and even loud sounds can cause us discomfort and pain.

852
01:39:31,580 --> 01:39:34,790
Additionally, widespread pain is not thought to be strictly binary.

853
01:39:35,930 --> 01:39:43,280
Many people have symptoms that are on this fibromyalgia mass scale, so we can also look at this in more of a continuous fashion as well.

854
01:39:44,440 --> 01:39:47,600
Now it's a more the second aspect of this proposal.

855
01:39:47,960 --> 01:39:53,690
There has been research that looked at certain clinical symptom domains that are associated with widespread pain in particular.

856
01:39:54,170 --> 01:40:03,140
So those include sleep problems and sleep disturbances. Low and behold, pain affect cognition issues as well as energy and fatigue symptoms.

857
01:40:04,940 --> 01:40:12,350
So why does this all matter? So 80% of youth with juvenile fibromyalgia will continue to have fibromyalgia symptoms into adulthood.

858
01:40:12,590 --> 01:40:17,630
And this could have obviously health mental health consequences as well as economic consequences.

859
01:40:18,590 --> 01:40:22,249
Chronic and widespread pain have also been associated with poor school performance,

860
01:40:22,250 --> 01:40:27,920
increased social isolation and activity limitations in adolescence and later on in life.

861
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:33,200
Opioid misuse has also been shown to be higher in individuals with chronic, widespread pain.

862
01:40:34,430 --> 01:40:40,730
With that said, it is believed that vulnerability to pain may be established early in life, especially in widespread pain.

863
01:40:42,590 --> 01:40:45,980
One interesting fact, which will be the main part of my proposal,

864
01:40:46,130 --> 01:40:51,170
is looking at the sex differences that arise as children move from childhood into adulthood.

865
01:40:51,590 --> 01:40:56,510
So during adolescence, boys and girls have roughly identical prevalence rates of chronic and widespread pain.

866
01:40:57,560 --> 01:41:04,790
However, in adulthood, chronic and widespread pain, as well as conditions like fibromyalgia, are twice as prevalent in women compared to men.

867
01:41:05,030 --> 01:41:12,230
And it is believed that puberty may play a role in these differences. So moving on to my specific aims of my project,

868
01:41:12,890 --> 01:41:17,570
the first thing I have is to understand clinical and social differences in children with and without widespread pain.

869
01:41:18,200 --> 01:41:24,350
And my second aim is to explore sex differences in the trajectories of widespread pain as the participants transition through puberty.

870
01:41:25,220 --> 01:41:26,870
It's a kind of dig into this a little bit more.

871
01:41:26,870 --> 01:41:32,750
I just have some basic statistical analysis that I just want to mention real quick and how I anticipate these aims would be addressed.

872
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:38,659
So for M one, we would use cross-sectional data to conduct analysis to understand the associations

873
01:41:38,660 --> 01:41:42,740
between these clinical symptom domains and widespread pain in adolescence.

874
01:41:43,340 --> 01:41:46,760
And we also used longitudinal data analysis to understand if these symptom

875
01:41:46,760 --> 01:41:51,620
domains are more prevalent in participants with new onset of widespread pain.

876
01:41:51,630 --> 01:41:55,850
So starting with patients who don't have widespread pain, we develop it in the future.

877
01:41:56,060 --> 01:42:03,230
And looking at those symptom domains between those two timepoints trying to we can also use cross-sectional data

878
01:42:03,230 --> 01:42:08,030
to conduct the analysis to assess interactions between sex and pubertal status as they relate to widespread pain.

879
01:42:08,810 --> 01:42:10,670
And also using longitudinal data,

880
01:42:10,670 --> 01:42:16,820
we can look to understand how pubertal trajectories predict new occurrence of widespread pain in boys and girls within the ABCD cohort.

881
01:42:17,690 --> 01:42:21,620
So I know I haven't mentioned what the ABCD cohort is, but I'll mention that here now.

882
01:42:22,010 --> 01:42:27,770
So the HCV cohort is the adolescent brain pattern development study that started about three years ago now,

883
01:42:28,190 --> 01:42:32,180
and it has 11,878 children who are ages 9 to 10 at baseline.

884
01:42:32,630 --> 01:42:37,700
The race ethnicity breakdown of this cohort is that similar to that of the US population for this

885
01:42:37,700 --> 01:42:42,019
age group and participants were enrolled at one of 21 study sites across the United States.

886
01:42:42,020 --> 01:42:47,240
So it's well distributed to get a good, generalizable sample of the United States population for this age group.

887
01:42:48,650 --> 01:42:52,969
In this survey we have demographic information such as sex, race, X, variables,

888
01:42:52,970 --> 01:42:58,280
pubertal status, and then for some of those space domain clinical symptoms,

889
01:42:58,280 --> 01:43:02,929
we can get sleep problems through a proxy measure using the youth media chronotype questionnaire,

890
01:43:02,930 --> 01:43:06,589
which reports sleep duration affect and cognition measures,

891
01:43:06,590 --> 01:43:12,049
can be assessed using the brief problem monitor and the key schedule for affective disorders and schizophrenia,

892
01:43:12,050 --> 01:43:20,570
or a case that contains measures for energy and fatigue. Also, starting at Wave two, which is the current full wave of data that we have,

893
01:43:20,810 --> 01:43:24,860
they included a pain body map that has 74 different regions on it that participants

894
01:43:24,860 --> 01:43:28,070
are able to market that had been in that region for more than three months at a time.

895
01:43:28,820 --> 01:43:33,860
They used a slightly modified version of this higher body map that has 75 sites, but for the purposes of my study,

896
01:43:33,860 --> 01:43:39,410
will eliminate the mountain just because there's some other complexities associated with that in terms of the study.

897
01:43:40,430 --> 01:43:43,370
So looking over to the statistical approach that we'll be taking,

898
01:43:43,880 --> 01:43:50,660
so we'll be using the 2016 American College of Rheumatology guidelines for Fibromyalgia to assess why therapy in the ABC cohort.

899
01:43:51,170 --> 01:43:56,390
These guidelines put the body into 19 regions, which we didn't map those 74 acquired body map regions to.

900
01:43:57,230 --> 01:44:02,750
If a participant recorded seven more, seven or more of these regions, we would classify them as having widespread pain.

901
01:44:03,230 --> 01:44:09,620
And this will allow us to look at why throat pain both as binary seven or more, as well as a continuous variable 0 to 19.

902
01:44:11,470 --> 01:44:16,660
For the binary prediction, we will utilize logistic regression and due to the strong rates value of the data,

903
01:44:16,670 --> 01:44:20,110
zero inflated model, either negative binomial or cosine will be employed.

904
01:44:20,680 --> 01:44:27,729
Covariance that we anticipate to be using would be sex, race and latent variable pubertal status, sleep duration, internal problems,

905
01:44:27,730 --> 01:44:33,550
external problems, force attention scores, fatigue symptoms and most like an interaction term between sex and pubertal status.

906
01:44:35,050 --> 01:44:40,630
This is my conceptual diagram. It is, I think, somewhat of a work in progress.

907
01:44:40,780 --> 01:44:43,959
So we see certain associations that we would anticipate,

908
01:44:43,960 --> 01:44:49,810
such as sex predicted pubertal status and some of these other demographic variables predicting or some of our symptom domains.

909
01:44:49,810 --> 01:44:54,100
I kind of just incorporate them all in one little bubble there, just for simplicity's sake.

910
01:44:54,610 --> 01:44:59,439
The one thing that I do want to kind of mention is that we do see a bi directional relationship between widespread

911
01:44:59,440 --> 01:45:03,850
pain and symptom domains that would be important to think about when we're actually modeling this data.

912
01:45:05,870 --> 01:45:12,589
So for a proposed timeline, we would be looking at doing cross-sectional analysis well this year,

913
01:45:12,590 --> 01:45:16,880
but obviously kind of getting to the end of this year, addressing some of those cross-sectional aims.

914
01:45:17,060 --> 01:45:25,410
I mean, cross-sectional analysis, any more than two. Then during our wave three, we would actually get our first or second year of that body mass.

915
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:30,169
We would be able to start undertaking longitudinal analysis and then four into longitudinal analysis.

916
01:45:30,170 --> 01:45:35,809
Since we're focusing on the trajectories of puberty, we just want a little bit more time to play out, to look at way for data,

917
01:45:35,810 --> 01:45:42,350
to start beginning those analysis and then assuming that the data releases actually occur at time,

918
01:45:42,350 --> 01:45:46,520
which they haven't been as of recently, and we would hope to be wrapping this up by 2025.

919
01:45:47,540 --> 01:45:59,320
So yeah, that's it. Yeah.

920
01:45:59,590 --> 01:46:03,720
I'm kind of curious about the widespread definition.

921
01:46:03,750 --> 01:46:07,900
Yeah, because it's y y squared. All right.

922
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:12,700
So I'm wondering, like, if I have several thousand.

923
01:46:13,860 --> 01:46:18,120
Yeah. So this is actually a fun little argument in the field where there's some differences

924
01:46:18,120 --> 01:46:21,660
between do we consider just musculoskeletal pain or do we consider joint pain?

925
01:46:23,130 --> 01:46:29,340
For the purposes of like my project, it wouldn't probably matter as much just because in a juvenile population, joint pain isn't that prevalent.

926
01:46:29,850 --> 01:46:35,190
But it is something interesting. And typically when in adult populations we would include the joints in those regions.

927
01:46:35,910 --> 01:46:42,290
Yeah. Yeah. And also just added a little bit to like we would talk about like like in some bike

928
01:46:42,320 --> 01:46:45,170
there's different body maps out there and everybody wants to have their own body map.

929
01:46:45,170 --> 01:46:51,650
But like for example, we might have like the right arm, like your region and then like elbows and wrists and that would be included in those regions.

930
01:46:54,790 --> 01:46:58,229
Yeah. I understand that.

931
01:46:58,230 --> 01:47:03,760
My. Yeah.

932
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:10,060
I'm. Early on the site was.

933
01:47:11,950 --> 01:47:20,650
So adolescents who have. The experience will have an early.

934
01:47:21,380 --> 01:47:27,220
Oh, I was. Like, I'm not trying to do anything.

935
01:47:27,290 --> 01:47:42,050
I like it here. I love that question because I could go on a huge tangent, but I'm happy to talk afterwards because it will be a long tangent.

936
01:47:42,320 --> 01:47:45,680
But I fully agree with you. That was just not the language used in the paper.

937
01:47:46,610 --> 01:47:50,990
So if you understand what I'm kind of getting. But yeah. Yeah, no, that's great.

938
01:47:51,080 --> 01:48:03,800
Thank you. So what I think in terms of socialization is I think a lot of these slides we're talking about early adolescent boys and girls.

939
01:48:05,180 --> 01:48:08,920
So we suspect that the. What about socialization?

940
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:17,120
I presented to my. Well, there's nothing wrong with you and the socialization of being like a.

941
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:29,000
Yeah. So some of that space domain somewhat captures that a little bit.

942
01:48:30,020 --> 01:48:34,549
Another end of this project, because it is close to a real project.

943
01:48:34,550 --> 01:48:38,090
It's like a little offshoot that I kind of like changed a little bit just so it's different from the one I'm doing.

944
01:48:38,450 --> 01:48:43,790
Um, they're doing some more, like, brain imaging stuff that is interesting.

945
01:48:43,790 --> 01:48:45,580
That is way over my head. Um,

946
01:48:45,710 --> 01:48:52,340
but I think they're attempting to look at that a little bit more with that because it's the whole idea that there's probably a biological mechanism.

947
01:48:52,340 --> 01:48:57,379
But, you know, similarly, I believe it was you discussed like epigenetics a little bit to where like, you know,

948
01:48:57,380 --> 01:49:03,140
there's some socialization that might play into those biological mechanisms that, you know, we might just not fully understand it.

949
01:49:04,900 --> 01:49:09,250
Thank you. Yeah.

950
01:49:09,640 --> 01:49:14,270
So for people who haven't had an effect on. The prevalence of.

951
01:49:16,280 --> 01:49:23,910
My friend, is not a. Yeah.

952
01:49:24,180 --> 01:49:30,060
So that is one potential explanation that, like research has shown is that hormonal differences,

953
01:49:30,330 --> 01:49:37,710
there's a belief that potential the like based on what age somebody initiates puberty that that might be a main driver of this.

954
01:49:38,100 --> 01:49:43,770
And as we know that women girls tend to start puberty earlier than males, we believe that might be the case.

955
01:49:43,770 --> 01:49:45,899
So that's why like looking at like the trajectories,

956
01:49:45,900 --> 01:49:54,960
it might be interesting to see like does the stage of puberty that a male is in also predict widespread pain, for example?

957
01:50:04,030 --> 01:50:07,370
Could you go back to your slide shows the three types of pain. Yeah.

958
01:50:09,610 --> 01:50:13,870
So I have two questions about that. So centralized pain.

959
01:50:14,480 --> 01:50:21,070
Um, so it's more you may not know this, but I'm wondering if long COVID is thought to be.

960
01:50:21,070 --> 01:50:27,070
It's still not well characterized. Is that thought to be a type of centralized condition?

961
01:50:27,310 --> 01:50:34,450
And might you have people in your sample, given the timing of data collection that are experiencing a bit of an interesting one?

962
01:50:34,450 --> 01:50:39,010
So in this study, they have certain measures for during COVID.

963
01:50:39,040 --> 01:50:42,909
Mm hmm. I'm not sure they have diagnoses. You know, if somebody was diagnosed.

964
01:50:42,910 --> 01:50:46,809
But I know, like, the research group that I'm part of has included those types of questions in our studies.

965
01:50:46,810 --> 01:50:50,049
So although I don't know the specific answer, I would assume based on that,

966
01:50:50,050 --> 01:50:53,230
that we believe that that would be the case, that it might be kind of related.

967
01:50:53,230 --> 01:51:00,730
And then I was curious related to serious question whether opioids are like whether

968
01:51:00,730 --> 01:51:06,490
they treat centralized pain because I think like they don't treat nerve pain.

969
01:51:06,490 --> 01:51:09,910
Right. So that's where my focus. Yeah. Yeah.

970
01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:15,129
So of the pain, I'm sorry for a little bit, but like usually your NSAIDs,

971
01:51:15,130 --> 01:51:20,290
your ibuprofen and things like that and then opioids a little bit and then for neuropathic pain, that's your gabapentin Lyrica.

972
01:51:20,290 --> 01:51:28,029
So there's nerve medications for centralized pain, mostly central nervous system acting drugs where opioids do not work great in this population.

973
01:51:28,030 --> 01:51:33,099
But in reality, like a lot of these different drug treatments only work for like 30% of people anyway.

974
01:51:33,100 --> 01:51:36,730
So like most of these therapies, if you really want to get down to it, are all kind of crappy.

975
01:51:37,270 --> 01:51:42,729
So that's kind of the main problem. But I centralize pain. I kind of talk about like that bidirectional relationship.

976
01:51:42,730 --> 01:51:45,850
So but we've also noticed it's just like certainly cognitive behavioral therapy

977
01:51:45,850 --> 01:51:48,399
is actually a great thing because if you can help somebody get better sleep,

978
01:51:48,400 --> 01:51:51,190
that would also help with their pain and help them get more physically active.

979
01:51:51,190 --> 01:51:55,230
It also helps with their pain and that kind of like, you know, domino effect.

980
01:51:56,080 --> 01:52:02,409
Yeah, I just wondered if that had a little bit to do with the language around misuse of opioids and the other studies.

981
01:52:02,410 --> 01:52:06,620
Like if they aren't super effective, then maybe not. Anyway, thank you.

982
01:52:07,090 --> 01:52:13,910
Thank you for sharing that. And you know most.

983
01:52:45,400 --> 01:52:46,540
All right. Hello, everyone.

984
01:52:46,960 --> 01:52:56,320
I will be presenting today on a hypothetical story exploring the association between post-COVID-19 condition or long haul COVID and opioid use.

985
01:52:57,070 --> 01:52:59,889
So I wanted to disclose that this is kind of not my alley,

986
01:52:59,890 --> 01:53:04,570
but it is modeled after some of the study designs and data collection that I'm using for my elite.

987
01:53:06,160 --> 01:53:10,780
So it's just an overview of what I'll cover today in terms of background information.

988
01:53:10,780 --> 01:53:13,929
I'm going to fly through some of the general background information about COVID 19,

989
01:53:13,930 --> 01:53:18,550
just because I'm sure a lot of you have this amount of exposure to that thus far.

990
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:23,230
So COVID 19 is a respiratory virus caused by SARS-CoV-2.

991
01:53:23,830 --> 01:53:29,470
There's a wide range of illness. Severity that it can cause can be mild to severe or even deadly.

992
01:53:29,740 --> 01:53:35,050
And certain co-morbidities put people at higher risk of severe outcomes from COVID.

993
01:53:35,620 --> 01:53:40,690
But in March of 2020 was when COVID was declared as a global pandemic from the W.H.O.

994
01:53:41,170 --> 01:53:47,800
And then there have been a wide variety of stressors that have had physical, mental and emotional health implications as a result.

995
01:53:49,150 --> 01:53:58,120
So this is just a timeline of COVID 19. So there is a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, in December of 2019,

996
01:53:58,660 --> 01:54:05,530
and it was first identified as a novel coronavirus in early 2020 and then spread kind of continued across the world

997
01:54:05,530 --> 01:54:13,420
until mid March 2020 when it was declared a global pandemic and shutdowns started to occur in the United States.

998
01:54:14,050 --> 01:54:19,210
And then it wasn't until December of 2020 that vaccines began to be rolled out.

999
01:54:20,620 --> 01:54:31,420
So there are 639 million confirmed sorry, COVID 19 cases globally as of November 30th of this year,

1000
01:54:31,960 --> 01:54:38,350
and over 97 million cases in the United States with more than 2.5 million of those being in the state of Michigan.

1001
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:44,290
So these are some examples of these social emotional stressors that have resulted from COVID,

1002
01:54:44,560 --> 01:54:49,000
such as unemployment, financial hardship, loss of a loved one.

1003
01:54:49,300 --> 01:54:54,030
So social isolation and physical health outcomes as well as food insecurity.

1004
01:54:55,660 --> 01:55:00,100
So one instance of how this has impacted individuals is unemployment.

1005
01:55:00,490 --> 01:55:04,240
So this is just an example of how substantial the impacts have been.

1006
01:55:04,750 --> 01:55:15,010
So unemployment in Michigan was at 4.1% in January of 2020 and then in April of 2020, after lockdowns were instituted, that jumped up to 22.7%.

1007
01:55:16,790 --> 01:55:21,280
Moving on to kind of some of the more physical effects of COVID 19 long haul conditions.

1008
01:55:21,850 --> 01:55:28,000
You know, there's been findings of ongoing health problems that have lasted for weeks, months or even longer than that.

1009
01:55:28,660 --> 01:55:35,350
And this has been arising after COVID infection of any severity, even mild conditions or severe.

1010
01:55:35,350 --> 01:55:41,290
People who even have been asymptomatic didn't realize they had COVID, have, you know, experienced long haul symptoms.

1011
01:55:41,290 --> 01:55:47,079
So research is still being understood as to the mechanisms underlying long COVID and

1012
01:55:47,080 --> 01:55:51,880
symptoms range from like brain fog to heart palpitations and even more severe outcomes.

1013
01:55:53,440 --> 01:55:59,050
These these impacts may be mild or they can cause significant disruptions among an individual's life.

1014
01:55:59,530 --> 01:56:05,859
And there has been evidence of multi-organ system impacts and even development of autoimmune conditions as well.

1015
01:56:05,860 --> 01:56:10,330
So the impacts are pretty substantial on the individuals who are experiencing these conditions.

1016
01:56:12,010 --> 01:56:13,719
So a lot of people are experiencing this.

1017
01:56:13,720 --> 01:56:21,670
One in 13 adults in the United States have reported symptoms of long haul COVID across studies that have been conducted.

1018
01:56:21,910 --> 01:56:25,780
And then nearly one of every five adults in the United States who have tested positive

1019
01:56:25,780 --> 01:56:30,720
for COVID 19 are reported to be living with symptoms of post-COVID condition.

1020
01:56:32,830 --> 01:56:37,060
Moving on to opioid use, this is an epidemic that has been expanding.

1021
01:56:37,690 --> 01:56:41,140
So opioids may consist of prescription drugs like painkillers.

1022
01:56:41,560 --> 01:56:46,900
Oxycodone is a common one, or they also include illicit drugs like heroin or fentanyl.

1023
01:56:47,470 --> 01:56:51,400
So opioid use in the United States really increased in the 1990s.

1024
01:56:51,640 --> 01:56:55,690
Pharmaceutical companies were initially marketing these as not addictive,

1025
01:56:55,960 --> 01:57:00,880
but as we've seen, they are highly addictive and use as increased oversight process.

1026
01:57:01,720 --> 01:57:04,390
So there's been an increase in synthetic opioid use.

1027
01:57:04,750 --> 01:57:16,220
And then opioid overdose may also cause blockage among receptors in the brain, and that causes decreased oxygen availability and ultimately death.

1028
01:57:17,080 --> 01:57:21,970
There's been a tenfold increase in opiate overdose deaths in Michigan in particular since 2000.

1029
01:57:23,140 --> 01:57:26,710
So this is just a graph that illustrates how use has really increased.

1030
01:57:27,370 --> 01:57:30,700
So you can kind of see the history of that use was increasing over time.

1031
01:57:31,030 --> 01:57:38,320
But if you take a look at about 2019, 2020 when COVID started, it kind of impacted the United States.

1032
01:57:38,410 --> 01:57:43,000
That's when you really see that substantial take off in opioid use and overdose deaths.

1033
01:57:45,290 --> 01:57:53,209
So kind of understanding the background behind why we would want to study post-COVID-19 and opioid use is that post-COVID-19?

1034
01:57:53,210 --> 01:57:59,870
There's a variety of physical and mental health impacts, though these are difficult to diagnose and manage due to limited research.

1035
01:58:00,680 --> 01:58:08,210
So I'm hypothesizing that the increase in opioid use that we are seeing may potentially be associated with

1036
01:58:08,630 --> 01:58:13,040
kind of some of the post-COVID conditions that we are seeing just because they're not being managed as well.

1037
01:58:13,040 --> 01:58:18,680
So people may be turning to illicit opioids, for instance, to manage their symptoms.

1038
01:58:19,310 --> 01:58:23,030
So there's kind of an existing gap in the research of we're seeing this really substantial

1039
01:58:23,030 --> 01:58:27,650
increase in opioid related outcomes like overdose since the onset of the COVID 19 pandemic.

1040
01:58:28,310 --> 01:58:29,450
Why is that the case?

1041
01:58:29,780 --> 01:58:37,910
I'm trying to study for this hypothetical study to kind of understand is there an association between post-COVID conditions and opioid usage?

1042
01:58:39,830 --> 01:58:47,510
So this is my conceptual model. You see our exposure of post-COVID condition and then our outcome of opioid related use.

1043
01:58:48,140 --> 01:58:53,000
Some kind of proposing that there may be two mechanisms through which this association is occurring.

1044
01:58:53,360 --> 01:59:00,530
One, through the physical symptoms, people may be turning to opioids more to whether they're prescribed or not prescribed to

1045
01:59:00,530 --> 01:59:05,060
manage their physical symptoms like pain and just other symptoms of post-COVID condition,

1046
01:59:05,930 --> 01:59:09,709
as well as they may be managing their symptoms of decreased mental health status.

1047
01:59:09,710 --> 01:59:14,150
So there's evidence that post-COVID condition causes anxiety and depression.

1048
01:59:14,780 --> 01:59:18,410
So that also is associated with increased opioid use.

1049
01:59:18,470 --> 01:59:24,410
So that's another potential mechanism there. So also confounders like race, socio economic status,

1050
01:59:24,410 --> 01:59:33,110
gender and sex and then post-COVID condition is also influenced by vaccine status and comorbidities from COVID.

1051
01:59:35,150 --> 01:59:41,390
So jumping into the study aims, the first aim is to really just evaluate the odds of opiate related outcomes

1052
01:59:41,750 --> 01:59:46,610
among those with a post-COVID-19 condition diagnosis through Michigan medicine.

1053
01:59:47,480 --> 01:59:54,170
And then this is also comparing to those lacking a post-COVID condition diagnosis, but having a depression diagnosis.

1054
01:59:54,530 --> 01:59:59,090
So just really comparing the odds between those two groups and seeing if there may be an association between

1055
01:59:59,750 --> 02:00:07,580
post-COVID condition diagnosis and opiate related outcomes and to kind of exploring potential disparities among,

1056
02:00:08,570 --> 02:00:17,360
you know, opioid related outcomes and post-COVID condition among this racial and ethnic groups associated omics statuses.

1057
02:00:18,080 --> 02:00:22,580
And I'm kind of hypothesizing that those of lower socioeconomic status and minority

1058
02:00:22,670 --> 02:00:28,130
racial groups may be seeing increased impacts of these potential associations.

1059
02:00:29,750 --> 02:00:35,390
So in terms of design methods and timeline, this is kind of a retrospective cohort study.

1060
02:00:36,050 --> 02:00:42,470
We'll be looking at electronic health record data through Michigan Medicine and basically the study population is going

1061
02:00:42,470 --> 02:00:48,710
to be those within the Michigan medicine health system with at least one opiate related visit since August of 2020.

1062
02:00:49,100 --> 02:00:51,950
And that's with or without post COVID condition diagnosis.

1063
02:00:52,760 --> 02:01:01,250
Like I mentioned, our exposure is post-COVID condition and then the comparison group as those with depression diagnosis but no post-COVID diagnosis.

1064
02:01:02,210 --> 02:01:07,280
The outcome is opiate related outcomes and that consists of things like overdose and dependency as well.

1065
02:01:09,680 --> 02:01:19,880
So they're going to be two distinct observation periods, and that's July 2021 is when the diagnosis code for post-COVID condition was established.

1066
02:01:19,940 --> 02:01:27,080
So we'll be observing for a year with those and then the outcomes will be observed for all year 2022 through January 2023 after that.

1067
02:01:28,130 --> 02:01:33,500
So data is going to be extracted through data direct and using ICD ten diagnosis codes.

1068
02:01:34,520 --> 02:01:41,690
Like I said that we have those two kind of observation periods, the initial diagnosis for the exposure and then that follow up for the outcome.

1069
02:01:42,290 --> 02:01:45,320
And then we'll be using logistic regression to track the odds for these.

1070
02:01:46,070 --> 02:01:51,560
This is just an example of the ICD ten codes for opioid use that would be used.

1071
02:01:52,580 --> 02:01:55,700
And then this is kind of just the main overall question is are the odds of

1072
02:01:55,700 --> 02:01:59,780
opioid related outcomes higher among those with post-COVID condition diagnosis?

1073
02:02:00,860 --> 02:02:07,100
Like I said, we have that initial observation period and then that follow up period to observe those opioid related outcomes.

1074
02:02:07,730 --> 02:02:10,070
And then this is kind of when the data extraction would occur.

1075
02:02:11,630 --> 02:02:21,080
And finally, some of the strains of this is using ICD ten codes, kind of reduces some of the bias that other self-reported measures may introduce.

1076
02:02:21,080 --> 02:02:25,040
And then having those two distinct observation periods for the exposure and outcomes

1077
02:02:25,040 --> 02:02:29,090
kind of helps establish some of the temporal temporality of those associations.

1078
02:02:30,350 --> 02:02:35,989
One of the weaknesses is that opioid use in general is kind of broad, so using opioid related outcomes,

1079
02:02:35,990 --> 02:02:40,370
such as overdose as a proxy for this may not fully represent use generally.

1080
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:46,280
And then diagnosis of post-COVID condition may not be comprehensive because research is still being conducted.

1081
02:02:47,060 --> 02:02:52,790
So that's kind of a novel thing and we're still learning about that. And then the smell expert.

1082
02:02:52,790 --> 02:03:00,680
But some of the projections, this is secondary data. So minimum risk is expected for participants in the study.

1083
02:03:01,520 --> 02:03:15,340
Lots of questions. Your.

1084
02:03:24,050 --> 02:03:35,720
Why did you choose to come here with the first quarter diagnosis to those without but in the control room they have they for depression diagnosis?

1085
02:03:35,960 --> 02:03:37,130
Yes, that's a good question.

1086
02:03:37,460 --> 02:03:45,620
Essentially, I chose this because there's kind of prior knowledge that there's an association between, you know, like mental health and opioid use.

1087
02:03:46,340 --> 02:03:52,490
So kind of using that as a comparison group will help to kind of tease out whether like, you know,

1088
02:03:52,730 --> 02:04:03,889
if the association between post-COVID condition and opioid use is kind of operating through that mental health outcome.

1089
02:04:03,890 --> 02:04:10,770
And then yeah, I guess like. Does it make sense?

1090
02:04:10,800 --> 02:04:15,810
Yeah. Sorry, that was a really bad explanation. But just kind of comparing to like what the association that's already known.

1091
02:04:15,810 --> 02:04:20,730
So like we're trying to distinguish whether like for sure is that pathway between post-COVID

1092
02:04:20,730 --> 02:04:25,510
and not because a lot of people with post-COVID condition may also have mental diagnoses.

1093
02:04:25,510 --> 02:04:31,640
So. We talked about that.

1094
02:04:34,400 --> 02:04:38,180
Adrian. Yeah, that's a good question.

1095
02:04:38,780 --> 02:04:45,920
I don't really have any exclusion criteria for this study. It's basically just like whether they have those ICD ten code diagnoses present.

1096
02:04:47,300 --> 02:04:53,959
I mean, typically I think LONG-COVID has been more so diagnosed in like adults rather than pediatrics.

1097
02:04:53,960 --> 02:04:57,470
But yeah, there isn't really a specific age category.

1098
02:04:57,470 --> 02:05:14,590
It's just whether those diagnosis codes are present or not. Oh, no, go ahead.

1099
02:05:16,320 --> 02:05:21,760
Okay. So I'm still stuck on this idea from the last presentation that relates to this one,

1100
02:05:21,760 --> 02:05:27,310
too, about whether doctors are prescribing opioids like pain relievers.

1101
02:05:27,340 --> 02:05:31,149
Yeah. So could you could you look at that and your sample?

1102
02:05:31,150 --> 02:05:34,620
Because I didn't see anything about prescription. Yeah.

1103
02:05:34,630 --> 02:05:43,690
So that definitely is a consideration, I guess, from what I've learned with my Eileen process.

1104
02:05:43,840 --> 02:05:50,770
One of the outcomes we're looking at is opioid use. It's a little bit more complicated in terms of data collection to get that information

1105
02:05:51,580 --> 02:05:55,240
because you kind of have to go into the records and get that specific prescription data.

1106
02:05:55,510 --> 02:06:00,100
So it's a definite possibility. I would just add something like time and other requirements to the study.

1107
02:06:00,730 --> 02:06:03,730
But yeah, that would definitely be a better measure of like opiate use in general,

1108
02:06:03,730 --> 02:06:08,310
whereas this kind of looking at more like poor outcomes, like overdose and that kind of thing.

1109
02:06:08,320 --> 02:06:13,960
So can you go to your slide that showed that trends in the different opioids?

1110
02:06:15,100 --> 02:06:24,010
Yes. This is you know, this this is not due to any opioid, other synthetic commonly prescribed.

1111
02:06:26,220 --> 02:06:32,130
Okay. So the commonly prescribed deaths are pretty flat.

1112
02:06:32,370 --> 02:06:45,720
Yeah. Okay. Um, so one other question I had, and I think you address this in your limitations, like these outcomes overdose and abuse.

1113
02:06:46,620 --> 02:06:51,030
Do you think these will be captured in the medical record?

1114
02:06:52,920 --> 02:06:59,310
Um, yes, because I would see. But I guess it's not like comprehensive in the sense that, like, some people are going to be missed.

1115
02:06:59,360 --> 02:07:08,550
Yeah. But at the same time, if somebody is having, you know, symptoms of dependency or like overdose, they're going to be likely to seek care.

1116
02:07:09,220 --> 02:07:15,690
Um, so I guess it's not going to capture like dust so much maybe, or just like milder outcomes.

1117
02:07:15,690 --> 02:07:21,240
But like typically if somebody is overdosing, then they are, you know, seeking care.

1118
02:07:21,450 --> 02:07:24,870
So I would say, you know, ideally they would be captured. And again,

1119
02:07:24,870 --> 02:07:32,759
this is something I'm using for my earlier and I guess like going back to using like these outcomes instead of like prescription

1120
02:07:32,760 --> 02:07:41,760
use is I'm kind of hypothesizing that people are turning to more non prescription opioid use as a result of long-covid conditions.

1121
02:07:42,240 --> 02:07:49,980
Just because there isn't so much diagnosis happening like with Long-covid, there's it's still becoming more routinized.

1122
02:07:50,340 --> 02:07:56,190
So I think people are more so turning to, you know, use on their own rather than being prescribed opioids.

1123
02:07:56,190 --> 02:08:12,659
So that's another reason why that. Okay.

1124
02:08:12,660 --> 02:08:17,190
So I just had one announcement before we end.

1125
02:08:17,550 --> 02:08:25,290
Um, the course evaluation surveys are open now, so please, please fill those out.

1126
02:08:25,290 --> 02:08:27,600
And I'll tell you two things about that. One.

1127
02:08:27,960 --> 02:08:36,720
Starting this year, the student services team and I are going to be going through all course evaluations for the department,

1128
02:08:36,720 --> 02:08:46,500
for all classes in the department, reading all of the all the comments that you guys put in there so that we can identify if there are

1129
02:08:46,860 --> 02:08:52,439
faculty who are doing a really great job teaching and we want to recognize them and acknowledge that.

1130
02:08:52,440 --> 02:09:00,480
Or if we see patterns in the in the evaluations that suggest that there is a problem or an issue that we need to address.

1131
02:09:01,170 --> 02:09:06,569
So we will definitely be reading them. So it's not always a time suck.

1132
02:09:06,570 --> 02:09:13,770
It is 75% of the class completes the evaluations before next Friday's class.

1133
02:09:13,770 --> 02:09:23,790
I will bring you treats. Yes, we can negotiate the trees, although there have to be limits, because last year I was like, What do you guys want?

1134
02:09:23,860 --> 02:09:27,329
I got like eight things, so let's keep it to three.

1135
02:09:27,330 --> 02:09:34,360
So let's try to agree on three trees right now. I'm just like Rice Krispie treats.

1136
02:09:34,380 --> 02:09:43,010
Okay, I know how to do that. You're going to make. Oh, you can, right.

1137
02:09:43,250 --> 02:09:46,980
The pre-made ones are okay.

1138
02:09:47,630 --> 02:09:52,130
Okay. So we've got to vote for Rice Krispie treats. Anybody?

1139
02:09:52,130 --> 02:09:56,570
Second Rice Krispie treats. Okay, that's not enough.

1140
02:09:56,610 --> 02:09:59,750
Yes. Yes. Okay.

1141
02:09:59,780 --> 02:10:05,090
Rice Krispies. Are those really gross cereal? That's like has no flavor.

1142
02:10:05,840 --> 02:10:11,270
But when you put milk and then they kind of pop rice puffed rice.

1143
02:10:11,390 --> 02:10:15,860
Okay. Um, with it has malt in it too, which is why I can't hear it.

1144
02:10:15,860 --> 02:10:23,930
So, um. But yes. But then when you mix them with marshmallows, they become strangely delicious.

1145
02:10:24,260 --> 02:10:30,740
And so you mix it with, like, melted marshmallows, and then you put it in a pan and you cut it into squares, and they're weirdly good.

1146
02:10:31,700 --> 02:10:35,240
Yeah, they're high in sugar.

1147
02:10:36,170 --> 02:10:39,380
Yeah, they're very nice. Yeah.

1148
02:10:40,520 --> 02:10:55,819
How about fruits? Any votes for fruit? For honest honesty, you can bring treats to you want.

1149
02:10:55,820 --> 02:10:59,590
Yeah, sure. Anybody like this little oranges, but no.

1150
02:11:00,620 --> 02:11:04,040
Oh, you're like, no. Just proof candy.

1151
02:11:04,610 --> 02:11:07,760
Okay, anything else? A third. Anybody of.

1152
02:11:09,560 --> 02:11:13,900
Yes, sure. That's out there. Don't pass it out.

1153
02:11:14,630 --> 02:11:25,500
Okay. Oh, I. Okay, I'll try to do some donuts, but they're probably going to be like grocery store donuts because.

1154
02:11:27,680 --> 02:11:32,360
Equipment to look for. Okay, I'll try to figure out where to get donuts.

1155
02:11:32,900 --> 02:11:37,220
Donuts, Rice Krispie treats and fruit that nobody will eat.

1156
02:11:40,520 --> 02:11:47,600
Okay, so over fruit, can we get votes on oranges versus apples and oranges?

1157
02:11:47,630 --> 02:11:52,170
Okay, so we'll do oranges. Donuts and rice.

1158
02:11:52,250 --> 02:11:55,850
Krispy Kreme donuts. Okay.

1159
02:11:57,050 --> 02:12:04,520
All right. But but you guys have to fill out the evaluation. So go do it right now to ensure that you get these treats.

1160
02:12:05,310 --> 02:12:14,100
Okay. Yes. All right. And the reason it's impossible, because I figured it out before you say, you guys,

1161
02:12:14,120 --> 02:12:25,759
I want to get all right so you could try you can go back and you can I don't know.

1162
02:12:25,760 --> 02:12:34,430
I think you can go back in there. But yes, do them for all your classes because you will be reading them.

1163
02:12:36,950 --> 02:12:40,790
But don't write giant paragraphs because we have to read all of them just to get to the point.

1164
02:12:42,320 --> 02:12:45,620
Okay. All right. Have a good weekend. See you guys next.
