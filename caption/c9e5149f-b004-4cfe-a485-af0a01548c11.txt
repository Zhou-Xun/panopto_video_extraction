1
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:09,960
I hardly I don't say same group of words for like I'm a scientist for everybody.

2
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:28,490
But it's like we like want kind of like trying to on right now, I'm not like spying out.

3
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,550
Do you see the whole, like, soccer?

4
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:37,710
You know, I just think of the soccer game a the table. I think so.

5
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,220
I just. I don't have much to.

6
00:00:54,860 --> 00:01:04,310
I know what you're thinking.

7
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:11,730
I think it's fun. All right. Looks like a lot of people are enticed by the extra credit.

8
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,570
I have a sign in sheet for you so you can sign in, make sure they know you're here.

9
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:23,940
Today, we're going to talk about projects one, seven, eight and six.

10
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,500
And hopefully you saw my announcement yesterday that I hope you at least watch.

11
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,010
The other group who did your same projects, because I really want to talk about similarities and differences.

12
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:44,670
There were a few projects where they're very similar, but there are a bunch of projects where the idea is really deferred.

13
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:54,150
So I will maybe even make you clock here and put you on a spot project members.

14
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:01,050
So anyone who was in Project One and you all can come down here to help us with the discussion.

15
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,560
Come on down. I see your names.

16
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:19,230
We see your name. Who's here? 31.3.

17
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,780
Who else? The whole other team has copy.

18
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:30,360
Oh, just the other word is the other.

19
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,290
Your what group? Through our group. One group. A group. One who's group two.

20
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,580
Nobody from group two is here. I want you to.

21
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,310
Come on. Don't be shy.

22
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:46,190
These are your classmates. All right.

23
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:56,610
Okay. So you guys did it. You guys did some different you had different tactics in your group.

24
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:59,980
So remind everybody what your group project was about.

25
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:08,320
What phase of the study was it, phase one and what was like the thing that was different about your project?

26
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:12,249
It's a combination of two drugs. Combination of two drugs, right.

27
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:18,280
So you had one drug in there. How many dose levels and another drug in there, how many dose levels are three?

28
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:22,089
Okay. And so one group, one of your groups, right?

29
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:35,600
Group one, what did you all do? So we basically explored all nine combinations of the two treatments and we did a model for this.

30
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,530
Yeah. So you guys applied. That was what we applied to type C around, right?

31
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:46,600
Like what we had learned in phase one. And you had decided that you knew the order, right?

32
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:49,630
Of all nine combinations.

33
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:56,200
Okay. And then group two, what did you all do? So you had to mix it in the order.

34
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:03,250
But we also tried a lot of people, which is important.

35
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:13,310
You decide and the paper was published on the machines and so we tried this new medicine and compare between instances.

36
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:17,530
Okay. So, so the group two did something similar, right?

37
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:21,820
But then they compared it to something new called the tight keyboard design.

38
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:29,470
Okay. So how many of you watched one of be the phase one of these groups videos?

39
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:37,660
Well, right. Okay, great. So some of you, though, all of you, though, are familiar with height zero, right.

40
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:48,070
We learned that. We talked about it. Right. Phase one, the relationship between dose and toxicity is that as dose increases, so does toxicity.

41
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,520
Right. And so that's what both of these groups applied.

42
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:57,400
But the second group use something else called type keyboard. Can you can your group just briefly explain type keyboard?

43
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:04,030
So is instead of like a model design, it's more like a model assisted design.

44
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:16,000
It doesn't like have a model that for the time to toxicity like along all the trial is more like a models, a toxicity at a certain level.

45
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,740
And then it will compare,

46
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:28,570
it will have like posterior distribution of like a toxicity at certain level and then it will compare this with it pre specify.

47
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:35,169
So that will be the prior knowledge that that from the clinicians and then will be compared

48
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:39,760
to that and then they will decide like whether they will de-escalate or escalate.

49
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:47,800
So like different from like have a model like along all the way is more like just concentrate on one dose level.

50
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:54,600
Yes. In addition, it's kind of like somewhere in between the opposite design and that motivates people.

51
00:05:55,150 --> 00:06:07,629
It's like benefit from having a tabular of what every situation has occurred or that we can get a table.

52
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:12,550
But the model, they can see whether or not they're the ones who hit.

53
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:16,479
Yes, that was one of the is kind of like the anti pi.

54
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:23,110
Right. So we talked about where you can now this pre-specified table that makes a little bit easier now in your so use

55
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:31,239
nine the nine doses right and use the tight serum then you had a bunch of of slides of operating characteristics.

56
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,520
Were you happy with those operating characteristics?

57
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:45,870
I think based on the operating characteristic, our method of so like currently so like the MTD in every scenario.

58
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:52,910
So I think we were happy about that, but also the over dose allocation rate that some of the high.

59
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:58,200
So we might want to maybe add more safety restrictions to that.

60
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:04,650
So for any of you who watch this or for any of you maybe who are just listening right there, there is a tight zero.

61
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:10,560
There are nine doses. And how many people? 25 people.

62
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:21,180
Right. So if you were a biostatistician and you were trying to design this and you decided to go forward with the type zero nine doses,

63
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,320
which dose did you start at the first or the fourth?

64
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:31,590
Fourth, and what did you think was MTD? The last one or the middle.

65
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,879
You don't remember? That's okay. That's a hard question. Oh, right.

66
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,750
I was in the middle. Anyway, there are $9 levels. Right, and 25 patients.

67
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,260
And while you're operating, Kershaw's the one I watched.

68
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:46,889
There was a majority right out of any of them.

69
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:50,190
Your MTV was chosen most of time, but that doesn't mean it's chosen all the time.

70
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,830
Right. It was like 34 or 35%.

71
00:07:53,100 --> 00:08:00,330
Actually, to me, your operating characteristics weren't really good because it was only like a third of the time choosing an MTV.

72
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,380
Right. So what's the problem? Why is it not acting well?

73
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:09,600
You have so many doses. You so many doses and not a lot of people.

74
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:14,010
Right. 25 people and nine dose levels.

75
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,960
That's going to take that's going to be really hard to get a lot of people on.

76
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:25,560
Usually we want like at least five, six, seven, eight, nine people on an MTB and I think on average you are getting somewhere around like three.

77
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:29,210
Right. Which is not to say you guys did a bad job on your project at all.

78
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,220
You did what you did for a reason and it did looks okay.

79
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,600
But if I were you right, you couldn't do this. You couldn't go back to the investigator.

80
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:45,839
But what should you do in this case? It came up as a very different measure, which might be more effective.

81
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:53,160
But if you haven't tried those methods and one of them are.

82
00:08:53,730 --> 00:09:06,120
So for the first one, this sort of regular one stroke explanation of how we save a mortal with one minute, one say that.

83
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:15,269
Right. And we have to address we can create a three covariance model which contains the first draft of the first draft,

84
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:19,100
second draft and the interaction term. So that's one.

85
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:26,610
And the other one is use the partial ordering method, which I think explained a little.

86
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:33,180
And and the third one is use adaptive design.

87
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:38,730
Yeah. Regardless of whether this is a22 drug combination or just one drug,

88
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:45,120
if a investigator comes to you and says they're interested in nine doses, but they, Max, have 25 people, you have to say, no way.

89
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:49,170
Okay. You say no way. This is not a reasonable design.

90
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:55,680
So you either need to eliminate dose combinations or you need to increase the number of people possible

91
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:01,139
by maybe making this center right or potentially trying something else that's like more innovative,

92
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:04,410
which obviously you didn't have time to do with this project. Span Right.

93
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:08,400
That's why you couldn't get into it. That's definitely a more complex method.

94
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:12,960
But to know that those exist and that those would be reasonable alternatives, right?

95
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:18,599
So that was that was a really tough project because you had to figure out what do you do

96
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:24,360
with these two dose combinations and how do you fit that in with so few individuals?

97
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:32,160
Oh, you all did a great job and you all had some similarity, right, between your project and then they tried this extra one.

98
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:36,240
And so. All right. You also did not recommend that tight keyboard, right?

99
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,650
If I remember correctly. Yeah.

100
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:45,089
So ultimately, you said, okay, well, to type zero on itself with monotonic or the tight keyboard, we're not seeing really great results.

101
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:48,479
We might want to try something else or you would go back and argue with the investigator.

102
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:55,320
This is not something that's feasible based on the number of dose combinations and the number of people.

103
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:06,510
Did any of you who watched it or did any of you have any questions or comments for these or anybody who's listening now maybe didn't watch it?

104
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:10,870
Yeah. So I watched the two at the keyboard.

105
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:19,570
And I think my my question was you had a comparison table of like the dose selection for the type CRM and type keyboard.

106
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:25,450
And most of them were the same between the two, except one was like a little bit different and I wasn't really sure why.

107
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:31,479
Do you have any idea, like why that one dose selection was different if you don't remember the slightly?

108
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,630
Okay, but that was one thing that confused me.

109
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,790
So you mean the operating system may?

110
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:53,020
Yeah. I watched it a while ago. I know. So I guess you mean the the the one size shows the two versus the comparative operating characteristics.

111
00:11:53,050 --> 00:12:05,830
Yeah. And it's actually a similar one to how keyboard is tend to select a lower dose rather than the empty and with dual tone but because of the.

112
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:15,650
But then maybe because of we have like more stringent control for the overdosing

113
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:21,079
because we think there are only like 25 people and like for a keyboard,

114
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:29,510
it's not like a denial. Like as I see you do not like monitor like a home model is not based on all that is more like only on one dose level.

115
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:34,340
So we don't have a lot of data on that. So we don't want overdosing to happen.

116
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:43,549
So we have like a strained and if you check on the that I don't quite remember too sorry we have like two instead of one the default one,

117
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:52,850
we also have a more strained in one. So I think that may be the reason that it tend to like prone to trust the lower dose level think.

118
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:59,170
Okay. I know I put you on the spot. You do a great job.

119
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:03,280
I know not all of you don't want to come to class, which is totally fine.

120
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,249
But it's really good, right, to have not only your presentation,

121
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:12,969
but also to be able to talk about what you did in a way in which you can actually explain it to someone else,

122
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:16,960
not just in your one presentation, but in this project setting as well.

123
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:21,580
So if you took away something from this project, what would it be?

124
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:32,660
I'll quit the claim missions. Yeah, right. Competition is really important.

125
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:36,880
I also know that a lot of you were thinking about the skeleton, right?

126
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:41,030
That is the skeleton really statistical or is the skeleton really scientific?

127
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:45,740
Right. Some of you are trying to in your project, you are kind of wrestling with that, like,

128
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:52,729
do we set this up based on the statistics or do we really set it up based on what the what the clinician told us?

129
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:55,219
And that's definitely you need to go back and forth, right?

130
00:13:55,220 --> 00:14:00,890
You need to make sure that it's realistic, but also can provide good operating characteristics.

131
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:09,470
But really the making sure that it's true to scenarios and that if you choose a skeleton, it's not going to overpower the actual data.

132
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,709
Right. Is really important. Okay. All right.

133
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:15,740
Thank you. You can sit back down. You can breathe. All right. Give it up for.

134
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,920
Five. Okay.

135
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:27,710
Now we're going to go to Project seven, the multiple myeloma phase one and two.

136
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:43,890
But all of you all come up. Jesus Christ with your hands.

137
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:52,090
What is this for?

138
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:04,050
All right. Who watch these girls?

139
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:09,659
Oh, my God. Guys, this is Project seven.

140
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:13,020
Multiple myeloma, phase one two. All righty.

141
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:19,430
All right. So, remember, part of this class is learning about these other types of designs, what you're doing through the projects, right?

142
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:25,590
We have videos, and we have the ability to watch them on two times.

143
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:29,720
So it doesn't even take that much of your time to learn these things.

144
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:35,670
All right. So and also, remember, you have to do peer review, so you have to watch at least two of these.

145
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:39,050
So please make sure you do that by the 13th.

146
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:43,530
Okay. So remind us groups.

147
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:48,050
What was your project about? Anybody want to speak up?

148
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:55,020
It was a seamless phase one into design, looking at chemotherapy for multiple myeloma.

149
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:08,370
Okay. And what are some key components like what are some key characteristics of this

150
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:13,740
disease and or setting and why they might be interested in a phase one to the design.

151
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:19,350
So we have like real limited patient numbers. So that's what causes us to choose.

152
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,580
Yeah, right. Multiple myeloma, if you're not familiar, is a rare disease.

153
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:33,300
Okay. So there are not a lot of people. And so hence the, the, the desire to combine phase one and phase two.

154
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,149
And what is it about when you have a seamless design?

155
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:46,170
What makes it using less patients so they use the same patients that are on the MTD in phase one, going to the phase two.

156
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:50,970
Right. So we can use the phase one data, efficacy data, right, for the phase two part.

157
00:16:51,300 --> 00:17:02,010
And so actually your two groups had pretty different well, similar but slightly different phase one portions and also different phase two pieces.

158
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:07,980
Right. So what did your group do? I think phase one, we use the CRM asset.

159
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:22,379
Phase two, we applied the ancient design to determine two of the stopping criteria, first, for futility and secondly, stopping for efficacy.

160
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:27,750
But we do not comment to stop for efficacy because the sample size is small now

161
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:34,860
and we have a search criteria which is based on the probability of toxicity.

162
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:41,040
Very larger is and real point to the condition of the MTV those in and if the

163
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:46,799
probability is larger than the response and we may stopped the trial so yeah.

164
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:54,209
So your phase one was the serum and your phase two was the Thor enzyme invasion design and you had stopping rules for futility and toxicity.

165
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:59,970
You decided not to stop growth. Okay. And then what did your group do after phase one?

166
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:03,600
We did a type Xyrem and phase to a MINIMAX.

167
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:08,090
I'm maximum two stage design. And so one of my questions is right.

168
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:12,320
So you did you all choose the Bayesian design?

169
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:16,430
Why did you choose a Bayesian design and why did you guys choose the Minimax design?

170
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:23,600
Because I think we are in the phase two. We have a determining sample size like circuit six.

171
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:32,510
And if we use either like Simon Design or Minimax design, it might give us like six sample size,

172
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:37,700
which may not meet the criteria of six, which is given by a queen.

173
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,510
And so here we use a design which is more flexible.

174
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:49,969
What about you guys? So we chose the Minimax because we want to minimize the total sample size.

175
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:53,060
Like we mentioned, there's a limited patient population.

176
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:59,000
We also looked at whether or not we could actually meet that 36 sample size.

177
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:06,020
So we tested out different sort of power levels, type one errors, and we found one that to reach 36 patients was great.

178
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:12,310
Now, I have a question for for you. All right. So you'll notice that this team used two Bayesian designs, right?

179
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:15,700
Phase one CRM and the Bayesian phase two design.

180
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:20,570
This team used a Bayesian phase one design. Right. And a frequentist phase two design.

181
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:26,180
Can you do that? Can you mix and match these approaches? Like, is that a good idea, bad idea?

182
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:29,600
Any any feelings about that? What do you all think?

183
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:39,660
Who thinks it's totally fine to mix and match vision and frequent test designs.

184
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:52,210
You guys are like the bad guy who thinks it's a bad idea, who just really doesn't know.

185
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:57,410
What are you all doing with all your hands? What happened to your hands? I don't know.

186
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:04,480
Okay, so it's totally fine, right? We don't have to choose a design to do designs based on the framework necessarily.

187
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,010
Right. We're choosing designs based on the scientific question for choosing designs,

188
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:14,730
based on logistical constraints like sample size, rate, accrual feasibility.

189
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:18,280
What we need to make sure that we're able to interpret these designs.

190
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:25,989
We're able for the clinicians and investigators to understand these designs and that we can find robust results at the end of the day.

191
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:33,050
Right. That the approach, either if we use frequentist or Bayesian, we should come to the same conclusion, right?

192
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:38,470
It's just different approaches to problems and you can mix and match them if you want to.

193
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,130
Alternatively, you could stay within the same framework. Right.

194
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:45,880
But you have to have some justification for for doing that.

195
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:53,200
Now, the main one of the main differences I saw in your phase one, you all use CRM, you all use type zero.

196
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:56,260
So why did you think that tight CRM was?

197
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:01,380
You know, you all didn't think that there was need for a observation period, right?

198
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:04,600
I guess. And you all did. So what's the reasoning behind that?

199
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:13,299
So from the project brief, we saw that the expected accrual rate was 4 to 6 patients per month.

200
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:20,200
And I think our two groups made this reported that differently thought of it as like about one patient a

201
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:28,410
week sort of like spread out in which case accrual rate of one week and a observation period of 28 days.

202
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:32,830
The observation period is much longer than the time between patients.

203
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:38,380
It's great. Any questions for this phase one?

204
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:44,110
Yes, sir. I'm still a little bit confused about, like, the one aspect.

205
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:53,440
So when you start analyzing the phase two data before the completion of like the Phase one portion or were like, would you still wait?

206
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,930
And it's just seamless in the sense that like you're moving forward faster and you're using those patients from phase one.

207
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:06,640
Yeah. So it's the latter. So you don't actually look at the data right until the end, but you're collecting the efficacy information as you go on.

208
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:15,450
Phase one. Phase one patients. Are there more?

209
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:21,260
Did you all watch each others? Did you have any comments or findings between, you know, what was different?

210
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:26,500
What were you saying? I was also curious about our differences between the types here.

211
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:31,540
I'm a busy or just, you know, I'm curious about.

212
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:41,170
But actually we have different ideas and taking the time to observe.

213
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:54,510
And there was a period that we seem to be involved with this expansion plans for a few days,

214
00:22:54,730 --> 00:23:03,460
which is longer than you know it's an observation, eight days.

215
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:14,190
And so we think, well, so how would we be clear on like what's actually happening and whether we should use the title,

216
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:23,410
your own versus the CRM for anybody out there, how do you figure out which ones are really the appropriate one to use?

217
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:31,830
Right, because they have three different. The Ticer we use when we're not going to be able to see the toxicity right away.

218
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:35,790
Right. So how do we make sure that we're using the right design?

219
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:43,120
For instance, you could compare operating characteristics, but how else?

220
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:53,850
Yeah. You need to talk to the clinician. Right. So, again, as statisticians, we do not work in a vacuum.

221
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:58,800
We are thinking about the science the whole time. And so if we're not sure.

222
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:02,640
Right. We need to go back and ask clinician, you couldn't do that, right? They didn't exist here.

223
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:06,120
So it's not your fault you couldn't do that. You had to interpret of the error you had.

224
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:11,940
But in real life as a statistician, you need to go back and you need to make sure that you really understand the setting, right?

225
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:17,150
It's the clinical statistical versus clinical scientific setting that you need to make sure you really understand.

226
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:22,950
Can you when can you see? Right. When you're doing a phase one study, when can you see these toxicities?

227
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:28,950
Would you see them right away or would they happen over time? Would you see them before somebody else comes into the trial?

228
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:33,540
Are all the patients coming in the trial on the same day or are they accruing right over time?

229
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:37,910
Right. They almost never come in in a trial. Right. One day it's almost always right.

230
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:44,070
Somebody comes to the clinic and then we engage them in a trial and then somebody else comes to the doctor or two later, etc.

231
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:49,600
But that you have to talk to the clinician and to make sure that you really understand the settings.

232
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:56,520
All right. Any other questions? Comments. Okay, great job.

233
00:24:56,550 --> 00:25:09,510
Let's clap it out for Drew. All right.

234
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:13,500
The next one that we are going to talk about is Project eight.

235
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:29,379
The other phase one, two. So all of you, all of us, it's another thing.

236
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:40,240
Remember, I also put this on the canvas site, that part of Yellow Day, right, is that you have this ability.

237
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:46,930
It's like it's like old school Facebook, right. To like write comments and come back and provide reactions.

238
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:50,499
So a lot of you've been doing that, but a lot of you still haven't done that.

239
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,800
So I can go in and see next to your name, like how many points you've earned.

240
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:57,070
You have to earn a certain number of points to complete the project.

241
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:01,420
And so if you haven't done that reminder, that's part of the project grade as well.

242
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:08,319
And while there are various levels of comments, some of them are just like, great presentation, right?

243
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:13,930
I want a little something more, a little constructive. Like I really like X or I have this question about Y, right?

244
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:21,820
And a lot of you are doing that. So it's great. And then I've seen people comment back, if you're on the project, you, you explain like the answers.

245
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:25,750
Okay, so now we're on to another seamless phase one. Phase two, right?

246
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,730
So what was your set, disease setting or topic?

247
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:40,860
Anybody here, this one and this semester, this one that is to watch interest for to prevent the commentary.

248
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:46,510
And there's no new probably this results in one semester this one that this study.

249
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:58,989
Yeah so a seamless phase one phase two with a dream gene transfer intervention to prevent neuropathy peripheral neuropathy.

250
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:07,660
So like issues with like feeling, touching, moving that often happens from chemotherapy.

251
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:15,520
So you both had this is another example where you had very different approaches.

252
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:20,140
So which group are you guys group? 15 or 16? 60 to 60 or 15.

253
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:25,690
Okay. So what did you all do? What was your approach, your phase one and then phase two approach?

254
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:34,809
We did a seamless phase one to basically just to get more patient approval on the MTD and then

255
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:41,710
we just kind of the CRM for the first phase and then anyone that once we determine the MTD,

256
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:48,010
we collected effectiveness on every patient in phase one so that once we did a determined MTD,

257
00:27:48,010 --> 00:28:01,090
we would have that effectiveness information on our face to see remember what you did for after I was in rubber.

258
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:04,540
So you had a one arm phase two design.

259
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:09,430
Yeah. Right, right. Okay. So it wasn't randomized, it was a one arm phase two.

260
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:15,730
Okay. And what did you all do for as we did entry I, phase one.

261
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:22,660
And then we said that we can select several doses into the phase two and we used the patient random,

262
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:28,000
randomize them, assigned them to different dosing phase two.

263
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:38,319
And we also have a control. Yeah. So they had an empty and empty IV phase one which then could allow multiple doses to go into phase two.

264
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,970
Right. They chose, they essentially chose a dose and or I think it.

265
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:49,000
Did you continue your serum throughout the phase two portion or did you know so you chose the dose and went on to the phase two?

266
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,570
They allowed for multiple doses to go into phase two.

267
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:56,610
But they also you were randomizing. Did you have a control or do you just ram?

268
00:28:56,830 --> 00:29:00,890
Yeah. You had they they had a graduation rule, right,

269
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:08,680
to get into phase two and then they're randomizing between dose levels and control and you could adaptively change that probability of randomization,

270
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:13,270
right. Yeah. We were a little concerned about the patient recruitment.

271
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:17,230
I think it was like two patients per month in phase one and three patients per month in phase three.

272
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:26,590
So when we did our sample size, we looked in, it was like an incredibly long study if we like included more treatments and a control.

273
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:33,010
Okay, yeah, that makes sense. Right? So one reason why you chose a single arm was because you didn't think that you had enough.

274
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:41,320
The ability to put patients on control more would be another reason why you would choose a single arm study if we had a large control history.

275
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:49,360
Yeah, right. If you if you feel strongly that your historical control rate of the outcome is relevant, right?

276
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,349
If it's a good estimate, then you feel like, well, why put people on control?

277
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:58,090
Because I already basically know that rates right. And you all must have thought, you know what?

278
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:04,000
I'm not sure about that rate. Right. We have some estimate, but let's collect concurrent data.

279
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:10,960
Right. So that's one of the reasons for why you would choose a single arm study over a randomized study.

280
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:18,340
Right. The belief in the historical control rate and also your ability to run the trial feasibly, right.

281
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:27,270
With the sample size could be something that comes into play. So I think you're.

282
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:32,490
Did your group had did you guys have a stop for.

283
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:35,690
For futility and efficacy? Yeah.

284
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:39,930
Stop. Yeah. You all had a visual approach so you could stop for futility and efficacy.

285
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:44,550
And did you all know that's not enough?

286
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:55,259
But you did not have of stop in there is right you had to go a standard single arm design if I remember correctly.

287
00:30:55,260 --> 00:31:03,629
Right where you are going to go. The whole the whole way. However, I do believe that you had potential to stop for one toxicity.

288
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:10,320
Yes, right. You could stop for safety. And that is right in this setting.

289
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:13,649
Very important. Right. This is a gene therapy.

290
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:17,820
And what's what are some potential issues with gene therapy intervention?

291
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:25,230
Do you all remember when you were looking at gene therapies? Ours in particular is like delivered by a herpes virus vector.

292
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:31,290
So you might have a strong immunogenic response just to the virus itself.

293
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:39,489
And then. I think long term there's also just concerns for latency like reactivation of virus.

294
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:41,920
So kind of staying longer than we want to stay.

295
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:53,090
And then also ability for viruses to insert DNA into the genome into a random spot so it could disrupt certain genes and potentially cause cancer.

296
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:58,860
Yeah, right. Here's your treatment. Setting is quite different than anything we've talked about.

297
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:04,389
Usually we're talking about something like chemotherapy or some, I don't know, drug you can take.

298
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:12,790
Right. But they actually have a very unique setting. This this treatment was delivered via a dream gene transfers or putting in this dormant

299
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:18,999
herpes virus that that's going to try to change what is going on inside of you.

300
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:27,219
And we while right we can run a trial because we think it's safe, there could be these issues, particularly longer term,

301
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:34,660
that we're not going to be able to view necessarily here, that we want to be very careful and or if there are short term safety reasons.

302
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:42,000
Right. We want to have this continuous monitoring of safety and or built in safety rules.

303
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:50,319
So those are those are all very important. I think there is something interesting about this portion, too.

304
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:58,719
I believe in the phase two. There was it said in there that there is a relatively large loss to follow up or potential dropout rate.

305
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:10,300
Right. You all remember that. So how did you guys handle that or how do you think you would need to handle that if you didn't address it?

306
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:18,040
Just increase the sample size. Yeah. Yeah. So you all right? And when we talked about sample size, we said, okay, now if you expect Lost to follow up,

307
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:25,030
you would want to inflate your sample size and so that you can ensure at the end you have the evaluable patients that you require.

308
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:28,840
Did you all take it into account? You also inflated the sample size.

309
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:38,709
Yeah. Now inflating the sample size is important to have the participants at the end for whom you want to make this this conclusion about.

310
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:47,200
Right. But what, what are some potential effects of having participants start this trial and then dropping out?

311
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:51,310
For anybody, this team or. Yeah.

312
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:58,840
So I was also concerned about the dropout rate because it's a chemotherapy and people sometimes drop out because like Ed,

313
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:11,830
it didn't work or it makes them feel worse or they just go on to continue or it it just maybe like go going so bad that it cannot continue.

314
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:20,080
I think it's necessary to like for the job up personal to reach out again to get the real reason why they jump up.

315
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:25,339
Sure, sure. Yeah. Right. So one issue why people might drop out in chemotherapy or gene transfer.

316
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:33,520
It might be the toxicity or side effects. Right. Which is maybe so we wouldn't get efficacy information but says something about this treatment.

317
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,159
So it's very important to understand why they drop out. Yeah.

318
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:45,760
Sarah Weren't they also trying to do like a really long term follow up because of the gene therapy to make sure that like the virus didn't reactivate

319
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:56,680
because there's any follow up five years of annual in-person observation and then additional ten years of either in-person or questionnaire follow up.

320
00:34:57,130 --> 00:35:00,910
But yeah, that's something that needs to be included from patient recruitment.

321
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:08,590
So like informing the patient. So they just so a lot of the like phase one, phase two that we talked about, right seemed like they're very short,

322
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:17,499
but they can potentially the drugs can go or the interventions can go along in the process while continuing to collect this long term safety data.

323
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:24,310
But it could graduate from phase two and go into phase three while collecting that data, but you want to be very careful collecting it.

324
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:32,770
So what are what are some given that 30 to 40 can drop out if those were all due to toxicity?

325
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:43,210
If we find that this you know, we find a dose level and we find that it looks efficacious, are we worried about it or we just move forward?

326
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:49,870
What do you think? So in our design involves like phase one and two,

327
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:58,560
we pre-specified the efficacy rate and toxicity rate that we can accept and they didn't meet the requirement.

328
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:02,020
They would not be able to graduate from phase 1 to 2.

329
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:06,790
And in phase two, we're still kind of observing the toxicity.

330
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:21,280
So that's a lot of kind of method to help to prevent those patients who entering the phase two to experience some bad syndromes because of their.

331
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:30,230
Yeah. Right. So the seamless design allows us to collect both efficacy and toxicity.

332
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:40,070
And while perhaps it's your I think your design maybe came slightly closer to this, although you are you are continuously monitoring toxicity as well.

333
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:45,860
Right? There is the possibility that you could jointly model toxicity and efficacy.

334
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:54,229
And maybe that's an outcome that joint modeling of these outcomes is more important than necessarily just efficacy with some safety modeling,

335
00:36:54,230 --> 00:37:02,420
although obviously that's much more complex. Right. But we have to make sure that if we're losing people due to toxicity, right.

336
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:06,079
This can cause a lot of bias in our outcome because then we'd only be looking at

337
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:10,670
the efficacy outcomes of those that were able to go through the full protocol.

338
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:12,409
Right, and last through it.

339
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:18,650
So we have to think about this bias and how we're going to handle that beyond just adjusting or inflating for the sample size.

340
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:22,820
Right. So that's something that like, again, you all statisticians, you're thinking about, okay,

341
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:27,920
where did the potential bias come from and then how do we deal with it or what are we going to do about it?

342
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:36,750
Yeah, I think that. That is a concern because our therapy is really just trying to make chemotherapy more tolerable.

343
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:44,090
So the people that are dropping out could especially work where they could have the worse effect from what we're trying to measure.

344
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:51,870
So. Yeah. Yeah. That's a really good point. Right. Like all these patients are are our cancer patients are getting chemotherapy to treat their cancer.

345
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:56,459
This treatment right is not to treat the cancer, but is to treat the side effects from the cancer.

346
00:37:56,460 --> 00:38:00,660
So you don't want this treatment to induce additional side effects, right?

347
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:06,810
You're really trying to prevent the other side effects. So you want to be particularly careful about the safety of it.

348
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:11,150
Are there any questions for this group?

349
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:21,560
Maybe the other group that did Phase one seamless design, we actually out of all four groups that did seamless design, we had four different methods.

350
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:34,040
We had a CRM and a Bayesian design, a type CRM, an assignment MINIMAX, a CRM and a single arm phase to design an empty and adaptive randomization.

351
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:41,930
So really interesting that everybody came to their own conclusion of how to approach this seamless one.

352
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:47,660
I guess maybe another thing that you all chose a CRM and you all chose it MPI.

353
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:54,829
What were the reasons for those differences? For our toxicity calculation,

354
00:38:54,830 --> 00:39:07,440
we use the patient's anticipation design to keep updating the toxicity rate and so we can continuously monitoring how the toxicity rate is.

355
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:12,860
Yeah. So the serum does that too, right? Serum is also a Bayesian design.

356
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:17,690
Updates the toxicity the do all remember. What was the difference between the MPI and the serum?

357
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:29,509
A.P. is calculating the probability of like greater than the toxicity rate or like near the toxicity rate or less in this calculating strain.

358
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:34,130
Different problem, a probability. So you can choose what your decision will be.

359
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:41,240
Mm hmm. Anybody in the audience remember a big difference between the empty eye and the serum?

360
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:52,680
Go back to those space one days. It cannot be cross-referenced across the dose.

361
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:58,739
Exactly right. The biggest difference is that MPI only considers those people on that dose level, right?

362
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:06,480
On the current dose level, whereas the CRM uses that model that can can use information across all the dose levels.

363
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:10,259
Right. And there's not one right or wrong answer in any of these.

364
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:13,710
Right. You all chose different, different designs.

365
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:22,950
And I think it's really interesting. And another illustration of how much of an art that statistics is, there's not just is not black and white.

366
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:31,590
There's a lot of in-between. And you have to be able to justify what you're doing, what I think, which I think all of these groups did well.

367
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:36,630
Any other comments about seamless? One, two.

368
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:43,000
Questions for these groups. Um.

369
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:48,860
I'm just curious if it's a study that is done in the real world.

370
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:57,090
Oh, yeah. How is it turned out? So this study I worked on with somebody from neurology and we submitted it multiple times.

371
00:40:57,930 --> 00:41:02,950
It was like very close to being funded multiple times and ultimately never got funded.

372
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:07,080
And so it does. It did not occur.

373
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:16,290
However, studies like this do happen. But this this study in particular was based on one that I worked on for a while, but never quite got out there.

374
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:21,910
Okay. Thank you. Let's clap for great.

375
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:32,950
Okay. Project six The Analysts Debate.

376
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:48,850
So this project was really different. This project, unlike the others, they were not designing a study or writing a protocol.

377
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:57,459
So come on, Project six. Anyway, they weren't they weren't writing a protocol or designing a study.

378
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:06,880
They were looking at a study that had run that a clinical trial had run for individuals with ALS or with Gehrig's disease.

379
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:13,720
And the study went to the FDA and said, we want to get this drug on the market.

380
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:17,490
And the FDA said, I don't like what you did essentially.

381
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:23,200
Right. And so then there are these advisory committee meetings between the FDA,

382
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:29,730
individual independent people who are looking at the study and the study sponsors,

383
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:34,900
or the pharmaceutical company, which is M.S., who put in this this drug.

384
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:45,010
So. Do you all remember what the company, either of you with the company.

385
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:51,460
Well, okay. So this isn't Lou Gehrig's disease or looking at a drug for individuals.

386
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:58,700
Do you remember what the outcome was? Although there were a lot.

387
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:02,720
What was a primary outcome your goal for our school?

388
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:06,079
Yeah, it was some like composite A+ score. Right.

389
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:11,180
Which was related is supposed to be some surrogate for survival and for quality of life.

390
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:19,220
Right. Okay. Do you remember what did the company, the analytics company, say that they found at the end of this trial?

391
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:25,490
Was there a significant difference? So this was a was it a randomized trial?

392
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:28,810
Maybe. Let's start back there. Was this a randomized trial or what did the trial look like?

393
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:32,960
You remember that people controlled trial?

394
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:40,430
Yeah. Randomized placebo controlled trial. Okay. And what did the company say that it found so significant?

395
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:43,670
Yeah. So the company found that this drug. Right.

396
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:48,050
Had was significantly different than the placebo.

397
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:55,130
Right. And in fact, I think the p value is like .034 that there is a significant difference in the outcome favoring the drug.

398
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,910
Okay. And then the FDA came in.

399
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:02,610
Why was the FDA concerned about this finding?

400
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:11,270
Do you all remember any of the arguments from the FDA? They said the applicants did not handle the missing data.

401
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:21,950
Really? And in the summer, unblinding, potential unblinding because of the bitter taste of the drug.

402
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:28,160
Yeah. So the the drug. The drug had a bitter taste, so they thought that there is potential unblinding.

403
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:34,250
So then that could make people watch what happens. If there is unblinding, they will find out.

404
00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:37,880
Yeah. The people, the patients and could know what they're taking.

405
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:44,510
And if the patients know what they're taking. Right, they could be, I don't know, maybe calling the physician more.

406
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:51,140
Right. And then the physician would know if they realize that they're not taking that right, they can be upset and stop taking it.

407
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,920
Right. So issues with unblinding can cause bias in the conclusions.

408
00:44:55,700 --> 00:45:02,060
If I remember correctly, there are also issues, some of the issues the FDA said with how they did their analysis.

409
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:10,430
Do you remember any of those points, the way they conducted the slope analysis and the doubt, the generic assumption?

410
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:22,160
Yeah. So I think was it was it longitudinal data that and so they did they had their main P-value was from a slope which assumed linearity.

411
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:28,670
Okay. But the FDA came in and said I don't you know, we look at the data and I'm not sure linearity is appropriate here.

412
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:32,900
And so the FDA redid its own analysis.

413
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:37,250
Right. And what did they find? It's not significant.

414
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:42,540
Yeah, it's not significant. So the company says, hey, this this treatment is better, it's significantly better.

415
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:46,110
And the FDA comes in and says, Oh, no, I redid your analysis.

416
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:49,860
You didn't handle this data correctly. There's potential unblinding.

417
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:54,330
There are also issues with randomization. Do you remember what the issue with randomization was?

418
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:59,549
So patients were always like, Yeah.

419
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:07,680
So they actually had an issue with creating the placebo and they didn't get the placebo made in time when the trial started.

420
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:14,219
And so instead of following the randomization list, they just gave everybody all for the first nine patients,

421
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:19,460
got the drug and then they decided, okay, now the second night, the next set of nine patients, they'll just get the placebo.

422
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:22,710
Now see those, right? And then they turn on the randomization.

423
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:28,440
What happens? Right? What happens if we have not actual real randomization.

424
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:31,920
Yeah, there could be a potential bias. Right.

425
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:40,080
Because now if the clinician knows what that treatment is that's being handed out, they may or may not put their patient on this trial.

426
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:45,960
Right. Or they might say, who get on it right now. I know it's the drug like oh, does get you want to go for the placebo, right.

427
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:48,780
So there could be there can be issues with that.

428
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:58,020
So the company says this is significant P equals point out three four FDA says we redid this analysis you have issues with blind potential

429
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:09,870
unblinding randomization the the way you analyze the data the slope analysis with linearity the potential missing data and then what else they had.

430
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:14,819
Like you said, they had a lot of outcomes. Right. And their primary outcome, the company said, was significant.

431
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:18,840
But what did they say about most of their secondary outcomes? Were those significant or not?

432
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:25,680
There's no signal. Those are not significant. All right. So that was another reason why the FDA maybe wasn't fully trusting these results,

433
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:32,280
because while the primary outcome says this is good, the secondary outcomes weren't really showing this this difference.

434
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:37,410
So I think I remember your group. Right.

435
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:41,729
Actually did a vote. Right. And and which side did you side with?

436
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:47,190
Were you pro company in getting this drug on the market?

437
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:53,160
It was significant. Or are you pro FDA concerns and more conservative?

438
00:47:54,890 --> 00:47:57,830
Actually, I think our group is like in the middle.

439
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:10,010
We we are thinking that we could approve that going to meal, but we should wait for like follow up to follow results.

440
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:17,390
Okay. And what you guys didn't come out. I don't remember quite saying what you who you sided with.

441
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:24,430
We tried to take a vote, but we couldn't really make up our minds, so we just chose to present both of the issues.

442
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:31,639
Yes. Okay. So you you're very objective. Okay. So if you're when you're listening to me, explain it right.

443
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:39,020
All of you out there. Right. The company says, okay, maybe we should also I didn't provide a lot of reasons to back up the company.

444
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:47,000
Right. So why what would we why was the company so firm and what they said in wanting to get this drug to market,

445
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:55,600
can you all you all remember there's the issue of the severity of the disease and the lack of available treatment.

446
00:48:55,940 --> 00:49:01,010
Yeah. So this is a disease where there are not a lot of treatments and the patients and their families

447
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:06,709
themselves said that collecting more data would take more time than most of these patients have.

448
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:14,030
So they were pushing for approval. So this is a case where there is a huge patient advocacy push.

449
00:49:14,330 --> 00:49:21,590
So patients who have this disease, their families, families of patients who have this disease came out when all this was happening.

450
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:25,940
And and we're saying we're really fighting for this drug to come to market.

451
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:33,740
Right. And and the company itself and their analysis, while most of their secondary outcomes were not significant,

452
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:37,070
I think they had one maybe, which was or two when they broke it down.

453
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:42,770
Right. They had themselves done a fair amount of sensitivity analysis to their primary analysis.

454
00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:46,430
Right. And they kept finding the significant difference.

455
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:52,010
Right. Sorry, you have a question. I have a quick question about like the Patient Advocate Group.

456
00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:57,830
Yeah. Was that like a group that was already formed or was that like recruited by the company?

457
00:49:57,830 --> 00:50:06,260
Like how did this all come? So usually there are many I'm not sure in this case, but many, many patient advocate groups exist already.

458
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:14,089
There are lots of nonprofits which exist which are really trying to help raise money for research in these areas.

459
00:50:14,090 --> 00:50:18,739
So I'm guessing that this group existed or these people existed and were active,

460
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:23,150
but then became much more active when they saw what was happening here.

461
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:29,210
All right. So so we have this company that says there's almost nothing out there for these patients.

462
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:33,409
Right. We need to get this out. Look, we did sensitivity analyzes.

463
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:38,479
We find the same thing. And then we have the FDA that's saying, but look at all of these issues for bias.

464
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:42,930
So if quick raise of hands. Right. And you have to raise your hand.

465
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:47,030
Okay. You have to raise your hand. Is part of the extra credit grade here.

466
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:51,350
Oh, do you would you say let's approve this drug.

467
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:56,899
Right. With the but with also saying we will also conduct a larger study.

468
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:00,440
Okay. We will approve this drug now, but we'll continue to conduct a larger study.

469
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:07,069
Or would you say we should not approve this drug we need to hold out before we move into anything further.

470
00:51:07,070 --> 00:51:10,700
So who says let's approve the drug? I have a question.

471
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:14,450
Yes. How many people have this disease? Oh, Lou Gehrig's disease.

472
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:18,650
I think this is also a rare disease. It's like 30,000 in the U.S.

473
00:51:19,130 --> 00:51:23,840
Yeah, it is a rare a rare disease. 30,000 per year or something.

474
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:26,930
Yeah. So it was also talking about in emergency use.

475
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:30,409
So something could be approved like this. Certain caveats in place is that.

476
00:51:30,410 --> 00:51:33,860
That's right. Yeah. So like, you know what we saw with the vaccines, right?

477
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:41,629
We could approve this drug and then we do this larger trial and depending upon that analysis in a larger trial or like with the vaccines,

478
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:45,950
when actually all the efficacy data came out, then we could have a full approval or not.

479
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:51,230
Okay, so let's vote for emergency approval versus hold up.

480
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:55,190
We are worried about your biases. Okay, so emergency approval, who votes?

481
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:58,309
Yes. Okay, who votes?

482
00:51:58,310 --> 00:52:02,090
Hold up. I am not. I'm really wary of these biases.

483
00:52:03,130 --> 00:52:06,700
Okay. Yeah. So. So what happened?

484
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:10,300
Do you all know what happened? What happened with this drug? Did it get approved or not?

485
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:17,770
Finally, it got approved after the companies and all their follow up results.

486
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:24,940
Yeah. So the. So they had this original they had one original like advisory committee and there was a vote.

487
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:31,710
There was like a64 vote. I think it was still in for approval, but they kind of halted after that.

488
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:40,510
The company gave all of its results. They had another advisory committee meeting and then it was like a72 or something.

489
00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:44,860
I forget what the numbers were, but it was more in in favor of approval.

490
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:50,229
So this drug does have emergency approval, emergency use approval or whatever right now.

491
00:52:50,230 --> 00:52:55,060
And actually, this drug costs $158,000 per year.

492
00:52:55,900 --> 00:53:05,560
So if you go back to thinking about ethics, right, making this decision to approve this drug, it has massive consequences for all the individuals.

493
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:10,430
Good consequence that perhaps there's not a lot out there. So maybe this could be helpful.

494
00:53:10,450 --> 00:53:14,830
Bad consequence. It's going to cost them a ton of money, right, to do that.

495
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:24,520
Yeah. Would issuing the emergency use kind of actually make doing another trial difficult for a rare disease and like or at least a randomized trial?

496
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:26,829
That's a good that's a really good point. Right.

497
00:53:26,830 --> 00:53:32,739
Like if you issue this approval, would anybody actually engage in this trial if it's randomized to control?

498
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:39,460
That could be a very big concern. Yeah, but if it is that expensive, if you were in the trial, it would you would get it free.

499
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:43,450
Yeah. Then it'd be biased because you'd have like the rich people just buying the drug and.

500
00:53:44,850 --> 00:53:48,489
Yeah, right. Well if you were using the observational data.

501
00:53:48,490 --> 00:53:53,860
Right, but in the trial, everybody gets on the trial you would probably only get non-rich people.

502
00:53:53,890 --> 00:53:57,370
Oh, because the other people would just automatically go to buy it.

503
00:53:57,430 --> 00:54:03,129
That's a good point. Yeah. Yeah, that's possible. Yeah. So see, there are definite repercussions of this decision.

504
00:54:03,130 --> 00:54:06,670
Yeah. So I'm just wondering what'll happen if they don't approve it?

505
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:16,690
Do they have to stop the trial or. Um, so in this case, they, they did approve it, so they're moving on.

506
00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:19,989
And I think a large part was due to the patient advocacy, to be honest,

507
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:27,340
I think that huge push from the patients helped that if it were not approved, it could be not approved.

508
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:32,020
Saying this is not approved, push on with your trial or it could be not approved.

509
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:38,890
Stop. Right. But the I, I think because the results were so it's not like P was point nine.

510
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:43,030
Right. Even with the FDA did a PE was .079.

511
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:50,019
And so in a rare disease to me that seems promising I'd probably be on the either approve

512
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:56,230
and continue and or you know wait and continue the trial but you know looks promising.

513
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:05,819
So there is also something, if I remember correctly, one of the other issues there was missing this, right.

514
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:09,120
So the FDA or the FDA was worried about the handling of missing.

515
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:19,680
Now there is 17% missing data like outcomes in the placebo group and 18% missing this in the drug group for the primary outcome.

516
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:23,340
So do we feel like that's an issue?

517
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:26,520
It's balanced? Is that a problem or is that okay?

518
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:32,259
Any ideas? Any thoughts about that?

519
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:38,380
If you if you see that there's like balance missing this, do you feel okay with like, for example, a complete case analysis?

520
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:46,150
Or are you worried about bias? Any thoughts on for different reasons in each arm?

521
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:49,360
Yeah, right. So even though there is balance, right,

522
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:54,219
even though the percent of missing ness is the same and both these arms people could

523
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:58,360
drop out in the placebo for very different reasons that they drop out in the drug.

524
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:03,669
So we could have very different groups of people left that we're trying to compare.

525
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:11,200
And so perhaps that randomization we initially did is no longer so balanced on these characteristics because people dropped out for different reasons.

526
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:14,500
So a note to yourself, statisticians again, right,

527
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:22,959
balanced enough in percentages doesn't necessarily mean balance on covariates of interest and or balance and reasons for dropping out.

528
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:27,370
And so you still need to be very careful and for this reason in the analysis.

529
00:56:30,990 --> 00:56:34,820
There are any other points about this? Yes. So I know one.

530
00:56:34,830 --> 00:56:41,070
We had like a different drug that was that came out a couple of years ago that was also approved for emergency use.

531
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:45,720
Oh, yeah. Just wondering if there was any kind of follow up on that to see how that went or how that going?

532
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:46,469
Oh, yeah.

533
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:53,700
I don't I don't know if you have a follow up, but I remember one of your groups had would you call it like a historical precedent in this area?

534
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:57,900
Was that this project? Yeah. Did you all mention the historical precedent?

535
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:10,870
Do you remember? Can you explain that? And we can find your video where you group.

536
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:16,970
11 or 12. Which group were you?

537
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:23,580
You're 11. It goes near the end.

538
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:29,720
Right. I think Nick talked about it.

539
00:57:29,730 --> 00:57:34,590
So that's why you don't remember it. Okay, here we go.

540
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:40,600
Let's see if this or if you.

541
00:57:50,770 --> 00:57:58,570
Neurodegenerative disease with irreversible progression. Statistical analysis was found to be not sound by the committee.

542
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:03,330
Approving the drug could result in a potentially less effective treatment given out

543
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:08,090
to less patients when evidence supported supporting treatment options already exist.

544
00:58:08,590 --> 00:58:13,350
And so obviously that would be a negative or illustration.

545
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:20,060
One more thing that we wanted to consider was the concept of a historical president.

546
00:58:20,810 --> 00:58:30,260
And so we say, How you home, which was an experimental drug that they conducted a trial for, for Alzheimer's treatment.

547
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:36,740
Alzheimer's is a known neurodegenerative disease with irreversible progression, much like ALS.

548
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:41,240
You home. So this is a different company. Okay. Right.

549
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:44,330
Is not MLS, but a different company, different disease.

550
00:58:44,330 --> 00:58:56,780
But similarly, like, you know, maybe somewhat rare case of Alzheimer's and trying to find a treatment that where there's not much treatment.

551
00:58:57,170 --> 00:59:06,230
It was approved for accelerated. It was it received accelerated approval for Alzheimer's treatment in 2021.

552
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:10,249
But looking back on the approval pathway,

553
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:16,400
we see that trials had initially been halted by the data monitoring committee due to a lack of demonstrated efficacy.

554
00:59:16,850 --> 00:59:26,690
And the pharmaceutical company that was developing it, Biogen, claimed that one of the trials that they were conducting would demonstrate efficacy.

555
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:31,790
In it, they used a surrogate end point to demonstrate mitigated disease progression.

556
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:38,300
The advisory committee voted 10 to 1 against recommending the drug for approval.

557
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:46,880
However, given the severity of Alzheimer's and limited treatment options, the FDA decided to provide accelerated approval for the drug anyway.

558
00:59:49,850 --> 00:59:53,270
So the MTA received substantial backlash from this decision.

559
00:59:53,780 --> 01:00:04,500
So we posed the question was the AMYLASE sales decision against approval in Overcorrect a response to the backlash that they received for ADL?

560
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:12,950
So the sort of interesting. Right, so this there was accelerated approval for this Alzheimer's drug.

561
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:20,209
But there the advisory committee said, don't do it, don't approve this.

562
01:00:20,210 --> 01:00:27,290
And the FDA said FDA said we're going to approve it. Primarily, I think that in that case, it was also due to patient advocates really speaking out.

563
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:32,540
Right. And then they received a lot of backlash like this is a that was a really terrible idea.

564
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:37,580
I don't actually know. We should I'll Google it later or somebody can Google it with their computer open.

565
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:42,739
Like what, actually? Happened with this drug.

566
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:47,930
It was ultimately approved or not. But I thought this question was pretty interesting.

567
01:00:49,890 --> 01:01:02,410
If the FDA, you know, is and if they're going to approve this drug, you know, is it because they they see that there could be.

568
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:07,530
That's I don't know if it's overcorrected because they didn't ultimately approve this and they approved it there, too.

569
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:09,560
So I'm not sure it's really overcorrected,

570
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:16,770
but it's kind of interesting to think about if FDA is not listening to the advisory committee right and making decisions.

571
01:01:16,770 --> 01:01:21,990
And sometimes they're going with the advisory committee and sometimes they're not like how they're actually making those decisions.

572
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:27,830
Right. It's a little worrisome. And you can understand why some people don't trust medicine.

573
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:30,930
Right, because this is not well communicated.

574
01:01:31,290 --> 01:01:34,979
And then there's confusion about the results and the potential for bias and nobody's really

575
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:40,290
explaining it well and then making these decisions that don't always match what others are saying.

576
01:01:40,290 --> 01:01:46,559
So you can see that like scientific communication, very, very important in the role of a statistician,

577
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:51,959
very important in terms of thinking about all the biases and explaining them and thinking about that.

578
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:57,900
We actually analyze this data this well. So when we go through classes, right, a lot of time, what you're learning,

579
01:01:57,930 --> 01:02:04,049
you're learning are these skills and you're applying it to two datasets which are relatively perfect, right?

580
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:09,570
But in the real world, we're going to have all this opportunity, particularly in clinical trials, for human error.

581
01:02:10,110 --> 01:02:14,009
And so you have to think about how can we make sense of this data?

582
01:02:14,010 --> 01:02:21,540
How can we get as robust of a conclusion as possible so that people will really feel confident in getting this drug out and in this case, right.

583
01:02:21,870 --> 01:02:27,690
How confident are you that charging people $158,000 is really useful for that?

584
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:33,510
Yes. I'm just wondering, like, you know, in countries outside of the U.S., some drugs are approved that are not.

585
01:02:33,570 --> 01:02:37,890
And that's right. Right. Yeah. What does that impact the decision making like if this was approved elsewhere?

586
01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:43,860
Yeah, that's a really good question, too. So right. In other countries, some drugs will be approved, whereas they're not approved here.

587
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:47,459
And how does that impact what the FDA decision process is?

588
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:49,680
I think is probably a very I don't have a good answer.

589
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:56,879
I think it's very complex and it definitely can impact decisions and it can also impact patients.

590
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:02,940
Right, to go somewhere else and then to get treatment and whether that's actually safe.

591
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:07,019
And they may differ on what setting it is.

592
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:13,230
Yeah, because emergency approval versus like regular approval change, insurance costs are like insurance.

593
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:19,829
Oh, I don't actually know the relationship to insurance and this is slightly different.

594
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:23,490
Accelerated approval is somewhat different than emergency use approval.

595
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:30,809
Um, I, if I was reading one of the articles and it didn't sound like this drug was covered in insurance,

596
01:03:30,810 --> 01:03:35,040
but by insurance yet until there was full approval but the company was trying

597
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:41,190
to make some do something about the costs to try to help the the patients.

598
01:03:41,730 --> 01:03:45,300
Yeah. But still huge. Yes. Yeah. I'm looking at the ads.

599
01:03:45,810 --> 01:03:53,550
Yeah. So it says that one is 28,000 per year without really affect the list price, but there is insurance that covers it.

600
01:03:53,640 --> 01:04:01,770
Okay. And then also because of these are in approval that they still do have to go through more trials further.

601
01:04:02,190 --> 01:04:06,989
Yeah. And then right as was said with the trials, like once you have accelerated approval,

602
01:04:06,990 --> 01:04:12,330
how does that really affect who's going into the trials and the quality and quantity of data you can get there?

603
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:19,500
Something definitely quite interesting and how it affects the idea of equipoise, right, from both the clinicians and patients involved.

604
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:30,270
So another comment I was just going to say that with this historical precedent, it's actually not covered under Medicare until they get more evidence.

605
01:04:30,270 --> 01:04:37,030
So it might go back to earlier where you're saying that patient groups might differ on who can get it outside of trial and who can.

606
01:04:37,050 --> 01:04:40,740
Yeah, yeah. So that's true actually.

607
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:47,940
That that's probably part of the I bet that right the insurance doesn't potential places insurance companies

608
01:04:47,940 --> 01:04:53,730
won't cover it so that there is still this incentive to be in the trial through until the full approval.

609
01:04:55,420 --> 01:05:00,310
All comes back to ethics. Any other questions?

610
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:08,960
All right. Great. Great work. Group six. Okay.

611
01:05:08,970 --> 01:05:12,480
So a few additional comments and then I'll let you go a little early.

612
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:15,840
So one, there was a sign in sheet for all of you who are here.

613
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:19,770
I don't know where it is. It's over here. If you haven't signed it, it'll be up here.

614
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:28,230
You can sign in, too. We will continue the discussion of the next four projects on Thursday.

615
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:31,530
Now you know what to expect so you can come prepared.

616
01:05:31,740 --> 01:05:35,219
Extra special groups. Don't worry. This is not like if you didn't remember.

617
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:38,600
It's totally fine. I didn't warn you that this was happening. But it is a good idea, right?

618
01:05:38,610 --> 01:05:42,930
To think critically and to watch the rest of your presentation and know what everybody else did.

619
01:05:44,070 --> 01:05:49,979
If you can watch at least one of the group videos of the next four projects, that would be helpful.

620
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:57,540
And with this discussion and remember that all of this is important and part of your learning and process and learning more about these designs,

621
01:05:58,650 --> 01:06:07,559
the next thing just generally. So I watched all the videos over the weekend and last week and I had a few general comments.

622
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:12,299
Number one, all of your slides are amazing. I would like to hire you all to redo all of my slides.

623
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:20,970
They're excellent. I don't know what if you're just using like Google Slides or Canva or what, but they look so beautiful, so great job on the slides.

624
01:06:21,630 --> 01:06:26,040
You ordered a very nice job also of like taking turns and presenting.

625
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:30,509
I didn't give any specifics of like whether we wanted to see or not in the presentation.

626
01:06:30,510 --> 01:06:36,330
I actually like seeing the speaker, but, you know, I understand why some of you just didn't have the speaker on there, so that was fine.

627
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:42,389
If you haven't engaged on Yellow Dog, please do so again.

628
01:06:42,390 --> 01:06:47,730
You earn points for your comments that are intended to be constructive, not just like great job or something.

629
01:06:48,690 --> 01:06:56,309
And if you get asked questions on your projects, please take turns of your group member answering those questions.

630
01:06:56,310 --> 01:07:00,390
So I've seen on several of them it's the same group member, which is awesome.

631
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:08,700
That person is clearly very knowledgeable, but it'd be great if your group members can take turns to you have your peer reviews.

632
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:12,780
That includes the yellow, the engagement, plus the actual a Google doc.

633
01:07:13,230 --> 01:07:16,680
I think on there it says like share. You're supposed to share it with me.

634
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:21,630
Please don't share it with me. Just upload it. I, I'm getting like millions of Google notifications.

635
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:25,889
I don't want those. Just download that and don't share it with me.

636
01:07:25,890 --> 01:07:29,219
Just uploaded to canvas for all those you did already. That's really fine.

637
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:32,340
I enjoy that. But don't anybody else who has done it, don't do it.

638
01:07:32,350 --> 01:07:35,580
Okay. Don't share it with me. Just download it. Uploaded to canvas.

639
01:07:36,030 --> 01:07:43,829
That's both your two peer reviews and then you have within project group review as well.

640
01:07:43,830 --> 01:07:50,280
So you are reviewing those individuals within your group. Also, the teaching evaluations are out.

641
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:53,700
Please complete those. Again, these are really important for all teachers.

642
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:57,329
So not just my class but all of the classes that you have. Please complete those reviews.

643
01:07:57,330 --> 01:08:07,950
We have really bad review proportions and we actually look at these every year when we do reviews of every professor and we look at these,

644
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:11,999
especially when professors are going out for promotion and they do change.

645
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:16,080
They can help change the way of who is teaching in the class and or how they're teaching.

646
01:08:16,380 --> 01:08:20,790
And so if you have constructive again, constructive criticism, please leave it there.

647
01:08:21,990 --> 01:08:25,709
But don't just say, you know, your class sucks.

648
01:08:25,710 --> 01:08:29,010
Like, say this is something that could be improved for this class.

649
01:08:29,490 --> 01:08:35,280
Yes, Sarah, I wouldn't do them for all of my classes if the deadline was a little bit later.

650
01:08:35,370 --> 01:08:42,660
Do you know why the deadline is like right before finals? And I don't set those.

651
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:47,390
Those are set by the university. So we couldn't talk to the university.

652
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:50,850
I think partially they think that once people have finished their exams, they're out.

653
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:54,510
Like there's no way we're getting them. There's limited, diminishing returns.

654
01:08:54,870 --> 01:08:56,309
So we try to get them before exams.

655
01:08:56,310 --> 01:09:01,620
We also want you to do them before you get your grade because we don't want you to be like, Oh, that grade was awesome.

656
01:09:01,620 --> 01:09:07,529
Woo woo. I love this class. Like, Oh, got to do, you know, I'm really giving it to them, right?

657
01:09:07,530 --> 01:09:11,520
So you probably have some idea, but I think that's part of the part of the reason.

658
01:09:13,740 --> 01:09:18,930
But they shouldn't take too long. Like I don't think most of our professors add questions to them.

659
01:09:19,980 --> 01:09:28,230
So I do urge you to complete those because they are really good feedback to your professors and they can potentially make changes for the future.

660
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:32,790
Okay, I will. If you didn't sign in, please sign in. Otherwise I will see you Thursday.

661
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:55,580
And good work. I'm sorry I put you on the spot because. That's not what I was doing, but I was like, Oh yeah.

662
01:09:55,640 --> 01:10:07,230
It's like, it's all about you.

663
01:10:14,420 --> 01:10:31,610
Oh, God, I hope they were.

664
01:10:32,330 --> 01:10:45,180
They were really good. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

665
01:10:45,870 --> 01:10:51,949
How did you first hear?

666
01:10:51,950 --> 01:10:57,230
That might be a possibility. Okay.

667
01:10:58,490 --> 01:11:02,480
Yesterday. Yeah, we did like a few.

668
01:11:03,450 --> 01:11:07,660
And then I was like, Oh, my God.

669
01:11:08,020 --> 01:11:12,860
I swore I'd like to hear what they think.

670
01:11:16,370 --> 01:11:21,740
I think and everything, you know?

671
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:29,000
I hear ya.

672
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:37,260
Yeah. I told her to go to the hearing room. Explosive on my own.

673
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:41,080
Probably about, you know, in the areas that are right here.

674
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:59,210
I mean, literally, I mean, of course, you know, you are gonna get better, and that's why that was good anyway.

675
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:03,020
So is it back at the varsity? Yeah, I would have been.

676
01:12:04,230 --> 01:12:13,480
Yeah. Where is your way back?

677
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:22,100
So Kathy was arguing over there.

678
01:12:22,990 --> 01:12:27,799
Well, she, like when she heard her eyes were swollen within like 5 minutes.

679
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:34,790
There were some people and I gave her the dirt, and I was I was, like, really thinking, like, there's no way to help.

680
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:39,950
I wonder if you shouldn't have, even if she shouldn't even take it so she can get something like better?

681
01:12:40,490 --> 01:12:45,770
I don't know. Well, opinions are just in general and I don't think September and then it's a completely different

682
01:12:46,340 --> 01:12:52,459
that's the only thing you can do is just you know like make something that I have no idea.

683
01:12:52,460 --> 01:12:57,020
I mean, I'm trying to go. I think it was Benadryl.

684
01:12:57,020 --> 01:13:08,420
It's yeah, it's it's antihistamines protection but it's like it's all not and I stage there's no I wasn't feeling it was not going to help it.

685
01:13:09,150 --> 01:13:14,120
Yeah well they isn't really having drugs.

686
01:13:14,660 --> 01:13:20,640
I think it was the she was like one that's how we got like she was like it could have been worse when I dropped her off,

687
01:13:20,690 --> 01:13:26,780
which I'm like she, she was able to go to the bathroom and then we said I smelled smoke outside.

688
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:37,760
So finally I heard the president say there's better by the end.

689
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:47,780
But that beginning was I was there was a negative experience with technology.

690
01:13:47,780 --> 01:13:58,489
And I guess they point out to you guys that in such a backhanded comment like that, you should watch every everyone's part of the video.

691
01:13:58,490 --> 01:14:02,180
So you know what they did? Oh, yeah. That was the very first one.

692
01:14:02,180 --> 01:14:05,600
The others have been. What is that, a brain?

693
01:14:06,470 --> 01:14:13,190
Oh, they used to be single little brothers and sisters.

694
01:14:13,910 --> 01:14:16,910
Brothers emerge. Then I'm just going to put it down and take one.

695
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:25,190
I'll take it one of the points.

696
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:29,030
Oh, yeah. Let's check with Athanasius. Find my AirPods.

697
01:14:36,990 --> 01:14:52,200
77. I'm going to go.

698
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:14,210
The.
