1
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,490
In this module,
we'll be focusing on

2
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,280
the concept of global
health which is basically

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,500
promoting health and achieving

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,740
health equity for the entire
population of the world.

5
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,180
Now, that may sound like

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,370
a huge challenge and
it absolutely is,

7
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,320
but I will point out, I
don't think any of us come

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,200
into public health because
we think it's easy.

9
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,470
I'd like to begin by focusing on

10
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:33,440
the global burden of disease
due to the environment.

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,390
So the World Health
Organization has given

12
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,430
us data on, for example,

13
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:38,735
the fraction of deaths

14
00:00:38,735 --> 00:00:41,255
and so called
disability-adjusted life

15
00:00:41,255 --> 00:00:43,190
years or DALYs that are

16
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,980
attributable to the
environment around the globe.

17
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:49,145
The data we're looking
at here are from 2012.

18
00:00:49,145 --> 00:00:51,380
So if we looked at the
graph on the left,

19
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,840
you'll see this is the number
of deaths in millions.

20
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,145
So in total, almost 60
million people died in 2012,

21
00:00:58,145 --> 00:01:01,430
and about 12.6 million
or nearly 23 percent

22
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:02,690
of those deaths were

23
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:05,150
directly attributable
to the environment.

24
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,025
If we look at the
chart on the right,

25
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:09,680
this is DALYs, again
disability-adjusted life years,

26
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,020
so another measure of basically,

27
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,970
harm to quality and

28
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:17,600
health of life as a result
of environmental exposures.

29
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,165
Here, we think it's
about 22 percent

30
00:01:20,165 --> 00:01:22,925
of DALYs are directly
due to the environment.

31
00:01:22,925 --> 00:01:24,380
So there are of course,

32
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:25,760
many other reasons that people

33
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,470
die but I want to
highlight that there's

34
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:29,360
a huge fraction attributable

35
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,460
to the environment here
and this is actually

36
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:33,755
something that we have
some control over

37
00:01:33,755 --> 00:01:34,970
through the application of

38
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,345
environmental health principles.

39
00:01:37,345 --> 00:01:39,360
So what is global health?

40
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,270
This is basically
focusing on the health

41
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,280
of populations in a global,

42
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,645
rather than at the level
of an individual country.

43
00:01:46,645 --> 00:01:49,775
So we're focusing here on
worldwide health issues.

44
00:01:49,775 --> 00:01:52,205
The interconnectedness
of countries

45
00:01:52,205 --> 00:01:53,660
is absolutely something that

46
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,370
we need to acknowledge and work

47
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:57,545
within when we consider
global health.

48
00:01:57,545 --> 00:02:00,665
So how do transportation,
and commerce,

49
00:02:00,665 --> 00:02:03,020
and communications,
and economics,

50
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,330
and politics influence
health around the world?

51
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,220
All of these things undeniably

52
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,380
influence health
in different ways.

53
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,770
We also have to think
about, for example,

54
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:13,710
as we become more interconnected,

55
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,070
the possibility of
infectious disease

56
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,570
traveling around the world.

57
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,670
Although we don't often
think of it this way,

58
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,980
we also need to
start thinking about

59
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,080
the possibility of
chronic diseases

60
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,700
basically moving
around the world,

61
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,040
these are not infectious
pathogens but rather,

62
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,710
concepts in lifestyles
that can spread through

63
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,150
media and commerce as

64
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:35,290
we become increasingly
interconnected.

65
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,060
Let's spend a moment
here and talk about some

66
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,250
of the leading causes
of death globally.

67
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,690
When we talk about causes of

68
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,490
death in an
environmental context,

69
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:45,395
we typically focus on things like

70
00:02:45,395 --> 00:02:47,990
communicable diseases
as a first group,

71
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:50,570
non-communicable diseases
as a second group,

72
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,505
and injuries as a third group.

73
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,530
So the chart we're
looking at here is

74
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:58,775
the top 10 global causes
of death in 2016.

75
00:02:58,775 --> 00:03:00,950
I'd like to highlight
that the blue bars

76
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:03,065
here are noncommunicable
diseases,

77
00:03:03,065 --> 00:03:05,330
the red are communicable diseases

78
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:06,845
and nutritional conditions,

79
00:03:06,845 --> 00:03:09,755
and the orange bars are injuries.

80
00:03:09,755 --> 00:03:11,480
So if we come back
to these top 10,

81
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,190
we see ischemic heart disease is

82
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,960
far and away the leader here.

83
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,030
This would be heart
attacks, for example.

84
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,620
Stroke is number two,

85
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,180
and chronic obstructive pulmonary

86
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,320
disease is number three.

87
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,630
All of these are
noncommunicable diseases.

88
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,850
It's not until we get to
the fourth leading cause of

89
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:28,130
death which is lower
respiratory infections,

90
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:30,200
that we find a
communicable disease.

91
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,760
Then, we have another sequence

92
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,395
of noncommunicable diseases,

93
00:03:33,395 --> 00:03:34,790
then road injuries appear as

94
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:36,800
the eighth leading
cause of death.

95
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,055
Then finally, we wrap up with
two communicable diseases.

96
00:03:40,055 --> 00:03:41,720
So you can see globally,

97
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,450
non-communicable
diseases are in the lead

98
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:48,395
basically in terms of the
leading causes of death.

99
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:51,620
But the picture
changes if we zoom

100
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,380
in only on low-income countries.

101
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,270
So if you look at the graph here,

102
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,250
we're looking at the same type

103
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,095
of format: blue is
non-communicable,

104
00:04:00,095 --> 00:04:02,810
red is communicable,
and orange is injuries.

105
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,480
Here, you can see for
low-income countries,

106
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,825
the top two causes of
death are communicable.

107
00:04:08,825 --> 00:04:10,060
So as number four,

108
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,210
so are six, seven,
eight, and nine.

109
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,870
So seven of the 10
leading causes of death

110
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:17,660
in low-income countries
are communicable diseases,

111
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,690
only two of the top 10
causes are noncommunicable,

112
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,625
and injuries is
basically bringing up

113
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:25,545
the rear here at number 10.

114
00:04:25,545 --> 00:04:29,120
We can contrast that to
high-income countries for

115
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,140
the same year 2016,
where in fact,

116
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:35,000
nine of 10 leading
causes of death are

117
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,405
noncommunicable and injuries
don't even make the top 10.

118
00:04:38,405 --> 00:04:39,710
So we can start to see

119
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,450
this pretty stark contrast in

120
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,280
terms of what people
are dying of,

121
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,495
the cause of death,

122
00:04:44,495 --> 00:04:46,040
in low-income countries

123
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,590
compared to
high-income countries.

124
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:51,110
Let's think about
health equity in

125
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:54,470
the opportunity to achieve
the best health possible.

126
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,120
The graph here is showing

127
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,300
life expectancy at birth
among both sexes again,

128
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,265
for the year 2016.

129
00:05:01,265 --> 00:05:03,260
I'd like to draw your
attention to the fact that

130
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,510
the dark green countries
pictured on this map,

131
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:08,510
so Canada, much of Western
Europe, and Scandinavia,

132
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:11,150
Japan, South Korea,
and Australia,

133
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:12,860
and New Zealand, all have

134
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:16,195
life expectancies of
80 years or greater.

135
00:05:16,195 --> 00:05:19,440
Compare and contrast that
to Sub-Saharan Africa,

136
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,070
and South Asia where we
have some countries where

137
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:25,640
the expected life duration
is only 50 years.

138
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,970
So here, we have a 30-year
discrepancy in the amount of

139
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,350
time people are expected to

140
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,735
live due solely to
where they're born.

141
00:05:32,735 --> 00:05:35,330
That is not good health equity.

142
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:37,850
We also have to
acknowledge the fact that

143
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:39,995
global patterns in many
different things vary.

144
00:05:39,995 --> 00:05:42,020
So the illustration
we're looking at

145
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,330
here is a distorted cartogram.

146
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:47,540
So you should recognize the
underlying map of the world,

147
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,310
but the size of the
country is basically

148
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,320
been weighted according
to different factors.

149
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,825
So we end up with this quite
distorted looking map.

150
00:05:53,825 --> 00:05:55,400
So at the top of this map,

151
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,730
we're looking at a
map of population.

152
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:02,070
So 7.6 billion people in 2016,

153
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,800
and you'll see that a
couple of countries,

154
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,430
India and China, are especially
emphasized in this map.

155
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,080
Not surprising
since almost one in

156
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,180
three people live in
those two countries.

157
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,740
On the other hand, this shows
gross domestic product,

158
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,010
so this is a measure
of economic health.

159
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,620
Here, you can see that
the United States and

160
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,440
Western Europe look
particularly bloated,

161
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,585
if you will, as does Japan.

162
00:06:23,585 --> 00:06:25,970
Whereas, Africa and South Asia

163
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,965
have enlarged part disappeared.

164
00:06:27,965 --> 00:06:29,690
So there's a stark difference

165
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:30,800
between where the majority of

166
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,450
the population lives and where

167
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:35,480
wealth is distributed
across the planet.

168
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:39,080
We could also think about
the differences around

169
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,080
the globe in terms of risk
of dying from pollution.

170
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,000
So this map is
showing us basically,

171
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,769
the number of deaths per 100,000

172
00:06:45,769 --> 00:06:48,440
people attributable to
all forms of pollution.

173
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,385
So water, air, and soil in 2015.

174
00:06:52,385 --> 00:06:54,650
We're quite fortunate,
those of us who live in

175
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,659
North America or South America

176
00:06:56,659 --> 00:06:58,340
much of Western
Europe, North Africa,

177
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,875
the Middle East, and
Australia, and New Zealand,

178
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:02,090
and that we are typically at

179
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:04,270
the very low end
of the scale here.

180
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,290
But if we look at much of Asia

181
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,360
and all of Sub-Saharan Africa,

182
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,890
we see that those
countries are at

183
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,990
the very upper end of the scale

184
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:14,405
in terms of risk of
dying from pollution.

185
00:07:14,405 --> 00:07:17,510
So again, our exposures are
quite unequally distributed

186
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,845
around the globe that presents

187
00:07:18,845 --> 00:07:21,550
additional challenges for us.

188
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:24,110
I also want to spend a
few minutes here talking

189
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,165
about globalization
and global health.

190
00:07:26,165 --> 00:07:27,580
What do I mean by globalization?

191
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,255
This is basically the process

192
00:07:29,255 --> 00:07:31,160
of integration across
all the space in

193
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,990
the world that arises from

194
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:35,139
the interchange of world views,

195
00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:37,590
and products, and
ideas, and cultures.

196
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,435
Again, the more
interconnected we become,

197
00:07:39,435 --> 00:07:41,465
the more we tend to
exchange these things.

198
00:07:41,465 --> 00:07:43,745
That's a good thing overall.

199
00:07:43,745 --> 00:07:47,600
So there are undeniable
benefits to globalization.

200
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,920
Some of the good things are that

201
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,040
the more interconnected
countries become,

202
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,015
the more opportunities
they are for

203
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:54,455
economic development and that's

204
00:07:54,455 --> 00:07:56,785
essential to get
people out of poverty.

205
00:07:56,785 --> 00:07:58,790
Also, the more we share ideas,

206
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,320
the more likely we
are to come across

207
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,030
innovations and
those innovations,

208
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:04,660
when applied, can allow
countries to modernize.

209
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,980
But there are
absolutely bad aspects

210
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,210
of globalization as well.

211
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:09,635
So historically,

212
00:08:09,635 --> 00:08:13,030
viruses have had a very
difficult time jumping oceans,

213
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:15,710
and so pandemics have been
limited to a single continent.

214
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,840
Today, with modern air travel

215
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,820
and infected person
can cross an ocean in

216
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,845
the space of ours and
those viruses find

217
00:08:21,845 --> 00:08:24,845
a much easier
opportunity to spread.

218
00:08:24,845 --> 00:08:28,385
We also have the spread of
unhealthy lifestyle patterns.

219
00:08:28,385 --> 00:08:31,370
So people are more
likely to succumb to

220
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,095
chronic illnesses when they have

221
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:35,555
more sedentary
lifestyles, for example.

222
00:08:35,555 --> 00:08:38,690
Finally, we're seeing transfers
of well-paying jobs out

223
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:39,740
of high-income countries

224
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,720
to low and middle-income
countries.

225
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,010
That's actually a benefit for

226
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,330
the low and
middle-income countries

227
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:47,740
but not so great for the
high-income countries.

228
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,970
There's another side effect
of the globalization,

229
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,880
particularly, of business
called offshoring.

230
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,000
So I'd like to explore this
notion of transferring

231
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,590
from high-income countries to

232
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:59,840
lower income countries
of various things.

233
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,960
So unfortunately,

234
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,690
some of those well-paying
jobs that have been

235
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:05,765
transferred are also very
high-risk occupations,

236
00:09:05,765 --> 00:09:08,210
and when they move to lower
and middle income countries,

237
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:10,400
they may actually
become more risky.

238
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,090
We may also, instead of just
sending high-risk jobs,

239
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:16,070
we may send whole high-risk
industries to where now,

240
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:19,130
whole communities are potentially
exposed to new hazards.

241
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:21,980
Unfortunately, this is also
spreading as a result,

242
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,390
environmental contamination

243
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:26,315
from commercial waste
including hazardous waste.

244
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:29,210
So if we think about
lower income countries,

245
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,980
where they are in the
development scale,

246
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,810
they're less likely to have

247
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,250
very protective occupational

248
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,990
health and safety regulations.

249
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:37,310
They also typically have less

250
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,780
restrictive environmental
pollution limits.

251
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,930
Unfortunately, workers
and communities in

252
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:44,150
lower-income countries
are often desperate

253
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,130
for employment opportunities and

254
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:49,010
benefits and that causes
them to focus mostly,

255
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:50,690
on the short-term gains from

256
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,370
those employment benefits and

257
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:54,380
maybe gives them
less opportunity or

258
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,430
ability to focus on

259
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:58,220
longer term health and
environmental impacts that may

260
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,780
actually harm their health

261
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:03,310
and negate those
economic benefits.

262
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:07,910
In terms of the globalization
of the planet and disease,

263
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:10,055
so we know that
low-income countries

264
00:10:10,055 --> 00:10:12,950
are faced still with more
traditional hazards.

265
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:14,690
By traditional, I mean,
things like lack of

266
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:16,695
sanitation and clean water,

267
00:10:16,695 --> 00:10:19,115
inadequate ways to
dispose of waste,

268
00:10:19,115 --> 00:10:22,030
insufficient or unstable
food resources,

269
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:24,380
and pests, among other things.

270
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,060
Middle income countries are

271
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,800
often faced with
hazards associated

272
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,225
with modernization including

273
00:10:29,225 --> 00:10:32,225
unchecked industrial
development and pollution.

274
00:10:32,225 --> 00:10:34,010
Then for high-income countries,

275
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:36,530
were looking basically
at postmodern hazards,

276
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:40,615
things like sedentary lifestyles
and over-consumption.

277
00:10:40,615 --> 00:10:43,880
Now, I'd like to wrap up the
session here talking about

278
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,340
the environment and children's
health specifically.

279
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,080
So children, one of, if not,

280
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,960
the most vulnerable
populations on the planet.

281
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,730
So the table we're
looking at here,

282
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,140
summarizes differences

283
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,790
in environmental
exposures that could

284
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,620
affect children's health across

285
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,225
12 countries around the globe.

286
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:01,880
So you can see those listed
in the left-hand column,

287
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,800
and I'd like to just highlight
some differences here.

288
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,910
So there's differences by

289
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:07,340
country in terms
of solid fuel use.

290
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,260
Some countries rely primarily on

291
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,710
the burning of biomass
for energy and heat,

292
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:12,980
whereas here in the US,

293
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,800
we basically use zero solid fuel.

294
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,305
You'll see there's quite
enormous differences

295
00:11:18,305 --> 00:11:19,760
in ambient air pollution,

296
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,820
that third column and
fourth column on the table,

297
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,830
where for example, in
the United States here,

298
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:27,500
we have relatively low
levels of air pollution,

299
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,240
not quite as low as Canada,

300
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,040
but substantially
lower than a place

301
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,900
like Iran and Ghana who have

302
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,670
levels that are many
times greater than

303
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:37,175
what US children are affected by.

304
00:11:37,175 --> 00:11:39,110
We could also think
about access to

305
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:41,660
improve your clean and
safe drinking water.

306
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,630
Many countries on the list
here or at 100 percent

307
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:47,750
every citizen or resident has
access to improved water.

308
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,250
Even here in the
US, we're only at

309
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,960
99 percent but that's better than

310
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,040
some other countries on

311
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,795
the list, likewise,
for sanitation.

312
00:11:54,795 --> 00:11:56,640
Although, particularly
for sanitation,

313
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,470
we see a much broader range here.

314
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,950
In the US, effectively,

315
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,160
everybody has access to

316
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,110
improved sanitation
compared to Ghana where

317
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:06,760
it's only 15 percent of the
population of children.

318
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,390
Finally, we could consider

319
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:11,660
some nutritionally
oriented exposures

320
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,700
on the far right-hand
side of the table here.

321
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,680
The percentage of the population

322
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,585
of children in each of
these countries that's

323
00:12:17,585 --> 00:12:20,960
overweight shows a
fairly large range

324
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,400
where Ghana has only three
percent of children,

325
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,840
compared to Thailand where

326
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,880
11 percent of children
are overweight.

327
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,760
In terms of children who are

328
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,830
stunted due to
inadequate nutrition,

329
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,225
the range is much larger.

330
00:12:32,225 --> 00:12:34,730
Here in the US, we're
very fortunate to have

331
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:37,100
only two percent stunting
which is much lower,

332
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,870
for example, than South
Africa where it's 24 percent.

333
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:44,060
So again, coming back to this
concept of global health,

334
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,490
we really do want to promote
health worldwide and

335
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:48,440
achieve complete health equity

336
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,510
for the entire
population of the world.

337
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,220
This table here
should highlight to

338
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,880
you that we're nowhere
close to that,

339
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,610
but the good news is by applying

340
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:58,060
good environmental health and
public health principles,

341
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,410
we have tools to move
forward and continue to

342
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:05,301
improve conditions for the
entire human population.
