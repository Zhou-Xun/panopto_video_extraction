00:00:02,294 --> 00:00:07,656
Hi everyone in this note set, I will cover methods for

2
00:00:07,656 --> 00:00:12,432
mediation analysis with multiple mediators.

3
00:00:12,432 --> 00:00:16,633
I will discuss how the question of multiple mediators is really

4
00:00:16,633 --> 00:00:20,524
intertwined with the one of time dependent confounding.

5
00:00:20,524 --> 00:00:24,867
Marginal structural models for direct effects under time depending.

6
00:00:24,867 --> 00:00:29,821
Confounding will be very useful in the context of mediation as we see.

7
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:34,453
Soon as I will tackle additional approaches form addition

8
00:00:34,453 --> 00:00:37,390
analysis with multiple mediators.

9
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:39,547
When the natural direct and

10
00:00:39,547 --> 00:00:44,344
natural indirect effects are not identified as we will see.

11
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:48,471
We will consider randomized interventional analog and

12
00:00:48,471 --> 00:00:53,035
the path specific effects as well as proportion eliminated as

13
00:00:53,035 --> 00:00:58,232
alternative ways of estimating effects in the context of mediation.

14
00:00:58,232 --> 00:01:02,035
Just with natural direct and natural indirect effects.

15
00:01:02,035 --> 00:01:06,628
An assumption that we call the assumption for he's needed and

16
00:01:06,628 --> 00:01:11,045
that requires that there are no confounders of the mediator

17
00:01:11,045 --> 00:01:15,393
outcome relationship that are affected by the exposure.

18
00:01:15,393 --> 00:01:20,933
So in this directed graph, the natural direct and natural indirect

19
00:01:20,933 --> 00:01:26,193
effects are not identified because there is an arrow from A to L.

20
00:01:26,193 --> 00:01:30,016
So if you're directed a cyclic graph looks like this so

21
00:01:30,016 --> 00:01:34,101
there is a confirmed L that is affected by the exposure.

22
00:01:34,101 --> 00:01:39,430
Then you need to really pay attention to the lecture of today.

23
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:45,136
This is a problem of time dependent confounding.

24
00:01:45,136 --> 00:01:46,704
Yeah.

25
00:01:46,704 --> 00:01:48,535
Even with control direct effects.

26
00:01:48,535 --> 00:01:53,085
So before I talked about the identify ability condition of the natural effects.

27
00:01:53,085 --> 00:01:58,286
Now for control direct effects if there is a confounder like L,

28
00:01:58,286 --> 00:02:05,565
the control direct effects are identified because this 4th assumption is not needed.

29
00:02:05,565 --> 00:02:10,429
However, an alternative estimation approach should be used

30
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:13,429
to estimate control direct effects.

31
00:02:13,429 --> 00:02:18,428
This is because if we simply put L in the regression as a co vary it this

32
00:02:18,428 --> 00:02:21,786
would block some of the effects of a on Y note.

33
00:02:21,786 --> 00:02:24,082
But if we didn't control for

34
00:02:24,082 --> 00:02:29,645
L then there would be a residual confounding of the M Y relationship.

35
00:02:29,645 --> 00:02:34,912
So as we know for the setting of time bearing exposure with time

36
00:02:34,912 --> 00:02:41,005
dependent confounding marginal structural models can come to eight.

37
00:02:41,005 --> 00:02:45,275
Previously to identify control direct effects,

38
00:02:45,275 --> 00:02:49,143
we have assumed that we were required sorry.

39
00:02:49,143 --> 00:02:53,800
As some C such that there is no unmeasured confounding of the exposure

40
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,497
outcome relationship.

41
00:02:55,497 --> 00:02:59,775
And there is no unmeasured confounding of the mediator outcome

42
00:02:59,775 --> 00:03:02,850
relationship are needed to be adjusted for.

43
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,191
And this is the scenario we have seen before.

44
00:03:05,191 --> 00:03:10,642
This was the dog where all the effects for mediation are identified.

45
00:03:10,642 --> 00:03:15,546
When now we are in this accepting where L is instead present.

46
00:03:15,546 --> 00:03:19,901
Now we see that to satisfy condition one and two.

47
00:03:19,901 --> 00:03:22,022
Condition one stays the same.

48
00:03:22,022 --> 00:03:27,998
But now condition two requires further to adjust for this L.

49
00:03:27,998 --> 00:03:32,486
So if we have an effect of the exposure that confound the immediate

50
00:03:32,486 --> 00:03:34,200
outcome relationship,

51
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:39,680
the traditional parametric traditional approaches are no longer available.

52
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,120
No longer valid so in marginal structural model for

53
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:49,079
control direct effect that directly extends the setting

54
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:52,810
of time letting exposures can be applied.

55
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:57,802
We will now have a model for the marginal counterfactual outcome

56
00:03:57,802 --> 00:04:01,139
Y under intervention little A and Nicole.

57
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:06,463
Which is function of the exposure,

58
00:04:06,463 --> 00:04:12,145
the mediator and their interaction.

59
00:04:12,145 --> 00:04:15,246
And once we fit the marginal structural model.

60
00:04:15,246 --> 00:04:19,407
The control direct effect is simply given by the difference between

61
00:04:19,407 --> 00:04:21,965
the counterfactual mean of the outcome?

62
00:04:21,965 --> 00:04:24,062
Had the exposure been set to A.

63
00:04:24,062 --> 00:04:28,941
And the mediatory little and the minus the mean of the counterfactual outcome

64
00:04:28,941 --> 00:04:33,381
when the exposure is changed to a star for everyone in the population.

65
00:04:33,381 --> 00:04:38,200
And then which is just the function of these regression coefficients.

66
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:44,110
Under certain assumptions, under the assumptions that first of all this

67
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:49,842
model is correctly specified which is enforced when A and M are binary.

68
00:04:49,842 --> 00:04:55,901
And if the weight models that recovered the super population

69
00:04:55,901 --> 00:05:01,979
that satisfy the exchange ability assumptions is created.

70
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:05,493
So let's see how these weights look like.

71
00:05:05,493 --> 00:05:09,128
We need to regress the outcome on the exposure, the mediator and

72
00:05:09,128 --> 00:05:10,215
the interaction.

73
00:05:10,215 --> 00:05:14,945
And then each subject is weighted by the product of the following two weights.

74
00:05:14,945 --> 00:05:17,552
That depends on the exchange of India assumption.

75
00:05:17,552 --> 00:05:22,133
The wait for the exposure is as I show here the stabilized

76
00:05:22,133 --> 00:05:24,776
wait where in the denominator.

77
00:05:24,776 --> 00:05:29,666
We have the probability of the exposure observed exposure

78
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:34,066
given the confounder see the base and can founders.

79
00:05:34,066 --> 00:05:39,922
And the weight for the mediator is the inverse of the propensity score for

80
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:43,769
the mediator and now adjusts for the exposure.

81
00:05:43,769 --> 00:05:48,823
The various and as well for alma we consider a stabilized weight.

82
00:05:48,823 --> 00:05:53,459
Again whenever we use weighting procedures we need to use robust or

83
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:56,358
sandwich standard diverse to account for

84
00:05:56,358 --> 00:06:00,939
the extra correlation that we have induced by waiting subjects.

85
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:03,870
So how would we apply this?

86
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:09,729
For example, in we would fit first the model for the weights.

87
00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:15,456
The first model is the for the denominator for sorry for the numerator of the weight.

88
00:06:15,456 --> 00:06:18,596
That's the first chunk of code.

89
00:06:18,596 --> 00:06:23,227
The 2nd chunk of code is the propensity score model for the exposure.

90
00:06:23,227 --> 00:06:28,724
The 2nd and 3rd chunks of code are for the weight for the mediator.

91
00:06:28,724 --> 00:06:33,578
Where we see that in addition to the baseline co variants,

92
00:06:33,578 --> 00:06:38,939
we also adjust for the exposure and the time dependent founder.

93
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:43,594
And we get the predicted values of the mediator and the exposure for

94
00:06:43,594 --> 00:06:44,602
each of them.

95
00:06:44,602 --> 00:06:49,963
And we use them to construct the weights here in this first chunk of code.

96
00:06:49,963 --> 00:06:54,854
I give you the solution of how you would construct these weights

97
00:06:54,854 --> 00:06:58,371
when exposure and mediator is by our binary.

98
00:06:58,371 --> 00:07:03,195
And finally when we have our S W which is our stabilized weight,

99
00:07:03,195 --> 00:07:05,569
we fit say linear regression.

100
00:07:05,569 --> 00:07:10,747
If the outcome is continuous, where the outcome is weighted, this is

101
00:07:10,747 --> 00:07:16,743
the repeated subject statement assuming an unstructured correlation matrix.

102
00:07:16,743 --> 00:07:25,079
That requires the robust standard errors.

103
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:30,104
For a binary outcome, we could also fit the national structural model.

104
00:07:30,104 --> 00:07:34,867
Considering the logistic regression for the outcome that is weighted by

105
00:07:34,867 --> 00:07:40,110
the inverse of the probability weights for both the exposure and the mediator.

106
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:43,796
And then we cannot recover the odds ratio, control direct effect.

107
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:47,062
This function of the marginal structural nodded.

108
00:07:47,062 --> 00:07:50,720
So we want to use the marginal structural model,

109
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,086
even if we don't have the time depending confounding when is the case?

110
00:07:56,086 --> 00:08:01,633
Well, we want some time a marginal rather than a conditional odds ratio for

111
00:08:01,633 --> 00:08:04,716
our effects when the outcome is binary and

112
00:08:04,716 --> 00:08:10,724
that this model recovers the marginal odds ratios of the control direct effect.

113
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:15,402
Alternatively, we might prefer to model the exposure and

114
00:08:15,402 --> 00:08:19,986
the mediator through the weights rather than specifying

115
00:08:19,986 --> 00:08:24,201
the relationship of the mediator with the outcome.

116
00:08:24,201 --> 00:08:28,644
Okay, why is that again?

117
00:08:28,644 --> 00:08:34,267
Because the outcome model is gonna be much simpler in marginal structural models?

118
00:08:34,267 --> 00:08:39,348
Because you see the outcome model will only depend on the exposure and

119
00:08:39,348 --> 00:08:44,614
the mediator and potentially their exposure mediatory interaction.

120
00:08:44,614 --> 00:08:49,109
So, you see that we don't need to specify how the co variants

121
00:08:49,109 --> 00:08:51,237
relate to the outcome here.

122
00:08:51,237 --> 00:08:56,134
So it's more likely to get this model right.

123
00:08:56,134 --> 00:09:01,115
So let's apply this approach in the context of a life course.

124
00:09:01,115 --> 00:09:05,862
Epidemiological example, numerous studies have found childhood

125
00:09:05,862 --> 00:09:11,532
socioeconomic status to be associated with a variety of adult health outcomes.

126
00:09:11,532 --> 00:09:17,144
And there is debate as to whether there is an effect of this,

127
00:09:17,144 --> 00:09:22,760
a child socioeconomic status on adult health that is either

128
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:29,405
entirely mediated by adult, partly mediated or not mediated at all.

129
00:09:29,405 --> 00:09:34,988
And in this figure, I'm just showing you how strong is actually the effect

130
00:09:34,988 --> 00:09:40,853
of child depredation on a variety of important health outcomes in adulthood.

131
00:09:40,853 --> 00:09:41,737
Yeah.

132
00:09:41,737 --> 00:09:45,143
So these are the three hypotheses.

133
00:09:45,143 --> 00:09:50,981
The first is that there is a latin sensitive period

134
00:09:50,981 --> 00:09:58,070
where basically child's SES changes in our programming for

135
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:03,774
life and directly affects health in adulthood.

136
00:10:03,774 --> 00:10:09,891
Then there is another hypothesis which is called the pathway social trajectory.

137
00:10:09,891 --> 00:10:14,962
That instead assumes that the only way child SES affects health in

138
00:10:14,962 --> 00:10:20,046
adulthood is bisecting the person to have also a very difficult.

139
00:10:20,046 --> 00:10:25,965
And challenging adulthood in terms of finding jobs, achieving education,

140
00:10:25,965 --> 00:10:30,983
corroborating setting of deprivation where health is damaged.

141
00:10:30,983 --> 00:10:37,197
Whereas the last theory puts forth the idea that both pathways,

142
00:10:37,197 --> 00:10:41,931
direct and indirect effect might be operating.

143
00:10:41,931 --> 00:10:45,227
The challenge in teasing apart.

144
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:51,174
These three different theories stems from the factor

145
00:10:51,174 --> 00:10:58,317
that a very big time dependent confounding sector is in the way.

146
00:10:58,317 --> 00:11:04,596
Let's look at how actually our direct elastically graph for

147
00:11:04,596 --> 00:11:08,289
this problem looks like child SES,

148
00:11:08,289 --> 00:11:13,475
can affect adult adult health through adult SES.

149
00:11:13,475 --> 00:11:18,564
However, we know that if a child is the pride in childhood

150
00:11:18,564 --> 00:11:23,866
has been neglected, then in algal food or in adolescence,

151
00:11:23,866 --> 00:11:29,286
this person might more likely uptake bad health behaviors.

152
00:11:29,286 --> 00:11:35,831
For example, they might more likely be used to eat at fast foods,

153
00:11:35,831 --> 00:11:42,389
they are more likely to become dependent to alcohol and smoking.

154
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:47,749
And all these risk factors can definitively affect socioeconomic status

155
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:53,022
because if a child early on in life in their adolescence starts smoking or

156
00:11:53,022 --> 00:11:54,067
using drugs.

157
00:11:54,067 --> 00:12:00,125
They are less likely to then being able to complete their studies or

158
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:04,460
continue their studies and getting a good job.

159
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:09,655
So this factor is in the middle and we know that

160
00:12:09,655 --> 00:12:15,823
natural effects are not identified in this setting.

161
00:12:15,823 --> 00:12:23,239
So how do we go around this problem?

162
00:12:23,239 --> 00:12:27,549
Well, consider marginal structural model first of all to estimate

163
00:12:27,549 --> 00:12:31,948
the controlled direct effect of childhood SES on the final outcome.

164
00:12:31,948 --> 00:12:37,126
Accounting appropriately and adjusting appropriately for the time dependent.

165
00:12:37,126 --> 00:12:42,052
Confounder and we'll compare these results with what

166
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:46,345
we would obtain with traditional approaches.

167
00:12:46,345 --> 00:12:52,184
So we use health and retirement study data which is a national sample of U S.

168
00:12:52,184 --> 00:12:57,992
Adults and their spouses to tease apart these different hypotheses.

169
00:12:57,992 --> 00:13:02,153
There were 9,760s.

170
00:13:02,153 --> 00:13:04,550
Beginning in the 1992 Cohort.

171
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:09,745
That had that baseline ages between 50 and 62.

172
00:13:09,745 --> 00:13:14,785
There were biennial follow up interviews conducted

173
00:13:14,785 --> 00:13:20,519
through 2008 and how were the exposures constructed?

174
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:24,964
Well, there were several measures that can load into

175
00:13:24,964 --> 00:13:29,823
the latent variable SES both in childhood and adulthood.

176
00:13:29,823 --> 00:13:34,615
And the principal components were used to combine information across

177
00:13:34,615 --> 00:13:37,697
all of these and the child SES was a function of

178
00:13:37,697 --> 00:13:41,696
father's education model educational region of birth.

179
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:45,886
Rural urban residents, father's occupation,

180
00:13:45,886 --> 00:13:53,078
whereas adult SES was a function of income wealth occupation and employment styles.

181
00:13:53,078 --> 00:14:00,023
Both childhood and adult SES were modeled in quarter tiles based on.

182
00:14:00,023 --> 00:14:06,371
Can founders were birth cohort, sex, race and self rated childhood health and

183
00:14:06,371 --> 00:14:11,297
adult risk factors were smoking high blood pressure, B M I and

184
00:14:11,297 --> 00:14:14,062
self rated health at study entry.

185
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:16,594
The outcomes of interest so

186
00:14:16,594 --> 00:14:21,218
that characterized in adulthood were nonfatal or

187
00:14:21,218 --> 00:14:27,066
fatal stroke, nonfatal or fatal heart disease and diabetes.

188
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:32,160
So given the structure of the dark we require two weights one for

189
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:38,122
the child SES which only requires adjustment for based on can founders and

190
00:14:38,122 --> 00:14:42,854
adult SES, which requires the adjustment for baseline.

191
00:14:42,854 --> 00:14:47,527
Confounders SES in childhood and risk factors.

192
00:14:47,527 --> 00:14:53,116
And then since these outcomes are binary with the marginal

193
00:14:53,116 --> 00:14:57,679
structural model using logistic regression,

194
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:02,812
adjusting for SES in childhood and SES in attitude and

195
00:15:02,812 --> 00:15:07,968
the waiting by the product of the waits for child SES.

196
00:15:07,968 --> 00:15:11,385
So look, let's consider the results for

197
00:15:11,385 --> 00:15:16,275
diabetes compared with those in the least disadvantaged.

198
00:15:16,275 --> 00:15:21,190
Bartel of early life as yes, those in the 2nd, 3rd and

199
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:26,631
4th warranties who were worse off had respectively 12%,

200
00:15:26,631 --> 00:15:30,201
and 62% increased risk of diabetes.

201
00:15:30,201 --> 00:15:34,373
So that's what we call our total effect.

202
00:15:34,373 --> 00:15:38,129
Now what happens if we use traditional approaches and

203
00:15:38,129 --> 00:15:40,139
we know that L is a mediator.

204
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:47,197
So let's say that we first adjust only for baseline.

205
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:48,969
Confounders.

206
00:15:48,969 --> 00:15:53,136
And we see that what we do is that we are just for

207
00:15:53,136 --> 00:15:57,868
based on confounders and we adjust for adults SES.

208
00:15:57,868 --> 00:16:01,578
And that we see that these effects are often waited but

209
00:16:01,578 --> 00:16:06,526
then once the adulterous factors which is the other confounder which is

210
00:16:06,526 --> 00:16:10,667
also mediator is adjusted for all the effects become null.

211
00:16:10,667 --> 00:16:15,572
When instead we use the marginal structural model that a property account

212
00:16:15,572 --> 00:16:18,588
for the fourth time depending confounding.

213
00:16:18,588 --> 00:16:23,647
We see that those who experienced the greatest disadvantage in

214
00:16:23,647 --> 00:16:28,707
early life showed still an increased risk of diabetes relative

215
00:16:28,707 --> 00:16:35,040
to those in the list of disadvantage but it was slightly activated.

216
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,885
So the results indicated still a moderate controlled direct effect

217
00:16:39,885 --> 00:16:43,880
of child is yes on heart disease controlling for adult,

218
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,875
not that the interaction terms were not significant and

219
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:52,635
we know that under no exposure mediatory interaction then control

220
00:16:52,635 --> 00:16:56,820
direct effects could be equal to natural direct effects.

221
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:01,088
However, this assumption is under the individual

222
00:17:01,088 --> 00:17:05,950
counterfactual level of no interaction which is unlikely

223
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:11,112
because I would think that the relationship between child and

224
00:17:11,112 --> 00:17:16,571
the outcome should be super additive but we didn't find evidence

225
00:17:16,571 --> 00:17:21,931
of that in our sample, similar results were found for stroke and

226
00:17:21,931 --> 00:17:27,392
what we just showed that simple regression adjustment either for

227
00:17:27,392 --> 00:17:32,881
only the basic ovaries or for both the base and various and adult.

228
00:17:32,881 --> 00:17:37,802
Risk factors sometimes did not yield the significant association or sometimes yield

229
00:17:37,802 --> 00:17:42,051
the paradoxical results depending on the outcomes we're considering.

230
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,985
Note that there is still some measure confounding and

231
00:17:46,985 --> 00:17:49,521
the precise interpretation of the S ES.

232
00:17:49,521 --> 00:17:54,409
Estimates is difficult but the results are strongly suggestive of

233
00:17:54,409 --> 00:17:57,830
a direct effect remaining for childhood SCS.

234
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:02,840
Not through adult SCS right.

235
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:07,842
So for marginal structural model we can think that these these

236
00:18:07,842 --> 00:18:13,230
approaches can be extended inspecting when either the exposure or

237
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:16,430
the mediator actually vary over time.

238
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:19,560
So more complex situations.

239
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:25,073
Not that however, if the mediator is time varying than repeated measure,

240
00:18:25,073 --> 00:18:28,660
marginal structural models should be used, but

241
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:32,171
essentially the techniques are very similar.

242
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:37,940
Mm.
