1
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:19,510
This works and also the data that they can use as well to get the best of this is one that I myself am using.

2
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:26,250
I do like 33 times, you know.

3
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,570
So let's talk about that one.

4
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,630
I. I like that.

5
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,809
One of the reasons for this idea has been because it was in our work.

6
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:58,920
It was also one of the things that, you know, I didn't go to the gym I went to get my was because I think it was awesome.

7
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:16,850
But if you want to go to like one of these and just cool myself and then my college construction so it progressively got cheaper like math.

8
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,830
Like I told my handler, I was like, You want a good time?

9
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:39,670
So it's like they know all your abilities, like from your coach.

10
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:45,500
It comes to like a few things.

11
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:54,510
And I was, like I said, possible.

12
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:03,210
So for those of you who weren't here on Monday, I have a few extra copies of The Reading Guide and the syllabus.

13
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:10,980
So all your questions and if anybody else needs them, just kind of flag them.

14
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:14,520
Now they're the same thing that's online, but they're analog.

15
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,620
Okay. I tried the little Starbucks cup of my place today.

16
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:26,420
I was trying to get all your readings assigned for the week. I think everybody has filled out the survey, so.

17
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:35,540
Or if you haven't, I've run. I've got enough degrees of freedom left that I can assign you the readings, so you'll have that by the end of the day.

18
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,930
So just thank you for calling that out. If for whatever reason you get assigned something and you did not.

19
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,070
Realize that you were chosen, that or this is a serious problem.

20
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:50,610
Let me know immediately and we will see if you can switch with somebody.

21
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,480
But otherwise, I think everything should work out.

22
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:02,510
So again, just a reminder that your first assignment, I think many of you, most of you have done this is due by the end of this year.

23
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:09,420
You know, so to introduce yourself to the class and to fill out this survey and I think most of you already done this.

24
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,880
Yes. I'll I'll have your assignment before Thursday.

25
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:28,319
Questions about any of that. So today we're going to see these slides are online.

26
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:33,750
So they're on canvas if you want to take notes on them again, except for yesterday,

27
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:39,990
because I knew I was going to give you that quiz on your site will always be available prior to 4:00.

28
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,319
So today we're going to talk about continue our conversation that we started last week in

29
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,190
terms of introducing this concept of what does it mean to take a public health approach,

30
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:50,700
talk about mental disorders, and specifically want to talk about what does even mean?

31
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:55,889
What does it mean to say that they're stigmatized? So just again, this is a reminder of what we did on Monday.

32
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,720
We talked about the syllabus and the schedule.

33
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:03,900
We talked about the history, the some important studies in our field and sort of who our historical heroes are.

34
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:09,540
Today, we're going to revisit the DSM, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,

35
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:14,400
and these concepts of reliability and validity to then get to the conversation of something.

36
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:28,140
So for those of you who have some familiarity with the psychology, tell me a little bit about the DSM.

37
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:35,759
So what is this? Who uses this book? What's what's in it or how familiar with this?

38
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,970
When I say that, when I see DSM, this acronym that is meaningful to you.

39
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:42,990
Brian. So what about your. I got you here.

40
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:47,420
I'm trying to learn. Okay, so can you tell me a little bit about what you know?

41
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:58,310
Well, I just know that it's like it was kind of just, like, kind of conversation, but it's just it goes like this sort of the challenge columns.

42
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:02,420
Okay. I'm not that from those, actually.

43
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:07,070
So it's got symptoms of disorders. Other comments, what else is in this book?

44
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:16,200
Who you're uses this book. Three years it.

45
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:19,670
Yeah. I also we have like a very general attitude of it,

46
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,440
but I think it's like psychologists and psychiatrists use used to try and like diagnose people based on the symptoms listed in it.

47
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:33,570
So it is a tool, right? So it's a tool used by trained professionals to arrive at a diagnosis.

48
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:45,280
And what is it? What is the diagnosis? Simply diagnosed with depression was a mean.

49
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:56,950
Yeah. What if you just meet the criteria, like two weeks in the spring and things like that?

50
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,849
Right. So you're you're to be diagnosed with something according to this manual means

51
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:06,070
that your symptoms are consistent with the definitions outlined in this book.

52
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:14,590
Am I my expert opinion? Right. That term diagnosis, we're going to we're going to problematize that quite a bit in this class.

53
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:19,089
All right. So that I'm going to use that power.

54
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:25,720
But if you really sort of unpack what it is, it is the it is the it is not what the person has.

55
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:31,560
What they have are feelings of sadness or feelings of disinterest or trouble sleeping.

56
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:37,060
Right. That's what they have. The need for depression is something we give that.

57
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,260
Based on this criteria, we've all agreed that we're going to we're going to use this criteria.

58
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:49,839
The stuff is in this book, not any other book, this book, to sort of turn the experience of a human being into a diagnosis,

59
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:57,040
which that the other reason I need that is to bill for health care.

60
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:57,510
Right?

61
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:04,450
So there's this other element that comes post diagnosis which is like now you can now now that diagnosis and we're going to talk about this more.

62
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:08,710
We're talking about treatment, access. That diagnosis gives you access to lots of different things.

63
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:13,570
Okay. Right. And without that diagnosis, you don't have access to those things. So.

64
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:18,220
Okay. So that but it's not a classification system in the true sense of the word.

65
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:25,270
And the reason for that is that in this book, if you look through this book and there is an online version of this book,

66
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:29,770
they can go mess around with the disorders are grouped together by what they look like.

67
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:38,650
So major depression and minor depression and dysthymia, which are all kind of different forms of low mood, low affect, etc.,

68
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:45,669
are grouped together not because they sort of are genetically related or necessarily like, but just like they look the same.

69
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:49,749
And also like disorders of I should be eating, not eating, but eating, right?

70
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:54,610
So bulimia and anorexia and binge eating disorder, these are all grouped together under one heading,

71
00:07:54,610 --> 00:08:02,380
not because they have like the same sort of underlying like fundamental problem, but rather because that's what they look like.

72
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:11,050
You can compare that to a true classification system, which groups disorders together, not by what they look like, but by what system is involved.

73
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:16,440
So the the symptoms of cardiovascular disease or sorry,

74
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:20,680
the things that are underneath the cardiovascular disease system are all things that they can look at,

75
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,140
everything from rheumatic fever to a heart attack.

76
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,469
Right. But they're all problems of the cardiovascular system.

77
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:30,610
So they don't look the same, but they are grouped together because they're affecting the same system.

78
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:37,180
So the reason why the book is this book is organized differently and is organized by what things look like rather than what is like under

79
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:44,469
the fundamentally underlying what's wrong is that we actually don't know what's fundamentally underlying what's wrong for most disorders.

80
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:47,580
This is what the ah docs effort is trying to figure out.

81
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:54,900
Right, which we talked about on Monday. So so what is what what can the DSM give?

82
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:59,820
So it does gives us a very important element. So it's again, it doesn't tell us what is fundamentally wrong.

83
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:07,200
It allows us to have a common language for turning a experience of a human being into a diagnosis, which then it can.

84
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:11,580
The purpose of that diagnosis is to inform treatment.

85
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,530
And but that also, very importantly, which we talked about last time,

86
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:26,490
is that prior to the DSM three and the revolution that happened two years before Beyonce was born in 1980, is that we get the reliable assessment.

87
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,540
So it doesn't matter who asks the questions or who does the assessment,

88
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:36,860
they get the same answer because prior to that is the diagnosis you diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder,

89
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:40,739
where you meet criteria for generalized anxiety disorder, whatever, whatever the criteria is.

90
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:47,069
And I'm trying to figure out. And the reason we need that is because prior to that, depending on who asked you the questions,

91
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:50,190
they would ask you different questions because they had different opinions about what

92
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:53,759
generalized anxiety disorder was or what schizophrenia was or what depression was.

93
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,610
And that opinion of theirs is shaped with the kind of questions they asked to what symptoms they thought were important.

94
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:07,160
And so there really was no widely consistent, acceptable, accepted operational definition of what constitutes disorder.

95
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:15,209
So we are trying the goal of DSM three in the 1980 revision and every DSM since then is to get us reliability,

96
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:18,480
which you can think about the same as consistency or reproducibility, right.

97
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,070
To say I get the same answer no matter what it does, it equal validity.

98
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:28,940
Validity is truth, right? So because people will say like, well, you know, like depression doesn't capture like the full experience,

99
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:34,940
you know, the criteria of depression are not fully capturing the symptoms of depression.

100
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:37,740
That's fine. That's fine. It's not trying to get at the truth.

101
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:41,099
It's trying to get at a consistent measurement, sort of once you sort of understand that,

102
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,810
like the bar that this book is trying to actually cross is not that high.

103
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,379
I think it makes you a little less angry about it because people sometimes get angry at this

104
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:55,170
book like this doesn't fully capture like all the ways that like misery expresses itself.

105
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:58,380
It's not culturally appropriate. True. All true, all true.

106
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,580
It's not trying to do that.

107
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:08,400
It's trying to come up with a much more basic idea, which is, can I put the same person in front of the same set of criteria and get the same answer?

108
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:15,149
And the reason why that bar, despite how low it is, is still something that we struggle to do today.

109
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:19,190
And why is it so important? Because if I can't get reliability, I can never achieve validity.

110
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,230
Why is this the case? So prior to the DSM three revision,

111
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:34,309
you can think about this this bullseye as a graphical depiction of what it is like if you walked into a mental health specialist office and were like,

112
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:40,040
Doc, what's wrong with me? Depending on who you got, you would you would be anywhere on there.

113
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,020
Okay. Like that's previous three.

114
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:49,900
What do you Simon is trying to is getting us trying to get us to we can argue as to what how is this is this second scenario,

115
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:55,190
which is that no matter what doctor you walk into today, they're going to give you about the same answer.

116
00:11:55,850 --> 00:12:00,390
That answer. As you can see in the second bullet, is not the truth. The truth is whatever is in the middle of this bullseye.

117
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:07,249
Okay. But at least you're getting the same answer, because without that, I can never get to what I actually care about.

118
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:12,440
Which is this. All right. There is this intermediate step, right?

119
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:22,070
So if you think about it this way, the goal of so do we lack courage in the field of mental health, the equivalent of a thermometer.

120
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:25,250
A thermometer is something that doesn't matter.

121
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:29,750
I guess maybe it matters what elevation you have, but it doesn't matter if you're in Michigan or California.

122
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,030
It doesn't matter if it's a Tuesday or a Friday.

123
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:37,220
It doesn't matter if you've just broken up with your boyfriend or girlfriend or your life just finished.

124
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:42,530
You've just graduated. None of that matters. It will give you your core body temperature reliably.

125
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,930
We lack that. We don't have that yet. We're trying.

126
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:50,690
So. So part of the reason is because a [INAUDIBLE] of a lot harder to ask somebody

127
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:52,730
about their mental state than it is to figure out their body temperature.

128
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:59,990
So but also makes it more interesting that that's this is sort of this fundamental thing that the DSM is trying to get us to do so.

129
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:03,799
And this is not just my hot take on it. This is actually what the DSM says itself.

130
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:08,010
If you go to again, I'd mentioned that this is online and you can go to their frequently asked questions.

131
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:14,600
There's of course, one too, like, what the [INAUDIBLE] is this book and why is it important? And it says in its own words, I am a handbook.

132
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:20,920
I contain descriptions, provided I provide a common language that establish consistent and reliable diagnosis.

133
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:25,669
There's no word in here that says like, this is the true state of human misery.

134
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:30,379
And like, I've got it all figured out. Okay, so I say all this.

135
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:34,670
Maybe I'm the only one who has, like, an ax to grind when I was your age about, like, this book, but, like, I.

136
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:44,090
I was very, like, confused. I'm like, why are people doing this? And, like, don't they understand how, like, impoverished this book is and how it is?

137
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:48,560
Like, yes, they do. They totally get it. And so now you can, you can direct your finger elsewhere.

138
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,750
So. Okay, sorry. So this is just an example.

139
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:57,140
If, again, if you went to this book, this is the type of thing you would see for mood disorders where it says,

140
00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:00,530
again, symptoms in this category are those from primary symptoms.

141
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:06,769
Mood by mood, I mean in a heavily exaggerated or very limited range of feelings, everybody gets down sometimes.

142
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:11,839
But to get diagnosed with a mood disorder, your feelings must be in the extreme that are so right.

143
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:18,470
So it gives you again this idea that like it introduces this idea that we're going to this is, again, why we don't have a thermometer.

144
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:26,419
But it introduces this idea that there's no line in the sand between depression and kind of feelings that I'm blue, right, like this.

145
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:36,350
But the thing the reason why you meet criteria for a major depression versus not has to do with the this idea that

146
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:42,259
there is frequent symptoms that are impairing and set in that you're you're not able to significantly hinder.

147
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,749
And we're going to talk about that in a minute. Right. This idea that, like,

148
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:51,560
whatever is going on with you is significantly impairing your ability to do other things that you would like to do with your life.

149
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:57,450
So you can compare that to the OECD. This is the diseases of the circulatory system.

150
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,200
These things don't have the same symptoms. They don't have the same treatments.

151
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:05,190
But they are all affecting the circuit. Yep. Sorry. Go ahead. Oh, no, I'm so sorry.

152
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:10,050
Even if the DSM three doesn't claim to be, like, have extreme validity,

153
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:16,020
is there an assumption that they at least try to tell us what they agree on anything.

154
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:19,379
If they were at least trying to get at something real. Yes. Right.

155
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:22,440
So. No, no, no, no. Right. So.

156
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:26,520
Right. So we have to walk the line between this book is arbitrary and this book is meaningful.

157
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:34,030
Right. So. So on the one hand, the diagnosis is that in this book do predict things.

158
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:41,470
So like depression predicts, like having a diagnosis of depression or meeting criteria for depression predicts a lot of things about about your life.

159
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,320
And we can predict who is more likely to develop depression.

160
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:45,570
Right.

161
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:55,120
So there's these other types of validity in terms of convergent or divergent validity or, you know, it's useful in terms of predicting outcomes.

162
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,409
Are there certain medications that help people with depression, that don't help people with bipolar and vice versa?

163
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:06,430
Right. Some indicating there's some there's something. But most of our medications are only effective like 50 to 60% of the time.

164
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:12,880
Right. So we there's still not a clean we still don't understand like the actual, like, substrate that these things are operating on.

165
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:19,150
But, you know, I think your I want you to.

166
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,690
So your question is a good one. And it's a kind of a fundamental one.

167
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:30,640
When we talk about autism, we're going to one of the things we're gonna to talk about is how that diagnosis has changed over time

168
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:37,959
and that the changing of that diagnosis is one of the things that has produced the epidemic of autism,

169
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:41,880
which is not actually an epidemic of the symptoms of autism.

170
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:46,270
It is an epidemic of the diagnosis and labeling of those symptoms as autism,

171
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:51,370
which may very well be completely appropriate, like the true state of the world,

172
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:58,220
may be that one out of two boys has autism or whatever than one out of 50 or whatever the number is right now at some ridiculous number.

173
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:03,729
I mean, there's 100 actually. Sorry, let me correct stuff like that.

174
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:09,910
Diagnosis 30 years ago was one in 10,000. And so today, to have a diagnosis of one in 100 is shocking.

175
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:16,149
It is truly shocking. But if you sort of understand that, like, well, it's not that the truth was that it was actually one in 10,000,

176
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:21,220
30 years ago, is that that diagnosis didn't have meaning in the way that it does today.

177
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:26,210
You're not immune. And so the meaning of that diagnosis and what it's what is captured by it is different.

178
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:31,400
Those symptoms were always there. We just didn't. Those kids just didn't get the call that they might have gotten called something else.

179
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:37,670
When we talk about ADHD, like symptoms of inattention are very common actually for kids with autism.

180
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:47,780
So so I appreciate the question for lots of different reasons, but I think it is true the goal is validity.

181
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:54,500
But this book does not provide that in itself. And so it's other stuff that this book and forms that can get us there.

182
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:56,630
Okay. Good question. Yeah, go ahead.

183
00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:05,209
So does the DSM differentiate between like bipolar psychodynamic or does it just not so each of these so this would be like the

184
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:12,000
preamble and then underneath that would be here's bipolar and there's bipolar one and bipolar two and just mania and cycles.

185
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:18,889
So it's actually sort of if you think about the way I, I don't know how many of you I mean, I don't bird either.

186
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:23,720
But like apparently a birding guide has got like all the different types of, like, finches, like there's 40 million finches.

187
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:29,780
And if you're really into birds, these differences would make a lot of important, like this would be important to you.

188
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:35,900
And so it it sort of describes like the habitat is here and like the beach is a little bit different here.

189
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,239
That's all. Like that's the kind of differentiation here.

190
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:46,700
But your question also points to the fact that like, it's actually so there's it's actually very easy to say there's something going on with you.

191
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,990
It's actually very hard to say it's this versus this thing going on with you.

192
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:57,109
Right. So like people with particular with bipolar disorder is like notorious, like difficult to diagnose people.

193
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:01,729
Bipolar disorder, on average, takes 10 to 15 years to get to an accurate diagnosis.

194
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:06,790
And in that 10 to 15 years, they are being you know, who knows what's going on?

195
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:12,830
They're often on medications that have almost no efficacy. Like I particularly antidepressants have almost no efficacy for bipolar disorder.

196
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,880
It's because it's it's not the same thing. It's but it looks the same.

197
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:22,840
And so we're trying to treat it with what is here. But it's actually like, no, that's not what's that's not what's driving underneath.

198
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:29,450
You're in fact, bipolar disorder has a lot stronger genetic liability with schizophrenia than it does with depression.

199
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:35,310
So it's like our dog trying to, I don't know, solidify like the differences then.

200
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:38,630
So not it's trying to figure out what's actually underneath the hood.

201
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:41,630
This this differentiation is irrelevant to it.

202
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:50,629
So it's saying I'm interested in what drives irritability or what drives, you know, so if someone someone's in a manic state,

203
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:55,400
they don't eat they don't eat sleep like they they will they will be awake for two days and feel fine.

204
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,780
I mean, I'll feel fine. They'll be actually on the brink of psychosis.

205
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:04,480
But like, they'll be they will they will not feel tired. And so it's trying to figure out, like, okay, is that a stress?

206
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:10,220
Is that a problem with like a fundamental system of like a weakness?

207
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,879
You know, when, like, that's what's going on, you know, and like that's what's going on in the brain.

208
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:20,570
And then it's getting expressed as I'm going to spend $10,000 on a shopping spree, which is a symptom of bipolar disorder.

209
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:24,469
But it's not like that symptom is what's actually going on in the brain.

210
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:29,120
Right. That's just this expression of this like more fundamental thing that we're just trying to get a handle on.

211
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:38,270
Yeah, good question. Other questions? I.

212
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,440
Okay. So what is in the what is in the DSM?

213
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:50,070
So again, so it's had this list, it's got this list of things that are going on after each of those things.

214
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:55,050
And the book has a description of what are the symptoms and if they have any duration requirement, requirement.

215
00:20:55,060 --> 00:21:01,740
So likely two weeks at least a month, etc., some conditions will have what is called a diagnosis by exclusion.

216
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:06,780
So if you were on, if you were taking methamphetamine, you would also not need to sleep.

217
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,570
But that would not be a diagnosis of bipolar disorder.

218
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:13,470
So it would include like you're that symptom didn't happen just when you were on that amphetamine.

219
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,120
And then it would also so that's the diagnosis of exclusion.

220
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:29,370
And then you have this question around impairment. So the idea is that you don't qualify for the diagnosis of depression or bipolar or schizophrenia

221
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:34,820
or what have you unless there is significant clinical distress or impairment in some role.

222
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:38,850
So your social earlier occupational role or other something else you're trying to get done in your life.

223
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:45,870
And that piece is really important because most of our studies like most of like if you read, for example,

224
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:49,710
like that symptoms of depression and anxiety have increased over the course of the pandemic.

225
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,450
Sure, sure.

226
00:21:53,700 --> 00:22:01,380
Those symptoms and we're going to talk about this next week when we talk up when we talk about measurement and actually do use some of these tools.

227
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:08,640
Most of those studies that you've been reading about increase in depression and anxiety or during the pandemic have been based on four questions,

228
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:13,590
simply four questions, the 2/1 symptoms of depression and the two for symptoms of generalized anxiety,

229
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:19,620
disorders of sadness, anhedonia, worrying a lot and then irritability or something like this.

230
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:23,099
And there's no question about impairment. There's no question of did this happen before.

231
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,070
It's just those were symptoms and like and just over the past week.

232
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:36,760
So for me, that doesn't mean that like America is depressed now because like, that's not what it's been.

233
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:41,890
That's not what the data showing people are reporting symptoms that are that are part of depression.

234
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:48,329
They're also part of the new lockdown and not being able to see your friends and family or dealing with grief because somebody, you know has died.

235
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:51,360
Right. So like all of those other like that doesn't mean pathology.

236
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:56,400
Right? What what means something that I should be concerned about is this question about impairment.

237
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:03,629
So now but this impairment, which again it helps us differentiate, is not the only thing,

238
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:12,600
but it helps us differentiate between kind of everyday lousy days and a clinical syndrome that I want to go see a

239
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:18,689
health care provider for who is going to be going to provide some sort of intervention for that clinical syndrome,

240
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:22,920
which is going to be a medication or a psychotherapy or something, some combination of the two.

241
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:35,300
That that threshold has led this focus on permit leads to this type of a opens the door to this kind of important but problematic issue.

242
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:41,510
So this is from the World Health Organization. In 2017, it declares that depression is the leading cause of disability around them.

243
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:46,370
So of all the things that could go wrong, any physical health problem, any mental health problem,

244
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:53,810
anything that can go wrong with you, the thing that is going to cause the most disablement in your life is depression.

245
00:23:54,070 --> 00:24:00,020
Right. That is what the World Health Organization said. But what does that what does that mean?

246
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:12,959
What does that mean when you see that? What does that mean to you? I just like the kind of growing up.

247
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:17,930
The definition of disability is really associated with like physical disabilities,

248
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:24,960
so like loss of lives or like all of that limbs or crutches or different.

249
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:34,140
I think who, if you read the article, probably just gets like the definition of disability, just like it limits some common everyday function.

250
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:39,399
Okay, so it's a much more broad, we presume that this you're talking about a much broader set of things.

251
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:44,790
So not necessarily in the example of I might use crutches because it's difficult for me to walk up stairs.

252
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:50,549
But the broader sense of disability in terms of like I can't do it most of the

253
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:54,750
time sometimes like talked about in the context of like loss of work production.

254
00:24:54,940 --> 00:25:00,530
Yeah. Yeah. So there's a, there's a, there's a capitalist sort of like element here, which is true.

255
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:03,779
Like people with depression like to have lower productivity and greater absenteeism.

256
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:08,370
So I mean, there's, there's a the in the room, you can certainly go down that rabbit hole.

257
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:12,290
Are there other things that are at this might get ahead?

258
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:17,350
It kind of implies that everyone with depression has disability and that some.

259
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:20,669
Yeah, yeah. Um, and I think if I'm not mistaken,

260
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:30,540
like people that are depressed can still like have that same sort of functionality and like not be characterized as disabled.

261
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,160
So there's this distinct. So. So you're pointing to that idea that like, well, I need impairments, right?

262
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:39,389
Because depression without impairment is actually not depression. That's just sort of like life.

263
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:43,830
I guess this kind of comes back to this what we're going to talk about in a couple of weeks of like.

264
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:51,520
Does the diagnosis follow the symptoms or do you decide you you have something seriously wrong with you?

265
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,690
And so you actually decide that a diagnosis is needed and then you go to seek that out.

266
00:25:55,850 --> 00:26:02,020
Right. So we tend to think like symptoms, doctor diagnosis, but it could actually be self-diagnosis, doctor.

267
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:05,860
Right. Like there's there's a different kind of understanding there. So.

268
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:14,680
So either way, like this idea of of disablement is important because you know what the World Health Organization is trying to do.

269
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:20,560
And that very first graph I showed you of like the giant bar graph that you can read where I was like, look, it's so much disabling.

270
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:27,040
The reason it's doing that is because it's trying to erase things that can kill you, like heart disease and cancer,

271
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:30,310
with things that don't really kill you, at least don't kill you directly like depression.

272
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:38,740
Okay. And so it's it's and we're going to talk a little bit about how this this story about to see it in that story.

273
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:42,639
But this rationale about disablement also has to do with time out overall.

274
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,560
But also, how common is it? When does it start in life like depression is in your twenties and thirties.

275
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,910
This is like peak school work, family stuff going on.

276
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:54,400
All right. So there's a lot of other reasons why this is going on.

277
00:26:54,520 --> 00:27:01,810
So this the note here, it says, relax, I come to your toaster. So so again, so the World Health Organization is trying to say,

278
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:06,270
I want to figure out all the things that are that could go wrong, even if they don't tell you.

279
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:11,139
I want to be able to figure out what countries should like, prioritize or what, you know,

280
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:14,760
sort of like how we should think about what are the drivers of population health.

281
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:21,639
So because we don't really have mortality statistics like nobody's cause of death on an on a death certificate is listed as depression.

282
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:26,080
Right. It's just not it's not doesn't it's not eligible to be listed there.

283
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:34,420
We need something else. And so we get this idea of disability in this context, what the what the W.H.O. means in this context,

284
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:40,760
when it says leading cause of disability, all that means is a decline in functioning relative to a prior state that's public.

285
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:44,739
So it's got some pre this thing happening to you and others post things,

286
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:51,000
something happening to you and it doesn't argue as to why that why your functioning is lower.

287
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:55,690
It doesn't say that it's because of what's going on in your brain or because of what's going on in your environment,

288
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:57,519
or it's because of what's going on in your family. All right.

289
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,760
So it's a gnostic as to why that decline in functioning is happening, but it's arguing that like that.

290
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:06,520
That's what I'm trying to figure out. So we action.

291
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:09,870
We get the idea of this global burden of disease.

292
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:16,330
I'm going to try to metric everything that could go wrong and figure out which are which

293
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:19,810
of these things cause the most declines in functioning relative to some prior state.

294
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:25,100
Because I need some way to to compare things in an apples to apples way they don't have otherwise.

295
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:31,180
And so it generates this idea, but what it calls disability adjusted life years.

296
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:36,790
What I want to tell you about is sort of how where those things come from.

297
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:41,950
So in disability adjusted life here is a is simply a formula.

298
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:49,520
It's just an algebraic formula. And we get it in a couple of different ways so that I'm trying to get this value of years lived with the disability.

299
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:52,239
So that has to do with the prevalence or depression prevalence,

300
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:58,809
about 15 to 20% lifetime prevalence depending on on when in the life course you're getting that duration.

301
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:01,810
So, you know, most depressive episodes that can last at least two weeks.

302
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:06,610
For many people, this is a condition that's episodic, right? So they might have multiple weeks.

303
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:11,650
You know, let's let's let's just say on average a person with depression for the whole life and spent six months in depression.

304
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:16,380
And let's just say that times this interesting value, this disability rate.

305
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:24,040
Okay. So these two these two I can get pretty easily. I mean, duration is actually kind of hard to get, but pretty much I can at least get.

306
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:26,140
So what the [INAUDIBLE] is this? Disability.

307
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:35,500
Disability weight is a number that ranges from zero, which represents perfect health to one of the anchors.

308
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:40,300
And it is the thing that represents that reduction in functioning.

309
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:49,840
That's what it's that's what this week it's and the way that they generate the weights is not in there fundamentally,

310
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,370
but rather it's qualitative in nature.

311
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:58,810
So the way they generate the weight is they get a bunch of people in a room and they ask you, this group of people,

312
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:06,610
we're not some knowledge of health and not necessarily experts in mental health to rate how disabling this thing is.

313
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:10,930
Okay. So that's and I think I have an example.

314
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:16,719
Okay. So all right, so you've got this group of, let's say,

315
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,370
10 to 12 people and they're there they are there to represent America and

316
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:25,929
they're going to rank these health conditions by which is that most disabling,

317
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:29,440
which is the least disabling. And from that, I'm going to generate this weight.

318
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:34,959
So you might say, like, that doesn't sound like a great idea and people have critiqued this idea.

319
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:43,750
So this is just a couple of examples. So the first one is saying, look, even the problem with this idea is that even within the same culture,

320
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:51,489
there's a lot of ambiguity and lack of consensus concerning the absence of health or the presence of illness or illness, disease, etc.

321
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:56,080
Right? So like this is that there's not like there's, there's some like universally accepted definition of health,

322
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,440
much less a universal definition of disability.

323
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:07,239
The other issue here, this is from 20 years ago, and it is it is the answer is James Foster,

324
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:13,690
it is too late because that you know that when you think about it,

325
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:22,590
who cares what the disability weight of depression like who in America cares what the disability rate of depression in the UK is like?

326
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:28,450
Why would that why would that matter to us really? We don't spend their money, you know, like we don't we don't abuse their health care.

327
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:36,610
So what really matters is within the country, reallocations within the United States, how should we be prioritizing things right.

328
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:42,280
Or within your country? And so the idea of this, what the World Health Organization, which is trying to basically say,

329
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:46,600
I'm going to get an average of disability for every health condition on the planet.

330
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:54,100
And that average number is going to be the thing that is going to help me rank all these things together with this formula,

331
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:59,750
because this is this is this is what I'm trying to get to. I need I need to get this weight, this disability weight,

332
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:04,180
which is I'm going to sort of argue that the best way to get this is to ask all the different concern,

333
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:09,460
every country to get a group of people together, to develop this consensus process and give me that number.

334
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:12,669
Then I'm going to plug it in this formula and figure out yours with disability.

335
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:16,930
And I'm going to rank order everything, point to the biggest, the smallest number.

336
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:28,360
Okay. So so let us take a couple of minutes to just what's in your table and then I'll ask if you guys are you all to share out?

337
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:36,669
Just take a minute to say like, okay, what, what do you think the W.H.O. is sort of like when they say these are disabled?

338
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:43,630
Like, what are they? What do you think? I mean, and I'll tell you what, do you think they to just take it from us in this way?

339
00:32:43,680 --> 00:33:04,360
It says, yeah, I mean, it sense like it's just, you know, it just makes me feel like because I really feel like this is like, you know.

340
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:09,980
I also think that there were a set of corrective actions.

341
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:20,090
You see right here, it's not like it's not what it was about.

342
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:36,250
The timing, what it would have might do more to reduce, you know, so that there wouldn't be like something like this really has no place to go.

343
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:40,360
I was like, it doesn't look like any multitasking.

344
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:59,929
It's like, you know, I feel like I look at something and it just got like even bigger thumbprints and like I'm sure I would

345
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:06,890
like to share your table talked about in terms of what what makes depression disabling right now.

346
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:12,920
Joel, talk about there are some physical manifestations.

347
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:20,890
For example, you can't get out of bed or like you can't get rid of those manifestations that make it right.

348
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:26,120
So you're not able to do some like take care of yourself. Other comments.

349
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:31,640
Yeah, we talked about how mental disorders aren't necessarily curable.

350
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:37,940
So like no matter what kind of like treatments or like steps to mitigate that disorder, you take like you still have to live with that.

351
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:42,860
And that does lead to some level of disability no matter what you do like a broken leg.

352
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:45,190
Which presumably we would be able to be.

353
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:55,739
Can be disabling for a relatively short period of time that would then not have repercussions like any other in the health aspects.

354
00:34:55,740 --> 00:35:03,100
But if you have a disability, it will lead to actual physical disabilities.

355
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:10,060
And if this one of. Yeah.

356
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:16,950
So depression is associated risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, diabetes, other other sorts of things.

357
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:20,900
And certainly and as we'll talk, we'll talk a little bit about it.

358
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:24,330
Health services, many of the medications that we use to treat mental health disorders,

359
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:30,650
atypical antipsychotics that we use to treat schizophrenia, also cause heart attacks and diabetes and things like that.

360
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:40,020
So. Yeah I think it kind of raises the question like is like to comparing like us I don't know like a healthy

361
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:45,600
population to those who are disabled but then also like based on the definition of like disability,

362
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:52,050
it seems like you should be comparing like, like a person's current state to like a previous state.

363
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:56,370
And so like, I don't know, I think like for me it's a little confusing.

364
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:56,549
Like,

365
00:35:56,550 --> 00:36:04,680
how are they defining people as disabled if you're looking at like the population as a whole when like disabled seems like a very individual thing,

366
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:08,060
like kind of. Well, there's different ways to view, right?

367
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:14,879
Because you can view so from like the disability rights perspective, disability is really around person environment mismatch.

368
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,430
And so what this is what the advocates say is like you need to change the environment, right?

369
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:28,120
And like that's this is where accommodation from Trump in terms of I can do everything I need to do as long as there's a ramp here and not stairs.

370
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:31,500
Right. Like, that's not it's not about like, can I get to the can I get to X space?

371
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:38,580
It's can you make this very minor, relatively minor, like environmental change and now I can get to X space, right?

372
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:42,240
So, all right. So good. So I'm going to let me show you. Exactly.

373
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,360
So this idea, right? It's clear that, like, this is complex.

374
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:50,950
So imagine you're in the room. Maybe to rank these conditions.

375
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:55,600
So these are the choices. You've everything on here. This is a literal example of what they did.

376
00:36:55,620 --> 00:37:01,590
So this is like legit. This is this is what happens. So this is in 14 different countries.

377
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,720
So they've got this groups that each of these countries has their own group of people.

378
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:11,740
And they're going to rank order these from most disabling to least disabling the 17 conditions.

379
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:16,420
And what I'm showing you here is the ranking of alcohol dependance.

380
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:20,310
Okay. So this is so this is Canada.

381
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:28,480
So Canada thinks out of the 17 things where one would be the most to say, like Canada says, alcohol dependance is nine.

382
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:34,990
Netherland is not a big deal. It's five. Okay, Nigeria, it's up to sorry.

383
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:40,180
Netherlands is much more disabling. Pardon me, it's a five. Right. So there are only four things more disabling on this list.

384
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:46,360
According to the Netherlands, relative to alcohol dependance Romania, it's 13.

385
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:50,050
Okay, so there's 12 things more disabling than alcohol dependance.

386
00:37:50,710 --> 00:38:01,360
So you kind of see first of all, like the, the variation in that in this ranking here, just one of the things about alcohol.

387
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:05,730
So in this paper they say the following. So they say two things.

388
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:08,440
These are not next to each other, but they are in the same paper,

389
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:12,910
which is one of these things where you kind of wonder sometimes I think they read earlier.

390
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:19,480
So the one point in the paper they say higher degrees of stigma were associated with higher disability ranking.

391
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:24,910
All right. So the more where we're going, we're heading to stigma. But they say the effect size is small point one.

392
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:29,200
Right. And that's like that small. But like I can tell you, like, it kind of depends on relative to what.

393
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:34,540
Okay. And so they say, yes, this has a has a scale.

394
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:39,470
But then later on they say. But not connected to this.

395
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:43,400
Later on, they say physical health conditions were ranked more uniformly.

396
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:49,819
Okay. So and now but not across informant groups. What informant groups means is like sometimes the group of people they get

397
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:54,390
together are like psychiatrists or psychologists or clinicians of some types,

398
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:57,860
and sometimes they're more like social service people.

399
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:02,030
They occasionally have a person who has the condition in the room, but very rarely.

400
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:07,740
So usually the people who are actually living with X thing are not represented in this disability ranking,

401
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:16,399
which is a whole nother conversation to have. So they get to this point, you know, they're like they don't see the connection between these two.

402
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:22,610
But I'm going to hopefully argue that those two statements are not it's not a coincidence that those both those things were true in the study.

403
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:33,780
So I'm going to pause here because I'm going to take a hard left into stigma and and how it relates to what we've been talking about so far.

404
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:38,630
Let me ask for clarifying questions. The question is.

405
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:51,600
So the first thing and for those of you who've had a chance to watch Bruce, how many of you watch First Things lecture so far on campus?

406
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:57,120
Okay. So for those of you, I really I know this is first week I said, okay, but watch that lecture.

407
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:00,470
And he argues he's, you know,

408
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:11,130
part of what he is he introduces in that lecture is this idea of is stigma and not simply a straight up synonym for discrimination.

409
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:14,820
And so part of what he lays out here are in one of his readings, I can't remember.

410
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:19,770
He doesn't talk, but certainly he's written a lot about this is your rights that two different definitions.

411
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:26,879
So the first definition is of prejudice, which has these elements of a antipathy.

412
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:33,480
That is, I don't want to be near you or I don't like the status that you have based on a faulty and inflexible generalization.

413
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:37,290
I might just feel that way, or I might do something to express how I feel.

414
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:46,260
I might. I'm going to direct this to a group of people that I identify as being part of or this individual once I know that you're part of that group.

415
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:55,830
You compare that to the definition of stigma here by Goffman, which is a situation where an individual is disqualified from full social acceptance.

416
00:40:56,250 --> 00:41:01,890
They are reduced in our mind from the usual person to a tainted and discounted one.

417
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:10,730
So there are some things that are shared across these definitions, but some things that are a little different.

418
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:14,580
But I hope that sort of, as we have this conversation today,

419
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:19,020
that you'll see that some of these elements are they're more similar than they are different.

420
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:32,550
So what makes things like schizophrenia, alcohol, dependance, drug dependance, depression, anxiety?

421
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:36,040
Like what makes them objects of stigma?

422
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:47,870
And to kind of get get at that, we can kind of think about like what makes some groups targets of discrimination or targets,

423
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:54,930
you know, racism, sexism, ageism, you know, gable ism, etc.

424
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:55,700
What makes that?

425
00:41:55,700 --> 00:42:05,040
And so what I'm going to argue is that those two ideas of discrimination and stigma are actually operating on kind of the same fundamental process.

426
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:10,880
So the first is there's some signals that signal might be something that I can observe,

427
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:15,560
like a your appearance or something that you're having trouble doing.

428
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:20,479
It might be a label that like society has bestowed upon you.

429
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:29,710
It might be some symptoms that I can't really observe, but I can, you know, sort of I somehow infer that that you're experiencing those signals then,

430
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:35,030
you know, I observe that, but then it gets interpreted in this brain through stereotypes.

431
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:40,040
And those stereotypes might be things like authoritarianism, right?

432
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:46,699
In terms of wanting to control another group, it might be there's there's also like positive mediators.

433
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:50,660
So I don't want to help this group. Right. I want to be positive towards this group in evidence.

434
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:56,810
There's social restrictions or I want to prevent people from engaging in certain things.

435
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:02,090
And the big thing that we're going to talk about with mental disorders is this idea of dangerous.

436
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:07,010
This person is dangerous. This person who is talking to themselves is dangerous.

437
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:11,959
This person who is unkempt appearance is dangerous.

438
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:17,210
I don't know what they're going to do, but I know that they are dangerous. Right. So that that if but that is not present here.

439
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:20,300
It's not that they're doing something here that in and of itself is dangerous.

440
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:23,420
Is that that that signal is being interpreted through the stereotype.

441
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:27,590
And then what happens at the outset is this idea of discrimination.

442
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:32,240
Right? So whether I can say I don't want to work with that person, I want to live with that person, I want to be with that person.

443
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:38,390
And I'm going to do whatever I can to make sure that this person is not treated

444
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:43,220
with full respect of another human being who did not exhibit those signals.

445
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:53,350
So, you know, the reason I do the word cloud and we're going to talk about this again in a few minutes.

446
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:56,750
The reason I do that, I've done that exercise every single time I teach this class.

447
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:02,810
And I felt that exercise with the with the help of the Center for Research on Learning and Teaching.

448
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:08,959
And the reason I do that is because it's really hard, even for people who like, you know,

449
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:15,140
a lot about mental health tonight to come up with ten words or at least one of them isn't negative.

450
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:21,080
And the reason is because everything that you've been told about mental disorders is negative.

451
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:28,549
Okay. Oh, I can't I can't even think of an example where it's like, this was a I mean, maybe there's, like, this idea of,

452
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:35,990
like, oh, there's this sort of, you know, the, the psychosis, like, helps with, like, creativity or something.

453
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,610
Like, there's some, like, maybe there's some weird, like, bizarre thing, but even then it's not like, Oh,

454
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:45,319
I want to be friends with Van Gogh because he's dealing with bipolar disorder and he's like an artistic genius like that.

455
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:48,500
Still doesn't like translate into this would be a cool guy, you know.

456
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:56,870
Okay. So, so mental disorders are associated with an astoundingly broad range of negative attributes, even to this day.

457
00:44:57,170 --> 00:45:02,090
Dangerousness is a huge one, being bad, being unworthy, being weak and ignorant.

458
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:11,389
And then the consequences are these are both in terms of direct and obvious, like discrimination in employment and housing.

459
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:17,750
We know that people have mental disorder, are less likely to be housed, they're less likely to be currently employed.

460
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:22,819
There are also, you know, think about any of your favorite television programs.

461
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:26,389
I got a feeling that if they talked about somebody with a was dealing with a mental disorder,

462
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:31,730
it wasn't in a positive way, but rather this person, what I'm like was inadequate.

463
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:35,809
So maybe that was presented in a way that like it was like this benevolence of like,

464
00:45:35,810 --> 00:45:40,790
let me help you, but it still wasn't like you're a whole person, right? So even if it wasn't unlikable and dangerous,

465
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:49,250
the other thing and we're going to talk about this when we talk to when we hear from advocates from the National Alliance on Mental Illness or NAMI,

466
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:53,120
they're going to come talk to us that family members also suffer from stigma.

467
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:58,219
So if you were the parent of a child with schizophrenia, if you're the parent of a child who's died from a drug overdose,

468
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:05,000
I guarantee you that that that the stigma that that that that is really about what that person has

469
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:10,250
or has experienced is now going to the family is going to get blamed for what has just happened,

470
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:13,820
either because maybe their own mental health status gets questioned.

471
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:18,070
Maybe their parenting gets questioned. Right. Like they're not, you know, they.

472
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:24,370
So this is an example of that idea of stigma.

473
00:46:24,370 --> 00:46:30,309
But then also each family bless you, the impact on family.

474
00:46:30,310 --> 00:46:36,940
And so I'm going to read this to you. And I. One of the things I would encourage you to do with your project is to bring in the voices

475
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:40,270
of people who are who are dealing with whatever condition you decide you're going to.

476
00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:46,390
Our situation doesn't have to be a condition. Whatever situation you're going to do your project on, as this one is called.

477
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:53,680
This is an example with this call, the volunteer. She says, My family, my father's had electricity shot through him and nobody must know.

478
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:57,160
Will he be blackened like lightning? Trees lying sideways in the wetlands.

479
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:02,230
My heroes, huge horse chestnut father who'd made my special saddle on his bike when I was little.

480
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:06,099
It was voluntary, my mother whispered of summers, mumbled all night.

481
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:12,100
That never ended up of days hunched over the table, his hands ringed into black tunnels for his eyes to look through and not see.

482
00:47:12,610 --> 00:47:21,260
I was at my wit's end. So this patient voluntary man, crept home with two rough circles at his temples where they jumpstarted him in shingles.

483
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:27,290
My mother explained as she hurried past the neighbors. My job was to take him by the hand and unobtrusively to lead him around town.

484
00:47:27,290 --> 00:47:31,129
Reached him three. Teach him all the names of all the streets that he'd always known and how to use

485
00:47:31,130 --> 00:47:35,720
his telephone so his secretary wouldn't guess he was not allowed out by himself.

486
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:41,970
My father's had electricity shot through him, and nobody must know. So what is this?

487
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:46,440
What is serious is being described here. What has happened to her father.

488
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:55,490
Yeah. Electric shock therapy. Yes. He's had electroconvulsive therapy, which is still used to this day as a treatment,

489
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:58,970
as a and it is an effective treatment for treatment resistant depression.

490
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:05,870
Where do you see stigma represented in this? Or is.

491
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:12,780
Yes. The reference to telling everyone else it's shingles so that they don't know that it's happened.

492
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:16,530
So I've got a new explanation for I've got an explanation for what's going on with him.

493
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:20,240
It's this physical health problem. Right?

494
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:27,200
Yeah. Where else is there? Yeah.

495
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:32,500
Actually, do we have to send other people in?

496
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:38,190
So you can't you can't to be observed to be less than in any way.

497
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:44,210
So we're going to try to patch up this these functional things that you've been experiencing for us.

498
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:48,060
Yeah. How about yourself?

499
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:53,000
You can't be. You can't be. Everyone needs to be with them. Yep. Where else do you relax?

500
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:08,100
Why do you think? She says it was voluntary. Does that signal to you?

501
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:17,639
Yeah. I guess like in the past, like the idea of like mental asylums,

502
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:23,969
like people are trying to get mental disorder treatment, like because they can't operate themselves at all.

503
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:32,129
So I saying it's voluntary. I think maybe like your dad still has some form of consciousness and he wants to get better.

504
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:38,370
And because that's somehow just a little bit better than being taken to jail, it's a little bit better.

505
00:49:38,490 --> 00:49:41,890
Right. So we're it's like we're splitting hairs here in terms, too.

506
00:49:41,910 --> 00:49:51,890
And this is like the absolute function of I mean, you think about it in terms of, you know, just discrimination based on skin tone, right?

507
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:59,970
This isn't another example. It's like, well, there's I mean, these there are so many different ways that people split hairs to not be the worst.

508
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:04,770
So the worst situation is he's taken in voluntarily. Everyone knows it.

509
00:50:04,770 --> 00:50:12,210
They know why and he can't function. Right. That's the worst scenario. So everything else I'm doing here is to try to get him out of that status and.

510
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:17,650
So that's a poem. This is what it looks like in real life.

511
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:21,200
So this is a woman who this was a few years ago. I'm not going to play this video,

512
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:28,879
but it is in the notes of the slide who was in a Baltimore hospital and she was just put out and this is I think is happening in January.

513
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:35,660
So is this is cold in Baltimore. Even in Baltimore. And she's she's clearly delusional.

514
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:40,730
She's clearly doesn't know where she is. She has she's completely inappropriate dressed, inappropriately dressed.

515
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:45,290
And they just discharged her. You know, she had no work knowing.

516
00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:46,009
She had nowhere to go.

517
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:54,380
Like it's now clear that the hospital staff know knew that they were putting her out onto the street knowingly, which is this is completely and.

518
00:50:55,720 --> 00:51:00,780
Heard, you know, the argument is simply like this is that, you know, we didn't have a bed for her.

519
00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:02,880
Okay. Why don't we have enough psychiatric beds, right?

520
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:10,329
Like so the way that, like, sort of becomes a rationale as to why this stuff continues to happen, but it's that the fundamental,

521
00:51:10,330 --> 00:51:17,980
if you sort of like think about stigma and discrimination and sort of like fundamentally this core thing that just gets expressed in different ways,

522
00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:26,190
like, well, we didn't have enough beds, so I couldn't, I had to discharge her and, you know, or I didn't, you know, like just these different these,

523
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:34,150
these ignoring the kind of fundamental structure that keeps making these things come back, reiterate in different ways.

524
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:40,690
So, you know, we talk about like what is stigma? Just like is this just like a normal reaction?

525
00:51:40,690 --> 00:51:44,090
And people have argued, you know, thought about this. So what? What?

526
00:51:44,410 --> 00:51:46,120
So there is there is an argument.

527
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:51,309
And you can be like, go read the evolutionary psychologists that basically say like, look, stigma and discrimination, etc.,

528
00:51:51,310 --> 00:51:55,450
like these are like evolutionarily conserved things in our brain that help us sort

529
00:51:55,450 --> 00:51:58,240
of like identify like who's part of our group and who's not part of our group.

530
00:51:58,630 --> 00:52:03,730
And that's that's sort of this fundamental thing about sort of protecting ourselves.

531
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:08,200
Okay. Sure. Even if that's operating the sociologists, which is, again,

532
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:11,739
I'm going to bring back this idea of like this idea of like social groups are saying like

533
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:16,240
like an evolutionary psychology perspective might have something to say about this,

534
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:22,569
but that the real thing and especially the thing that we can alter the whole yeah, I think I was like,

535
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:26,590
why is the procedure in place for homeless people who like are in the psych ward and then like.

536
00:52:27,590 --> 00:52:30,590
Eventually they stay there forever. Like they do get discharged.

537
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:40,080
Like they don't have anywhere to go. So. So we're going to talk to Trish Cortez, who is the executive director of Wash My Community Wash.

538
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:46,190
It's going to come to talk to you all. I think in November, she's coming and this.

539
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:49,460
And we're also going to talk about this idea when we talk about mental health services.

540
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:55,520
So unless because of the way and the history of this, because of the history of how courts have worked out.

541
00:52:56,610 --> 00:53:04,349
The only situation in which you can treat someone for a psychiatric condition without

542
00:53:04,350 --> 00:53:09,030
their explicit consent is if they are an immediate threat to themselves or others.

543
00:53:10,050 --> 00:53:13,730
So absent that, you cannot force someone to treatment.

544
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:19,860
So you can't force someone who's unhoused to get treatment even though you have.

545
00:53:20,010 --> 00:53:26,159
And if you want, you would pay for it. You would. You know, it's it's unless they are an immediate harm to themselves or others.

546
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:31,860
And so what? I mean, this is why we have an in-house population that has a high prevalence of serious illness,

547
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:39,450
because there actually isn't a legal because the threshold is so high, there's actually not a way to help somebody, you know, absent.

548
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:43,860
Like intense case management and then hopefully getting someone there.

549
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:48,510
But the you know, it's sort of it's this bizarre idea because part of what's happening is like the person,

550
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:56,820
especially if somebody is psychotic, like they're not able to articulate like they they can't tell you what's happening.

551
00:53:57,010 --> 00:54:00,450
Right. Or like, you know what I mean? You can tell them something like, I'm going to take you to a safe place.

552
00:54:01,050 --> 00:54:05,100
And they may think that you're like the devil or have some I mean,

553
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:11,520
like they don't they're not able to perceive reality, you know, and so but that that is not the threshold.

554
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:16,530
The threshold is, are they threatening to kill themselves or somebody else? Then I can get them and then I can get them to a hospital.

555
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:21,270
Likely I will get them arrested and then they'll be in the criminal justice system, which is the other way that goes.

556
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:24,660
And if they are like in the hospital, what's the procedure for?

557
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:26,740
Like once they get better, like.

558
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:35,430
Well, so you can only hold so you can only hold someone against their will for that period of time when they are a threat to themselves or others.

559
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:39,690
And then you learn. You must discharge. You must discharge.

560
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:45,680
So people I mean, people are afraid if they go to a psychiatrist that they're going to become admitted.

561
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:52,440
I'm actually this is this a huge risk that people people think still exists, that that is almost impossible to happen.

562
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:57,270
This is part of what made Britney Spears like situation so unusual.

563
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:04,469
But the argument on her family side was like she as I said, we don't know exactly what's going on,

564
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:12,360
but there's some sort of psychiatric thing going on in there. Like this was this was to protect her, her physical self and her assets.

565
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:15,590
And then it became broadly it's more about this assets thing, right?

566
00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:20,460
Which is what she was she was arguing because you can see that being useful for a short period of time.

567
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:26,520
But the idea that that you need that for a decade is is was not obviously well justified and worked on it.

568
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:32,200
Yeah. Okay. So, I mean, so.

569
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:36,919
So if we think about like what is the function of segments, I think there's this evolutionary argument,

570
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:40,610
but I'm mean argue for a different perspective, which is this more sociological idea?

571
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:44,090
So what is the function of stimuli? What do I get when I stigmatize a group?

572
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:51,409
So there's three things I get. So I get a way of keeping people down so you can think about this is exploitation and domination.

573
00:55:51,410 --> 00:55:54,649
So this is like I have there's a group that has power.

574
00:55:54,650 --> 00:55:59,780
This is a group that is not dealing with a mental health problem and they are able to exploit it, dominate this other group.

575
00:56:00,530 --> 00:56:10,010
So I get to maintain my relative position. There's keeping people in, which is I'm going to you know, our group behaves in this way.

576
00:56:10,070 --> 00:56:14,010
Right. We don't talk to ourselves on the books or we you know, we keep our, you know,

577
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:19,409
whatever we're dressed in a certain way and we have certain hygiene and we work and we, you know, do these other things, right?

578
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:25,020
So the stigma enforces social norms that, like we as a society benefit from.

579
00:56:25,650 --> 00:56:29,960
And then there's this piece which does relate to evolutionary psychology, which is that keeping people away.

580
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:36,299
So the idea of disease avoidance that there's this like disgust reaction, there's this concern that I'm going to get this from you.

581
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:44,790
And certainly we see this I mean, the early stages of the HIV epidemic, this was like a huge part of stigma towards people who were HIV positive.

582
00:56:44,790 --> 00:56:49,140
And then, of course, got applied to people who are LGBTQ. Right. Because this is who was being most affected by this.

583
00:56:49,470 --> 00:56:55,050
So you can see it like it's actually like a very short distance between stigmatizing a behavior and stigmatizing the whole.

584
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:59,730
People have this other status that is associated with that behavior. So.

585
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:04,950
So all of these things are operating and stigma. They're all also operating in discrimination.

586
00:57:04,950 --> 00:57:10,290
And we can kind of argue as to which flavor of it are we dealing with in our current situation.

587
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:17,220
So when it comes to mental health disorders, the things that really influence variation and stigma, attitudes that there's severity.

588
00:57:17,230 --> 00:57:20,400
So to what degree is this you know, is this person able?

589
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:23,670
Are they housed? Are they able to hold a job, etc.?

590
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:27,810
This perceived dangerousness is a huge trait, which I'll talk about a little bit 1/2.

591
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:32,310
The idea of control is that you see this a lot with depression, right?

592
00:57:32,310 --> 00:57:35,400
Was this person could just do X, they could just get out of bed.

593
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:39,120
They could just, you know, or somebody with anxiety. They could just do extra stopping, anxious.

594
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:41,610
Right. Of course. Dr. Phil, why wouldn't I just think about that?

595
00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:52,590
This idea of contagiousness, this was huge, particularly when we, you know, a couple of hundred years ago, ideas about mental disorders, stability.

596
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:59,940
So the idea of whether these symptoms are treated, this idea of I'm going to skip this one for a second, morality.

597
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:02,309
So belief that the condition is a punishment, right.

598
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:08,640
This is still actually not the especially and not it's not as common in the United States, but it still does exist.

599
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:15,060
But I worked with a gentleman who was one of three psychiatrists in all of the country of Afghanistan.

600
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:18,150
Afghanistan had three psychiatrist on one. Maybe they have a few more.

601
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:23,850
He was here in America on a fellowship, and he was taking my graduate version of this class.

602
00:58:24,390 --> 00:58:28,680
And he was you know, I'm talking about all the things I'm telling you.

603
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:34,739
And he's telling me that in his country, you know, because there's only three psychiatrist the idea is if,

604
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:39,270
like what you do, if your family member develops schizophrenia or starts developing,

605
00:58:39,270 --> 00:58:41,190
I mean, develop symptoms of psychosis,

606
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:47,760
is they still like bring them to religious temples and often just leave them there and sometimes they're restrained and left.

607
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:50,730
And the idea that like, I'll come back in a week and this person will be cured.

608
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:56,550
So the idea that like this is a punishment from God is, is even if it's not as prevalent here, it is still prevalent.

609
00:58:57,300 --> 00:59:01,110
There's also this idea that this was probably a decade ago now that people thought like,

610
00:59:01,110 --> 00:59:04,769
if I just explained that depression and schizophrenia and anxiety and substance use problems,

611
00:59:04,770 --> 00:59:12,750
that these are all just in the brain, there's a biology of this, then people will discriminate against it less.

612
00:59:13,290 --> 00:59:19,439
And it turns out that's just absolutely not true. So which condition of all the things you're going to talk about in this class,

613
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:25,560
which condition do you think we have the most secure understanding of the neurobiology of what's going on?

614
00:59:26,010 --> 00:59:34,050
So we're going to talk about six things cognitive impairment, autism, substance use and abuse, schizophrenia, suicide and depression.

615
00:59:34,290 --> 00:59:37,500
Um, those six things, which do you think we're like?

616
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:43,400
I have a great I have a best understanding of what's happened in the brain. Yeah.

617
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:47,239
What, you guys. Substance abuse. Substance abuse? Why do you think that is? I don't know.

618
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:50,780
I guess I just feel like because you're, like, ingesting things, it's easier to see.

619
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:54,890
Like, what things you or something are doing to your body. Not only are you ingesting things.

620
00:59:55,040 --> 01:00:02,130
Who else ingest things? Rats and mice. So I do I get a rat addicted to cocaine idea.

621
01:00:02,190 --> 01:00:04,220
I mean, not personally, but like, I mean, if it's not.

622
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:09,530
Okay, so, like, these things are done and so are you can actually see and then you can take that rat,

623
01:00:09,530 --> 01:00:14,930
you can go to the bathroom and then you look at it, you can look at the slices under a microscope and you see what happened.

624
01:00:15,170 --> 01:00:18,230
It's like, okay, how do you tell if a rat's depressed?

625
01:00:19,430 --> 01:00:23,650
There's no cure all they you don't know what that brand is, but that's a shame.

626
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:28,430
That's on you. Okay. So all right. So let me talk a little bit about again how stigma.

627
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:34,660
This isn't just a, you know, cognitive exercise, but there are legitimate actually wants to get through.

628
01:00:34,970 --> 01:00:39,110
Okay. There are legitimate things going on here. So this is very famous supreme.

629
01:00:39,110 --> 01:00:42,530
So it's gotta stands for Supreme Court of the United States. You maybe you've heard of them lately.

630
01:00:42,530 --> 01:00:47,599
They've been issuing some interesting rulings lately. So, um, so this is the story of the Carrie Buck.

631
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:52,489
She is a, a white woman who has been committed to the Virginia State Colony for Epileptics and the Feebleminded.

632
01:00:52,490 --> 01:00:59,420
Again, these are not words that have any meaning to us today, but it also, I guess I want to point out to you how for a long time epilepsy,

633
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:04,520
which we understand is a neurological condition, was seen in the same exact breath as anything else that was going on.

634
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:08,899
Behavioral disorders. She is ordered to have her tubes tied.

635
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:15,740
That's what this I'm not going to try. She appeals under the 14th Amendment, which is the equal protection protection clause,

636
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:19,970
that you can't have your life, liberty or property without due process tonight.

637
01:01:20,930 --> 01:01:25,190
This is from the. This is text taken from the decision. So she loses the Supreme Court case.

638
01:01:25,910 --> 01:01:30,380
So this is the Supreme Court justices saying the act of Virginia recites the health of the patient

639
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:35,239
and the welfare of society may be promoted in certain cases by the sterilization mental defect.

640
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:37,700
There's I want you to as people who are in public health,

641
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:44,780
I want you to understand this is setting up that the public's health benefits from this situation,

642
01:01:45,050 --> 01:01:54,140
this is public health being used to like the her liberty is not does not outweigh the health of to the public.

643
01:01:55,130 --> 01:01:59,600
It's important to understand this because like this is like the fundamental problem or not.

644
01:01:59,870 --> 01:02:05,090
This is the fundamental crux in which all public health things sit.

645
01:02:05,540 --> 01:02:12,980
This is where like fluoridation of water sits. This is where mandated vaccinations, individual liberty versus public welfare.

646
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:18,920
Okay. And so you might agree that we should have mandatory mandated vaccines, right?

647
01:02:19,070 --> 01:02:23,030
So you might not agree that the public welfare is benefited in this case.

648
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:30,770
Right. But it's the same argument. So they again, this idea, it's the best interests, not just for society, but for hers.

649
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:38,450
And the the idea that we're you know, she has this hereditary form of insanity.

650
01:02:38,450 --> 01:02:44,030
So she now you're saying science brought in this idea. Her mother is also a patient at the same place.

651
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:50,270
Then they have this interesting soapbox where they say we've seen more than once,

652
01:02:50,270 --> 01:02:56,240
then, well, public welfare may call on the best citizens for their lives. So this is coming right on the heels of World War One.

653
01:02:56,270 --> 01:02:59,540
All right. So like we send people off to war and they die for our country.

654
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:06,290
It would be really weird if the state couldn't call for these lesser sacrifices from people who already set the strength of the state.

655
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:11,450
And then you have this very famous quote at the end, which is the idea that three generations of imbeciles are in prison.

656
01:03:11,450 --> 01:03:14,810
She's referring to the family that Carrie Buck is part of.

657
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:21,670
So this this is the legal and, you know, codification of state.

658
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:29,270
This is what this is. And this this continued so forced sterilizations continued in Virginia until about the 1970s, we think.

659
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:35,070
I mean, I say like we think because it's possible these things continued after the 1970s.

660
01:03:35,310 --> 01:03:44,000
They definitely continued until the 1970s. So this idea of interpretation again.

661
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,879
So there's the signals that are coming in and then there's the cognitive

662
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:50,630
mediators that are interpreting the way this again ties back to discrimination.

663
01:03:50,630 --> 01:03:53,820
We can see this in examples here. This is the images from Hurricane Katrina.

664
01:03:54,200 --> 01:04:02,390
So this is the Associated Press saying that this young man who we can see is probably African-American, is looting a grocery store.

665
01:04:02,780 --> 01:04:06,320
We can see these two people who appear to be white are finding bread.

666
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:11,510
I was just out and about, I guess, but not somehow in a grocery store, and they clearly paid for it.

667
01:04:11,870 --> 01:04:15,140
So that's they because I can tell that from this image.

668
01:04:16,430 --> 01:04:22,050
They found. Right? They found it. It was just out. But again, so it's like this is this is the same thing.

669
01:04:22,070 --> 01:04:24,250
What I'm trying to tell you is like this is the same sort of thing.

670
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:27,829
It's just a different you know, it's a little bit more we say to make you say tomato.

671
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:33,020
I say tomato. Okay. All right. I got to be quick. So how will we measure this in population research?

672
01:04:33,020 --> 01:04:37,670
So the way we measure it is that through a thing called social distance, we so before we were all social distancing.

673
01:04:38,030 --> 01:04:42,580
In my field, we had this term social worker to describe stigma. Like, that's literally what the definition is like.

674
01:04:42,590 --> 01:04:49,579
This is how we measure it. So I ask you like, okay, well, how willing would you be willing how willing would you be to have a person with this thing?

675
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:51,780
And I'm I read you have been hit, so I don't just say depression.

676
01:04:51,780 --> 01:04:57,730
I guess I'm going to describe what this person's doing and describe what the signs and symptoms of that person are moving next door to you.

677
01:04:57,740 --> 01:05:02,540
Spend an evening with, work closely with, or have married into your family and you tell me how willing you are to do that.

678
01:05:03,230 --> 01:05:08,150
This is a this is a hyperlink to the general social survey where you could mess around with that date yourself if you were so inclined.

679
01:05:09,170 --> 01:05:15,319
So this is the type of thing you would see. So I would say a description of this gentleman, 27 years old, Jim Johnson, follows.

680
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:17,959
After two years, he was hospitalized after being diagnosed with schizophrenia.

681
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:21,440
After receiving treatment, he now appears to be recovered and doing very well. He's clean and well-groomed.

682
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:25,489
He is a part time janitorial job. He gets along well with his coworkers, takes initial coffee breaks.

683
01:05:25,490 --> 01:05:29,899
He checks his work carefully and completes tasks before moving on to another. This might slow him down a little bit.

684
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:33,350
He's never criticized for the quality of his work, yadda, yadda, yadda.

685
01:05:33,470 --> 01:05:39,200
All right, so there's Jim. And so then I say, okay, well, how willing are you to have Jim move next door?

686
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:42,870
Spend an evening with, work closely with, or have married your family? Okay.

687
01:05:43,730 --> 01:05:48,160
And you can also do it here. That describes his symptoms. So sometimes people are randomized to this vignette,

688
01:05:48,170 --> 01:05:53,420
which says he would sometimes hear voices which hallucinations, his thinking was confusing, tangential, etc., etc.

689
01:05:53,430 --> 01:05:57,830
I guess how willing would you be willing to have this guy sit next to you?

690
01:05:58,610 --> 01:06:01,730
And so what we know based on, again, quantitative evidence,

691
01:06:02,090 --> 01:06:09,890
is that the thing that is really driving stigma when it comes to mental disorders is this idea of perceptions of dangerousness.

692
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:15,140
And I don't mean this is like this. It's like we all feel this way.

693
01:06:15,290 --> 01:06:23,200
Like we all feel this way at times. Okay. And the and what that is doing is driving fear is driving a desire for social distance.

694
01:06:23,210 --> 01:06:28,870
I mean, think about it. Think about how this operated with conflict right there.

695
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:34,070
I presume there were places that you felt were potentially more dangerous or you were told were more dangerous.

696
01:06:34,070 --> 01:06:37,930
Right. And then you had fear that kept you from going out. Okay.

697
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:46,940
And perhaps maybe you had to go out to that place once and then you didn't get home or maybe you got Copan and it was it wasn't so bad.

698
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:52,780
And so now you have familiarity, which is inversely associated with dangerousness, right?

699
01:06:52,790 --> 01:06:56,659
So this, this is how we learn about the world, right?

700
01:06:56,660 --> 01:07:02,720
But the problem is, is that when the way that we're learning about the world is through this cognitive filter of perceived dangerousness,

701
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:10,370
I can't actually get to things, but it does. What is what is helpful is that we see that this idea of familiarity.

702
01:07:10,370 --> 01:07:16,399
So that is working with somebody who has a mental health problem or having that person in your family,

703
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:20,720
etc., is associated with lower perceptions of dangerousness.

704
01:07:23,570 --> 01:07:27,469
Skip this. This is just showing you what I just said.

705
01:07:27,470 --> 01:07:34,549
So this is your average. How much social distance do you want if you've had previous contact with a person who has some

706
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:39,170
sort of mental illness and so that you can see the social distance is significantly lower even,

707
01:07:39,410 --> 01:07:45,500
and that is largely driven by a lower perception of dangerousness, even though they have about the same affective reactions.

708
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:50,630
So you're still like, whoa, but it's not. Oh, and that person's of is a danger to myself.

709
01:07:52,310 --> 01:08:03,170
You might think that people who have more exposure to people with a mental health problem would by definition have lower desire for social distance.

710
01:08:03,170 --> 01:08:10,879
But that's actually not the case. So what I'm showing you here is the average social distance desired by a psychiatrist, psychologists,

711
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:15,950
psychiatric nurses, other therapists and the general public not to even yet of schizophrenia.

712
01:08:15,950 --> 01:08:19,069
A vignette of major depression and a vignette of a non case you can think about.

713
01:08:19,070 --> 01:08:26,600
This is just like I don't like people. Okay, so like psychiatrists on average want a distance of 2.2 from anybody else.

714
01:08:26,810 --> 01:08:31,160
Okay, that's the way to think about it. So by how much distance they want from somebody with schizophrenia, they want 3.3.

715
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:35,000
You can compare that to the general public who only wants a distance of 2.9.

716
01:08:36,050 --> 01:08:40,730
Why would a psychiatrist want much more social distance from a case of schizophrenia than than the general public?

717
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:50,250
Why wouldn't they want less? I have more familiarity, right?

718
01:08:50,340 --> 01:08:57,690
Certainly much more familiar. So, like white. Yeah. Since I have more familiarity, they probably also seem like the worst case scenario.

719
01:08:58,830 --> 01:09:05,780
Right. So in actually to get a psychiatrist means by definition you've kind of failed out of primary health care and prevention, etc., etc.

720
01:09:05,790 --> 01:09:09,629
Right. So, right. So they're seeing a much more severe situation.

721
01:09:09,630 --> 01:09:13,650
And you can see that. What's also interesting is that, you know, you see something like major depression.

722
01:09:14,070 --> 01:09:17,490
People actually, they want a little bit less social distance, but not that much less.

723
01:09:18,030 --> 01:09:28,019
So in terms of in terms of that, then and then you ask those same people, well, what, what what kind of things should we do to kind of restrict?

724
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:30,060
Again, this is around exploitation and domination.

725
01:09:31,110 --> 01:09:39,120
So this is a 2420 9% of psychiatrists think that if somebody has a psychiatric illness, they should not be able to drive.

726
01:09:40,290 --> 01:09:44,610
20% of the public thinks that person should not be able to vote. Okay.

727
01:09:45,220 --> 01:09:51,090
So, you know, people are you know, it's not that this is meaningless even today.

728
01:09:51,090 --> 01:09:53,159
I mean, this is, I guess, the studies from 2006. Right.

729
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:58,530
But the idea that, like, people are pretty willing to accept these things, what's interesting here is this compulsory admission.

730
01:09:59,010 --> 01:10:03,600
So your mental health specialists, 98% of them think if somebody has a psychiatric illness,

731
01:10:03,690 --> 01:10:08,219
they should be we should be able to admit them without their consent. This is exactly the same reason that you just argue, right?

732
01:10:08,220 --> 01:10:13,830
Because if they are not able to like their perception of reality is are altered and I need to

733
01:10:13,830 --> 01:10:17,760
get them stable and then I can explain to them what's happening to their body and their brain,

734
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:23,340
and then I can get them help. So they want people to be able to be admitted even if they're not a danger to themselves or others.

735
01:10:23,580 --> 01:10:27,960
The general public does not want that right too. Only two thirds of the general public want you to be able to do that.

736
01:10:27,990 --> 01:10:32,610
Yeah. Is there a particular reason that for the right to vote and abortion,

737
01:10:32,610 --> 01:10:39,000
like the statistics for the general public, is significantly higher than like every other like medical.

738
01:10:39,390 --> 01:10:47,940
Like it's just like like the medical personnel I don't this abortion what is so this is actually you should

739
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:53,750
force them to have an abortion if they were pregnant like that is that is what that statement is from.

740
01:10:55,410 --> 01:10:58,580
I don't know what other than stigma. Right.

741
01:10:58,620 --> 01:11:06,590
So because but even I mean, even here we're at 5 to 10% of mental health professionals are on board with this.

742
01:11:06,690 --> 01:11:12,389
Okay. So so how have things gotten better?

743
01:11:12,390 --> 01:11:17,010
No. So so this is 1996. This is when your parents were born or something.

744
01:11:17,010 --> 01:11:22,739
Okay. So anyway, but the point is, is like this is showing you changes over time. Not really.

745
01:11:22,740 --> 01:11:25,800
I know, but this is like when your cohort was born.

746
01:11:26,010 --> 01:11:28,380
But the point is, is like this is what it looks like.

747
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:33,690
You can see that the condition that we have actually the highest amount of social stigma in the United States is alcohol dependance.

748
01:11:33,690 --> 01:11:39,120
Maybe that's not surprising, but maybe this these are consequences of stigma.

749
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:46,919
So we talked about this is talk a little bit about people being afraid of being committed, but people there are legitimate consequences of stigma.

750
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:50,940
People say, I'm afraid of will if I got treatment. So this is what I'm showing you.

751
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:56,160
Here are paragraphs of people who have a mental health, mental health condition.

752
01:11:56,700 --> 01:12:00,680
They wanted treatment for it and they did gotten it did not get treatment for it.

753
01:12:00,870 --> 01:12:03,870
Okay. They have a condition. They want treatment. They did not get it.

754
01:12:03,870 --> 01:12:09,240
And the question is, why didn't you get it? The first part is, I could not afford it.

755
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:15,000
Now we can argue that's also a manifestation of stigma because health insurance was a really hard to get help.

756
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:20,610
And most psychiatrist psychologists don't take insurance, which we'll talk about, which I'll call services.

757
01:12:22,860 --> 01:12:25,960
The second is they thought they could handle problem without treatment.

758
01:12:26,030 --> 01:12:30,629
Right. So this is a preference I don't want I don't want that kind of the third is I don't know where to go.

759
01:12:30,630 --> 01:12:34,440
And then the next block is all different is just think back to that point.

760
01:12:34,890 --> 01:12:37,200
I'm concerned about being committed or having to take medicine.

761
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:41,340
That is, I'm concerned about having to do something that I am that is not voluntarily my choice.

762
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:45,870
I'm concerned I may lose my job. I'm concerned my neighbors will find it. I'm concerned anybody will find out.

763
01:12:46,980 --> 01:12:55,470
Okay. So this these are primary drivers after cost stigma is a primary driver of why people don't get treatment.

764
01:12:58,380 --> 01:13:00,930
I'm going to skip this, but just we're going to talk about this.

765
01:13:00,930 --> 01:13:04,139
When we talk about treatment, there are different preferences in terms of what kind of treat.

766
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:09,020
When you say treatment, what does that mean and what is my preference? We'll skip all this.

767
01:13:09,050 --> 01:13:14,300
Okay, so. So what's interesting and you'll maybe you'll recognize a couple of these names.

768
01:13:14,570 --> 01:13:21,650
So Robert Sellers just stepped down from being our diversity, equity and inclusion chair from the stream.

769
01:13:21,670 --> 01:13:25,370
Jackson is the guy who ran the National Survey of Black Americans Necessary with American Life.

770
01:13:25,370 --> 01:13:28,160
And you've got to watch us talk with him in a few weeks.

771
01:13:28,580 --> 01:13:33,590
So they had actually done work on to the two places that were first integrated in the United States,

772
01:13:33,590 --> 01:13:36,969
the first place that was integrated federal integration, racial integration.

773
01:13:36,970 --> 01:13:44,240
The United States was the armed services. And there have been studies showing that if you were in the military pre versus post integration,

774
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:50,630
that your attitudes towards working with people from different racial backgrounds became substantially more positive after integration of military.

775
01:13:51,020 --> 01:13:57,320
The other place where we got integrated, one of the first places that we had mandated integration was on the field.

776
01:13:57,740 --> 01:14:03,770
So in sports teams and they've been able to show quantitatively that if you were playing sports pre integration versus post integration,

777
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:10,280
that your attitudes towards working and in this case playing with people of different backgrounds were certainly much,

778
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:12,740
much more positive post integration. So again,

779
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:19,550
this idea that like the thing that reduces feelings of racial discrimination are directly working with people from different racial backgrounds.

780
01:14:20,030 --> 01:14:22,999
Part of what makes this really hard to do in the United States is because we live in such a

781
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,870
segregated society that people don't actually live near people who look different from them.

782
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:33,570
What reduces attitudes of stigma towards people with mental illness? The answer is directly learning from people who have experienced mental illness.

783
01:14:33,590 --> 01:14:36,790
This is a paper that I wrote a couple of years ago based on this class.

784
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:41,330
And so if you read this paper, you will see data from the very first group of students who took this class.

785
01:14:41,750 --> 01:14:46,399
And the reason that you're going to hear from people who have mental illness or dealing with mental health or family members of

786
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:51,950
dealing mental health is because this is of all the things I could do to help address stigma attitudes in the United States.

787
01:14:51,950 --> 01:14:58,519
It's doing that and helping you get exposure to that. Okay, so we're out of time, but I'm going to leave you with your homework.

788
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:02,660
So I guess I'll leave you with a summary that I'm going to tell you your homework, which is also on canvas.

789
01:15:02,990 --> 01:15:08,480
So stigma is still prevalent. It's both in the journal population and among experts or clinicians.

790
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:13,669
The only thing that we know that seems to reduce feelings of stigma is actually getting

791
01:15:13,670 --> 01:15:17,210
exposure to people who are living with psychiatric condition or mental condition,

792
01:15:18,050 --> 01:15:23,450
increasing knowledge or awareness, telling people what's in the brain, etc. It has had almost no effect on stigma.

793
01:15:23,450 --> 01:15:29,450
When you talk about mixed effects, that is another time. So what I want you to do is so on.

794
01:15:29,540 --> 01:15:38,359
There is a there is on the discussion board, you will find it's called stigma and it has this word or word cloud from Monday attached to it.

795
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:45,350
Now it's also in the slide deck. And so what I need you to do is respond to the prompts, which is, again, looking at the word cloud.

796
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:49,630
What words do you think are should be, should be smaller, larger?

797
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:54,200
Are there terms that you think are missing? This is due on the seventh at 1159.

798
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:57,080
So that's where I will leave us.

799
01:15:57,080 --> 01:16:09,950
I'll stay around for a couple of questions on on how to make money and helping others may not be such a labor of love.

800
01:16:11,950 --> 01:16:15,700
Thank you for bringing that.
