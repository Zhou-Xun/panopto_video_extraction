1
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:09,000
All right. We're live. I don't know.

2
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,809
I'm with you on the scheduling.

3
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:17,000
The school aid committee is the Android Authority. So I run up here and then I'm all right.

4
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:20,160
Right. And we can't speak anyway.

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,480
Okay, so where are we? Here.

6
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,940
Here's our schedule today. We're here at the 13th.

7
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,350
Oh, it's my brother's breakfast. Probably text reminds me.

8
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,729
That's right. So last time we talked about pathways and routes, we've been focused on routing.

9
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:47,490
We got partway through. So we're going to finish that today and then start in on chemical risk assessment, which we will then finish that on Thursday.

10
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:50,610
Next week we're going to get into standards and guidelines.

11
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:57,390
So on Tuesday we'll have a guest lecture from Professor Terblanche and then I will talk to Occupational on Thursday.

12
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:04,050
And we're getting you know, then next week we'll talk a little bit more about the quiz, which is coming up in two weeks.

13
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,020
So with that, any questions?

14
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:20,310
So as was asked last time, the problem sets are geared toward the second unit of the course because it's much more technical applied type stuff.

15
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:31,530
And since this first unit is more intro, I thought, you know, just a summary quiz at the end of that, that would probably be the best.

16
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,730
And I didn't want to load you up with the previous version.

17
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:38,820
This course had five problem sets, which I thought was too many because they are pretty involved.

18
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,860
So I will do it down to two and change to some of these other types of assignments.

19
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:51,320
They are. They give you two weeks for each of them, but they are a bit more time intensive.

20
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:54,360
So we'll talk about it when the time comes.

21
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,840
But they kind of track because they give you two weeks. There's several.

22
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,030
We'll track this across several lectures.

23
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:06,990
So if you just break it up by the material we cover for each class session, I think it should be quite manageable.

24
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,500
All right. Any thoughts, questions or concerns?

25
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:20,710
All right. So we'll continue on our exposure routes.

26
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:28,110
So we talked about inhalation, first bit about the lungs, gas exchange, difference between gases and vapors and aerosols.

27
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,220
Different definitions of various types of aerosols.

28
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:38,340
Talking about how important the size of the aerosol and the other characteristics are.

29
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,650
Then we moved into dermal and we were partway through journals.

30
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:51,090
We talked about the different structures of the skin, the stratification in being the outermost layer,

31
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:57,180
and also the most important for protecting us from chemical exposures.

32
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:04,470
And if you recall, had these protein structures, are these ovals in this picture and then the lipid in between.

33
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:09,690
So they call it a brick and mortar structure is sort of where we left off.

34
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:14,610
So this is the slide where we were. So skin exposure, again,

35
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:24,510
important for both occupational and environmental exposures and while different ways which your skin can come into contact with the chemical.

36
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:28,020
So the most extreme would be immersion.

37
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:40,080
So there's a lot of historical and even current industrial applications and operations word you might physically need to immerse maybe your hands,

38
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:45,870
maybe your arms into something that could contain a lot of toxic chemicals.

39
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:53,630
Obviously in the environmental non occupational setting, bathing and swimming, you have immersion, but there's other applications of just, you know,

40
00:03:53,970 --> 00:04:05,040
washing dishes a lot of different ways in which you might be fully in contact with at least part of your body with a matrix or a chemical.

41
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:08,130
So the next is deposition.

42
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:19,770
So this is, you know, any gas fever, aerosol, direct contact or for an aerosol deposited on the skin of this spray mist.

43
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:27,780
So, you know, you're spraying you see a hopefully this isn't you, but you see a spider in your kitchen.

44
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:32,110
You grab the rain just like totally douse it. Right. I've seen people do that before.

45
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:42,870
And you said, no, that's not how it works. But you can see how that spray mist, in addition to the inhalation concern, might also deposit on the skin.

46
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:48,419
You could also permeation that. The other one is more indirect.

47
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:56,610
So see that red guitar on a countertop and then you later touch the countertop or lean against the counter with your skin surface contact.

48
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:00,540
We'll talk about consumer products later in the in the semester.

49
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,530
That's a big area where you're trying to get that,

50
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:15,360
trying to estimate how much of that is transferred from a particular surface to the skin, which can be quite tricky to do.

51
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:23,100
So there's a lot to that. So these are some of the main ways pathways in which the to the skin.

52
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:27,729
And then the way in which we measure it or estimate or model,

53
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:36,160
it could depend on some of these mechanisms that we're expecting in a scenario or or observing in a workplace to try to get a grasp on it.

54
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,330
So we also want to think about secondary ingestion.

55
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:45,420
So in the workplace, this becomes a big deal with people who take cigaret breaks.

56
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:49,710
They don't wash their hands before they start smoking a cigaret you get out of hand.

57
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:52,510
Contact can happen there.

58
00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:02,740
Also, more recently, there's more much more focus on occupational exposures that could lead to sort of non occupational exposure.

59
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,809
So you go and you worked exposed a lot of lead dust at work.

60
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:11,420
It's all over your clothes. You go home and guess what, you take off your work clothes and it's all over your house house now,

61
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:19,070
which could result in turmoil and other relative exposure to other people in that space.

62
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,670
Okay. So it's various ways we get there.

63
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:31,570
So again, for dermal it, I mean, I'm not calling inhalation exposures easy by any means,

64
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:35,950
but when we get into dermal, you can see there's a lot going on.

65
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:41,710
They have to try to account for if you're trying to estimate the exposure with some precision.

66
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:45,690
So the first is the age. And of course, so what form is it in?

67
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:51,340
Is it a liquid solid gas or vapor that's going to make a big difference on how it might be able to get through the skin,

68
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:57,620
on the skin and through the skin. Then the media vehicle, like we just heard discussing, is it in water?

69
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:05,409
Is it as part of a solution like a dipping station in a factory or that can a rate?

70
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:11,980
I've talked about all kinds of different ways in which it could be it's some sort of vehicle that could have other

71
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:19,480
chemicals involved that could increase or decrease its ability to get to the skin and stay on the skin and penetrate.

72
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:27,440
Different types of aerosols, like a spoiled particle. Then what's going to happen?

73
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:34,160
To the agent of interest in that particle now interacts with body and other particulate matter.

74
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:37,940
So that's another layer. And then once you get to the skin.

75
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:44,500
Is it going to stay on the skin? How much of it is actually in contact with the skin?

76
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:50,140
And then what form is it in the dry or what?

77
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:55,000
So all this is just getting from the source to the skin.

78
00:07:55,300 --> 00:08:02,560
All these factors to keep in mind that might influence how things are calculated or measured.

79
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:10,709
So we talked about inhalation last time. These are our main variables of need to to figure it out.

80
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:20,440
Once you have the inhale concentration as a reminder, your exposure rate, inhalation, volume, etc. and then once it's to the lungs,

81
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:28,540
we talk about particle size for so very small particles and gases and vapors to penetrate all the way to the deep personal things.

82
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:32,740
Whereas you'll have deposition in other parts of lungs based on that aerosol size,

83
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:37,890
and then how much of it actually crosses that barrier into the bloodstream is its bioavailability.

84
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:44,050
So that's what we talked about last time. We're going to compare it now to we're talking about skin exposure here.

85
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:51,460
We want to try to get that. What's the skin loading? How much of that agent is getting on the skin?

86
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:58,620
You also need to know or calculate the skilled voting rate.

87
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:06,750
So there we have a unit of time and oops, total surface area and contact.

88
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:15,670
So how much of the skin is in contact? And that's where you get your integrated exposure dose.

89
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:19,120
So you have your skin concentration at times.

90
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:28,390
That area is your mass, but that's not it, because you also need to know once it gets on the skin, that mass of the agent of interest is on the skin.

91
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:37,209
How much of that then is expected to penetrate, permeated through the skin and into the bloodstream?

92
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:41,680
If we're talking about systemic effect, again, it could be a skin effect. But a lot of times we're interested in this.

93
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:47,530
More systemic therapy might need to account for losses due to the evaporation.

94
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,820
And so there's, again, some complicated.

95
00:09:52,850 --> 00:10:02,700
Things to consider and then your bioavailability so that I've seen a lot of different ways to do this for dermal as a lot less as we've

96
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:11,990
I think I touched on her early on inhalation has been a main focus of environmental occupational exposure for decades and decades.

97
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:19,730
So that's where a lot of the sampling strategies, a lot of modeling strategies have been developed that entire time.

98
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:27,320
Dermal is a little bit newer to the level of information you have in any given scenario, might be a little bit less, might vary.

99
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:30,830
So it's not quite as developed?

100
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:37,150
I don't think so. I've seen it done different ways. And you usually go with the best information you have.

101
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:48,590
So as we've talked about throughout these intro slides, here's another variability in body surface area.

102
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:56,420
So basically amount of skin per different types of individuals, male female children.

103
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:01,940
And you see, you know, you have that adult, adult male, we'll say on average,

104
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:11,300
obviously people come in all different shapes and sizes throughout very 18,000 square centimeters, whereas a 12 year old is 12,000.

105
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:21,379
Square slumbers. I have a 12 year old right now, and I can tell you, I weigh more than 50% of what she does.

106
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:25,250
So, you know, but again, children like we talk about the lungs.

107
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:31,850
Children have a higher surface area of her body, but as they inhale more air, her body weight as well.

108
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,440
So for dermal exposures, children may be more susceptible in that regard.

109
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:44,440
I mentioned this Exposure Factors handbook. So that last slide showed body weight.

110
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:52,300
If you're interested in specific parts of the body, this is more detailed tables.

111
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:58,270
Again, if you're interested in the mean median EPA percentile maximum, you can find that information.

112
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:08,230
So when might we want this information? Like population studies, population studies.

113
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:12,309
And based on what we think is going to be in contact.

114
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:20,380
Right. So, you know, in some instances, maybe it's only the hands in others that might be like because I did a project once on sunscreen,

115
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:27,790
so we had to make some assumptions on, you know, how much sunscreen are people using on what parts of the body, our skin we think they're covering.

116
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:33,370
So you get some interesting questions throughout this that you might have to think about.

117
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:42,290
And then they have estimates down here adherence to skin. So different activities.

118
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:46,940
How much just soil or dust? Do we think it's going to stick to the skin?

119
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:54,470
And if you said calculations as well, of course, you'd want to know what was in that soil or dust as well.

120
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:02,410
Okay. So we talked about all these factors from the agent getting from that source pathway to the skin.

121
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:07,360
What about once it's that set that that barrier? What kind of information is important?

122
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:14,200
You have chemical properties. So configuration through that chemical structure,

123
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:20,260
you talk about polarity and things like that will influence how well it can navigate

124
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:24,300
through the skin or whether it's going to be blocked the size of the mouth.

125
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:35,090
Remember, if it's a big, clunky molecule, it might be less mobile through the skin, but not always volatility and solubility as well.

126
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:40,750
And we'll go through each little bit more detail in the next slides. Skin factors.

127
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:45,910
So skin anatomy, skin condition and physiology, which we'll talk about here in a minute.

128
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:49,750
And then environmental factors. How much is there? How long?

129
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:55,680
Temperature and humidity always important for for what we do and then vehicle type.

130
00:13:55,690 --> 00:14:03,940
So, you know, if it's in a solvent, maybe that helps. It helps it through or if it's in more of a solid, maybe it's not as minimal.

131
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:09,160
So those are things that can impact as well. So some of those chemical factors.

132
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:18,070
So I mentioned polarity. So more polar substances tend to diffuse through those those protein based bricks,

133
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:24,730
while the non-porous substance will be more able to move through those lipid mortar structures.

134
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:34,040
And that rate of fusion inverse is proportional to solubility and inversely related to the amount of the weight.

135
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:42,200
So again, more soluble, lower molecular weight, smaller molecule are going to be more more mobile through their.

136
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:46,150
Walk away with the general rule of thumb.

137
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:54,580
But again, if it's above about 400 or more has less of an impact on that rate of absorption than the velocity does.

138
00:14:55,330 --> 00:15:00,040
And in general, though, the larger the molecule, the slower it.

139
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:08,950
So here's another drawing of the brick and mortar structure.

140
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:17,620
So here's our strap mechanism, that outer layer. And so something non-polar compound, they call it inter cellular.

141
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:23,570
So it's going to go between those cells in that lipid rich order as we refer to it.

142
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:28,030
So it's going around the lift, the proteins through that lipid, those are the non-polar.

143
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:34,900
You have a more polar compound. You can trans go trans cellular through those protein cells.

144
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:42,380
The third type is trans appendages. So we have sweat glands and hair follicles as well.

145
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,190
Right. That could be more of a direct line through the skin.

146
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:53,620
But we'll come back to that in a minute. Some more chemical factors, volatility.

147
00:15:53,620 --> 00:16:00,490
So if a chemical so volatile, it evaporates into the air before it has a chance to really penetrate the skin.

148
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,880
That's going to be reduced. It's its potential for.

149
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,200
Interval exposure and then finally solubility.

150
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:15,400
So optimal water coefficient is something that can be tested and in any chemical.

151
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:20,230
It's basically how much does it want to dissolve into water versus.

152
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:29,730
Oil. And that talks about, you know, it's like a facility versus it's it's hydrophobicity or hydrophobic.

153
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:33,840
So hydrogen phobic is water fearing, hydrophilic water loving.

154
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:39,630
Same for lipid lipophilic is lipid loving so.

155
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:52,730
Chemicals that are soluble have in that mid-range, where they're soluble in either water or small, might be the best transport.

156
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:58,899
Transparent through the skin and there's are some examples DMS.

157
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:09,910
So if they worked in a lab prior counter that kept it in, they might need to look into their delivery method for me.

158
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:16,750
Organophosphate pesticides. We mentioned earlier another one in that sort of range.

159
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:24,910
And then finally concentrate fat soluble vitamins have a higher rate of penetration than water soluble compounds.

160
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:29,290
So kind of a lot going on there and it's very chemical specific.

161
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:33,220
So again, these are just rules of thumb that you want to generally consider.

162
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:36,819
But, you know, when it comes down to it,

163
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:45,010
we usually look into tables or studies that have tested some of that stuff and hopefully also tested for skin penetration.

164
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:52,640
So we don't have to rely fully on. Okay.

165
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,720
Some skin factors so we can talk about through those cells, the either the pull or non-polar,

166
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:08,210
we might go through the different brick and mortar structures as well as the possibility for parents with follicles,

167
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:15,590
other skin characteristics, obviously the same area, different surface properties.

168
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:19,160
Skin condition. We'll talk about thickness in a minute.

169
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:26,969
Also, skin damage, of course, if you have cracked skin direct, raw, right in the wintertime.

170
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:32,620
But the humidity levels are so low like in my house and things that get really cracked skin.

171
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:40,580
That's the opportunity for something to have a free ride hydration level the skin temperature age.

172
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:48,590
Once you get past that certain point, you might have some metabolism within that viable portion of the skin in the dermis.

173
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:54,800
That might also influence how much it's getting to the bloodstream and in what form,

174
00:18:55,190 --> 00:19:00,050
whether it's the parent compound or some sort of metabolite which could influence its toxicity.

175
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:06,260
And that's one of the reasons why, again, out of exposure for a given dose might.

176
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:18,260
Very well. Given Temple's toxicity and based on how it's metabolized, you know, through liver or through the skin can make a big difference.

177
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:25,430
So I showed this before for the intracellular translator, for the polar non-polar and also the transit and the Jill.

178
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:32,780
But just know that typically this is considered a minor out because they're actually very spread out.

179
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:39,890
Actually, it's a very small percentage of that surface area of the skin, the hair follicles in the sweat glands.

180
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:46,220
So it is possible, but it's usually less factored in.

181
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:58,990
The other modes. Uh, variation in skin thickness, very wide variability depending on body parts.

182
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:03,460
So forearm, abdomen, back or in the teens range.

183
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:11,989
Forehead. Those of you that might have a scrotum very thin, that's just that's always listed on this.

184
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:16,950
So I have to address it. And then you see, like palm saw the foot in the hundreds.

185
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:22,410
So you see that range is 10 to 100 fold, depending on what we're talking about,

186
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:29,370
which can really obviously impact how well the chemical can carry it through there.

187
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:34,770
So here's an example. So pharmaceuticals, if you apply to the skin, you can get some good data.

188
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:42,630
Here's one example from hydrocortisone. There's a little screw again jaw angle, even though xolo means.

189
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:53,500
Yep. So again, for personal care products, you're doing something like that or or some other version.

190
00:20:54,710 --> 00:21:05,170
It's thinner skin and may be more open to getting through when you have your palm on the hand and.

191
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,480
So the feet are very thick. It's.

192
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:23,989
So a big difference. So here is for a chemical or, you know, phosphate pesticide we're talking about, here's two different ones.

193
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:29,900
One pesticide called paraffin. And I'm related from the same family, but a different chemical compound, a fine art.

194
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:39,530
And they can see the different percent absorb on different parts of the body and you see less than 10% on the forearm.

195
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:43,490
And you get up to a lot, you get to the scalp.

196
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:51,740
Scalp is very thin in the armpit and Dawson means back to the hand, much thinner than the tall man.

197
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:55,520
So again, just just to illustrate the variability. Yeah.

198
00:21:55,850 --> 00:22:02,180
Sitting here I see why is so the rest of it looks like it decreases from the first one to the second one, but it will increase.

199
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:10,760
So good. A great question. So this could be a number of things because this looks to be empirical data,

200
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:16,520
could be just random testing variation, something with whatever their model was.

201
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,830
Same with why this could be a more than 100, you know, otherwise.

202
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:29,450
And unless there's something about that particular part of the skin that has a different structure, that one would be more akin to it than the other.

203
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:36,170
I would I would probably chalk this up to just variability if I had to guess, but it's a really good observation.

204
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:43,430
I don't know enough about the skin to go down.

205
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:49,310
What's the fossil record is the kind of the triangle?

206
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:54,530
What is that, somebody googling? That's not a good question.

207
00:22:54,650 --> 00:23:04,680
I'm glad you guys are paying attention reading the slides. I like it. 28%.

208
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:12,500
So it's similar to the back of the hand, the elbows, although it's like a triangle part of the.

209
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:18,270
Okay, it's now it's cool.

210
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:23,640
All right. Some environmental factors for thermal wind.

211
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:30,340
Temperature, humidity that's going to impact the vaporization or evaporation of the chemical.

212
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:45,250
Again, to either could reduce its potential increase in temperature, can open up the skin of things and increase humidity, well-hydrated skin.

213
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:56,520
But again, that's going to be limited by what you have cracking. And the type of chemical with that solubility and polarity has and harsher vehicles.

214
00:23:56,540 --> 00:24:00,400
We talk about things like solvents and other chemicals that really can.

215
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:05,989
Change. The skin structure might help usher in some of those chemicals.

216
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:10,670
You're concerned. Okay.

217
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:16,549
So measures of permanent permeability and this is where it's kind of the Wild West in my experience,

218
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:20,870
when you go to try to model or estimate exposures,

219
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:26,240
you have to go to the literature to try to find bioavailability or how much permeation you get through the skin.

220
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:34,220
And that's where you see you'll find, you know, all kinds of weird studies in rabbits and other things that they might report to you a flux.

221
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:38,690
So this is the amount of chemical absorbed across a defined surface area over unit time.

222
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:45,890
So that's that's great. If they report that they might also instead report a permeability coefficient,

223
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:51,950
you then have to, you know, interpret in a way based on the units that are given.

224
00:24:53,090 --> 00:25:00,170
So that's that's a rate as well. And again, it might vary based on the medium performance in what part of the skin,

225
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:06,590
what kind of model they used to test it again, was it an animal, was it synthetic human skin?

226
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:12,199
You know, there's all kinds of weird stuff out there. You start trying to find this, but there are some calculators out there.

227
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:20,120
Here's a link to an example through the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, and that can try to help you out.

228
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:30,270
You can also do. Another one I've seen is just pure percentages like they showed on the pesticide slide north of person.

229
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,799
So trying to navigate this, hopefully you'll be able for the chemical of interest,

230
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:40,140
you will find some of these use multiple approaches and see how will that compare.

231
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:49,510
You can also do some measurements, quantum monitoring that we'll talk more about later in the semester.

232
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:54,200
But some examples are just. Sampling the skin.

233
00:25:54,650 --> 00:26:02,059
So circuits skin techniques. That's a weird word for just basically like putting a patch on the skin and seeing what what it attaches to it,

234
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:07,700
then analyzing it later using a wipe or something to wipe the skin and then analyze that.

235
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:13,220
Or there are direct reading methods. There's indirect methods.

236
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:17,210
That's kind of like what we've been talking about using some of these exposure factors,

237
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:23,149
chemical properties to to model or calculate and then finally do some biological

238
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:28,390
monitoring that is supposed to give you more of a absorbed dose of the.

239
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:34,060
Interesting. And we'll talk about that later as well. So that's turmoil.

240
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:40,460
Like I said, it's complex, but if you break it up into different factors that are important.

241
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:48,590
That's half the battle. And then once you get there, trying to really narrow in on the specifics of each of those factors,

242
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:52,040
that's where it gets really difficult because a lot of times they're not available.

243
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:59,060
But just knowing is is is good. So this is challenging for several reasons.

244
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,979
As we talk about a lot of regulations are based on air and inhalation.

245
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:06,590
So there's not a lot of dermal based regulation.

246
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:16,040
So with that comes not a lot of systematic testing and agreement with how things should be done and nothing to compare to.

247
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:24,650
When you do take a measurement and then the methods and procedures you look in literature,

248
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:29,840
people will tend to do it the best they can for their particular application.

249
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:35,330
Again, if you're not comparing to a standard, then you might see your interest of what you're trying to measure.

250
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:40,770
Might be way different than what somebody else is trying to measure. So it's it's all over the place.

251
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:48,200
So it's different than inhalation for one of those reasons and does have

252
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:52,260
typically a lot more variability for similar reasons we've been talking about.

253
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:59,000
So it's very important, but also very complex.

254
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:05,600
Okay. Don't confuse even more. Any questions on dermal observations?

255
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:12,870
But you can see I mean, you can think about things that come in contact with the skin and some of these but really make sense.

256
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:17,570
Right? Just drilling down into the very nitty gritty, it's all kind of.

257
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:32,140
All right. There's Lily. She's older than this now. But again, just an illustrative of how you can have ingested exposure if it's not intended.

258
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:34,460
Ingestion of the food that you choose to eat.

259
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:45,590
So when she was a toddler, you know, like most toddlers, exploring the world very, you know, period, doing so, all kinds of stuff,

260
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:53,740
being touched and put in the mouth and things like that, like different environments and,

261
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:58,729
you know, food touching the surface then being ingested plastics, dishwasher.

262
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:05,420
So things coming out of the dishwasher. The hopelessness cigaret that wouldn't make sense.

263
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:11,020
I mean, my guess drive to a sippy cup or something and stuff.

264
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:17,210
But all right. So this is back to our pathways.

265
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:23,600
We had a couple of different examples. This is back to that original example of pathways with that chemical disposal site we use for inhalation.

266
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:31,220
But you can use some of the same pathways that think how something might be ingested by a human target as well.

267
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:37,879
So it might end up in the food that you're eating or could stem from contact with contaminated

268
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:43,340
surfaces that then you have in mouth contact or direct ingestion of contaminated water.

269
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:48,560
So there are three ways that pathway to just an exposure.

270
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:54,290
So this one luckily is going to be more straightforward than our dermal.

271
00:29:55,220 --> 00:30:01,130
So direct ingestion is, you know, by volume usually the the most important.

272
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:07,160
And, you know, we usually think of it for more biological agents rather than chemical.

273
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:15,920
You know, food safety is a big deal. And but, you know, chemical payments are also a concern.

274
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:19,930
And when you get into things like metals, a lot of them are essential.

275
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:25,370
So we use the same some of these same techniques to look at positive exposures as well.

276
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:33,620
Same with water, you know, biological hazards, huge concern historically.

277
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:44,209
But, you know, chemicals are in the past 100 years have gotten a lot more attention likely on food, soil, dust, other non-nutritive substances.

278
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:51,680
And then that just contact with with surfaces can find a way into ingestion.

279
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:57,639
And then going back to the original role, we talk about inhalation.

280
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:07,210
Those large particles, the deposited in upper airway airways can be cleared through a small wing mechanism that is similar to ingestion.

281
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:13,010
So here's our estimated absorbed dose.

282
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:17,099
We have the volume ingested simply times.

283
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:23,190
That concentration will give you the amount of exposure and then some bioavailability

284
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:29,600
of what's being what's being absorbed from that is your estimates of dose.

285
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:34,530
So it's a lot more straightforward, right? That's good.

286
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:45,720
Some pathways and occupational to think about. Just mentioned the large particulate that could ultimately be swallowed through its mechanisms.

287
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:52,580
You know, just general. Housekeeping issues.

288
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:56,840
So you're working and then take lunch break. If you want to wash your hands.

289
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:01,390
I mentioned cigaret smoking and other hand and mouth activity.

290
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:08,080
And again, this is of great concern with us agents of high toxicity.

291
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:12,310
So when you see we'll talk about artificial standards later, but for example,

292
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:18,170
that standard, they try to address all these other groups of exposure that could be,

293
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:27,530
you know, historically may have been really overlooked, simply, you know, wash your hands before you eat, drink during the shift if you're exposed.

294
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:40,380
Occupational water, food, breastfeeding, soil and dust through either intentional or unintentional modes.

295
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:46,280
You may heard of pica. It's an interesting. Either, you know,

296
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:50,690
a lot of young toddlers will literally eat dirt just because it's part of their

297
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:58,730
exploration and also might be used in certain cultures and religious practices.

298
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:05,420
House dust is another big one that historically have been overlooked, but we're now coming to terms with it.

299
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:09,560
It's important for certain types of chemicals like flame retardants.

300
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:16,240
For one, it's very important. Exposure Factors handbook again.

301
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:21,670
So this is an important reference for all these relative exposure.

302
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:24,700
So on this table we're talking about drinking water.

303
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:33,640
So this is where you might get you might observe how much water a person drinks or you might estimate it from a table like this and then.

304
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:38,879
An estimate of how much concentration is in that water. And there you have your exposure.

305
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,540
And then depending on the agent and you have a bioavailability factor that you can.

306
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:47,900
Multiply it now. So again, we have a huge range. You see a theme here.

307
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:52,520
Small children have higher intake for body weight, as with the other roads.

308
00:33:54,800 --> 00:34:01,080
And you can there's all kinds of tables for different. Aspects of this distribution.

309
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:12,210
So about bioavailability on ingestion. So kind of like the skin, if you think about that GI tract internally as your barrier.

310
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:20,940
So once you ingested, that's not actually your dose. It has to for most agents cross that barrier for it to be considered internal built into it.

311
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:26,940
So it's going to be thicker than the lungs but much thinner than the skin.

312
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:30,810
So that bioavailable is going to be in between.

313
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:37,530
They're so much higher than their dermal. But what's the inhalation for something that makes it over to the lungs?

314
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:44,460
So it's not usually one or two layers. So layers thick and can vary by location.

315
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:52,470
And there's a reason it's highly permeable and that's for nutrients to get through.

316
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:56,330
But with that can come. Toxic agents as well.

317
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:04,040
So we've done some and others have done some interesting work on, say like lead and cadmium.

318
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:14,180
People who are iron deficient tend to take in more Lebanon because the the body is trying to get that essential mineral.

319
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,639
And with some of these toxic metals,

320
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:23,990
can use some to take advantage of those same pathways in the body trying to get taken more of that essential nutrient to result in more.

321
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:29,350
Toxic metal. So that kind of goes both ways.

322
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:33,110
It's good for them. The good, but bad for the toxic stuff.

323
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:40,160
Different transport mechanisms here. Passive transport with simple diffusion or facilitated diffusion.

324
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:48,300
It's a getting little detail. I don't need to spend much time on this, but that simple diffusion.

325
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:56,160
You know, this is a principle we use for various applications throughout this class where it's based on a concentration gradient from high to low.

326
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,470
And we've mentioned that before for other things.

327
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:09,600
And those detail mechanisms can vary and probe beyond the scope of this course for now, facilitated diffusion for inorganic contaminants.

328
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:17,130
So again, metals, other minerals and stuff like that go through there.

329
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:22,960
Then you have active transport. Engulfing and taking a.

330
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:33,020
Once again, it's going to hammer this home. The children expected to be at greatest risk.

331
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:43,400
So we talked about they have, you know, they just water and just inhale more air, have more skin.

332
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:52,190
They also are rapidly developing organs. So for a given mass of toxicant, it might be more to.

333
00:36:54,750 --> 00:37:00,660
Systems that are rapidly developing. They have frequent melting of obsidian objects in their hands.

334
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:06,240
In addition to kind of touching off everything, maybe crawling on the floor, carpet thing,

335
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,840
all kinds of stuff on their hands, and then a lot of more hand-to-mouth contact.

336
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:20,820
Hand to mouth contact. They also have that a tip on that in the exposure factors handbook for different ages, different surfaces.

337
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:25,410
We mentioned pica and soil ingestion,

338
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:35,730
just another sort of huge exposure potential for young children that it can be difficult to really estimate in context with all the other routes.

339
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:48,200
And now in amount frequency you see by age is a huge varied variation and where they are either indoors or outdoors,

340
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:57,370
whether it's hand to mouth or objects now pacifiers and things are probably included in there and then swill and dust ingestion.

341
00:37:57,410 --> 00:38:04,730
So, you know, inadvertent as well as as the on purpose huge range there.

342
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:08,450
So again, you can get some estimates here for for some population wide.

343
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:13,730
Calculations. Yeah. The previous slide.

344
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:19,610
It says frequent wrapping objects in hands greater than 80% in those less than one year with less.

345
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:41,360
It's been a while since I've been a slave. Either it meant something in the papers that have children are less than one year old.

346
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:49,170
I think it. 80%, I would guess, 80% more.

347
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:59,120
There's more in the mail. If you were to compare. This.

348
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:10,840
These two, these 80% more. So I would assume it's just going to be 100% of kids under one that are able to do it.

349
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:14,520
It's just much more frequent.

350
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:20,930
For the younger ages. Yeah. That's okay. Thank you for the question.

351
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:27,820
Cost overruns are the answer. Usually there's an answer for you if you stop and focus a little bit.

352
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:35,780
Okay. So review of our three ones that we covered, inhalation, dermal and ingestion.

353
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:42,259
So for inhalation we want to know the target organ mechanisms of toxicity and the physical properties of

354
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:52,280
the chemical form as well as more detailed properties that absorb dose as a function of concentration,

355
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:58,430
time for aerosols, particle size, inhalation rate and bioavailability.

356
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:08,270
And those effects could be at the one thing silica, asbestos or systemic size, but that's inhalation.

357
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:15,260
And we'll talk about that. You know, this will come into play again a lot when we talk about sampling strategies as well.

358
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:24,170
Assessing dermal exposure requires knowledge of exposures, scenario and the chemical agent properties as well as we talk about skin properties.

359
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:29,510
Function of concentration, time, surface area and bioavailability.

360
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:36,450
And again, the effects may be local or systemic and then ingestion.

361
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:45,620
We want to know amount of the medium and justice to amount of food, volume of water, etc. the agent concentration in that medium and bioavailability.

362
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:53,960
So it's more straightforward. So usually where a lot of times we're thinking about multiple routes of exposure.

363
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:56,990
So if we're concerned about particular scenario,

364
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:05,450
we might need to combine multiples of these to try to get an overall picture of exposure and potential risk.

365
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:10,220
Especially when those systemic effects are most concern.

366
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:18,660
So here are some examples down here of, you know, gases and vapors could be inhaled, but you might have good thermal penetration as well.

367
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:22,530
Particles can be ingested, inhaled or absorbed.

368
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:34,379
And something you get on your hands could be absorbed directly in the mouth contact or we talked about agents might evaporate off skin.

369
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:39,240
You could then also have inflation. So there's a lot of interplay potential.

370
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:47,810
All right. So that's that. Any questions on that before we move to the beginning of this discussion?

371
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:53,950
You guys love this late afternoon class dining room with no windows.

372
00:41:55,570 --> 00:42:00,730
I apologize. I did not pick the room or the time, but I appreciate your.

373
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:10,219
Attention. Okay.

374
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:13,790
So I guess we're going to start this one off and then finish it on Thursday.

375
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,660
And again, please stop me if if I'm.

376
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:25,960
Not making sense. Well, if there's something. So 31.

377
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:33,940
Okay. So here we're going to define the goals of risk assessment for components of risk assessment.

378
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:40,570
Understand the role of exposure, toxicology, epidemic, epidemiology and risk.

379
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:47,930
And talk about risk assessment versus risk management goals and competencies.

380
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:54,070
So risk is the probability of injury, disease or death from exposure to a hazard.

381
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:58,959
So that's going be a different definition than if we were over at the Ross School of Business.

382
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:05,140
Right. They talk about risk a lot, but it's usually in different terms than what we're talking about here.

383
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:15,580
In our scenario context, we're talking about a function of exposure to potential receptor characteristics.

384
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:24,640
So receptor in our cases usually people, but as we talked about, it could be other, other things as well could be a population.

385
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:30,550
Usually it works best at the population level. Once you get to the individual level, it gets gets very tricky.

386
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:35,970
That's what, you know, litigation usually gets into.

387
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:41,550
Likelihood of occurrence of exposure and health effects. So that's what you're dealing with.

388
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:49,920
So the risk assessment is then defined as in our field, the scientific approach for evaluating potential harm from environmental hazards.

389
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:57,510
So we want to find out how harmful is it. In the in the grand scheme of things, how important of a priority should this be?

390
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:09,610
Which ones are periods concerned, how they compare. So we can prioritize and and do things most efficiently because resources are always limited.

391
00:44:10,990 --> 00:44:17,680
The National Academies, way back in 1983, this law, the principles from this really old book are still used.

392
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:25,480
So it's called the Red Book. They have a newer one that's a different color, but it just kind of adds to this one.

393
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:29,470
And they're both while these principles are still in effect.

394
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:37,780
So in the U.S. so I should clarify, we're talking about the United States and we don't have time right now.

395
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:44,109
We'll get on this throughout the semester. But, you know, it's all messed up in the grand scheme of things compared to some other countries.

396
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:51,010
How we do this but in general use risk assessment framework has four, four parts to it.

397
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:58,480
Up there we have the first one is hazard identification. So what health problems are caused by food?

398
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:05,980
The next two are exposure assessment. So that's highly relevant to what we've just been talking about.

399
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:10,940
So how much of this is for airborne pollutants this particular cycle?

400
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:15,730
But how much are people exposed to. Dose response assessment.

401
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:20,440
So what is the expected health check for a given dose of the chemical agent?

402
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:24,250
And then finally, the fourth is mischaracterization.

403
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:32,409
So for a given increase in exposure, what is the expected increase in disease or the other way around?

404
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:41,020
If we were to do this intervention, if we reduce exposure by X amount, how much reduction in disease or death can we expect to see?

405
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:46,090
So those are the four main steps and we'll go through those.

406
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:56,040
Who regulates risk in the US. So when we think about environment, of course a lot of it is the EPA.

407
00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:00,900
Professor Davos talked about this in more depth on Tuesday.

408
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:08,310
We also have for certain things, foods and drugs, as you might expect, given the name the FDA,

409
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:15,720
OSHA for occupational exposures and for consumer products and various aspects.

410
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:26,520
You might have the CPSC, you might have some local involvement, state or local governments, NGOs, very important to this process.

411
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:33,040
These two, these other ones a lot. And that's sometimes what it takes, I should say.

412
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:37,000
A lot of times what it takes to get movement on things.

413
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:43,990
Know the Department of the Interior and the Health and Human Services or others that might be involved, depending on the.

414
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:55,380
Risk or agent of interest. So risk assessment because there's a lot involved.

415
00:46:57,390 --> 00:47:00,520
It can lead to a lot of disagreements, a lot of controversy.

416
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:06,120
So here's this for another guy. This will have seeds for things, right?

417
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:10,260
But if you look at it from this way, there's only three. It's kind of an optical illusion.

418
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:14,940
But that is sort of how risk assessment goes sometimes because, you know,

419
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:20,790
we talked about just earlier today the different all those different factors where you're making

420
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:24,989
assumptions or taking data from one thing and applying it to another and then trying to interpret that,

421
00:47:24,990 --> 00:47:32,250
synthesize and interpret it. That's a long process from A to B that things can differ depending on which way you're coming from.

422
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:36,930
So, you know, you have somebody from an environmental NGO,

423
00:47:37,650 --> 00:47:43,680
they're going to maybe you want to take the most protective assumptions or estimates for each of those steps,

424
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:50,220
whereas somebody who, you know, is producing or or benefiting from that chemical might take the other approach.

425
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:54,810
So so you do see this quite a bit, just as a heads up.

426
00:47:57,070 --> 00:48:03,399
Historically, we're pretty good assessing obvious risks like things that are clearly not good for us,

427
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:08,590
you know, fire, volcanos, poisonous snakes, venomous spiders,

428
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:09,520
you know, you see it,

429
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:18,610
you either from experience or what you've seen or heard from others know that it could harm you and you take steps to protect yourself.

430
00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:22,600
Right? So that's one thing when it's obvious,

431
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:31,350
but when it's more subtle things in our current that we encounter in our contemporary lives, it gets a little more sketchy.

432
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:35,350
So this one is kind of a fun exercise.

433
00:48:36,130 --> 00:48:40,510
We can talk about the details, but let's take a few minutes to think about this.

434
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:46,030
So rank in terms of decreasing the risk, all these different things.

435
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:52,330
So flying 1200 miles, eating a thousand bananas, 12 months in Denver, 4 hours by canoe,

436
00:48:53,590 --> 00:48:59,870
20 miles from a nuclear plant, 600 miles by train and eight tablespoons of paper.

437
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:08,170
So take a few minutes. Talk to the people next to you and so you can cover the ranking with the last year.

438
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:13,060
Yeah, try to we probably try to look at it as well.

439
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:23,040
As you mentioned, and I love my time traveling across the country, a lot of people have a lot of different yeah,

440
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:31,390
I definitely want to be better than I was one day because I was trying to go to.

441
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:36,800
Yeah, but it's like, it's like a two hour flight.

442
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:45,230
I guess it comes over here. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

443
00:49:45,370 --> 00:49:47,550
That's true. Yeah. Yeah.

444
00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:59,760
For this time of year and maybe, maybe like this, like, I guess under the radar screen, I read a book called Passive Aggressive.

445
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:20,610
Or maybe if you find out later, I was very lucky because I John Kerry or you because I you have a lot of people,

446
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:36,910
something like that where are saying, well, you know, I was on streets pretty much yeah, you know, a little better.

447
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:44,140
But I was in the middle of the alphabet.

448
00:50:44,680 --> 00:51:12,380
Yeah. Yeah. So I have to do yeah. I think with bananas and Christopher's insides from yesterday and stuff like that that fall.

449
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:16,660
But that's a girl that I got into earlier.

450
00:51:18,850 --> 00:51:29,080
I just want you to understand, how did you learn from something like that?

451
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:32,470
I appreciate that.

452
00:51:34,270 --> 00:51:48,460
I mean, you know, like I really like if you're ready for it.

453
00:51:49,630 --> 00:52:04,920
And I'm actually curious to think you guys are not allowed to have banana sketches and they have a voter out here here in New York.

454
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:08,860
Do you want to respond?

455
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:14,030
Let's do one more minute. One more minute. I don't have materials.

456
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:19,900
You know, this is going to go and I'm right.

457
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:23,380
Thank you. It's the highest you've heard.

458
00:52:25,030 --> 00:52:33,700
Very clever. Well, you know, that's why I like that one.

459
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:41,049
Yeah, but there's like. No, absolutely nothing that I could get.

460
00:52:41,050 --> 00:52:44,540
But they want to hear you. Yeah. Isn't that what you can do it and.

461
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:54,470
Oh, the radiation. Yeah, I don't know. And then the 5000 to 79.

462
00:52:55,250 --> 00:53:10,170
That's pretty high, which is, you know, almost a moderate. But once again, this is not the time to do this.

463
00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:17,600
All right. And it's really a big change because I travel a lot.

464
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:26,000
So I guess, yeah, that's why we haven't got that inflation bill that was passed in the tax year.

465
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,770
Even when they got Hitler downsizing. Carter is a jury.

466
00:53:31,970 --> 00:53:36,290
And that was the whole idea that. All right, let's regroup here.

467
00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:39,880
What happened to your cool tyrant? Dangerous? Oh, yes.

468
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:44,180
We've been helpful here. I've taken care of it.

469
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:48,080
All right, so what are we thinking here? This is going on all over the place, right?

470
00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:52,640
Random. Who's who? What do you think is the most risky here?

471
00:53:53,810 --> 00:53:56,990
For me panning the canoe. And for what reason?

472
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:03,380
It's very easy to fall out of control. Yeah. Okay.

473
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:07,580
Any other thoughts on the number where people feel better?

474
00:54:07,790 --> 00:54:15,190
For what reason? I just advertising for toxins, as I recall.

475
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:23,150
Some of them have a recall. Yeah. And any others in the letter, like within a time frame?

476
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:32,060
It doesn't really say that would be helpful if you either at one time or a different thing over the course of a year.

477
00:54:32,430 --> 00:54:36,350
Right. All right.

478
00:54:36,350 --> 00:54:40,820
So let's see. What did they say? High risk number one accident.

479
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:47,150
So, yeah, drowning, etc. Somebody will are going to be more dangerous than others, obviously.

480
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:50,600
And with any of these, there's going to be some a lot of assumptions.

481
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:55,830
Right. That illustrates part of why this is a risk assessment and it is tricky.

482
00:54:56,710 --> 00:55:00,430
Number two, 12 months in Denver. So that's a surprising one right there.

483
00:55:01,930 --> 00:55:05,440
So anybody here from Colorado, they'll be left in Colorado.

484
00:55:05,830 --> 00:55:09,910
Okay. Yeah. The cosmic creation from elevation.

485
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:17,300
Number three, favorite peanut butter.

486
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:24,589
So aflatoxin and this is, you know, I'm guessing the calculation involved in this, this is somebody else's exercise.

487
00:55:24,590 --> 00:55:31,640
I'm guessing, you know, a probability of, you know, what you said recalls when they detect aflatoxin,

488
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:39,680
aflatoxin, you know, the probability of that through 80 tablespoons, it's probably low, hopefully.

489
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:43,010
But these other ones are lower.

490
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:53,030
Number 4000 bananas. They have potassium, very low levels of radioactive potassium.

491
00:55:53,150 --> 00:55:57,040
Those. I read about.

492
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:08,570
Three weeks. Number five, flying 12 miles again, the cosmic radiation.

493
00:56:10,010 --> 00:56:18,110
So, you know, that might look different for flight attendants and pilots, right, who are flying thousands and thousands of miles per day.

494
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:24,470
Next is by train and train accident. Very rare, but it does happen.

495
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:32,660
And then the last one, which, you know, there are certain groups of people that might think they see the word nuclear.

496
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:35,780
They think of all the nuclear accidents in the past.

497
00:56:36,110 --> 00:56:40,159
They would think that would be the most risky. But because it's it is a rare occurrence.

498
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:44,570
And they do have a lot of. Safety checks in the system.

499
00:56:44,810 --> 00:56:49,450
That is the last of us. So thanks for putting up with it, obviously.

500
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:54,800
One could probably argue any of the is based on, you know, what's being considered and things like that.

501
00:56:55,640 --> 00:57:04,760
But, you know, point 100 miles in a ultralight, you know, one of those little ones that they crash all the time, they'd be way, way higher.

502
00:57:04,790 --> 00:57:09,810
It doesn't specify what type of aircraft. So, you know, you could argue anyway.

503
00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:15,050
So there's a lot of stuff like this out there. Here's one from quite a while ago that was in The New York Times.

504
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:23,150
Again, this is very U.S. focused, but it's talking about, you know, people thinking about risks of summer.

505
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:32,360
A lot of people scared of sharks. But, you know, it's actually a way less risk than irradiation, for example.

506
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:40,750
From the side, I see us centric because mosquitoes here, they see less risk globally.

507
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:44,790
Mosquitoes are going to be much higher risk in context here.

508
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:49,090
But U.S. mostly out here, drawing snake bites, amusement parks.

509
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:53,440
Fireworks. Wind disease falling out of windows.

510
00:57:54,670 --> 00:57:59,319
Heat exposure. Lawnmower accidents. Bike accidents.

511
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:05,380
Hot dogs, food poisoning. So well, Dr. Juliet.

512
00:58:05,410 --> 00:58:08,530
Yeah, right, right. If you do, you know.

513
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:12,380
What is it? Five years off? 6 minutes. 36 minutes.

514
00:58:12,610 --> 00:58:16,870
As long as you watch three. Martha July hot dog eating contest.

515
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:21,490
Yeah. So it's just not. It just took, like, a year off, just, like, every year.

516
00:58:21,910 --> 00:58:25,630
I'm so gross. I can't.

517
00:58:25,990 --> 00:58:30,350
I can't look away. It's fascinating. I mean, he is like an athlete.

518
00:58:30,350 --> 00:58:33,520
Athlete. You do that. It's a sport, some say.

519
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:39,610
Anyway, so you can find these these types of graphics out there trying to put it into perspective.

520
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:44,350
So for our back to our our model.

521
00:58:44,350 --> 00:58:48,670
So for has hazard identification and dose response assessment, where do we get that information?

522
00:58:49,690 --> 00:58:57,489
Usually we get it from toxicology, historically toxicology, but in growing part epidemiology.

523
00:58:57,490 --> 00:59:02,260
So I think most of you are in toxicology now or we'll be taking toxicology.

524
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:06,850
So we're going to do just a quick primer as it relates to risk and then also a

525
00:59:06,850 --> 00:59:11,739
quick primer on epidemiology just in the context of what we're talking about here.

526
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:15,730
So we might go relatively quickly here.

527
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:20,130
So how are agents assessed for toxicity?

528
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:30,210
You have a lot of different ways, so the fastest and cheapest way to do it is through modeling prediction based on things like chemical structure.

529
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:33,330
So quantitate, structure, activity, relationships, for example,

530
00:59:33,690 --> 00:59:41,220
just based on what that chemical looks like, can we predict how toxic it's going to be on the next level?

531
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:50,990
You know, you're starting to get more involved here. You're in a lab, but you're using in vitro or in test tube type of experiments on cell lines or

532
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:58,260
pieces of tissue to look at how it responds to a dose of a chemical agent.

533
00:59:58,730 --> 01:00:01,800
And then at the bottom here, we're getting what they call in vivo.

534
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:06,179
So within a learning or a whole animal experiments, this is going to be, you know,

535
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:10,020
probably a lot better information because you're getting more physiology involved,

536
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:19,230
just different systems, compensatory mechanisms, etc., but much more time consuming, much more expensive.

537
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:22,830
And then you you know, it's becoming less ethical, right?

538
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:29,130
You're you're exposing a lot of living things to chemicals to see what happens.

539
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:39,900
So again, putting this into a framework that first but the cheap fast way to do it is called tier one.

540
01:00:40,530 --> 01:00:48,180
Tier two is your tier two screenings here, in vitro cell line or tissue type of assays, experiments.

541
01:00:48,540 --> 01:00:52,769
And then tier three is that animal testing that can look at all these different things.

542
01:00:52,770 --> 01:01:02,100
So, you know, you have things that go into those inputs, use of that chemical physical properties.

543
01:01:03,810 --> 01:01:07,110
Different points from the literature to try to model that toxicity.

544
01:01:07,350 --> 01:01:11,790
Here you have specific reactions you can have that usually actually have stress.

545
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:16,860
Things that might find your particular receptor. You can do that.

546
01:01:17,310 --> 01:01:24,600
So on the tissue. And then for animal testing, you have more disease processes you can look at.

547
01:01:30,130 --> 01:01:33,190
So we talked about how to ID dose response.

548
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:42,460
So as the dose increases, as we supply long term peristalsis, the harmful effects generally increase.

549
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:52,320
And in toxicology, a lot of times what they're interested in is finding that threshold of when a chemical or exposure is not harmful,

550
01:01:52,330 --> 01:01:56,830
you don't see a response. And then at some point it sort of goes level and you start to see a response.

551
01:01:56,830 --> 01:02:06,790
And that's referred to us as the threshold, and we use that information and risk assessment to come up with how toxic chemical is.

552
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:13,060
So they use some of these points from these experiments, then extrapolate to what is an acceptable level of exposure.

553
01:02:13,930 --> 01:02:18,970
But we have to keep in mind acute versus chronic exposures as well as those effects.

554
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:27,900
Latency period is the amount of time between exposure and onset of the adverse health effects of disease.

555
01:02:28,710 --> 01:02:33,270
So here's just a figure. I don't know why some of these lines got a little bit disjointed.

556
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:40,010
I think I have two pieces, I guess on the two different pages of a textbook.

557
01:02:40,170 --> 01:02:43,670
I try to piece them together and then go anyway.

558
01:02:44,180 --> 01:02:51,230
So a so the top one here, you have a single exposure event, like an acute exposure, and then what happens?

559
01:02:51,620 --> 01:02:54,460
The bottom one, you have a longer term exposure from the top.

560
01:02:54,470 --> 01:03:00,440
When you have a single exposure event, A is what they call a an acute self-limited effect.

561
01:03:00,830 --> 01:03:07,129
So that curve goes up and then back down. B is an acute and persistent effect.

562
01:03:07,130 --> 01:03:12,080
So it goes in response to that exposure. It goes up and it stays up the dotted line there.

563
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:17,690
And a C is a long delayed effect. It began long after that acute exposure.

564
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:22,880
So that's a latent effect that occurs later on, but resulting from.

565
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:31,490
Much previous exposure. So that's three possibilities from an acute single time exposure or repeated more chronic

566
01:03:31,490 --> 01:03:36,440
exposure you have D is a chronic condition arising shortly after onset of exposure.

567
01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:42,170
So that might be based on some sort of individual susceptibility factor.

568
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:47,360
If you've got allergic responses, things like that.

569
01:03:47,570 --> 01:03:55,879
Hypersensitivity can be a chronic condition for getting long after a period of chronic exposure.

570
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:59,090
So you have this, say, a career working at a job or exposure,

571
01:03:59,090 --> 01:04:03,890
and then you finally see an effect that might be like some of these lung disease that we've been talking about.

572
01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:07,490
Fibrotic lung diseases are related to things like asbestos.

573
01:04:08,150 --> 01:04:14,270
And then F is you're exposed for a long period time. You don't see anything. But does that mean nothing's happening?

574
01:04:14,420 --> 01:04:21,290
Not necessarily. There could be. Adverse processes going on there just aren't evident depending on what the scenario might be.

575
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:28,640
So those are some examples of things that might happen for acute or chronic exposures.

576
01:04:29,420 --> 01:04:35,510
So back to the threshold. So this is defined as the lowest dose of a chemical at which a toxic substance causes a response.

577
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:39,590
And hopefully you're getting that response in a more susceptible individual.

578
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:47,520
So if it's somebody with underlying. You know, one condition for children like we've been talking about.

579
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:54,900
Do you want to come forward? But whether that's done in practice is sometimes up in the air.

580
01:04:55,470 --> 01:05:02,340
So there's two concepts here with these acronyms. One is an O, L and the other is l, o l.

581
01:05:02,790 --> 01:05:05,910
So no, no observed adverse effect, though.

582
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:10,910
In oh eight, it is lowest sort of adverse effect.

583
01:05:11,170 --> 01:05:19,210
So that's based on this particular experiment. They have these dose levels and that term, they're not seeing a significant response.

584
01:05:20,820 --> 01:05:25,440
But they are 20. So on this particular, it's not quite, but we'll call it.

585
01:05:26,610 --> 01:05:29,790
So for this particular experiment, if this was being used in risk assessment,

586
01:05:30,810 --> 01:05:37,650
they might define ten as your inner wheel and 20 is the lowest observable.

587
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:41,220
And then, depending on the rules for that particular process,

588
01:05:41,730 --> 01:05:46,890
sometimes the rules change depending on what type of chemical it is or what government agency is doing it.

589
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:53,730
One of those might be used in further calculations to come up with what might be seen as an acceptable exposure.

590
01:05:55,980 --> 01:06:00,240
So those are two important terms to understand there.

591
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:09,740
All right. So this is another example, looking at different thresholds, talking through this.

592
01:06:09,740 --> 01:06:18,710
So dose response curve for three hypothetical things here A and B are typical.

593
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:23,990
So they call them sigmoid curves. Where they go, there's there's they're parallel with the x axis.

594
01:06:24,470 --> 01:06:28,520
Then all of a sudden you see a response and then that response kind of maxes out and levels up.

595
01:06:29,270 --> 01:06:35,990
That's what they've seen time and again with various chemicals at various doses for a particular response.

596
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:44,299
So that's what you see with and this is what they use for non carcinogens so they and risk

597
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:48,640
assessment they treat cancer endpoints much differently than the trick on cancer reports.

598
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:56,720
So for non cancer they're usually looking for the sigmoid curve and they'll come up with that and we know observed

599
01:06:56,750 --> 01:07:04,340
adverse effect level or the lowest observed etc. they might also pick out the median or the 50th percentile.

600
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:11,870
So what that means is at what dose do 50% of the experimental animals die?

601
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:18,800
So if it's a healthy 50/50, lethal dose, 50, but there's other end points you might be looking for in that.

602
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:24,020
So when a lot of times gets ignored and I don't want to confuse you guys too much,

603
01:07:24,020 --> 01:07:28,040
but is that with all these experiments, there's statistical considerations, right?

604
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:32,390
That don't really talk about but we don't have to worry about that now because nobody's talking about it.

605
01:07:32,660 --> 01:07:40,549
So, like, you know, even with this, they say no observed effect, but there might be something.

606
01:07:40,550 --> 01:07:46,040
It's just depending on how many animals or cells they had in their experiment, it's not statistically significant.

607
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:50,380
So it doesn't get picked up anyway. That's my my soapbox.

608
01:07:50,390 --> 01:08:00,320
I'll, I'll save that for another day. So you know the dotted line here B and hey they look different they're they have the same LV

609
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:06,049
50 but there no observed adverse effect levels going be different for these two chemicals.

610
01:08:06,050 --> 01:08:10,590
So that's where you might have different values on that depending on what you're interested in.

611
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:14,780
And then that C is a straight line. That's what might be used for a carcinogen.

612
01:08:16,450 --> 01:08:20,500
It's based solely on probability. They tend to use a linear function for that.

613
01:08:22,690 --> 01:08:31,840
So it's kind of a confusing figure. But just try to point out cancer versus non cancer and then we'll we'll do things like that.

614
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:43,010
Again the LDV so dose that results in 50% of sales going for dermal or oral.

615
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:46,640
When it's an inhalation study, they'll call it the LC 50.

616
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:53,580
We have a concentration instead of dose just depending on the of exposure.

617
01:08:55,990 --> 01:09:00,850
Is this the type of data you want to base your risk assessment on when you're talking about humans?

618
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:09,159
I mean, historically, that's what they did. They were just like mammals, dump a bunch of chemicals on them, see how many died.

619
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:12,940
And then that's your starting point. So humans can be exposed to.

620
01:09:13,180 --> 01:09:17,260
Yeah. You'd hope there's some more nuance in respect for, you know.

621
01:09:19,180 --> 01:09:26,920
Disease processes the man. But, you know, sometimes it's that you don't have access to much more than that for chemical.

622
01:09:27,820 --> 01:09:36,110
Which is a bit scary. So here's just a graphic showing a LV 54 due to different chemicals.

623
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:43,580
A on the left has a lower LV 50 because your doses is x axis.

624
01:09:43,820 --> 01:09:48,740
So a lower dose as your LV 50 means it's got greater toxicity, right?

625
01:09:50,270 --> 01:09:53,690
That's just the concept they're being shown.

626
01:09:57,510 --> 01:10:01,420
Here are some examples of healthy 50 values.

627
01:10:02,170 --> 01:10:06,100
So the population of animals mg per kg body weight.

628
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:11,200
So we can we talk about the average daily dose for example, who is talking about risk assessment toxicology?

629
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:18,610
A lot of times you do see that body weight factor in there in a tiny factor, whereas for other applications, you may not see that.

630
01:10:19,450 --> 01:10:22,930
So ethyl alcohol, it takes a lot of that to to kill animals.

631
01:10:23,350 --> 01:10:33,390
But as you come down here, you know, nicotine is real relative to that much more toxic dioxin, which we've mentioned before.

632
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:38,920
Highly, highly toxic botulism is a toxin that's even more toxic.

633
01:10:39,310 --> 01:10:47,740
So so these are just some basic chemicals to give you a sense of how variable, obviously, it can be.

634
01:10:49,330 --> 01:10:57,910
Toxicity between chemicals. Another important thing to consider is species differences.

635
01:10:57,940 --> 01:11:03,130
So if you're taking a risk assessment on something that was done in mice,

636
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:09,340
but they metabolize the chemical much differently than rats or hamsters, what do you do with that?

637
01:11:09,580 --> 01:11:13,480
That becomes problematic because then you have to decide which one is more like a human.

638
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:18,070
And depending on what process you're talking about, you may not know that.

639
01:11:19,030 --> 01:11:29,890
So this is for dioxin. Again, you see huge variation in different types of experimental animals, which can be, of course, problematic there.

640
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:35,140
So guinea pigs are much more sensitive than a rat or a hamster in this case.

641
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:41,470
Different ages, different life stages of the experiment as well.

642
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:46,780
In this particular case, much younger is actually less susceptible.

643
01:11:46,780 --> 01:11:50,260
For some reason it might be have to do with the doping.

644
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:57,310
You know, there's a lot of reasons that could be for this particular agent and these in this particular animal, that could be.

645
01:11:57,730 --> 01:12:02,049
But again, you want to pay attention to what those sensitive light stations are.

646
01:12:02,050 --> 01:12:09,850
So you can see how there's a lot of lot of issues potentially here with basing a risk assessment solely on toxicity, toxicology.

647
01:12:10,230 --> 01:12:13,450
Yeah, it's like there's a whole like different kinds of brands like Spring. Yeah.

648
01:12:13,660 --> 01:12:17,739
Yeah. And yeah, you get into that risk assessment process.

649
01:12:17,740 --> 01:12:23,370
If you know, a certain strain of rat was used, it's not compatible with a certain exposure that becomes a problem as well.

650
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:31,420
Or if you see two different strains and very different results between studies that use different strains, that becomes a problem as well.

651
01:12:33,860 --> 01:12:38,540
It's unconventional study type. So acute toxicity versus chronic toxicity.

652
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:47,090
So acute studies much shorter and usually looking at, you know, various things that are relevant to today.

653
01:12:47,090 --> 01:12:52,460
So the LV 50 is done in acute time point of course, but you can have other things that are of interest,

654
01:12:53,420 --> 01:12:57,560
but typically we are more interested in some chronic or chronic.

655
01:12:58,250 --> 01:13:01,700
If you're trying to do a good risk assessment,

656
01:13:02,540 --> 01:13:08,240
you'll take all of these into consideration and you want to have two or more species for tactical kinetics similar to humans.

657
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:14,990
Look for sex differences, have a true control group, and this rate of exposure, again,

658
01:13:15,470 --> 01:13:19,340
could be very important to how it's metabolized or how it reaches target organs.

659
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:26,719
So. We want to pay attention to the relative exposure as well and hopefully have it consistent with what the human risk

660
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:34,430
assessment is going to be to use some examples of types of things they look for in chronic toxicology studies.

661
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:38,690
So Carcinogenesis reproductive tox. Developmental tox.

662
01:13:39,380 --> 01:13:51,650
Neuro immuno toxicity. Again, the list goes on and on, depending on what what's of interest, various mechanisms that might be looked at,

663
01:13:51,650 --> 01:14:01,010
either for animals in vivo or in cell lines or tissues, in vitro, or try to be predicted with with your.

664
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:08,379
Models use our models, but a lot of different things sense an induction receptor interference,

665
01:14:08,380 --> 01:14:13,150
oxidative stress, toxicity, etc. and there's more that aren't listed here.

666
01:14:13,450 --> 01:14:22,990
Just to give you a flavor of how much is out there. So that was a whirlwind, whirlwind tour of toxicology, but it is vital to risk assessment.

667
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:29,910
Typically, you know, as we talk about dose mix of poison, but there's a lot to it.

668
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:41,350
You know, it's not always linear and might depend on the mechanism of action that could influence that number of ways to test toxicity.

669
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:50,000
The three years we talked about knew new developments in microbiology were much more nuanced than we used to be.

670
01:14:50,180 --> 01:14:53,930
So, you know, like I said, in the old days, they would look at the LV 50 and start there.

671
01:14:54,050 --> 01:15:00,620
Now, hopefully we can look at much more detailed studies, much better experimental designs.

672
01:15:01,490 --> 01:15:06,830
We know a lot more about how disease works. To try to get upstream, get the most sensitive endpoint or mechanism.

673
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:15,400
And that's what we start, not not with death. There are still challenges, as we pointed out, though.

674
01:15:15,740 --> 01:15:19,880
And, you know, it'd be nice to have a more uniform system.

675
01:15:21,260 --> 01:15:24,530
All right. We'll probably stop there. So talk about toxicology.

676
01:15:24,830 --> 01:15:33,370
Here is an epidemiology crisis, I guess. Most of you have taken epidemiology before or if nothing else, you go next semester, next year.

677
01:15:33,390 --> 01:15:38,570
Right. So this is just going to be a very basic primer. Like you didn't just call, but we'll start there on Thursday.
