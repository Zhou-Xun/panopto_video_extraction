1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:05,690
For at least 4 hours. I'm like one on one.

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:16,850
I was playing as I played for two months.

3
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,520
I mean, yes, fill it out. It's underground.

4
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:34,630
I know. Extra.

5
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:42,260
Thank you.

6
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:58,500
It's awesome.

7
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:09,760
It's great. I suppose he felt that way over.

8
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:29,820
I think that's that was like because everybody was like, oh, no, Eileen and Grant should be on opposite sides.

9
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,020
There is no way that I would ever do that for him.

10
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,980
Laugh about it now.

11
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,830
Is it like a genuine laugh or joke? You actually.

12
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:52,530
I mean, it's so funny if you.

13
00:01:52,890 --> 00:02:07,470
Yeah. That's mean. If you try to like some breaks, like when I go to like my own line, so I'll stop.

14
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,110
Right. Right.

15
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:22,830
Well, it means that I am so present to the last two weeks, you've had sort of clinical statistics related to clinical cancer.

16
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,010
So studying in prostate cancer today,

17
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:30,030
you're going to hear about head and neck cancer and you're going to hear something much more sort of molecular and biological.

18
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:36,840
So happy to have Maureen here. Maureen is a professor in computational medicine bio informatics,

19
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:43,290
and she's also has an appointment in biostatistics and her background is actually formed.

20
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:53,820
Technically, I think she's in biostatistics, but it was that she's invited Alex and so she's from it's a sheaf and she's about ten, 15 years.

21
00:02:53,940 --> 00:03:00,599
So that's 40 years. Yes. And she's actually advise Ph.D. students through biostatistics.

22
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,319
I don't know, one or two maybe. And this sort of worked with a number of those over the years.

23
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,830
So I connect to a department. So she welcome and yeah.

24
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:15,720
Yeah, I thought, I thought if there was someone in your class, Andre, see that?

25
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:22,320
And I'm like, Yeah, no, I think he switched to a different class.

26
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:28,680
Okay. I think he signed up originally and then quit. So I'm advising him right now.

27
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,700
I would be I don't know anything. I make him feel guilty.

28
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:37,560
I'll make him watch the recording.

29
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:47,740
So I'm gonna use the microphone because my voice is still a little bit forced from me, but I should not be contagious any more from right.

30
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:57,690
So yeah. So the last decade or so I've been studying and that cancer molecular subtypes of it in my lab.

31
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:05,280
And so today I'm going to be talking about going from doing unsupervised learning or identifying

32
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:13,740
molecular cancer subtypes to now supervised learning to classifying individuals new tumors by subtype.

33
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:24,900
And so my outline, I'll start off by giving an introduction to having that cancer and the role of human papillomavirus in certain cancers.

34
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:35,340
And I'll talk about my, our unsupervised learning approach, where we originally identified two HPV positive tumor subtypes.

35
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:39,300
And I'll say a bit about the things that we did.

36
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:48,090
This is using other types of OMICS data to characterize these different HPV positive subtypes and why they're important?

37
00:04:49,470 --> 00:05:00,870
Because they're important. We now want to we've developed a supervised learning approach to classify new tumors by subtype with RNA SEQ data,

38
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,410
which is what we used originally for the unsupervised learning approach.

39
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:14,070
And then if I have time at the end a little bit about what we're going to do moving forward and kind of trying to translate this into the clinic.

40
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:25,079
So I realize you probably have various backgrounds, some stronger in biology than others, so please feel free to interrupt me.

41
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,180
Just raise your hand to ask a question.

42
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:38,280
If I use, you know, biological terminology that that you're not familiar with, I'll try to define and I think of that.

43
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:43,920
But, you know, given my background, I might assume that you have some things that you that you don't.

44
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:55,829
So so head neck cancer is the six most prevalent cancer worldwide and over 90% of so the great majority are what's called head neck,

45
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,950
squamous cell carcinoma, which is what we study.

46
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:05,490
And so that's denoted HCC. So you'll see that abbreviation for my slides.

47
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,180
So that just refers to a majority of head and neck cancers.

48
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:19,980
So annually there are over 500,000, half million cases and about 50% of those are little more each year results in death.

49
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:25,340
Because the average five year survival rate is only.

50
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:28,590
Is there a point to and maybe this is point. Yeah.

51
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:40,110
I don't know if you can see that it's really pretty weak. So five year survival rate is about 40%, although it's much higher for dogs caused by HPV.

52
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:45,510
So the most common and that cancer type is is oral cavity.

53
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:50,820
But there's a significant proportion that are that arise in the oral pharynx,

54
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:59,820
which is basically areas like face of your tongue in the tonsil area or the back of your mouth.

55
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:05,640
So it's adjacent to the oral cavity and it can also rise the names of pharynx banks and larynx.

56
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:12,150
And so it's mainly the tumors in the oral pharynx that are caused or can be caused by HPV.

57
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:17,490
And this has risen pretty drastically over the last few decades.

58
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:29,130
Now, about 90% or so of the or pharynx cancer cases, at least at the University of Michigan, are caused by HPV or HPV positive.

59
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:37,980
Most of the other cancers are caused by tobacco use and to a lesser extent, alcohol use.

60
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,180
And the incidence rates are higher in men than women.

61
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:46,530
And this is especially true for the HIV positive and cancers.

62
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:52,620
So so HPV is a small, double stranded DNA virus.

63
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,030
Has that just a small handful number of genes you see here on the left.

64
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:10,080
But the two main oncogene. So genes that cause carcinogenesis and cancer to arise are called E six and e74, which stands for early gene six and seven.

65
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:20,089
And these. Caused the degradation so inhibit two main tumor suppressor genes, p53,

66
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:32,600
which is the biggest and most important cancer gene and retinoblastoma are B protein, which play roles in apoptosis and cell cycle regulation.

67
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:37,240
But just these two genes alone do not cause cancer.

68
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:42,440
So HPV is extremely common, but only a very,

69
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:53,030
very small number of people aren't able to clear the initial infection and end up years, decades later resulting in cancer.

70
00:08:54,260 --> 00:09:01,430
So and the normal HPV lifecycle DNA occurs in a circular former epithelial forms you see on the

71
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:10,130
left or then a certain percent of cases and cancer that DNA integrated into the host genome.

72
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:23,100
And especially if e six and seven become integrated, then then that just gets reproduced each time.

73
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:33,679
So it's time the cell device and so the HPV virus no longer needs to survive and its natural lifecycle and so that there

74
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:41,000
are a number of other biological changes that tend to occur when that happens and then tumors that have HPV integration.

75
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:45,560
So I mentioned that because that comes into play between the subtypes.

76
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:55,640
And so just to note that the time between the initial HPV infection and cancer diagnosis can be several decades, even like 40 years.

77
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:05,330
So, you know, there are cases where a man is diagnosed and has been married for 25 years and, you know,

78
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,280
thinks that his wife that his wife thinks he's been unfaithful because they've been married for so long.

79
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:15,980
And the doctor has to reassure them, no, you know, this HPV infection could have occurred like 40 years ago.

80
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:21,200
So definitely not a reason to think that it's not faithful.

81
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:30,830
So most people are very familiar with human papillomavirus being associated with cervical cancer, which of course, always occurs in women.

82
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:40,400
But it's, I think, a little bit lesser known that it can also occur mainly in men, but also in women and oropharynx cancer.

83
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:50,630
And in fact, for the last few years, there's actually been more incidence of HPV related ovarian cancer in the U.S. than there is cervical cancer.

84
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:56,809
So you see the numbers here 11,000 for cervical and 14,000 for or pharynx estimated in

85
00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:04,940
the US and the incidence of male to female is about 5 to 1 of our oropharynx cancer.

86
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:14,680
And so that's why it's important for our boys as well as girls to get HPV vaccines.

87
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:19,780
So I'm definitely having my son are actually vaccinated for HPV.

88
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:29,740
So. So there are some pretty important differences between HPV positive and negative head that cancers,

89
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,640
HIV positive patients tend to be a slightly younger age.

90
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:41,770
On average, they are less likely to be smokers, although still more likely than the average person in the population.

91
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:51,270
And that's because smoking, when they got the original HPV infection, lowers their immune system and ability to clear that initial virus.

92
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:59,010
A lot of them are previous smokers. They tend to be somewhat smaller tumor size, less differentiated tumor.

93
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:02,200
So that means that the cells are less different,

94
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:11,770
tend to be less differentiated and more a little bit more similar to stem cells and more likely to have distant metastases.

95
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:20,200
But in spite of this, HPV positive patients tend to have better prognosis because they tend to respond very, very well to treatment.

96
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:31,220
So gosh, it's been about a decade now since I started looking at differences by HPV status

97
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:36,680
at the molecular level in terms of like DNA methylation and gene expression.

98
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:47,420
But more recently, we've been interested in looking at how the HPV positive tumors should be subdivided further into different molecular subtypes.

99
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:58,469
So that's what I'm mainly going to be focusing on today. So it's something to note that that drives kind of our motivation for what we're

100
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:03,060
working on is that the treatment for head and neck cancer can have really horrible,

101
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:14,579
long term, lifelong side effects even. So treatment with radiation and surgery that leads to a permanent loss of saliva,

102
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:18,600
which you can imagine makes it very difficult, if not impossible, to to eat.

103
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:22,890
Some patients are left having to have a feeding tube.

104
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:33,600
He asks. I'm not even going to try to pronounce the full name of what that is and their inability to speak.

105
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:42,060
Fibrosis, neurological damage, facial malformations and scarring, especially if the tumor is recurrent.

106
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:48,300
Then surgery around the face can have really drastic changes in how you look.

107
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:53,610
So obviously these things can really affect the quality of life of these patients.

108
00:13:54,630 --> 00:14:04,350
So our goal is and precision medicine for HIV positive head and neck cancer to try to see whether

109
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:11,670
we can identify a certain subset of patients who could benefit from de-escalated treatments.

110
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:16,890
So less harsh treatment so that we can improve their quality of life later on.

111
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:22,170
As you can see here on the survival curves, HPV positive patients,

112
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:32,309
about 80% of them tend to survive six years and beyond, whereas it's about 50% for HPV negative patients on the left.

113
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:36,810
This is disease specific survival and thus overall survival.

114
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:50,810
So I also mentioned that there has been a couple clinical trials looking at de-escalation of HIV positive patients,

115
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:59,060
kind of overall using very basic variables to to classify them into whether they can de-escalate treatment or not,

116
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:04,490
such as whether they're nonsmokers based on stage and so forth.

117
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:10,610
But using these very basic decision making variables,

118
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:19,070
the result was that the those patients that had de-escalate therapy actually a slightly higher risk of death.

119
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:21,710
And so that trial was stopped early.

120
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:32,150
And so clearly we need better kind of molecular variables to decide which subset of patients can benefit from the escalated treatment.

121
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:38,900
And for those that are similarly for the patients now, there are still 20% who die.

122
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:49,490
So similarly, can we identify at a higher risk subset of patients who could benefit from an alternative or additional therapy?

123
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:57,880
So, you know, there are a number of different approaches that can be used for studying cancer for the genome.

124
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:03,680
You can look at things like copy number, alterations, mutations, of course, neoantigens,

125
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:16,580
or looking at new parts of proteins called peptides that have a mutation in them that the immune system can respond to fusion genes.

126
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:28,970
So all of these looking at genome aspects, looking at different cell type proportions or bacteria, looking at the epigenome with DNA methylation.

127
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:37,760
And so these are all of the types of omics data that we've used so far to study head and neck cancer.

128
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:41,720
And mainly I'm going to be talking about the RNA seq.

129
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:51,960
Sorry. These are the ones that we've looked at to study and that cats are really going to be talking about the use of about our namesake.

130
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:59,150
So all of these things can affect gene expression, which can drive different tumor subtypes,

131
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:05,720
agnostic biomarkers can use to predict treatment, response, recurrence and survival.

132
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:17,410
And research in different tumor types will lead to different subset of these being most important in studying, right?

133
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:23,950
So the cohort that we've use and I'll mainly be talking about are two different cohorts,

134
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:31,000
one from the University of Michigan, which is 36 patients, and half of them 18 were HPV positive.

135
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,830
And then the TCGA or the Cancer Genome Atlas.

136
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:45,220
If you haven't heard about that yet. In this class, you will likely hear about it more because this is a big consortium funded by NIH that has

137
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:52,750
generated a ton of extremely useful molecular data across many different types of cancers,

138
00:17:53,080 --> 00:18:02,469
thousands and thousands of cancers. And so we've mainly been using 66 HPV positive samples from the head and neck

139
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:09,970
cancer group of this and and again mainly be referring to the RNA seq data.

140
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:21,290
So now I'm going to go on into our unsupervised learning approach to identify the positive tumor subtypes.

141
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:30,790
Are there any questions about the background material? Yeah.

142
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:36,370
True I HPV positive patients have a higher prognosis than it actually be negative.

143
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:47,020
That's because their tumors tend to respond so well to the default treatments, so they respond very well to radiation.

144
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:59,070
Why that is. There are some guesses, but it's not necessarily very well known why they respond so well to that.

145
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:04,649
Yeah. To Jeremy.

146
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:13,050
If you know anything else, we may have a young guy who may have smaller tumors, usually something as simple as lots and lots of things play into it.

147
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:18,770
Yeah, I know. So.

148
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:26,190
So. Choosing an approach to identify tumor subtypes if there even are tumor subtypes to identify.

149
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:31,260
So, you know, there's many different machine learning algorithms to choose from.

150
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:36,690
We can look at it divided between, you know, classical machine learning techniques and deep learning.

151
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:40,319
We only have, you know, less than 100 samples to work with.

152
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:48,810
So I think that kind of takes out that deep learning where you really need at least thousands to work with.

153
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:55,500
So within the classical machine, learning could be divided into unsupervised learning approaches,

154
00:19:55,890 --> 00:20:01,260
supervised learning where there's labeled data as opposed to unsupervised,

155
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:11,790
where you don't have any labels known a priori, and reinforcement learning, which is at least so far not used as much in bioinformatics.

156
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:18,560
So in this case, you know, we don't know. We don't have any label data.

157
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:24,270
We don't know subtypes of HP positive tumors yet. So we're going to choose the unsupervised learning approach.

158
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:31,350
And with it then this clustering is a very good technique.

159
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:37,740
We didn't feel we needed anything more complicated than that clustering.

160
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,860
And so then to choose, you know, which clustering approach.

161
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:46,170
So two common ones are K means our comedians,

162
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:53,160
media and just a little bit more robust to our outliers because it's using a non parametric

163
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:58,010
approach or hierarchical clustering so they each have their advantages and disadvantages.

164
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:03,690
For K means it can be difficult to predict the number of clusters.

165
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:11,639
Right? We don't even know so far whether there are different subtypes or identify the order of the data and rescaling

166
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:19,110
can greatly affect results and it can be difficult to interpret the biology from the results when doing K means.

167
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:27,560
And so that was kind of the biggest driver for me to choose hierarchical clustering and I had already had a lot of experience with that already.

168
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:37,170
So some advantages that is, you don't need to choose a number of clusters a priori as if you've got a tree diagram

169
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:43,409
which you can then use to choose the cutoff and outputs are very informative.

170
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:50,219
So yeah, you have that hierarchical structure and it's very easy to do biological interpretation

171
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:55,740
with a heatmap and clustering of the individual genes used to do the clustering.

172
00:21:56,910 --> 00:22:01,500
Some disadvantages are that it's sensitive. You can be sensitive to outliers.

173
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:10,750
And so in order to. In order to address that, I'll explain in the coming slides what we did.

174
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:15,610
And it can be slow for large numbers of variables, but that didn't really matter too much.

175
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:23,409
You know, although we we did have potentially thousands of genes, you know, it's not that big of a deal to wait an hour.

176
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:27,840
If we need to wait an hour, we're clustering together.

177
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:31,750
People are clustered together genes. Well, it's both.

178
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:38,080
Right? So I'll show our example of what the resulting heat map looks like.

179
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:47,530
But so we've got we've got our two cohorts, university tenants, 36 from University of Michigan.

180
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:56,320
And then we just focused on the 66 H positive. So those would be the columns and then each row are the genes from the RNA seq data.

181
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:09,080
So before I mention the methods that we that we used for, I want to talk a little bit about consensus clustering.

182
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:12,740
As I said, clustering can be somewhat sensitive to outliers.

183
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:26,270
So consensus clustering is a way to to to get confidence levels in the robustness of the clusters that you identify, subtypes that we identified.

184
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:33,830
So it's, it's, it's when you aggregate the results from multiple clustering algorithms.

185
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:36,140
So it's kind of an ensemble learning approach.

186
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:44,210
And it's nice that it gives you a measure of stability or measure of confidence of each of the resulting clusters.

187
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:53,060
So the choices that we still have or the number of genes to include the distance measure,

188
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:59,599
to use the clustering methods to use or different linkage methods to use in clustering.

189
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:06,500
So all of these can affect the results. We want our results to be robust to any specific one choice that we make.

190
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:13,460
So what the implementation of consensus clustering that we used.

191
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:17,880
So we did 500 iterations of hierarchical clustering.

192
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,930
Consensus clustering could be used with Siemens as well.

193
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:32,510
And then each for each iteration chooses 80% of cases without replacement each time and builds a consensus matrix.

194
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:40,390
So that all the steps that we did to ensure robustness.

195
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:47,100
So first, we ranked the genes by decreasing variance relative to their mean expression.

196
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:50,700
So the variance of jeans and transcript.

197
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:56,729
Transcode Transcriptomic data is a function of its mean expression,

198
00:24:56,730 --> 00:25:06,120
so we don't want to just start by decreasing variance and take the top because then we'll be biased towards C towards the lower expressed genes.

199
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:16,440
So we look at the function relative to its mean expression and take the ones that are more variable relative to the mean.

200
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:20,940
Then we chose different numbers of top variable genes to cluster.

201
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:25,680
We didn't want to use our results to be just based on one choice for that.

202
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:33,150
We also chose different distance measures Euclidean distance centered, non centered correlation.

203
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:37,920
We chose different linkage methods for the clustering algorithm itself.

204
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:45,810
Complete linkage, average linkage, single linkage. And then we did consensus clustering on these.

205
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:51,290
We started with our University of Michigan cohort and then we added in the

206
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:57,210
DCG cohort to see if the results were again robust to when we added that in.

207
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:04,980
And so in most cases, not a single sample switched cluster within the HPV positive group.

208
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:11,400
And some cases wondered, you could say we had one outlier that whose cluster was somewhat unclear.

209
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:21,200
So with consensus clustering, you do need to pick ultimately the number of clusters that you're going to use.

210
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:28,100
And so I you know, I said that we did like 500 iterations of this.

211
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:38,030
And so with each iteration, it keeps track of which samples are assigned to which cluster assuming different numbers of clusters.

212
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:41,240
So with K equals three. Three clusters.

213
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:47,360
So we have the HPV on the left of the HPV negative group.

214
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:51,770
I don't think the pointer is really working. Negative group.

215
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:56,630
And the two HPV positive clusters.

216
00:26:56,780 --> 00:27:00,280
I haven't introduced those yet, but we named them to you.

217
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:02,030
And I am you. I'll explain that later.

218
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:10,100
But you see that they're very clear squares here, and that's because across all of the iterations with K equals three,

219
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:14,090
not a single sample switched to a different cluster.

220
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:21,740
In this consensus clustering run. Whereas if we moved to a K of four or have two, which I'm not showing here,

221
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:34,280
then you start getting instability and some some samples start moving around between the iterations, between clusters and also what the case was for.

222
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:39,019
There is only a single sample that was ultimately put into the fourth cluster.

223
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:44,780
So this seems to be quite unstable. So we decided on the table three ultimately.

224
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:54,580
So this is what the final clustering look like for the University of Michigan samples.

225
00:27:55,060 --> 00:28:01,660
So and now I'm adding in not just the the hierarchical tree structure,

226
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:06,760
but also what the gene's expression levels looked like that we used for the clustering.

227
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:14,010
So in this case, the most of you have probably seen these kinds of heat maps before.

228
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:19,350
In this case, Red was used for a more highly expressed gene screen for Low Express.

229
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,170
And this was created years ago.

230
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:28,470
I would not recommend doing this because people most people who are colorblind cannot distinguish between red and green.

231
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:35,700
So they're not good colors to use. So now we use usually blue and yellow instead.

232
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:49,640
So the same procedure was done. So did you select a know like 200 genes to work from or did you use or you definitely don't want to use organs?

233
00:28:49,650 --> 00:29:00,420
Right. So I mentioned we we raised the genes by decreasing variance relative to their mean expression and then we chose different numbers of genes.

234
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:09,300
So top 1000 to 5000, I can't remember off the top of my head exactly what numbers of top variable genes.

235
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:18,660
So, you know, we can't use like we we don't want to bias it towards genes that are significantly

236
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:24,540
differentially expressed between like a priori known groups like HPV status.

237
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:35,690
Right. So we just do something unbiased like the variability level of each gene that just ensures that the gene is changing somewhat, right?

238
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:41,910
If we included all genes, many of them wouldn't change much at all between all of the samples.

239
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:45,030
And so they would just be adding noise to our clustering.

240
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:50,190
So we don't want to use all genes, right?

241
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:54,540
So the same procedure was followed, adding in.

242
00:29:54,540 --> 00:30:03,540
Then the 66 had met cancer samples from Tcga and with just the HPV positive samples,

243
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:10,109
the two clusters were optimal with B when we added in the Tsuji, I don't show it.

244
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:19,739
But when we did that, the one HPV positive cluster at Blue from University of Michigan went nice neatly into

245
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:25,110
one cluster with CCJ and the purple ones went neatly fell into the other cluster.

246
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:33,690
So so that showed us that it was consistent then when we added in people from a completely independent cohort.

247
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:41,730
So by that point doing it, you know, all of these different ways, we were very confident that we had identified these two subtypes.

248
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,820
So now that we've identified these two subtypes, we wanted to characterize them, you know,

249
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:54,900
and try to understand why are they important, what's the the biology behind what could be driving their differences?

250
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:05,050
So so this is kind of another look at the clustering of a certain subset of the genes.

251
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:11,200
And so you can see their expression level in relation to HPV negative.

252
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:20,260
So and and as I said, particle clustering is nice because it results in this kind of heatmap.

253
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:27,520
And then you can take the genes in each cluster and determine what types of cellular pathways are they involved in.

254
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:41,410
And so we did that and we saw that in the in the blue cluster that there were a lot of immune response genes that were really highly expressed.

255
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:53,100
So you like that? Yeah. So so this large group here, the immune genes, you see that again, red indicates higher expression.

256
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:56,860
So these were higher and that the IMU subtype.

257
00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:02,530
And so we named the Subtype II a new for its strong immune response.

258
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:10,900
But it was also had higher expression levels and mesenchymal differentiation and angiogenesis, which is the development of blood vessels.

259
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:18,430
And then the other subtype we saw had very high levels of characterization genes.

260
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:28,090
So characterization is the kind of and end result of differentiated differentiation of epithelial cells.

261
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:34,240
So these are done keratinocytes on the outside of your skin underneath layer are alive

262
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,710
keratinocytes and then below that are the less differentiated epithelial cells.

263
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:50,260
So it's similar in your mouth. So also in this subtype, not only characterization, genes were increased, but also oxidation reduction process genes.

264
00:32:50,770 --> 00:33:01,180
And this subtype also was noted to have significantly more likely mutation and a gene called PIK three S.A., which is important in cancer.

265
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:11,790
So. So we still don't know at this point, you know, what could be driving these differences and and are they important?

266
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,350
Right. So there's no relationship yet with survival.

267
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:26,900
So one of the first things we noticed was, remember I said in some tumors, the HPV viral genes can become integrated into the host genome.

268
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:34,819
So one of the first things we noted was that the T subtype was much more likely to have HPV integration.

269
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:45,860
And both in the cohort and on the court compared to the immune subtype, I was much less likely to have integration in them.

270
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:48,230
So it turns out that.

271
00:33:50,080 --> 00:34:01,910
That the biology of what's known from Create Integration could explain a number of differences between the subtypes, although maybe not all.

272
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:10,280
So the subtypes we also looked at copy number alterations and they were different in terms of copy number alterations.

273
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:24,410
So the two significant differences were in the Q arm of chromosome three was significantly more likely to have gains in the T subtype.

274
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:31,970
And the Q arm of chromosome 16 was significantly more likely to have losses in the Iyamu subtype.

275
00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:42,120
So we later identified other important differences between the subtypes.

276
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:47,290
So what I said so far has all been published, but now this has not yet been published.

277
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:53,889
So the IMU subtype has been seen to have more infiltrating immune cells.

278
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:58,360
So that kind of makes sense along with what we saw with the gene expression data.

279
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:08,980
But now in this case, we're actually looking at image data from our imaging slides from the tumors.

280
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:16,300
So for each patient, what's called an HD slide is created automatically.

281
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:21,520
So that's always done and that stained for certain things.

282
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:33,190
And so a machine learning approach was used to to identify from these images of each tumor where the tumor cells are,

283
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:35,650
where the infiltrating immune cells are,

284
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:44,410
and then look at the distance and it uses the minimum distance between from each tumor cell to an immune cell.

285
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:51,760
And so and then it comes up with what's called an overall G cross score for H tumors.

286
00:35:51,790 --> 00:36:03,340
H in a slide image. And so a higher G cross score means a closer distance between the immune cells and the tumor cells.

287
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:09,790
So that's indicative of a good immune response to the tumor.

288
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:20,170
And in fact, the IAM use subtype has significantly higher g scores than the care t subtype and it

289
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:25,090
is known that patients with more infiltrating immune cells have better prognosis.

290
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:30,819
In fact, this year, this class last year looked at some of this data for the project.

291
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:34,450
Right, Jeremy? So different class.

292
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:38,560
I think it was a different class. Okay. Yes. So anyone who is a.

293
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:43,100
Janet G cross schools before.

294
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:54,320
So so this was kind of this was a clue that, you know, the subtypes would have different prognosis.

295
00:36:55,700 --> 00:37:01,790
So something else we we looked at was DNA methylation using whole genome by self sequencing.

296
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:08,750
And the IMU subtype had drastically higher levels of DNA methylation.

297
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:20,299
So much so that looking across the genome at differential methylation, 99% of the differences between I am unpaired t or hyper methylated.

298
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:25,040
So more methylation in the immune subtype across the genome.

299
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:32,720
Here we're looking specifically at methylation and transposable elements or repetitive elements, families.

300
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:38,900
So there's elements, line one, elements line to line one element.

301
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:44,390
So these are repeated elements that take up actually a significant proportion of our genome.

302
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:53,840
And when they become methylated and cancer, which they usually do, that can lead to more genomic stability because they can start jumping around.

303
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:59,960
And so they're usually kept highly methylated. So looking at,

304
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:05,510
I guess whichever Transposable element family to look at the immune subtype in red had

305
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:12,470
significantly higher DNA methylation than the K or T subtype or HPV negative tumors.

306
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:21,109
And so it is known it has been seen across a number of different tumor types that

307
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:26,120
patients with higher DNA methylation levels have been shown to have better prognosis.

308
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:31,400
So again, this is suggestive of the IMU subtypes having better survival.

309
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:37,820
So. So then more recently, this was published in 2019.

310
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:45,590
This was not our group. Another group did a meta analysis of 197 HIV positive patients.

311
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:50,230
They also used consensus clustering but with self-organizing maps.

312
00:38:50,240 --> 00:39:02,720
So this type of their to define their subtypes, they identified three subtypes, this one they described as being the main strong subtype.

313
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:08,570
And then these other two were more care t like one of them actually had more or a cavity

314
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:14,000
tumors and it just happened to be HPV positive and they had the lowest survival.

315
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:26,180
But in any case, there was a significant difference between the I am u subtype up here in green and blue and red, which you do see here on the right.

316
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:37,400
And so this provided a strong evidence that there is survival difference, prognosis difference between these two HPV positive subtypes.

317
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:48,560
So. So then now we're left with the question, you know, how best to classify new tumor samples that we get by subtype.

318
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:53,900
So we've identified the two subtypes which characterize them.

319
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:57,290
We're now in a new grant that we have.

320
00:39:57,290 --> 00:40:05,030
We're performing RNA for a new large cohort of HIV positive head net cancers, specifically world variance cancers.

321
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:14,360
And there's also a lot of publicly available HIV positive head net cancer transcriptomic data that have not been characterized by subtype.

322
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:19,360
And research may benefit from that. So you know having to.

323
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:24,719
Reduce hierarchical clustering with the unsupervised approach for what?

324
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:28,740
The new data isn't really the best way to to do this right?

325
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:31,850
Because the results may be somewhat and consistent.

326
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:38,309
Hierarchical clustering was meant to be an unsupervised learning where you don't already have any labeled data.

327
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:46,560
But we do. Now. We have our 84 HIV positive samples that are now have labels as either care t or I am you.

328
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:52,620
And different publications have used slightly different methods.

329
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:53,310
Right.

330
00:40:53,370 --> 00:41:07,590
So when we look at the the data from from this study and use our approach, we may get somewhat we will likely get somewhat slightly different results.

331
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:16,770
So the answer is to want to use now a supervised machine learning with the RNA data.

332
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:20,880
So I'm going to now move into the supervised block.

333
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:28,820
10 minutes left. So which supervised machine learning approach do we want to choose?

334
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:32,360
So there are many different options.

335
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:35,000
And right now we're not sure what works best.

336
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:44,870
So we decided to kind of take an ensemble approach and try several different supervised learning approaches.

337
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:48,320
Again, you know, deep learning's kind of question. We don't have enough samples for that.

338
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:59,900
So we tried using linear support vector machines, knife base based neighbors, random forest, which is a type of decision tree and logistic regression.

339
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:06,240
Although to be more robust with the logistic regression, we use what's called the elastic net,

340
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:10,970
which is a regular regularized version of logistic regression.

341
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:17,690
So I quickly go through some of the disadvantages of each of them.

342
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:25,940
So Support Vector Machines doesn't provide a probabilistic explanation for a classification,

343
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:34,219
and it sometimes doesn't perform well without having a margin of separation between the two groups,

344
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:37,760
which we we likely do not have that margin of separation.

345
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:46,400
Now, if Bayes assumes that all the features are independent, which is very likely not not the case,

346
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:55,610
and so how well it forms when that's not true depends on the extent of not satisfying that assumption.

347
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:06,410
K There s neighbor is relatively sensitive to outliers and so sometimes we may have outliers.

348
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:13,060
You need to know the chance, the optimal number of neighbors.

349
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:18,170
There's that kind of unknown parameter and it can be sensitive to noisy data.

350
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:26,989
Random forest with which is like an ensemble of decision trees this one can be tends to perform well.

351
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:35,240
But two major cons are that it can be difficult to interpret the results and there's many parameters to fit.

352
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:39,050
And so because of that, it can be prone to overfitting.

353
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:46,760
And then finally, it's kind of my favorite to try is that elastic net logistic regression.

354
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:53,660
So here we have the and the square brackets, the basic logistic regression approach.

355
00:43:54,080 --> 00:44:02,240
Now we're adding on to regularization things, both using that that L to norm and the L one norm here.

356
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:14,510
And so we we tried to minimize this entire function for elastic net logistic regression, which w have a penalty granted in the likelihood.

357
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:19,450
The. Of you is the.

358
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,790
That's the logistic was of a coefficient.

359
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:32,840
So. Logistic model. About fire, I presume?

360
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:39,920
Yeah. Okay.

361
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:45,080
So for those of you who haven't implements are familiar with the machine learning techniques.

362
00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:53,150
So a typical approach to follow is you have to divide your data into three sets.

363
00:44:53,210 --> 00:45:01,790
Training, validation and test. But actually the training and validation gets switched up multiple times,

364
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:10,130
usually to do cross validation, fold cost validation, meaning that, well, what's the next thing?

365
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:18,110
So so we chose to 70% of our samples for cross-validation so each time.

366
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:32,300
So initially we took out 58 of our 84 samples and then each we went through several files of cross-validation using.

367
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:41,400
I think we did five fold cross-validation so 4/5 of that 58 for training, one fifth for validation.

368
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:48,090
Then we switched to a different one for our for validation and the rest for training and so forth five times.

369
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:57,240
And then we held back the 26 of the other 30% of samples for to confirm our final model.

370
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:03,209
Because with the cross-validation you're optimizing the parameters and you want to have an

371
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:10,290
independent set of samples left out to test how well the model behaves outside of that.

372
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:17,520
So typically you would want your you would want your test sample to be independent.

373
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:27,300
So that would have meant like using the tcga data to for training and cross-validation and leaving that up samples for test.

374
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:37,020
But I didn't want to do that because I didn't want the training and model tuning to be done over

375
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:44,040
fit on just one set of T because J has certain properties about it that it could over fit to.

376
00:46:44,370 --> 00:46:50,669
So I thought it's really important to get this this training done on multiple

377
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:57,230
cohorts so that it's not overfitting when we go to use other independent data sets.

378
00:46:58,410 --> 00:47:05,670
So I thought that was more important than having a completely independent set of samples for the for the test.

379
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:16,350
But that comes with the caveat of now. Now, the the test set could potentially be slightly overfitting still, and we wouldn't see that.

380
00:47:17,990 --> 00:47:21,490
Then we can use this to classify new data.

381
00:47:21,850 --> 00:47:28,989
So some other considerations that we want to take into account is that if there are batch effects present,

382
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:32,230
that could be potentially disastrous to our clustering.

383
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:37,540
And so we need to be really careful about picking a good batch correction method.

384
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:42,190
We compared two different ones and we in the end chose combat.

385
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:51,440
B Before we use a complex machine learning approach, we want to check a simpler approach can work better or at least equally as well.

386
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:56,830
And so we did that. We want to look at potential for overfitting.

387
00:47:56,890 --> 00:48:01,690
Right. So we only have 84 labeled samples for training and testing.

388
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:07,660
We have potentially thousands of genes to incorporate, you know, potentially thousands of features.

389
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:13,210
I mentioned that if we only used one core for the danger of overfitting.

390
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:23,470
Finally, some users may not have all of the required genes measured, and so we want to allow learning when potentially missing data.

391
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:30,819
And so in addition to learning from with all of the individual genes, we kind of developed two approaches,

392
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:36,160
one with individual genes and one based on the principal components of the of the data.

393
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:41,120
So first, looking at a simple approach.

394
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:51,450
So, you know, immune score or T cells are essentially the most important part of the immune response and characterization.

395
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:59,870
The two main drivers of the two subtypes. So we looked at whether that just a T cell score and the Keratinocytes score based

396
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:05,509
on the expression data could correctly classify these tumors and they could not.

397
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:11,000
You see, there's a lot of overlapping between the IU and the carotene tumors.

398
00:49:11,390 --> 00:49:21,650
So this shows that the subtypes that really are more complex than just these two are just these two cellular processes.

399
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:28,040
So our strategies for the initial feature selection, again,

400
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:32,510
we want to kind of hedge your bets in a number of different ways for over and under fitting.

401
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:43,160
So the smallest number of jeans we chose was seven of these four really important genes or features from from all of the sets below.

402
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:47,540
So the number of genes that they all agreed on,

403
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:57,839
we chose 48 genes that were the intersection of another different paper that identified two subtypes, which is being called cat care and.
