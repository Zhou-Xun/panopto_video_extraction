1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:18,120
That's what you hope is going to prove to be more than you care about a bar.

2
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:23,819
Like it's really hard to see some of the other things we should do.

3
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:30,030
Like. So I would imagine think, oh, you know what?

4
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:42,440
So my monkey brain development, I don't like what she's hearing.

5
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,770
She's sketchy, but at least I know that.

6
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:53,230
And they would say, Yeah, she shouldn't do it.

7
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:58,160
I just like thinking the same way as just like you don't have to think about it.

8
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:07,920
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Our team is always deliberate when it comes to Britney Spears, so I was gonna freak out when I was in your field or something,

9
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,659
and you were trying to say that it was a mound now because a pitcher's mound.

10
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,980
And then you're like, Well, what if he doesn't know that or whatever that was? That was not.

11
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:21,719
No, I guess is true. No, I know that's not the right words or how did that I got it started.

12
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:28,160
I just want to review one thing about the sequel to Quiz.

13
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:41,160
I know one of the more difficult things in in the class is this idea about how to get in front of issues and how to think about which

14
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:49,950
interventions should be compared to which other interventions when you're thinking about the incremental cost effectiveness ratio.

15
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:57,420
And one of the I think the last question on the quiz showed something like this.

16
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:05,249
Here we have four interventions A, B, C and D with various costs and quality adjusted life years.

17
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:10,410
And I guess this one is this one is tricky and challenging.

18
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:17,280
So if you saw this and you had four mutually exclusive interventions, ABCD, you could only pick one.

19
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:28,200
Can't pick combinations of A, B, C and D. How would you think about the relative value of A, B, C and D?

20
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,300
Maybe you got this right. So I know you know the answer to this.

21
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,730
How do you think about, you know, which one's best? A, B, C or D?

22
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,830
Yeah. They'll go with these things and compare them. Yeah.

23
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:59,560
So we can see here, the first thing I guess we notice is that it's not clear that one is absolutely better than the other one's.

24
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:03,280
We kind of kind of go up into the right to compare to each other.

25
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:12,790
So D has the most quality adjusted life years such that we will access it, but also the highest costs eh is the lowest cost with the least quality.

26
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:16,990
Just like this. There are some trade offs here and so we want to calculate in incremental cost effectiveness ratio.

27
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:24,459
So let's think about first of all, intervention.

28
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:33,150
A, does a have a cost effectiveness ratio? Sorry.

29
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:36,960
Does it have an incremental cost effective ratio? Why not?

30
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,100
That's the whole point of this class is to work on structures, right. Why? It doesn't happen.

31
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,830
This is the first one. And so there's nothing to compare it to, right?

32
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:53,979
The first one, these things are incremental cost architectures, meaning compared to something else and a is the least expensive one.

33
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:57,129
So that's kind of be our baseline, at least for comparison against other ones.

34
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:01,690
So it will not. You're right. Absolutely right. It does not have an incremental cost of doesn't.

35
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:09,160
But how about interventions, you know, B, C and D, those are more expensive than A, so how do we think about intervention, B, for example?

36
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:14,579
Because. This be happening on a cost effective ratio?

37
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:26,760
And if so, how would we calculate it? It can be helpful to start with the least expensive kind of good on the list here.

38
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:31,170
So start with a does not have a customer to issue. B, what do you think about B?

39
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:38,870
Yeah. And compared to a so compare beat, eh.

40
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:50,410
Okay. So, um, and so for that I guess we would, how would we compare back to, for instance,

41
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:57,380
400,000, minus the 20,000 so we could calculate incremental cost, incremental effectiveness.

42
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:06,620
And so we say, okay, it's an extra $200,000 and we're getting an extra two quality adjusted life years.

43
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:12,800
And then so inculcating cost effectiveness ratio and that's going to be incremental cost effectiveness.

44
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:16,610
So $100,000 per quality adjusted life years. Okay. So we could do that.

45
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:23,380
Um, how about interventions? See? Everything.

46
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:34,160
What you mentioned. See? I think you I think you compare C to A because like ANC, like dominate.

47
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:39,580
B Yeah. And so one thing we can do here, it's a little and this is a little bit hard to see here.

48
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:46,430
Um. Let's see if we can do this here.

49
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:54,650
If we draw a line between AMC, B is on what I call the bad side of the line, more expensive, fewer qualities.

50
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,260
So actually, oftentimes we would we would just say this is dominated.

51
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:05,540
We actually would report a cost arbitration for B and C,

52
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:11,810
we would we would calculate the incremental cost compared to A B and the incremental effectiveness.

53
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:25,100
Compared to a and here it would be the incremental cost effectiveness and it's $83,000 or 80000 hours per party.

54
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:33,320
Just letter. And one thing you'll notice that is if you did calculate a cost effectiveness ratio here, it's $100,000.

55
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:40,200
And and then when you're calculating the contracts ratio for C anyway, you would have gotten a smaller aspect ratio.

56
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:45,860
And if you as you go from least expensive to more expensive, the cost purpose ratio should be increasing.

57
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:52,610
And so that that would be a signal to you another signal to you that this is dominated by extended dominance.

58
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:07,840
And so we should prepare you right to proceed, eh? And one other thing too, is if I throw in a junk strategy in there, it shouldn't make.

59
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:17,320
It shouldn't make, you know, C or if I, if I threw in an intervention s here and it was terrible, that shouldn't make C look any better.

60
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:23,379
Okay. So I shouldn't be comparing C to a kind of junk intervention, f and in fact,

61
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:28,840
if B were worse over here, that would if I compared C to be, it would make B look better.

62
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:34,450
But really, again, I'm considering that B is kind of a junk, if you will, intervention.

63
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:41,350
It's it's not good. It's on that bad on line. And so we want to compare it to the next best alternative in this case, which is okay.

64
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:47,709
So B, sorry, C should be compared to A and how about an intervention?

65
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:53,030
D How should we think our D? Or that one.

66
00:07:53,030 --> 00:08:02,290
A, b. C. It doesn't have a cost arbitrage.

67
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:10,160
You. It's the most expensive one deep.

68
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:23,759
I think if you compare it to see yeah, we compare it to see and um, and it's a little, again,

69
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:31,080
a little hard to see here, but see two d is, you know the line and bends up here and so.

70
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:39,770
It's an extra $200,000. We get one quarter to just five here.

71
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:48,920
And so it's $200,000 per quarter adjusted. So the cost, this should be kind of increasing as we go from one to the next here.

72
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:59,120
And the way I think about this is we start with the least one, least expensive one, and we kind of go along the line here to the next.

73
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:02,510
And that's not an dominated strategy.

74
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:09,530
And we keep going along the line here until we kind of we stop, when we start exceeding our cost structures, willingness to pay.

75
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,070
So let's say we're willing to pay $100,000 per quality adjusted life year.

76
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:19,720
Which intervention would you want to choose? See.

77
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:26,250
See what you see. Yeah. You say. Okay. I could start with a and then do I want C instead of a court.

78
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:29,360
I'm willing to spend $100,000 per play. See? Looks like a good deal.

79
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,980
I'm only paying $83,000 per property. That's a good deal.

80
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:37,940
It's a good value for money. And then I then ask myself, should I choose D instead of C?

81
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:43,400
Again, these are mutually exclusive. I might choose one. So I want to say, do I want G instead of C?

82
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,860
In that case, I'm spending $200,000 for quality just like you. Nice.

83
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:51,680
Now I say no, thank you. That's. That's too expensive for me, so I'll stick with C.

84
00:09:53,180 --> 00:10:02,299
Okay. So that's some of the kind of this is one of the more complex concepts within in cost effectiveness analysis.

85
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:07,550
And it only really arises when you have more than two interventions that you're preparing.

86
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:16,940
It gets kind of complicated, but in the end, I guess the idea here is we don't want an irrelevant alternative to change our perception of,

87
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:21,590
you know, we want an era if we're considering B to be kind of irrelevant here, it's worse.

88
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:28,190
And on this worse on the line here, we don't want it to to affect our perception of how we think about K versus C.

89
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:37,560
So someone saying, do you want the, you know, Ford Escape or the Toyota Camry and throwing in like a donkey or something like that as an alternative.

90
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:41,190
It shouldn't affect your perception of the Ford Escape versus the Toyota Camry.

91
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:46,830
Okay. Okay.

92
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:51,750
So for today, I'm going to shift gears.

93
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:58,020
Well, before I shift gears on that, any questions on this this idea of US dominance, extended dominance?

94
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:09,080
Today. Hopefully we'll do something a little more interesting here.

95
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:15,200
And you read a paper for today about PCSK9 inhibitors.

96
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:21,979
And so what I'd like you to do is think about kind of the policy related to that

97
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:29,400
and how you might actually use an article like this to make policy decisions.

98
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:37,190
So let me pass out some thanks for agreeing to kind of set of questions and I have a printout of this, if that's helpful for you to have.

99
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:48,410
It's forward thinking today. The idea today here is to imagine that you're working for an insurance company like Blue Cross Blue Shield,

100
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:58,130
and you're we're going back a few years here and you're considering whether or not to cover these at the time,

101
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:05,030
the new PCSK9 inhibitors and remember what it's PCSK9 inhibitor is what does.

102
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,130
Biggest question. The biggest question. It reduces cholesterol.

103
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:17,380
So why? Why is reducing cholesterol helpful? Yeah.

104
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:26,350
You want heart attacks faster? All this stuff that clogs arteries, locks, blood flow to your brain and stuff like that.

105
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:38,250
Not it's not a good thing cause strokes and some people have high familial, high cholesterol, I believe, before these PCSK9 inhibitors.

106
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:44,070
Why did people what what do people do to control their cholesterol?

107
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:59,770
You just hang out with high cholesterol. So I'm really looking for that heart attack, stroke and excess typically.

108
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:13,090
Yeah. Now, the idea here is that the PCSK9 inhibitors might help people who whose cholesterol is still high, even though they've taken steps.

109
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:27,620
So. And what were they shown to to do?

110
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:37,110
I mean, are they are they any better than Saudis? Are they do they they actually lower cholesterol and all these things?

111
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:02,899
The clinical trials were done in people with really high cholesterol.

112
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:07,430
And it wasn't it was still low even after taking statins.

113
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:11,749
And they actually dramatic reductions in cholesterol.

114
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:17,900
So people were very excited about them. But of course, we're in a class on the cost effectiveness.

115
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:24,830
The cost of these drugs is relatively high. And so you imagine that you're working at Blue Cross Blue Shield.

116
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:29,660
These PCSK9 inhibitors have been improved for medical reduce to reduce bad cholesterol.

117
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:40,100
So your goal, you're going to be helping to evaluate whether or not Bill Cosby should cover these PCSK9 inhibitors and if so, how?

118
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,400
And so you're going to, you know, think about this, but think about, you know,

119
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:52,160
you have a financial responsibility to the company and but you also have a responsibility to the health of your populations that you're covering.

120
00:14:52,160 --> 00:15:01,819
So you want to get to the other and think about this. And so you found this paper here and you've taken a look at this article and want

121
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:07,430
to see how this article and I will say this article is not a cost for businesses,

122
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:10,699
but it's kind of a summary of several cost effectiveness analysis.

123
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:15,950
And so you want to take a look at this and see how is this relevant for your decision making at Blue Cross Blue Shield?

124
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:25,250
So I want you to get together in groups maybe like five or so people here and go through the questions here for the next half hour,

125
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:31,729
45 minutes or so, maybe 40 minutes or so, and then try to answer these questions here.

126
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:34,850
Is there a net health benefit to these PCSK9 inhibitors?

127
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:40,610
And then just a couple of things about the paper here. What is table one telling us?

128
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:47,240
What is table two telling us? I will say, you know, some of these tables, there's a lot of data.

129
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:51,769
One here, two is further on.

130
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:57,530
And actually table two is a big table here that continues on to second page.

131
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,450
And some questions are costing of these PCSK9 inhibitors.

132
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,370
What do we think the economics is of them?

133
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:14,510
There's this central illustration or only figure in the paper here, this nice, colorful one, and then think about how is our,

134
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:21,950
you know, PCSK9 inhibitors, you know, relevant or not, or how is this analysis relevant and process decision making?

135
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:25,640
And, you know, what? What do you think we should be doing?

136
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:33,680
So anyway, I'll let you guys kind of get together in some groups here in class and for the next half hour,

137
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,040
just discuss with your groups about these these questions here.

138
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:48,440
See if you can answer these questions and think about how this article is or is not relevant to decision making for an insurance company.

139
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:57,080
And I'll wander around answering questions. You might have any any broad questions to start off with.

140
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:18,280
You know, I like you guys out there doing, you know, very innovative work.

141
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:30,790
Where are my notes on it? Oh, well, that was a little unclear.

142
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:35,690
You got to make them both for the job tonight.

143
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,770
You understand the relevance of Microsoft, where you can go in there.

144
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:54,390
You know what? It's a chore. Yes. Yeah, that's really nice.

145
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:07,360
That's very interesting. You just saw that was news that you had to bring.

146
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:36,130
That's all.

147
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:41,660
Always. I know.

148
00:18:50,050 --> 00:19:01,110
This is in this state.

149
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:43,290
Questions. Produce.

150
00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:02,640
You've seen something from.

151
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:24,190
It would be interesting to see which ones.

152
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:54,440
The. It's not like he's used to most people.

153
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:58,920
She's. And this whole.

154
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:19,760
This is a tracking. Yeah.

155
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:47,340
There's a reason. Yes.

156
00:24:49,140 --> 00:25:01,520
Yeah. I mean, that it's like. Like overall, it was just a little less than 50% pretty clear up here.

157
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,450
And for the long term, that's what I doesn't tell you, though.

158
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:09,570
I mean, like the other stuff is not hurting.

159
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:15,750
You know, we're not talking about Costa Ricans, you know. But yeah, I think I think that was mortality.

160
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:20,490
That's not clear. But this is I see. You know, so I don't know.

161
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,150
I don't think there's any questions.

162
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:37,400
And I guess I probably want to let you in on just kind of the health benefits for the control group right now.

163
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:41,430
So many questions. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

164
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:58,379
Based on what you're saying about the control or just health outcomes of getting into birth control, people want to the things on the table.

165
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:15,810
But it's not just the cost effectiveness, I guess sensitivity in a way that's fine of it's kind of like a dated message, I guess.

166
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:29,560
I know. It's just like it's got the recognition for.

167
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:45,000
Something you all one such as long distance.

168
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:59,250
And she's just 14 years old.

169
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:06,450
So we're coming on for exactly which ones.

170
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:19,109
Just for. You sound like the one after the Frappuccinos.

171
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:23,560
Kind of. Yeah. Yeah, that's true.

172
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:29,200
Yeah. After the bout versus the.

173
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:37,890
That's the one thing. Yeah.

174
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:47,290
It's just the temperature in those places to us.

175
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:56,010
How it's affecting the situation. Yeah, actually, I think it's a little bit.

176
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:04,110
That's what I'm confused about. Yeah. Because there's like different costs because there's this one where something like.

177
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:17,140
It's one of the reasons for this. Yeah, but what do you want me to report from there?

178
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:24,790
Yeah, like 14 months until you wrote the script. You could tell that as a text.

179
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:40,750
That's true. But still, it really did feel that we had to get through this week in life.

180
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:59,640
Kind of I, right? Yes. That's always kind of the idea if it works at all for the current frozen titles, expand gross and introduce efficiency.

181
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:10,890
If another stunner on the show is being funny by themselves with the simple illustrations in

182
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:23,260
French because we don't know the workings of the Central Station or how literally it is one of us.

183
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:32,350
Oh yeah. It was actually more dangerous.

184
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,470
What's it like, this part of the universe?

185
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:50,880
Yeah. An article estimated that 85% of all phone calls and stuff pretty asked over here.

186
00:29:53,150 --> 00:30:05,270
It's very pretty. So they're saying that there is something about.

187
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:10,780
Yeah, it's not just good contacts.

188
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:15,160
Oh, but above and beyond.

189
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:28,270
I think that's really interesting that that's the case and we have to separate the reports from.

190
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:33,720
Yeah, I do think it's like, who do you think?

191
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:42,910
Right. Yeah, absolutely. Because it's like changed in their cosmology, which was funny.

192
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:52,630
But also it's quite appropriate just because like, you know, they were right, but they weren't exactly one person.

193
00:30:54,400 --> 00:31:00,970
I think there's more going on, but I think, you know, it's inappropriate.

194
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:09,430
No, no, no. Okay. So what is especially important for you and your little world?

195
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:29,170
I just kind of leave them alone to increase your concern because they really want to see the of their graphs in one.

196
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:41,790
I'm just trying to understand, you know, I was just reading about you six feet, four inches from six figures.

197
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:54,190
So that costs the publishers. Which government seems relevant for better policy implications?

198
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:58,720
This kind of sensitive information.

199
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:06,190
August seven is getting getting look.

200
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:33,970
This is like the. We see the changes.

201
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,040
Not until 2021.

202
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:59,510
Exactly the right answer for all. Any lifestyle news can greatly increase lifetime which is just generally it's not like inappropriate feel.

203
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:03,710
Here I'm trying to figure out how much to pay for it.

204
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:09,570
You know what I'm saying? I think we're in on the same thing.

205
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:29,880
Oh, yeah. Back then, I had no idea that I had this insurance increase for the next three or four months.

206
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:35,570
I completely. Because I saw joy in his response.

207
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:39,690
I know you like a woman.

208
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:53,750
Yes, very much so. I mean, like when I was about four after the news of the incident.

209
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:09,590
Yeah. Oh, yes. I mean, that comes with a lot for sure.

210
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:17,530
I mean, yeah, we focus on all the people whose lives were over efficient.

211
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:27,210
I guess I just think one or not.

212
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:31,770
The question isn't really. It's.

213
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:43,050
I think it's related to a lot.

214
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:57,280
Just like an athlete. Oh, so we get run down.

215
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:01,580
Yeah. So sorry.

216
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:07,910
This is for you. I mean.

217
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:11,510
I mean, come on. It's like an option. It's not a magic number.

218
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:16,690
Oh, well, there's someone that. You're right. Yeah, yeah, there's 10,000 people.

219
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,960
What was I gonna wear this year?

220
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:26,440
It doesn't matter what price it's going to cost this time.

221
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:36,469
Cost effective. So it doesn't make any difference either one or two.

222
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:52,590
I mean, that's probably one of the things that, once again, is that what happens, it's always going to be financially disastrous, like you said,

223
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:59,480
just like the differences in the Republican version,

224
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:15,470
which are details which must ramp up against some people by Mitch McConnell nomination, as you said.

225
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:31,640
I'm trying to think what should happen with that races to oh I think I know what it is.

226
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:39,620
Yes. That's my business.

227
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:43,340
That's good. You guys said it was great.

228
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:49,130
Yeah. So it does look like the graphics.

229
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:58,850
I mean, some of this took place right in front of you.

230
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:12,390
That's fair. That was fun.

231
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:19,840
Yes. This is not how I thought.

232
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:25,220
It was not 100% premium over there.

233
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:29,660
Very efficient with my writing and any questions.

234
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:40,070
It's all worth it. I'm sorry. It's so much easier than it was once.

235
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:59,610
So you because yes the studies that were done when referred to look for support as Blue Cross Blue Shield strategies for dealing with inhibitors.

236
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:06,060
What I'm doing is, I mean, like concerning price or condition population for myocardial infarction.

237
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,900
Okay. Just the strokes. Thank you.

238
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:22,740
I'm in the M.S. trial. Didn't seem very specific for these because they cannot simply disappear to the client.

239
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:30,860
Oh, right. So many different options. No, they just target their own right.

240
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:36,250
I mean, yeah. For the 24 hours, there actually was the previous photo.

241
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:57,090
Kendra, come in. First of all, you know, I mean, this was going to get worse and worse.

242
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:11,970
Or transferring no such copies of your course because I was in the same facility.

243
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:24,060
But again, it's so minor, so close to each other.

244
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:30,050
No meaningful interpreter.

245
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:33,920
Study results. Here's to the Silverbacks.

246
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:40,050
I don't know. What do you guys think of technology?

247
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:49,440
It didn't come out. How do you think?

248
00:39:53,670 --> 00:40:03,750
You know what? We still need more, but it's still pretty marginalized.

249
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:33,540
I mean, they're kind of coming over to the station to have it like it was tipped over, which on this one, I have been really excited to I don't know.

250
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:41,250
I'm really looking at like £250.

251
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:50,310
So 1772612681.

252
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:55,020
This is yes, it's kind of a little.

253
00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:01,610
And I mean, like this is the point of it, right? I mean, with their different numbers playing around, I think she's media type.

254
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:08,430
First of all, I mean, that was just kind of in the middle. Yes.

255
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:28,260
You have to make sense if it's kind of even up a little bit better than all the others.

256
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:33,810
I guess it is the second time. So, you know. Yes, if you look people, this is like a big problem.

257
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:43,340
It was probably like that using some the back story like it's I'm not quite sure.

258
00:41:43,870 --> 00:42:01,630
I think I was used to seeing how you guys come up with your homework or you just kind of like, you know, when it goes down the middle three.

259
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:05,070
That's very introspective. I think that's kind of what this is.

260
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:12,190
Yeah. It's like having some marketing otherwise.

261
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,820
Yeah. Yeah, that's exactly.

262
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:23,630
Yeah, that's based on this issue because uses the conclusion that is it not negotiate the rest of the village is kind of what you said.

263
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:30,390
Yeah. Yeah. So I thought it's not supposed to be good.

264
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:40,860
Nobody wants to lower prices, but still constantly to keep them healthy.

265
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:50,520
Yeah, that's probably reason that I wish you can put me in different situations.

266
00:42:51,540 --> 00:43:02,880
I mean, obviously the one. Yeah, I feel like it's going to be like they just seem like this.

267
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:08,070
Like. I know.

268
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:14,970
I know. I know. I know. I know. What the paper is going to sympathize.

269
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:19,170
I would say I want them to have access to that.

270
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:26,130
I would still want it to be as soon as possible because that saves you money, you know, what would you do?

271
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:31,190
Yeah, we have some supply. You know, it doesn't say what struck me up to it just says this chapter.

272
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:42,210
And I said, you know, I don't I don't think the way they go, oh, I see where it is now.

273
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:46,769
Clear what I see. And so for that $14, that's the same thing.

274
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:50,190
But I know. But like with girls. Yeah well I wouldn't, they won't.

275
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:55,590
They're not like long term thing. So I mean you just saying that that. Oh I see.

276
00:43:55,590 --> 00:44:03,770
Like if it's in the street if we get. This quality at it is you're going to be okay says is hot.

277
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:09,180
It doesn't always you know. And so I think thank you for assuaging my concerns as a smaller number of people.

278
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:12,350
We also have a better deal that adds a lot of money.

279
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:16,430
Just think if you want to be maybe just like is a high concentration,

280
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:22,870
greater perspective of higher opportunities of more cancer that maybe just like having a lot more out of school.

281
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:28,639
Yeah, it's kind of like give it to someone if you add a lot of qualities mean just after the cost.

282
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,640
How much of $90 billion? That's what we need.

283
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:34,520
I think we need to go. We got to limit access. That's later.

284
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:41,719
And all I do is for someone who has a lot of private office I didn't want, and that's what I mean in this case.

285
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:45,830
It's not asking for more.

286
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:47,830
I mean, I agree.

287
00:44:48,680 --> 00:45:02,320
I think you guys want to be made no secret and you might like me, but I think that's what we really want to be here for, like one, Jane.

288
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:05,780
And it's not what it was like.

289
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:21,920
So it's like the I think I like how that shoots the burden into like, yes, I think you should say.

290
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:34,200
Yeah, and that's it. So compared to the supermarkets. Yes, I guess how much we need to see this in the office he and say yeah sure yeah yeah let's,

291
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:38,450
let's just gather together and discuss this as a group here.

292
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:42,170
I think a few groups have finished it even if you're involved, not it.

293
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:52,400
We can discuss this together. So the first question was, is there a net health benefit of these PCSK9 inhibitors?

294
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:59,210
By that I mean every you know, drugs are designed to benefit, give you a benefit, but they also might have some harms, side effects and so forth.

295
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:04,880
Is there a net health benefit of these PCSK9 inhibitors, and if so, how would we know?

296
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:14,790
Yes, there's a health benefit, but there's health benefit in reducing cardiac related events, not necessarily mortality.

297
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:20,670
Yeah. And we'll we'll see that, I guess, actually, maybe we can move on to the next question here on table one.

298
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:37,140
So table one is here and this is effects of PCSK9 inhibitors on outcomes.

299
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:41,760
And it's a little bit tricky that we've got four trials in this.

300
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:48,840
They've got to be a little bit tricky. This thing is these three in all caps, these three big trials,

301
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:56,249
they're pretty evenly matched in terms of the sample sizes for intervention and control, but the 24 small ones aren't necessarily match.

302
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:59,820
So it might be a little bit difficult to interpret some of the results because it's not, you know,

303
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:04,560
equal numbers of people in the intervention control, but know, what are you seeing here in table one?

304
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:15,420
One of the key takeaways from health outcomes, like comparing different studies is, yes, we have, you know, the different studies.

305
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:20,220
We might have looked at slightly different populations and everything and they have slightly sample sizes.

306
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:25,410
So I mean, they're clearly looking at, you know, mortality.

307
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:29,460
Am I is is a heart attack or mild myocardial infarction?

308
00:47:31,350 --> 00:47:35,190
Yeah. So, I mean, are these what do you what are the key outcomes you're seeing here?

309
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:45,110
Less events of the past.

310
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:55,960
And really that's, you know, a big outcome that is designed to be, you know, that reductions in state as we are the reduction in cholesterol is,

311
00:47:56,170 --> 00:48:01,360
you know, we there's no evidence to suggest that that's correlated with heart attack rates.

312
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:06,780
And so the control group had higher heart attack rates than she is.

313
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:13,960
And an inverse of those were reduced. And that's a substantial reduction that probably is statistically significant.

314
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:20,440
And no one, of course, wants a heart attack. So that's an outcome you want to avoid.

315
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:31,170
Or what about mortality? But there's no big difference.

316
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:38,129
There's no big difference there. Yeah very similar rates and we actually see slightly higher all cause mortality in

317
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:42,510
this in and CVD mortality although the sample size here is a little bit bigger.

318
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:50,700
But yeah, it looks I mean it's not probably a statistically significant increase, but that's that's another major thing we care about.

319
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:54,210
Right. The reason that one of the reasons you wanna avoid a heart attack is you don't want to die.

320
00:48:55,290 --> 00:49:01,260
And so that's, you know, that's a little bit concerning that we're not seeing a big reduction in mortality as well.

321
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:13,500
I will say, though, you know, mortality is is a there are a lot of things that cause mortality, not just heart attacks and and high cholesterol.

322
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:17,219
And so that is a a measure with a lot of noise in it.

323
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:23,040
Right. I mean, there are people getting hit by a bus and dying of cancer and and other things in these all

324
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:28,589
cause mortality numbers that you wouldn't expect to be affected by cholesterol reduction.

325
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:32,760
So your studies might not be powered to detect those kinds of differences.

326
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:39,149
But still, you know, it's it's it's not encouraging that we don't see a strong signal there in all cause mortality.

327
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:45,300
And that's that's one thing that the authors of this paper highlight so that's table one.

328
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:49,560
Table two is much bigger and perhaps more complex.

329
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:56,549
So what's going on in table two here? Is that just at a high level?

330
00:49:56,550 --> 00:50:03,750
What is it? I guess reflects different studies on bias.

331
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:11,550
Yeah, yeah. I mean, yeah. So this whole paper is designed to summarize the evidence.

332
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:21,149
And so each column here is a different study. And actually one of the coauthors of this paper is Drew Corsi, who is the lead author.

333
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:24,350
On these first two. The paper presented this first column.

334
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:30,270
It's kind of the same the same analysis, just an updated version of the of the first and second column here.

335
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:37,080
And then we have five other studies here, along with this study here.

336
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:46,890
And the beginning part of this table is giving us just a lot of kind of background on the model and assumptions and so forth.

337
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:54,870
I will say one thing that's a little bit difficult to interpret in this in this analysis here is that.

338
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:05,219
Get to the next page here. I guess the you know, they have a lot of baseline demographics.

339
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:10,830
And one thing they mentioned is, you know, potentially that the population, whenever you think more cost effective,

340
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:16,649
it's not just your intervention in this case a drug specific drugs, but also the population that it's applied to.

341
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:20,310
And so they have some details here on the the demographics of the population

342
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:24,870
they're thinking about when they're doing this cost effectiveness analysis.

343
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:34,800
And so someone with a group with higher cholesterol or older age or younger age, you know, could potentially affect their conclusions.

344
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:46,020
They also have some assumptions about the effectiveness of the PCSK9 inhibitors and how much do they do they reduce in a cluster or other events.

345
00:51:47,130 --> 00:51:56,310
So I guess what the costing and cost of the piece, which is which goes to kind of question for.

346
00:51:56,550 --> 00:51:59,880
And then notice here it is, continue to have the next page.

347
00:52:02,010 --> 00:52:06,209
The next page has the kind of cost effectiveness results.

348
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:09,930
And this is where I guess it's a little bit confusing to compare the studies.

349
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:15,330
Drew Cosby study looks at tries to simulate the entire U.S. population.

350
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:19,499
So all these results here are presented for the entire U.S. population.

351
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:28,560
So you see this is something times ten to the six giant, giant numbers on costs and things like that.

352
00:52:28,890 --> 00:52:36,780
So those are big numbers. But that's you know, if you gave these to large segments of the U.S. population that are eligible for this,

353
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:42,060
the other studies are per person, which maybe even make things a little bit easier to interpret.

354
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:52,500
You know. And then of course, but of course, the cost effectiveness ratios, they should be all comparable.

355
00:52:52,510 --> 00:52:59,200
Even if you're looking at something for the entire U.S. population, your incremental costs are for the entire U.S. population,

356
00:52:59,350 --> 00:53:01,989
but also your income inequality are for the entire U.S. population.

357
00:53:01,990 --> 00:53:08,140
So no matter how many people you're thinking about, the cost of ratios should be comparable.

358
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:16,640
And then they have sort of cost factor ratios, price at which it'll be cost effective, as are thresholds for impacted regions.

359
00:53:18,910 --> 00:53:23,860
Let me stop for a minute. Any any other comments or things you've got out of table two?

360
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:37,440
These are interesting. All of those publications from the air, from the company called for two weeks to write.

361
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:41,410
And yeah, so you see who is the sponsor?

362
00:53:41,410 --> 00:53:45,670
Amgen, Amgen and Amgen. So Amgen is sponsoring a lot of these.

363
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:53,110
And you know, I'll say, you know, the drug manufacturers have have an interest in examining the cost factors of their products.

364
00:53:53,410 --> 00:54:01,510
And oftentimes they have to do this analysis to in some ways kind of sell this to the United Kingdom, chuckles a little more later this semester.

365
00:54:02,470 --> 00:54:11,320
And so I've already done this one. I try to publish these papers but that is that is can be seen as a concern is you know who is doing this

366
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:18,060
analysis and then you know what kind of incentives might they have or biases might they have for that.

367
00:54:18,070 --> 00:54:21,940
So that's another yeah that's that's an interesting thing. Say they don't hear.

368
00:54:25,550 --> 00:54:31,190
Other things about table two. Okay.

369
00:54:31,190 --> 00:54:35,810
Well, let's move on to a question for here. But the cost of expanding iron ore.

370
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:40,190
So what's what's the rough cost to take these PCSK9 inhibitors over the course of a year?

371
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:46,290
Like $10, $10 million to 40,000?

372
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:54,620
Yeah. And they say that in the in this table here, they're sorry it was here.

373
00:54:55,640 --> 00:55:00,590
The cost of the PCSK9 inhibitors per year, you know, about $14,000 per year.

374
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:07,530
So though, do these things, how do they affect health care costs?

375
00:55:07,550 --> 00:55:10,580
I mean, presumably reducing heart attack rates.

376
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:16,280
So what do they do to health care costs? And then do they pay for themselves?

377
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:25,490
Because if you if you get an intervention that reduces really expensive events like heart attacks, you know, maybe they pay for themselves.

378
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:30,470
I think they can reduce long term healthcare costs towards.

379
00:55:30,810 --> 00:55:39,580
Oh, so they're using like medical procedures. But, but it's like a small offset from what the overall cost, likely the cost of the drugs.

380
00:55:40,190 --> 00:55:50,330
Yeah. And I really like how in this in this article they actually do show if the papers reported it the break out of incremental costs for the drug

381
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:56,930
and other costs and then total costs in other really it's probably just other medical expenses like those downstream heart attacks and,

382
00:55:57,470 --> 00:56:06,620
and so forth. Um, so here we have actually, you know, causes, study shows an increase in, of course,

383
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:10,879
the drug costs cause you have to pay for the drug and, but also an increase in other costs.

384
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:19,160
Although the magnitude here is, you know, three or four times lower, the other things have gone to a trough or sorry.

385
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:28,220
Dr. Fonarow Ah yeah. Do show a reduction in other costs to long term costs of heart attacks and things like that.

386
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:31,520
But you're right, they don't pay for themselves.

387
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:41,510
So it's, you know, about an order of magnitude or maybe a little bit less savings in medical costs so they don't pay for themselves.

388
00:56:43,910 --> 00:56:49,970
You know, there's a variation there in the and there are assumptions about what the results would be that they're not going to pay for themselves.

389
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:54,110
By the way, any thoughts on why Kasi.

390
00:56:54,650 --> 00:57:01,760
So these other studies show, well, yeah, you've been reducing other costs of heart attacks and things like that, so you reduce costs.

391
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:06,020
Karzai says, no, we actually think other costs will increase over time.

392
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:09,530
You know, beyond just the costs of the drug war, do you think that might be?

393
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:31,720
I don't think they show know, but I think Kasie did assume that they that these categories did indeed reduce heart attacks.

394
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,409
Yeah, it's kind of just a guess.

395
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:43,300
But maybe if you're just using inhibitors of it's not going to kind of encourage other lifestyle changes that are not inhibitors.

396
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:47,800
You know, if you just kind of overall change your diet and exercise habits, that would bring down costs.

397
00:57:47,890 --> 00:57:52,840
I don't know if that's. So it's interesting that I don't think they included that.

398
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:54,070
But that might be something.

399
00:57:54,100 --> 00:58:00,670
Yeah, that's something to think about is if you give someone intervention a will they stop doing or change their behavior in other areas.

400
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:05,010
And that's certainly a concern I think people have had with a lot of things.

401
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:10,899
So they say, well, if we give people, you know, condoms to prevent HIV and transmission or stuff like that,

402
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:15,310
maybe then people will think they're invincible and and engage in more risky behaviors, things like that.

403
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:22,680
I think well, for this in this case, though, I think what they were doing here is they say, yes, they are.

404
00:58:22,690 --> 00:58:24,130
They're avoiding some heart attacks,

405
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:30,910
but that means people live longer because they didn't die from a heart attack and then maybe they would die from cancer or something like that later,

406
00:58:30,910 --> 00:58:36,729
which would they'd live longer. And in the US, in your life, you have more and more medical expenses.

407
00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:43,960
And so now it's a it's a kind of always kind of a rounding error here that the increase in costs here compared to the drug costs.

408
00:58:45,310 --> 00:58:53,290
Yeah. But so, you know, basically everyone found out that these are not going to pay for themselves right now.

409
00:58:53,290 --> 00:58:57,460
We have the more I mean, I like this figure, but there's a lot going on here.

410
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:06,100
The central illustration. So what's going on here in this colorful figure?

411
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:20,980
She actually had a question about this.

412
00:59:21,010 --> 00:59:25,089
Yes, I guess I got a little confused by the arrows at the bottom that the arrow to

413
00:59:25,090 --> 00:59:30,220
their right is increasing severe that rates and then greater risk reduction.

414
00:59:30,790 --> 00:59:35,710
So how does that like is that applying to like, you know, it should be quality of life is improving as you're going to the right.

415
00:59:36,370 --> 00:59:43,719
Yeah. So it's a good point. And actually, yeah, if and so the x axis here is quite just added by the easiest kind of errors.

416
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:50,650
So if you think you're going to gain more from the PCSK9 inhibitors, that you're better over here to the right.

417
00:59:51,070 --> 00:59:57,520
And I think what this is was supposed to be this top arrow here is the event rates,

418
00:59:57,820 --> 01:00:02,470
the baseline event rates in the population before you give them the PCSK9 inhibitors.

419
01:00:03,010 --> 01:00:04,600
I think that's what they had in mind here.

420
01:00:04,870 --> 01:00:11,980
So if you had if you had a population like people in this classroom who presumably have low risks of cardiovascular events,

421
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:16,900
then you would probably have a lot less to gain from taking PCSK9 inhibitors.

422
01:00:17,590 --> 01:00:29,020
However, if you had LDL cholesterol levels through the roof and then maybe you have really high risk of a

423
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:34,710
cardiovascular event and therefore maybe you have more to gain from taking the PCSK9 inhibitors.

424
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:42,820
I think that's what this arrow was. These arrows are designed to represent is there is the risk in the population that there'd

425
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:47,560
be a plot that the senators will be applied to the baseline risk in that population?

426
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:57,509
That's a good question. So, you know, this end of the spectrum there is is probably a higher risk population to start with,

427
01:00:57,510 --> 01:01:01,230
but more to gain from the connectors, more 40 years to be gained.

428
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:07,580
And this is probably, you know, lower. It could be a combination of of, you know, a lower risk addition or, you know,

429
01:01:07,620 --> 01:01:12,390
there's some uncertainty on exactly how good these PCSK9 inhibitors, you know, maybe they're not as good as we thought.

430
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:16,200
Maybe they have fewer qualities to give you or maybe they're better than we thought.

431
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:23,969
Maybe they have more qualities to give you. And then the Y axis here is our cost ratio.

432
01:01:23,970 --> 01:01:27,270
So yeah.

433
01:01:27,270 --> 01:01:44,220
So what are we, what are we seeing in this figure? Now as the discount increases the ICER like it's better when you say as the discount increases

434
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:49,930
yes like it's costs decrease because like the first line is the one with no discount.

435
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:54,850
Oh sure. Yeah, yeah. Sorry. If you get more and more discount then you're more in the yellow and in the green.

436
01:01:55,150 --> 01:01:59,560
Yeah. So the red is kind of original list price and then the blue here is a 50% discount.

437
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:06,639
Green is 75% discount. And if you get at a cheaper price of the drug, it's going to be more cost effective.

438
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:10,330
Right. We like lower cost benefit ratio. It's going to look more cost effective except.

439
01:02:15,310 --> 01:02:18,220
So they're showing you're several different things on this figure here. Right.

440
01:02:18,370 --> 01:02:22,209
If you reduce the price of the drug, it becomes much more cost effective.

441
01:02:22,210 --> 01:02:26,020
And if you give this to a higher risk population.

442
01:02:27,950 --> 01:02:32,570
Then. Then perhaps it's more cost effective than if you give these drugs to a lower risk population.

443
01:02:32,870 --> 01:02:35,660
By the way, within these cost effectiveness studies,

444
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:41,420
roughly how many quality adjusted life years do we think a person would get from taking PCSK9 inhibitors?

445
01:02:43,370 --> 01:02:46,790
Is it going to be a one quality gain? A thousand boys gained?

446
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:09,809
It's hard to see from the crazy study square, but if you look at qualities gained in the studies that looked at this per person Gandara,

447
01:03:09,810 --> 01:03:15,510
Toth, Fonarow and Arrieta, you know, they're estimating it's all hard.

448
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:21,900
These are small numbers here, but, you know, 0.3, 9.6, 6.6, 1.12.

449
01:03:22,530 --> 01:03:33,389
So probably somewhere in the these other studies are suggesting that maybe you're gaining half to one quality adjusted life years,

450
01:03:33,390 --> 01:03:43,260
at least in the populations they they study. So anyway, this this y axis or sorry x axis is probably, you know, a reasonable range.

451
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:48,900
How long these these these other cost effective studies said, hey, we think we're gaining somewhere in this range here.

452
01:03:55,230 --> 01:03:58,440
Other questions or comments about this central illustration.

453
01:04:01,550 --> 01:04:07,010
I guess I would call this a two way sensitivity analysis. It's showing two effects on the cost effectiveness ratio,

454
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:14,360
the kind of risk in your population or the benefit of the of the intervention and also the price of the drug.

455
01:04:15,590 --> 01:04:21,850
Two things at the same time. Okay.

456
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:25,450
So now some more bigger picture questions. You know,

457
01:04:25,450 --> 01:04:32,259
is this review appropriate for decision making for Blue or Blue Cross Blue Shield or in what ways is it appropriate or maybe

458
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:39,970
not appropriate for Blue Cross as they're making decisions about whether to cover these medications in which populations?

459
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:49,440
I think most of the studies were conducted in a simulated environment instead of the usual real world thing.

460
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:52,820
So I think it may not be true.

461
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:58,970
So that's an interesting point here. And and you're absolutely right.

462
01:04:58,990 --> 01:05:02,559
These are all, you know, see study design, state transition.

463
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:08,140
Mark State transition mark almost transition mark a moment of mark of moments here.

464
01:05:10,150 --> 01:05:15,160
And it is possible, too, when you're running these clinical trials.

465
01:05:16,270 --> 01:05:21,040
I say when I run in these kind of trials, I mean, these these clinical trials, when you're running them,

466
01:05:21,610 --> 01:05:26,770
you can collect cost information and you can collect quality life information.

467
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:31,689
You can survey people and ask them, how is your quality of life or to certain activities of daily living?

468
01:05:31,690 --> 01:05:37,720
You're doing support. You can collect that information. That is expensive, though, to call it that information.

469
01:05:37,990 --> 01:05:43,030
If we're talking about, you know, tens of thousands of people, if if those studies were all collecting this information,

470
01:05:44,830 --> 01:05:48,820
you know, so that is expensive to add that on to the other costs of the trial.

471
01:05:49,330 --> 01:05:58,750
But it is possible. And so you could do a cost effectiveness analysis in the trial and actually directly collect what were the costs of all

472
01:05:58,750 --> 01:06:04,090
the people in the trial and what was their quality of life as they as they themselves assessed it throughout this,

473
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:07,640
you know, two years or whatever the trial's up.

474
01:06:07,870 --> 01:06:10,989
With that said, I would say so it's technically possible.

475
01:06:10,990 --> 01:06:14,200
And more and more studies are now incorporating that into their trial design,

476
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:20,919
where they actually will measure quality of life and and and and rates at which you get this procedure, that procedure.

477
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:26,230
And then they figure out what the cost of those, you know, how many times you go to the office visits and costs of those officers,

478
01:06:26,260 --> 01:06:29,110
all that kind of stuff that is becoming more and more common.

479
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:34,459
I'm just doing a revision of paper where I cut out of people who are actually caught in that kind of data.

480
01:06:34,460 --> 01:06:38,170
And so so that is possible to include that as part of the study.

481
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:47,470
One of the challenges with this, I think, is these cardiology trials are typically just maybe two years in length,

482
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:54,879
and it might not be a long enough period to observe the total benefit of these therapies

483
01:06:54,880 --> 01:07:00,370
and think that's that's a concern people have is if someone dies in year one of the trial,

484
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:05,770
well, they probably lost ten years of life because they they died.

485
01:07:05,950 --> 01:07:11,920
But if you only look at, you know, the qualities in life years that are happening during that two year time period,

486
01:07:12,190 --> 01:07:19,239
you might not see those the the missed life years in year three, four or five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, things like that.

487
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:25,390
And so that is one argument that people make for using these model based analysis.

488
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:29,620
But the model based analysis have a ton of assumptions in them as you're learning in this class.

489
01:07:31,270 --> 01:07:36,159
And so that is a limitation of this, is that it is going to you know,

490
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:40,450
it is it's a it's a simulation of reality versus, you know, actual data collected.

491
01:07:47,910 --> 01:07:53,300
Yeah. So is any of this stuff useful for Blue Cross Blue Shield?

492
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:59,370
If you're trying to make your decision about what to do, how to deal with these things, then it should we cover them, not cover them.

493
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:06,860
Patient is a patient population. Be. What's should Blue Cross to?

494
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:13,680
And how how is this information relevant to Blue Cross?

495
01:08:17,790 --> 01:08:22,650
If you read this and working with bluegrass, you're saying definitely want to give give these things to everyone.

496
01:08:23,130 --> 01:08:28,250
Put them in the drinking water. Or no way.

497
01:08:28,790 --> 01:08:32,570
Ban them. Keep everyone a thousand miles away from these things that are so dangerous.

498
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:45,350
Off the table, guests of the CROSSFIRE to informations about what kind of patient to cover and how much discount to provide.

499
01:08:46,910 --> 01:08:51,350
Could be benefit to this could be a benefit to the patients.

500
01:08:52,190 --> 01:08:58,940
So this graph is telling us, hey, you know, maybe a higher risk patients are people, then it might be better to give this drug to.

501
01:08:59,900 --> 01:09:06,110
And maybe you should we should try to get some discounts from the manufacturer in this is this red line here is the best price.

502
01:09:07,630 --> 01:09:13,190
And actually one thing we we often see and it really this that's the most visible price is the

503
01:09:13,190 --> 01:09:21,110
lowest price but in some ways that's like the the the price sticker on a used car at a used car lot.

504
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:24,710
That's not necessarily what you have to pay to get that product.

505
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:33,880
And I think we have some experience in this classroom with pharmaceutical benefit managers, PBMs.

506
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:42,730
So what do PBMs do? The buy.

507
01:09:43,210 --> 01:09:50,530
They have to negotiate, buy from pharma companies and things like that.

508
01:09:51,310 --> 01:09:58,310
They're like, if you manage a pharmacy benefit managers all over the country and like the pharma companies and some negotiation happens there.

509
01:09:58,330 --> 01:10:04,510
So they have some margin which they can pass on and they like to look at something like that.

510
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:11,800
And then there was some scheme or some policy which about, you know, how much cause they save.

511
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:16,780
They would get like incentives based on that. Yeah.

512
01:10:16,790 --> 01:10:22,150
And you know, the biggest thing that probably they, they do is they exercise market power.

513
01:10:22,750 --> 01:10:32,650
And and and how many of you have heard of the idea of five forces as a way to think about strategy, just like business strategy.

514
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:40,809
There's this idea of the five forces. There's you know, suppliers have written about this.

515
01:10:40,810 --> 01:10:48,310
There is the buyers like competitors.

516
01:10:51,600 --> 01:11:03,150
Your substitutes? I think there's a third with the fifth one is internal something like this.

517
01:11:05,180 --> 01:11:08,950
I think it was the. The interview came to something.

518
01:11:11,670 --> 01:11:14,830
Tough new entries. The threat. A new threat. A new entry.

519
01:11:15,490 --> 01:11:25,200
Yeah. Anyway, this is a concept in a framework for thinking about your strategy of your business.

520
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:29,099
And it's really a lot of it is based on the idea of market power.

521
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:32,370
And, you know, typically in your mind, economics, you know, monopolies.

522
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:41,249
How many have you heard of? A monopsony in monopsony is kind of like a monopoly, except it it's a it's a kind of single buyer.

523
01:11:41,250 --> 01:11:47,969
And so it can exist. It can exert pressure because it's the it's the only or limited buyer.

524
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:56,760
And so, again, it can kind of dictate the price. And so all of this idea of, you know, buyers and suppliers and five forces is thinking about, okay,

525
01:11:56,970 --> 01:12:02,340
if I have very few suppliers, that puts me in a risky position because they have a lot of power over me.

526
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:06,900
If I have a lot of what if I have a lot of buyers, then I have a lot of power.

527
01:12:06,930 --> 01:12:10,230
If there are, you know, and I have a lot of power over them,

528
01:12:10,470 --> 01:12:18,510
you can think about like a farmer selling corn, you know, their their product is totally on differentiable.

529
01:12:18,770 --> 01:12:23,010
There are competing thousands of other farmers. They're selling undifferentiated product.

530
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:26,580
And it actually, if they're selling it to just one, a few big agribusinesses like that,

531
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:31,410
you know, maybe have they don't have a good strategic position anyway.

532
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:35,820
But the whole idea behind the Pharmaceutical Benefit Managers is and actually, you know,

533
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:41,400
a lot of people complain about who's heard the word term, big pharma and raise your hand.

534
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:43,169
And one of the concerns, right,

535
01:12:43,170 --> 01:12:52,590
is there are these large pharmaceutical companies that have a lot of market power and actually think that and and they do to some extent.

536
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:58,320
But there are many more pharmaceutical companies than there are pharmaceutical benefit managers, PBMs.

537
01:12:58,890 --> 01:13:03,210
And so these these firms will benefit managers of only a couple of a few of them.

538
01:13:03,570 --> 01:13:08,760
And they basically they exist to negotiate enterprises from the drug companies.

539
01:13:09,150 --> 01:13:15,570
And then the idea is they get lower prices and then they pass them on to their customers, the insurance companies, and or they, you know.

540
01:13:15,810 --> 01:13:22,830
And so now with that said, I think there's their concern that maybe they don't pass those savings on and they kind of get the sense themselves anyway.

541
01:13:22,830 --> 01:13:30,270
So there's a lot of interesting arguments about that. And actually on Monday we have Mark Bender coming in to talk about debate insurance design.

542
01:13:30,510 --> 01:13:36,690
He also will talk a lot about what I think calls up, I think, gross to net bubble or something like that.

543
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:42,090
But basically there's the there's the list price and then there's what people actually pay.

544
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:46,410
And oftentimes we say, oh, drug prices are really increasing and we're just looking at the list price.

545
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:50,280
When you actually look at the prices paid by the pharmacy benefit managers,

546
01:13:50,730 --> 01:13:54,420
the price is actually for a lot of drugs are decreasing now actually use the consumer

547
01:13:54,420 --> 01:13:57,780
might not see that because oftentimes your co-pay is based on the lowest price,

548
01:13:57,780 --> 01:14:00,809
not what parts are. But there's one interesting things going on.

549
01:14:00,810 --> 01:14:07,080
Their mark Frederick is probably having a lot of interesting things to say about that if you ask him anyway.

550
01:14:07,170 --> 01:14:11,880
So all of this is to say is just because the list price is that big red price does not mean that that's

551
01:14:11,940 --> 01:14:17,760
actually what you as Blue Cross necessarily have to pay if there is a negotiation that goes on.

552
01:14:19,170 --> 01:14:27,420
And so that's not necessarily what you the press would have to be. A long winded discussion.

553
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:33,730
Right. But so are these PCSK9 inhibitors are a good use of resources.

554
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:40,150
Do you need additional information to help make your decision with Blue Cross? If so, what information would you want?

555
01:14:42,220 --> 01:14:52,080
Yeah. And really kind of how should you think about these pieces or how should they

556
01:14:53,370 --> 01:14:58,110
give or not give these from these medications to their patient population?

557
01:15:03,010 --> 01:15:09,280
Maybe they could look at the existing data from the patients who've been leaking it like

558
01:15:09,460 --> 01:15:14,080
it's Medicare approved that not necessarily private insurance would also prove it.

559
01:15:14,110 --> 01:15:20,380
Medicare generally approves any new drug because they cannot say no.

560
01:15:20,890 --> 01:15:25,240
There is that pressure on them to not say no to I mean, not denying anything,

561
01:15:25,810 --> 01:15:30,400
even though I know that they're budget neutral, but still there is some pressure on them.

562
01:15:30,820 --> 01:15:37,380
So I would say just for terminology, FDA would approve something, but once it is approved, you know,

563
01:15:37,390 --> 01:15:44,260
Medicare theoretically is supposed to pay for things if they're if they're medically necessary.

564
01:15:44,590 --> 01:15:52,480
And, you know, with that said, it's a little bit complicated with Medicare because Medicare is it would pay for something like this through Part D.

565
01:15:52,930 --> 01:15:59,050
Well, actually, they're they're injectable. So maybe I'm not sure if it's part D or B B, which anyway.

566
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:10,020
But like for for medical devices, once actual data is also tagged in the patients finds, they start using it to see what is that your life.

567
01:16:10,780 --> 01:16:12,190
Yeah. So you can. But you're right. So.

568
01:16:12,490 --> 01:16:18,910
So Blue Cross could maybe see how well it's working in their patient population and try to observe it in their patient population.

569
01:16:20,050 --> 01:16:23,170
Now, it's a little bit hard to control that.

570
01:16:23,170 --> 01:16:27,460
I mean, once you start giving to some people that everyone says, Hey, I like these medications too,

571
01:16:28,060 --> 01:16:31,600
perhaps, and it'd be hard to and this is a concern that people have,

572
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:36,550
is that once they say we're going to pay for something, it's hard to later on say, no, no, no, actually, we're not going to pay for something.

573
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:44,290
So oftentimes that would that introduces some conservatism and these terms companies might say, well, it probably is good, but I,

574
01:16:44,740 --> 01:16:46,870
I want to hold off on paying for it until I know,

575
01:16:46,870 --> 01:16:51,940
I really know it's good because if I give it to people and then if I know it's not good, it's hard to take that away from me.

576
01:16:56,100 --> 01:17:02,759
I will say I discussed this with students in the Executive Masters class a few weeks ago and they said, Well, you know,

577
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:10,650
maybe you could do something where you check the patient's history and only give the patients who are high risk.

578
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:17,760
And I said, Oh, my God, I think I just invented prior authorization. I think that a lot of doctors in that in the executive master's program.

579
01:17:17,770 --> 01:17:24,200
But I don't know what I just do. I hate. But, I mean, there is a there is a logic to prior authorization.

580
01:17:24,210 --> 01:17:29,490
The idea behind prior authorization is, okay, this this might not be a good medication for some people,

581
01:17:29,670 --> 01:17:34,860
but it might be really good for a lot of people. And we need to make sure that it's being given to the appropriate population.

582
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:39,360
With that said, that's a big hurdle. It's it's difficult and people hate it.

583
01:17:40,050 --> 01:17:44,400
You know, it's not pleasant, you know, and I can relate to that.

584
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:55,440
You know what? Did anyone catch it? What? What would happen if if the U.S. just decided, hey, we're going to pay for all these pieces?

585
01:17:55,590 --> 01:18:00,030
If everyone who had high cholesterol, it said it would.

586
01:18:00,030 --> 01:18:06,030
I'd like to 58 million in additional cost and save some $3 million.

587
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:09,770
Some of it. Yeah.

588
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:16,310
So there are like 500 billion in savings, but you wouldn't like offset that.

589
01:18:18,510 --> 01:18:22,410
Yeah. So having like $500 billion in spending.

590
01:18:22,620 --> 01:18:26,010
And so that is that I mean, is that a small number? A big number?

591
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:28,950
That's kind of a big number.

592
01:18:28,950 --> 01:18:35,340
And actually, it would be something where you see a noticeable increase in your health insurance premiums if if this were this round.

593
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:40,889
And and one thing to think about here is as health insurance premiums increase and of course,

594
01:18:40,890 --> 01:18:45,570
that that's difficult for for people who are paying co-pays or who are paying,

595
01:18:45,570 --> 01:18:51,000
you know, for part of their insurance premiums are it's difficult for businesses if they're covering for these insurance premiums.

596
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:55,799
And and it puts pressure on people to reduce access to health insurance.

597
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:59,520
You know, if I'm a if I'm the employer considering offering health insurance or not,

598
01:18:59,700 --> 01:19:05,469
and also health insurance costs are rising, I might just choose to not offer it or hire people part time or set full time.

599
01:19:05,470 --> 01:19:13,830
And things like that makes things more expensive for states that run Medicare and make statements about Medicare, etc., etc., etc.

600
01:19:14,070 --> 01:19:22,200
So yeah, certainly. Maybe the last question here is what price is appropriate for these PCSK9 inhibitors?

601
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:37,440
You're currently $14,000 a year or so. They think it would be appropriate.

602
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:51,269
She kind of went with like around 5000 because when you look at the graph,

603
01:19:51,270 --> 01:19:57,090
it's kind of splitting the difference between I think there's like 7003 thousand ish.

604
01:19:57,780 --> 01:19:59,276
Yeah. So that'd be somewhere kind of in between here.
