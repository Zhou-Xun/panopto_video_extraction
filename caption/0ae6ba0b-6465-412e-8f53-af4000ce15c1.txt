1
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:15,430
Is that door open, Ian? We'll just think you.

2
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:31,400
Hey. Hello, everybody. Couple of VHS poster winners in this class.

3
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:37,620
Congratulations to you all. At cash, maybe.

4
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,760
Or deposited into your accounts. Who knows?

5
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,320
Update on that. Okay.

6
00:00:53,070 --> 00:01:00,690
Just letting y'all know I ate some bad leftover sushi and I was straight home.

7
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:10,620
Not a good time. So we'll see if we make it through the entirety of lecture today without me needing to dismiss you.

8
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,920
I think it should be okay though.

9
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:26,069
So just to recap where we are last week, we kind of discussed, you know, again, the downfalls of not having environmental and social justice.

10
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:35,460
We looked at line three pipeline as a case study and then to recap where we are in this in the class as a whole.

11
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:41,190
So I believe you have quiz for you after this week and then the week after

12
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,040
you're going to submit to me your commentary topic with your first references.

13
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:52,049
So again, with this being a survey course, we kind of started out the class with, you know,

14
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:59,850
just an intro about like infectious disease principles and, and its relationship with climate change and the environment.

15
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:09,419
And then we got into national capabilities and then we kind of went into like, okay,

16
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:16,440
what are the systemic issues in terms of social determinants of health and structural racism, environmental justice?

17
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:21,470
So we did the intro and then like all the not great stuff.

18
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:28,950
Right now we're kind of transitioning into the part of class where we start to have some solutions.

19
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:39,180
This week is a little bit different where it's more like personal context in terms of emergency response and preparedness.

20
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:49,320
And then as we go in future weeks, we'll talk about public health department capabilities and what are some of the good things that we have going on.

21
00:02:50,940 --> 00:03:01,680
So that way, like the way that class is built, essentially helps you with your final commentary paper, which is summative of the entire course.

22
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:11,130
Okay. So today in particular, we're going to be talking about something that I really like, which is respiratory rejection.

23
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,020
And then and then if we have time, we'll get to the vaccines portion.

24
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:22,500
I know it's a lot of slides, but again, like feel free to interject with questions.

25
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,560
So we're going to talk specifically about understanding differences between types of masks and protection levels.

26
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:38,850
Now, almost everybody's wearing a mask and we've had to wear masks for like almost three years now.

27
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:48,479
Right. But it's still like a pretty hairy area in terms of what is required and what is not,

28
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,680
and especially in the workplace, what is required and what is not.

29
00:03:53,010 --> 00:04:04,470
And recently, the National Academies of Sciences and Engineering put out a report on voluntary respiratory protection,

30
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:10,200
because how it worked in the past is generally respiratory protection is found,

31
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:16,290
is a term only used primarily in the workplace, and we'll go over certain terms.

32
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:23,729
But respiratory protection applies to the workplace where either the entire workplace or certain group of workers,

33
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:27,990
while they're doing certain tasks, have to wear respiratory protection.

34
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:37,020
Now that we're in this like COVID post-COVID life, a lot of people are voluntarily wearing respiratory protection.

35
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:41,160
So a couple of you in the class are wearing K N95, for example.

36
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:46,290
That is considered a form of respiratory protection, but it's voluntary use.

37
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:54,720
So we'll get into the nuance of that. But first is a term called assigned protection factor APF.

38
00:04:55,260 --> 00:05:03,479
So this is the workplace level of respiratory protection that a respirator or class of respirators is expected

39
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:10,980
to provide employees when the employer implements a continuing and effective respiratory protection program.

40
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:18,959
So if we look at something, for example, like an air purifying respirator,

41
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:26,220
which I brought a couple of examples here that we can like pass around and do all of that.

42
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:34,590
So an air purifying respirator, this is considered a half mask and then this is a full mask.

43
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:43,440
So what are the ten and 15 necessarily mean? So a higher number does mean that it has a higher APF.

44
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:48,749
But what that means is just say, for example, like I go into this room.

45
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:52,370
Right, and I know that it's bad to be in.

46
00:05:52,470 --> 00:06:01,230
Supposed to ammonia. So I kind of take a direct reading instrument and determine, okay, how much ammonia is in this room right now.

47
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:07,079
If I know that the permissible exposure limit is a thousand parts per million,

48
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:16,470
but my reading says that it's actually 2000 parts per million and over the limit I should be exposed to.

49
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,410
So I need some kind of respiratory protection.

50
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:29,490
So if I wear this half mask, which I'll start passing around here with a APF of five, that means or excuse me, an APF of ten.

51
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:35,340
That means I'm protected ten times up to what the limit is.

52
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:43,980
So if it's a thousand, ten times a thousand, 10,000, or in particular with 50,

53
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:50,160
if it is, it would be 50 times a thousand, so up to 50,000 parts per million.

54
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:58,110
Now if I went into a room and it had like a concentration of ammonia of 15,000,

55
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:03,990
I know then that the half mask would not be sufficient and I need to step up to something higher.

56
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:10,910
So you can see on the we'll talk more about cartridges on the half mask there.

57
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,920
Those are purple cartridges and those are HEPA cartridges.

58
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:20,430
And then on the black one or different cartridges, you can see something like an scba,

59
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:28,920
which, you know, people wear to do scuba diving has a really high aps of like up to 10,000.

60
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:35,670
So again, maximum use of concentration is is exactly what I just said verbally to you.

61
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,389
So if the APF is like a a the of that mask, the full mask is 50 and you know,

62
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:49,320
the exposure limit is like 200 parts per million or like ten milligrams per meters cubed.

63
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:57,360
You multiply those numbers together and that's the maximum concentration you can expect to be protected from any higher than that.

64
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:05,130
And then you have to step it up. It's essentially a mathematical calculation that you don't necessarily need to worry about,

65
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:11,970
but the respirator must be appropriate for the chemical, state and physical form of the contaminant.

66
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:20,820
So sometimes, honestly, when you go into environment, you may not know what the contaminant is and you can't have a direct read of it.

67
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,890
So in those situations,

68
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:32,670
it's better to be safe than sorry where you might use something like a self-contained breathing apparatus or what we call escape canisters

69
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:41,040
that are good for like 10 to 30 minutes to just help you get in and out of the situation or to help you go just like rescue somebody.

70
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:45,270
They also have cartridges. The purple one is HEPA.

71
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,740
So that is in particular just for air particulates.

72
00:08:48,750 --> 00:09:00,690
It's not for any gases or vapors, but we have something called C burn cartridges, which are chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear.

73
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:09,270
And those are more expensive. But essentially you just twist off the cartridges and then twist on a C burn cartridge.

74
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:16,260
And you can expect generally to be concentrated from a vast array of potential inhalation exposures.

75
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:24,120
So here is the example. So what's the APF of a half mask in an atmosphere of sulfur dioxide?

76
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:33,210
Sulfur dioxide is essentially that rotten egg smell, which has a permissible exposure limit of five parts per million.

77
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,580
So from the half mast that's being passed around, the maximum use you can expect is up to 50.

78
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,880
You can just leave those there, Lexi. 50 parts per million.

79
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:46,680
Now, the thing in particular, though, is that you want to be mindful of,

80
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:52,350
depending on some very common chemicals like we know carbon monoxide is odorless.

81
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:55,800
Right. Carbon dioxide in particular.

82
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:08,370
Every year, many utilities workers actually die from a combination of carbon dioxide and methane poisoning because

83
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:17,549
this naturally off gases in a lot of sewage or septic systems and a lot of times utilities workers,

84
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:24,660
even though they're not supposed you, will climb down manholes in the street to go investigate a smell.

85
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:29,010
And they don't do any like preliminary testing and they don't wear PPE.

86
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:33,930
And so they go down there and essentially just suffocate to death.

87
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,709
But the thing with sulfur dioxide is in small concentrations.

88
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:43,140
When it hits your nose, it has that rotten egg smell, but in higher concentrations,

89
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:51,270
it actually shuts down your olfactory system where you you don't smell it anymore if it gets to a certain level.

90
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:56,230
So that's why it can be. Really dangerous. Now, in particular,

91
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:01,780
what we're supposed to be doing this whole time during this pandemic is essentially what

92
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:07,479
we call a user seal check on any type of mask that you wear you could use on your hand.

93
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:14,610
Any fire can kind of do this on your surgical mask, but not necessarily but on your K and any five.

94
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:20,919
Like if your glasses wear like me, you usually check for the seal to make sure there's no air leaking in or out

95
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:25,510
because your glasses will fog up right when you're wearing a mask like this.

96
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:31,810
There's two types of checks where you have something called a positive pressure check and then a negative pressure check.

97
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,729
So the positive pressure check,

98
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:42,970
you essentially want to cover the exhaust or the air's coming out form and then breathe and then if it mat the mask puffs up,

99
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:51,610
that means there's no leakage. Right. And then a negative pressure check is you cover the inlets over the air is being filtered through.

100
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:55,839
So air is being filtered through these cartridges and then you breathe in air.

101
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:02,830
So if you cover these and do a negative pressure check, the match should collapse slightly inward.

102
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:09,489
And then that means that you have a good seal on a k95 or a regular N95.

103
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:12,639
You obviously don't have an inlet or an exhaust.

104
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,120
The whole piece itself is just the respirator.

105
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:21,250
So you would just check to see if you can feel any warm air coming in or out.

106
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,780
So how do you pick the right respirator?

107
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:34,000
It's important to know what task are you performing, what environment are you going into, what's the respiratory concern?

108
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:40,150
What oil particles be present? Will you be confined area and will you be deprived of oxygen?

109
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:46,480
Most of us don't have to worry about oils because we don't work in like a refinery or manufacturing facility.

110
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:52,030
And ends are not oil resistor. And we'll get to that in a little bit.

111
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:58,629
So here's the vast array of respiratory equipment available we show.

112
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:04,600
We passed around the Elastomeric half phase piece, elastomeric four phase piece.

113
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:09,400
Then you have something called FFR filtering face piece respirators.

114
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:13,120
So these are your K and 95 and 95.

115
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:17,890
They do not provide protection against gases or vapors.

116
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:26,290
And something to note is that if you are working in an environment with gases or vapors, for example,

117
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:36,040
and it splashes onto your respirator, oftentimes it will seep into the material and then cause you to have more direct inhalation of it.

118
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,780
So, I mean, it could be something benign like Pine-sol, for example.

119
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:47,200
But if it's a more caustic chemical, obviously we don't want you breathing that for an extended period of time powered,

120
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:53,080
air purifying respirators or papers. These are blowers and canisters.

121
00:13:54,250 --> 00:14:02,950
These in particular, you generally see people wearing these in like the movies like Contagion or Outbreak or something like that.

122
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:07,120
They have what they call like a hood or they also call it a bonnet.

123
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:16,750
But this one people generally wear for longer term care just because it blows air into your whole suit and around your head.

124
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,990
So you're not super hot the whole time.

125
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,940
Supplied air respirators. These are connected through a hose.

126
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,380
So you can only go as far as the hose lets you.

127
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:35,830
So this might be someone like going into like a silo or a giant tank, for example,

128
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:46,600
to do a cleaning a paper essentially has HEPA cartridges and have a belt that you wear on your back and the cartridges sit on your back.

129
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:51,190
So the air is being filtered through the cartridges on your belt and then pass

130
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:54,460
through the tube on the back and then it's circulated through your head.

131
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:58,780
Whereas like with the line, it only goes to the extent of the line.

132
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:05,470
And then you have your scba aids, which is commonly seen like scuba diving and then combination respirators.

133
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:13,360
So most of these in particular, if we were in a pre pandemic world,

134
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:23,560
no one would be allowed to wear an N95 in the workplace without being properly fit tested.

135
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,159
How many of you hired this term before fit tested? Okay.

136
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:31,630
How about have how many of you have been fit tested? Okay, that's very good.

137
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:40,510
So fit testing in particular is to make sure that your specific respirator model fits you.

138
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:49,150
Okay, so a respirator model is not an N95 that is a class of respirators.

139
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:59,170
So, Sarah, for example, might. Fit tested and she's only allowed to wear the 380 to 10.

140
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:07,989
And that is the one I don't have it with me today, but it's like it looks like a cup and it's a turquoise and 95 that you usually see health

141
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:15,250
care workers wear or like she might only be able to wear like the three 9210 aura,

142
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:20,410
which is the white one that's like a tri fold and it kind of looks like a duckbill.

143
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:26,680
But when you're fit, test it at the workplace. Not just like any regular old person can do it.

144
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:36,249
It either has to be like a respiratory tag or an occupational tack and your workplace in particular, if you're required to wear a respirator.

145
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:43,270
So just say that you're, you know, in a very basic example, like a nurse who works with tuberculosis patients,

146
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:51,370
they have to offer a couple of class a couple of models for you to be fit tested on.

147
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:58,599
Right. Because they can't say like everybody has these the 8210 because all of us have different facial configurations.

148
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,840
They shapes noses in particular.

149
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:06,940
So all of the respirators, except for the paper require the fit test.

150
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:16,480
And the reason is the fit test is just the paper just like sits loosely over your head and is a shroud and doesn't have to seal against your face.

151
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:23,679
Now, anything with a seal against your face does not allow facial hair unless you have like

152
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:31,629
a goatee situation or a very like tiny mustache that fits inside of the respirator,

153
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:41,590
which is like a choice. But like, you know, for when I used to do trainings for fire service, they had what they call the credit card test,

154
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:46,690
which is essentially for all the men at Bloomington Fire Department, had to be clean shaven.

155
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:54,850
They were not allowed to have any facial hair. And the credit card test is if you take a credit card, your face and swipe it and you hear stubble,

156
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,590
that means that you need to shave because you're not going to get a good enough seal.

157
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:06,580
So if you compromise the seal, you're falling out of compliance, out of the respiratory protection program.

158
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:14,050
Things that can affect like your fit test is like if you've had like orthodontia work, for example,

159
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:24,310
and your face configuration changes, weight gain, weight loss, you know, facial hair in particular.

160
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:30,100
Let's see, let's hear some, some other bigger, higher class of surveys.

161
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:36,879
I'll get to the types of foot testing in a little bit for this one here.

162
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:44,980
As I mentioned, for for air purifying respirators, they must have color coded cartridges that are Naish approved.

163
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:48,820
Okay. So for HEPA, it's the purple or magenta.

164
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:56,680
Most respirators, R&D, Nilesh approved surgical masks, not respirators.

165
00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:01,450
These are not respirators. They just stop droplets from going into the environment.

166
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:09,730
So they're a form of like a resistance or like, you know, we're just stopping us from contaminating the environment.

167
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:14,920
K95 in particular are not Naish approved.

168
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:28,200
Some of them are looked at by the FDA, but there's more than likely a good chance that a lot of you are wearing counterfeit Kalan and 95.

169
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:29,020
That's fine.

170
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:39,850
Whatever it is still offering respiratory protection, but technically the ones that are FDA approved have to come from a certain batch after 2019.

171
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:50,230
So if you have like a legit case and 95 on every mask you wear on the outside, there is a stamp that says 2019 and a serial number.

172
00:19:50,500 --> 00:20:00,309
And then all the 90 fives. I don't have any right now because I'm trying not to like hoard any for training because they still need it in health care,

173
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:03,430
but they will have a stamp on the inside or outside that says nine.

174
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:15,160
And then the serial number you're looking does yours have the the mask non counterfeit it's okay so again what are the differences here?

175
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:24,130
Cloth coverings, surgical masks and 95 per early in the pandemic a lot of people were wearing cloth coverings.

176
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:36,700
I was doing it. I tried. I remember like March 2020, I was like, Oh shoot, I don't have anything available to me that I took with me.

177
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:41,710
Right? Because and actually these ones here that you see, they have been decontaminated,

178
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:51,680
but they went on loan for a while to the Indiana University health system because all the PPE that we had in stock for training, even though it was.

179
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:58,860
Fired. They asked us to please donate to the health care workers when there is, like, a mash shortage.

180
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:03,990
So these ones went on loan for a couple months in in Bloomington.

181
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:12,930
But I remember, like, getting an old pillowcase and then like watching some YouTube videos on how to, like, cut the pattern.

182
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:21,479
But I didn't have a sewing machine, so I hand sketched this pillowcase into like a rectangle.

183
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:31,440
And I made the pleats. And then it took some, like, old, clean underwear that I like, cut the elastic band out of to make the ear loops.

184
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:40,070
I'm not a seamstress. And then like more people started selling like cloth masks.

185
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:43,250
I remember by buying some on Etsy and all that kind of stuff,

186
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:50,990
and I'd only buy like the double layered ones because as you know, more data came out about studies.

187
00:21:51,260 --> 00:22:01,010
They talked about the efficacy of different types of fabrics in particular and their electrostatic attraction and how effective it actually was.

188
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:09,680
So I'm sure you recall some wild stuff at the beginning of the pandemic where like people were wearing

189
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:18,829
like T Rex costumes to the grocery store or like those giant water jugs that were like cut out,

190
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:22,640
like just put it over their head.

191
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:30,410
Or like I've seen like some people like put a pad over their face or like a bra.

192
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:42,500
And then who was that? I think one of the celebrities I saw was wearing like a mesh was that Lana Del Rey was okay.

193
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:52,249
Like a like a like a mesh fishnet stocking mask, which I'm like for fashion.

194
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:55,340
I sure. But and then we upgraded to the surgical mask.

195
00:22:55,670 --> 00:23:00,350
So these are like a 95 procedure, not in any procedure mask, surgical mask.

196
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,350
These, again, are not respirators themselves.

197
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:11,210
The materials don't serve any air filtering qualities, but because they are multi-layered, they are rest particles.

198
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:22,640
So as far as are considered negative pressure, particulate respirators, where the whole medium itself is filtering the air.

199
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:31,580
Interestingly, though, a lot of now medical professionals, they know how to use an N95,

200
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:36,080
but they don't necessarily understand the principles of respiratory protection.

201
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:44,959
So during the time when we were going through Ebola and all that kind of stuff, we realized that in medical school,

202
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:53,320
a lot of times the amount of training you get over four years on PPE is maybe like an hour max, right?

203
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:56,719
Even though it's such an integral part of what you do.

204
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:05,420
So we had a physician who was working, you know, not necessarily in direct patient care, but in the unit.

205
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:10,340
And he came up to Dr. Gibbs, who will be giving a lecture right before Thanksgiving break.

206
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:17,810
And he was like, my my N95 must be working well because it's getting really hard to breathe.

207
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:28,250
And it's like, no, sir. That means, you know, the whole face piece itself has now been saturated with saliva and is now time to change it.

208
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:32,870
And this was 2014. So it's not like we're going through a shortage or anything like that.

209
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:38,360
So in a pre-pandemic world, ideally the 90 fives are single use.

210
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:47,930
At any time you feel like the quality of your breathing air is compromised or there's like visible soiling or contamination,

211
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:56,300
you need to change it out immediately. So what are the numbers actually mean and means not resistant to oil?

212
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:06,620
95 means 95% filtering efficiency for particles between 0.12.3 microns.

213
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:19,700
So 1 to 3 might 1 to 3 microns are 0.12.3 microns or point 1 to 3 you m that's the signal and it's the size of bacteria.

214
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:26,030
Now, you might see in some health care facilities, people wearing ap1 hundred,

215
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:36,620
that one looks like a little bit thicker and bigger than an N95 that is oil proof and 99.97% efficiency.

216
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:43,550
We never say anything in the field of occupational health or industrial hygiene is 100%.

217
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:48,470
There's no such thing as eliminating every single entire risk.

218
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:53,870
We just aim to reduce it as much as possible. Yes.

219
00:25:54,080 --> 00:26:01,790
In a in a pre-COVID world, we did not reuse it. There was also the issue of like accidental swabbing.

220
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:08,269
This more so in health care facilities where, you know, like staff might like be reusing their 95.

221
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:11,600
So they might go out of a patient room, but they're on a cart.

222
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:16,280
Right. And then another person might come along and mistake it for theirs and then put it on.

223
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:25,549
But, you know, once you put on your respirator, it is contaminated on the outside with particles.

224
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:32,720
The outside is more contaminated than the inside. So when you're donning and doffing and in particular, doffing your respirator.

225
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:36,030
You only want to be touching the ear loops.

226
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:41,280
Now K95 eyes are different because they have loops around your ears.

227
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:46,470
An N95 never has loops around your ears.

228
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:52,740
They only have two straps, one that goes on the nape of your neck and one that goes on the back of your head.

229
00:26:53,040 --> 00:27:01,639
So you'll notice, like when I take off my mask, I always try to put it on something that is like semi more clean than the surface.

230
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:09,330
So in this case my folder and then I always leave it open with the outside up so that when I'm not wearing it,

231
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:13,680
it has time to dissipate or essentially like dry out the saliva particles.

232
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:19,350
And then when I put it back on, you know, it's as least contaminated as it can be.

233
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:24,820
Have I gotten a little bit careless over the last three years? Yeah, I did shove this in my pocket.

234
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:32,130
Sometimes now when I'm in a hurry. Generally, I, like, wear it, like as a hair tie with it, kind of like semi clothes.

235
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:43,380
But at the beginning of the pandemic, I was very judicious, I would say, about how I would store my respirators in particular.

236
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,850
So in my car,

237
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:56,050
I used to have a paper bag just like a like a clean paper gift bag that was open and that I would put my respirator in when I was not using it.

238
00:27:56,070 --> 00:28:03,630
You don't want to put any respirators used in a plastic bag because that's non-porous and it will trap all the moisture in there.

239
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:08,400
Now, how are cloth masks working in particular?

240
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:14,490
So depending on the fabric type and there's different efficacy studies on different fabric combinations,

241
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:19,500
the aerosols will be arrested essentially through mechanical filtration,

242
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:27,830
through the first layer of your cloth and then through the second layer of your cloth be stopped through electrostatic filtration.

243
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,280
So generally, fabrics are more.

244
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:38,430
Negatively charged, whereas the particles are more positively charged.

245
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:44,430
So things that they have found out are more effective are like double, triple layer cotton, for example.

246
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:52,709
But using things like polyester or rayon or silk are not as effective.

247
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:56,160
And then felt makes it like really hard for you to breathe.

248
00:28:56,910 --> 00:29:00,750
So, ooh, I was sorry. I get so distracted.

249
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:04,890
So depending on, you know, the type of fabric you use.

250
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:10,260
The University of South Florida in particular, did a lot of cool simulation studies with this.

251
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:15,569
But remember, it's only as good as you put on and take off.

252
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:18,750
And the more you add, the more complex it becomes.

253
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:22,740
So it's really important to understand what your PPE can and can't do.

254
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:31,979
As we mentioned early in the semester, the only U.S. cases of Ebola came from those two nurses in Dallas who were not properly

255
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:36,900
trained watching YouTube videos right before treating the patient on donning and doffing.

256
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:39,000
And they ended up in hindsight,

257
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:50,970
getting Ebola during the doffing process because there is a methodical and logical order in which you want to take off your high level PPE.

258
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:57,810
So generally, like, for example, if you choose to wear two pairs of gloves instead of one pair of gloves,

259
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:03,360
you do have more protection now, but you're losing some of that dexterity.

260
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,920
So there's trade offs, right?

261
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:13,440
And then when you're wearing high level PPE, generally you want to take off like your first round of gloves, first round of boot covers,

262
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:26,100
and then the respirator generally is the last thing you take off because you might be aerosolized particles in the process of you taking off your PPE.

263
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:31,560
So you want to make sure you're protecting a breathing zone up until like the last possible point.

264
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:40,620
But there are restricted movement, restricted vision and difficulty communicating due to the face protection.

265
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:47,610
Some people are claustrophobic. I am I'm not claustrophobic, thank goodness.

266
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:52,440
But some people are. You definitely get heat, stress and dehydration during this period.

267
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:56,010
How many of you have worn the full Tyvek suit before?

268
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:08,650
It is sweaty. I mean, it does what it's supposed to do because it's it's it's like chemical resistance and it is essentially like leak proof.

269
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:13,930
But that means all your sweat and moisture is being captured in there.

270
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:25,750
And also, like for a paper, for example, like I wear glasses, I don't wear contacts anymore just because my eyes don't produce enough natural tears.

271
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:35,310
But if you're in a paper and you're wearing contacts and you have like dries like me, an air is continuously blowing in and drying out your eyes more.

272
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:42,640
Right? Even though you're wearing the hood outside, like people have a tendency where they want to like touch and readjust and stuff like that.

273
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:51,880
Also, when you're wearing high level PPE should not be wearing any makeup whatsoever because that can also cause smears on the screen.

274
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:54,759
Like I said, facial hair, jewelry,

275
00:31:54,760 --> 00:32:04,990
improper use when we were doing when we're doing the training for national disaster medical personnel for their 2018 summit, this was at Atlanta.

276
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:11,110
And we were in like a giant ballroom where essentially we had to run like 3000.

277
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:17,679
And the EMS personnel, we are set up at like eight different stations, run like 3000.

278
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:25,270
And the EMS personnel through each person have an hour to practice putting on a full suit and a paper.

279
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:35,620
And they knew they were doing this. But so many people were still wearing like full makeup and in between uses, in between sessions,

280
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:45,250
we only had like 15 minutes where we had to like bleach, wipe the inside of the papers to get them, you know, ready and dried out before the next one.

281
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,760
So many makeup stains on the inside of them.

282
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:54,909
So it's not you know, it also causes like potentially like visual hazards as well.

283
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:58,690
And it's also hard to hear people talking to you when you're in there.

284
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:04,150
So sometimes you might need to wear an earpiece. So I know that was a lot.

285
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:08,379
But before I move on, does anybody have choir? Oh, okay.

286
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:12,970
So, okay, I didn't get to the testing. So a couple of you been fit tested before?

287
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:21,070
Um, how many of you know the difference between quantitative and qualitative fit testing?

288
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:26,879
No. Abby, you can guess. Okay. Quantitative.

289
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,900
There's a machine that reads the particles inside the mask versus outside.

290
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:39,030
Yes. And I'm quite qualitative. They use like a scent that heard it described as I've never done that.

291
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:47,220
Okay, so you've only done the quantitative. Yeah. Okay. But it's like there's a scent and if you can smell it, then it's not that, right?

292
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:54,420
Yes. Yes. Present day. But yes. Thank you. So the quantitative fit test, we prefer to do it over the qualitative one.

293
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:56,489
So it is like essentially a machine.

294
00:33:56,490 --> 00:34:05,030
It's called a port account and it has a hose in it that connects to like a model of yours, except has a hole cut out for the holes to go into.

295
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:14,880
And then you put it on and the machine counts like the inward and outward leakage to show how effective it is that one is that the gold standard?

296
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:22,920
But it's really expensive. A port account is like three $4,000 and to rent it even is like a thousand.

297
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:27,660
So that's why I usually like rep parties are like, Oh, take care of this.

298
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:32,370
The reason people do the qualitative bit testing is because it's cheaper.

299
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:39,390
You can buy a kit from 3 a.m. essentially where you put like a bonnet over your head and then they spray something.

300
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:46,920
Now they have something that is sweet tasting. They have a banana oil, they have big tracks, which is a bitter taste.

301
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:53,820
They have irritant smoke which I was doing a simulation with my friend is a TA for the

302
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:59,730
class and he like just was very liberal with the irritant smoke and I was like choke.

303
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:11,219
But this also depends on number one is a person a smoker because if they are their sense of smell is degraded.

304
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:15,150
So it seems like it's a good fit, but it's their olfactory is off.

305
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:21,600
Or even if a person for example and now it sounds silly but eats a lot of spicy food.

306
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:32,669
I'm a little baby when it comes to spicy food, like Tallulah, even like my ancestors are like, Oh, but you know,

307
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:40,229
if a person has a high tolerance for spicy food or whatever, like they also may not be able to sense.

308
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:42,840
Like if you do the bit tricks for the bitter taste, for example,

309
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:48,209
or the saccharin for the sweet taste, but this is frequently what people will use because it's fast,

310
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:51,060
it's a lot faster to just like pass and be like if you smell burning it,

311
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:55,020
tell me like when you how many puffs before you like tease banana let me know.

312
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:59,130
So it is less accurate in that sense, but it's cheaper, faster.

313
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:02,560
So that's why people do. Yes.

314
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:08,590
Mirror people. You have a reason to smile because of all that is also taking into consideration.

315
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:12,400
Yeah. So in that case, you would do the port account with them if possible?

316
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,850
I personally, that's a great question.

317
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:28,000
I personally don't know in my inner circle, anyone who still has lost sense of taste or smell from COVID video you do.

318
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:32,500
One of my friends and I were doing aged care this morning and pretty telling.

319
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:35,560
I feel like. Yeah, yeah. Did you see the study about Yankee Candle?

320
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:41,040
Oh, how have you all heard this Yankee Candle? Do you want to share?

321
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:44,230
No. The thing with the Amazon. Yes.

322
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:50,709
Okay. So it's like basically during peaks of cold air that typically during the winter,

323
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:56,710
there is a lot of negative reviews and online because people were complaining that they couldn't smell it.

324
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:59,860
But the reason why they can smell it is because it's cold.

325
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:06,190
Mhm. And there's Yankee Candle negative reviews going up right now again.

326
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:15,420
So it's interesting what they can kind of uses like a sentinel or a proxy for these higher incidences of COVID.

327
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:21,490
Yeah. Was it just that time with the Yankee candles or they totally lost their smell.

328
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:27,460
They said they can't really taste food sometimes as well. Oh, yeah, not for me.

329
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,660
On Wednesday, October of 2020.

330
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:43,400
Okay. Wow. I will be so sad because food is like my like the only thing with living life for me.

331
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:46,849
But you know, I've seen Tik Tok.

332
00:37:46,850 --> 00:38:00,050
A lot of people are trying like different remedies, like the one where you at like cha an orange on like a gas or or cooktop and then mash it up.

333
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:05,960
I don't know if that actually works or not, but people are trying all kinds of all kinds of stuff.

334
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:14,510
Oh, okay. Any thoughts or comments about respirators or questions before we move on?

335
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:22,730
All right. Emergency preparedness items for your car and home.

336
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:27,350
So car emergencies in particular?

337
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:34,640
Yeah. Especially now that I have lived in Michigan for two and a half years, I feel this deeply in my soul.

338
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:40,639
Car accidents. Incidents on the road. Stuck in weather winters.

339
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,390
Lost cell service. Other into unanticipated events.

340
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:48,620
How many of you have had one of the following on the list?

341
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:53,610
Only a couple. Okay. I've been in now.

342
00:38:56,180 --> 00:39:05,630
Three three car accidents, if you count the deer that I hit like last month and then coming back from a trip,

343
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:11,150
my car died in the airport parking lot and it was like 8:08 p.m. at night.

344
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:21,910
Fun fact if you park at Quick Park on Romulus, they cannot legally jump you because it is considered a liability for them.

345
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:26,930
They can watch you jump yourself so that which I ask them to do.

346
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:31,850
So I would like get electrocuted and then just like die in the middle of the parking lot.

347
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:36,020
But best investment of my life. I'm not sponsored.

348
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:44,200
Black Friday is coming up a self-starting battery jump kit where essentially you pay.

349
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:50,090
It's like 90 bucks. You don't need to wait for somebody to flag down to jump you.

350
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:57,710
You charge this baby up, you keep it in your trunk. It also has USB ports in case you're ever stranded and need to charge your phone.

351
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:03,139
And then essentially you put the leads on red to read black to that black.

352
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:07,320
That was my first time jumping myself ever. So that's why I wanted to make sure they watched.

353
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:10,490
So I wasn't like electrocuted. That lady looked really annoyed.

354
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:16,520
But yeah, then you just. You literally press the button and your car jumps itself.

355
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:23,570
So ten out of ten would recommend because even if you wait for triple AA or GEICO or whatever, it could be hours and hours.

356
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:32,690
So what the National Safety Council advises you to keep in your car as an emergency kit and you check this every six months.

357
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:36,260
So it will vary depending on where you're traveling to, right?

358
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:42,770
So what you keep in your car here for Michigan will not be the same if you live in like New Mexico emergency

359
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:50,060
phone numbers or at least your auto insurance and registration towing info a hard copy in case your phone dies.

360
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:58,850
Inflated spare tire wheel wrench tripod jack jumper cables tool kit flashlight reflective triangles maps.

361
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:08,180
First Aid Kit nonperishable high energy foods water car charger extinguisher duct tape, paper towel, rags, pen and paper.

362
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:16,790
And then for cold weather, snow brush, ice scraper, shovel, windshield wiper fluid blankets, kitty litter for traction blankets.

363
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:23,570
How many of you have any of these things in your car? Okay, that's great.

364
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:30,699
All of them. 50%. I tell them I get 50% on anything on here.

365
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:42,400
That's surprising. I did not know my car had a.

366
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:50,049
Crowbar until I remember back to the first day of class,

367
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:58,990
I showed you that picture of me doing air sampling at a remediated meth home in Muncie, Indiana.

368
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:09,580
So the stakeholder was supposed to come open the door for us and give us a key to the lock box, because they're yeah,

369
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:13,899
they did not come and they weren't answering their phone, but we needed to start the air sampling.

370
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:16,090
They had just boarded the door over though,

371
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:24,220
and I was with my faculty advisor and I was like just rummaging around in my car and I lifted them back in the trunk and I was like,

372
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:31,090
Oh, there's a crowbar here. And so we just took the door, took the plywood off the door.

373
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:36,700
But I also did not know I had a spare tire back there.

374
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:40,000
But your spare tire frequently is just literally a donut.

375
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:47,560
It doesn't have good traction. It just is enough to get you to a place where you can change your tire.

376
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:51,570
How many of you had to change your tire before? Burnley.

377
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:56,460
I don't know how to do it. Yeah, I mean, I've done unassisted.

378
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:59,970
I have not done it. Is it part of your license just here in Michigan?

379
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:03,420
No. Okay. It's not in California, obviously.

380
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:08,220
So if I had it flat, I would have to call somebody and then I would call somebody else.

381
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:13,690
Okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. How about you, Sanyo?

382
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,740
Yeah. Same as Bernie. Get someone else in with me.

383
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:28,020
Yeah, I did have my fuel pump die before, uh, when I was moving out of college, the literally, my whole car was full of stuff.

384
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:33,780
My Chevy Malibu was full of stuff, and my mom was in the front seat.

385
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:41,370
And then my fuel pump died and my car died. An exit before Disneyland in Anaheim on a Sunday.

386
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:45,900
I've never had so many people flip me off before in my entire life.

387
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:51,300
But that was an incident where, like California Highway Patrol did have to come like told me off.

388
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:56,060
But generally, I keep most of these things in my car.

389
00:43:56,070 --> 00:44:01,350
The only thing I would admittedly say I don't have is the nonperishable high

390
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:06,540
energy foods just because I don't like keeping foods in my car in particular.

391
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:16,020
Do y'all remember a couple years ago the Taco Bell sauce guy that it was?

392
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:21,780
I want to say, either washing, I think it was the state of Washington where they do get snow.

393
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:26,610
And this guy was his car was stranded in the snow and he was with his dog.

394
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:35,730
And the only thing he had in his glove compartment was fire sauce, like a just a glove compartment full of fire sauce from Taco Bell.

395
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:46,050
And he managed to sustain himself with the calories just from that Taco Bell glove compartment fire source until he was rescued.

396
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:51,560
You remember this, Lexie? Yeah. Yeah. I don't know how my body would do.

397
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:54,900
Just eating, like, fight fire sauce, fillet.

398
00:44:55,050 --> 00:45:00,570
Yeah, just. Just be solid, but.

399
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:07,769
Okay, so in an earthquake in particular, we are not in an earthquake prone area,

400
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:12,569
but it certainly if you live in like the Bay Area in California or if you live in Oklahoma,

401
00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:17,640
where there is a higher frequency of earthquakes now due to fracking in particular,

402
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:26,040
or parts of the Southwest, securing large appliances, having flexible non rigid gas and water connections.

403
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:35,790
A lot of people opt for cheaper gas and water connections and they might use plastic that will break and then avoiding putting heavier furniture,

404
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:40,590
anchoring heavier furniture to the wall, placing heavier items on the bottom shelves.

405
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:44,249
A lot of people in particular do not anchor their furniture.

406
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:48,840
I evidently don't anchor my furniture, but if I had like a toddler, for example,

407
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:54,749
right there was that whole incident of those IKEA dressers just like crushing a bunch of toddlers to death because you're

408
00:45:54,750 --> 00:46:01,530
supposed to use your anchor kit to anchor it to the wall and then avoid hanging anything heavy above where you sleep.

409
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:04,349
I don't have anything above my bed.

410
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:14,250
I know some people have, like shelves or like storage or like a whole plant escape situation or like heavy paintings don't.

411
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:23,219
And then in particular, you know, inside, getting under your furniture, holding it, getting in a doorway.

412
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:27,030
And then if you happen to be outdoors, unfortunately, during this time,

413
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:33,330
you don't want to be under bridge or near street light or utility pole that might come crashing down.

414
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:40,530
Know, Adriana, you're from California as well. Did you do earthquake drills K through 12?

415
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:44,490
Yeah, okay. I did too. Basically, we just climb under the desk, right?

416
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:49,500
Yeah. Yeah. And if you all do earthquake drills as a kid, not in the Midwest.

417
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:53,670
Okay. Yeah, a tornado. Tornado. We'll get to that in a second.

418
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:58,590
Yeah. For the earthquake drill, you just climb under the desk, essentially.

419
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:06,420
Thankfully, I got out of K through 12 at a time when I didn't have to do any active shooter drills.

420
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:10,500
Did you go do active shooter at school? You did. Okay.

421
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:14,460
Okay. Was that just essentially like hiding and being very quiet?

422
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:21,600
Yeah. Okay. For a home emergency kit.

423
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:27,420
One of my good friends, actually. The wedding I have to go to over Thanksgiving.

424
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:28,680
Thanksgiving weekend.

425
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:38,370
She for a while worked for the state of Nebraska for their emergency preparedness department and became a doomsday prepper, actually.

426
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:42,690
So she has what they call a bug out bag, which is your home emergency kit.

427
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:52,740
Gallon of water for at least a per person. For at least three people, nonperishable foods can opener battery powered radio batteries,

428
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:59,069
flashlight batteries, first aid kit, tool kit, hand sanitizer, garbage bags, plastic sheeting and duct tape.

429
00:47:59,070 --> 00:48:04,200
In case you need to seal any leakages, whistles or flares and external chargers.

430
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:08,700
How many of you have a home emergency kit or apartment emergency kit?

431
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:16,880
Me and Abby. Okay. Do you have, like, most of these things?

432
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:21,240
Yeah, for the most part. Sometimes it's hard to keep track of, like, the food.

433
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:27,440
Yeah. Yes, I have. I have everything except for the whistles and flares.

434
00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:35,960
But it is hard to keep the food in particular. And I would say, like as students, you're definitely less likely to have these things.

435
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:41,090
But I would say definitely try to keep at least the the gallon of water just in case.

436
00:48:41,090 --> 00:48:48,830
Just in case at any given time, I, I generally am against single use plastic, as you can see.

437
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:57,049
But I have one of the big water things that are like the, you know, and I don't know what you call it, but you like pull it out and pull it in.

438
00:48:57,050 --> 00:48:59,450
The water comes out. So it's like kind of shaped like a rectangle.

439
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:11,210
I have one of those in my house just in case there is not potable water or for some reason you lose a ton of water and there isn't snow to melt down.

440
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:19,520
How are you going to flush the toilet? So my friend who lives in Oklahoma City around thousand and 21,

441
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:30,620
when Texas lost that power during that ice storm couple of months before she ended up losing water in her house for a week, a week.

442
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:35,690
OC not because she didn't have water, because all her pipes were frozen,

443
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:41,809
because she lives in a house in Oklahoma where there's no insulation because of climate change.

444
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:48,140
In this house was built in the seventies. They did not anticipate that these houses would freeze to such an extent.

445
00:49:48,470 --> 00:49:51,920
So her pipes were frozen for a week.

446
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:56,270
A week? I cannot live like that. I was like, Why don't you go to somebody else's house?

447
00:49:56,270 --> 00:50:04,429
But she was being very stubborn about it. I was like, I hate you. But she ended up because there was snow outside before she knew this might happen.

448
00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:11,959
So she had filled both of her bathtubs up entirely with water so that once you like flush,

449
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:16,520
right, you have to refill your toilet tank with water to flush again.

450
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:19,010
So that was where the flushing after she ran out of that water,

451
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:26,780
she would bring in buckets of snow and dump it into the bathtub to melt down, essentially.

452
00:50:27,590 --> 00:50:34,850
And then she had she gets like water deliveries. So she did have like water to drink from her, like sources like that.

453
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:42,739
I would find that very challenging. But, you know, she was more or less prepared.

454
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:47,060
Lexi know, when I was little, it wasn't uncommon for us to lose power.

455
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:55,190
And so, like we have a little we would ditch next to our house and so have to go out with buckets and use that to fill the tank so we could flush.

456
00:50:55,490 --> 00:50:59,420
Oh, we always kept water in the fridge too. So do you have.

457
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:06,420
Well, water. Okay, yeah. Yeah. The power outage just a couple weeks ago, not weeks ago.

458
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:11,990
Eight months ago. Mine lasted for maybe like 6 hours, Titi, I'm telling you.

459
00:51:12,290 --> 00:51:18,319
But one of my colleagues who lives in Dexter on a larger property, a well water property,

460
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:25,900
didn't have power or water and was doing like, just like dry shampoo and like baby wipes.

461
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:36,950
I was like, I commend you. And in particular, I will say I saw this a lot in Florida, which I never thought about, which was really smart,

462
00:51:38,210 --> 00:51:46,280
is if you anticipate you're losing power and you don't know whether or not your food is still going to be good or not,

463
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:52,129
depending on how long your power is out in your fridge.

464
00:51:52,130 --> 00:51:56,330
So like not this past summer, but last summer, 36 hour power outage.

465
00:51:56,330 --> 00:52:00,860
I had to purge my entire fridge because I didn't want to get food poisoning.

466
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:11,569
Apparently I did not do so well with reheating my leftover sushi yesterday, but I saw and again, tick tock people in Florida,

467
00:52:11,570 --> 00:52:17,090
they have a small Tupperware that they fill with water and they freeze it and put a penny on top.

468
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:22,159
And then if the penny sinks to the bottom, that means that at some point,

469
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:27,709
like that frozen container of water melted and the temperature of your fridge went down.

470
00:52:27,710 --> 00:52:32,180
So that's like an indication that the food is no longer good.

471
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:36,469
I only just learned that recently. I was like, That is so clever. I see some had not.

472
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:46,820
Some of you really knew that. But I was like, Look at the lady bees every day. Now, in event of a flood, as we talked about earlier in this class,

473
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:55,610
your homeowner's insurance generally does not cover a catastrophic flooding like from a hurricane, for example, or if a dam breaks.

474
00:52:56,360 --> 00:53:01,700
So most of the time, you have to get this flood insurance from FEMA, FEMA in particular.

475
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:08,000
And so it's really important to understand your proximity to rivers, streams, dams and flood plains.

476
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:11,960
I bought a new construction house. And I still did an inspection on it.

477
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:15,320
They came back with over 30 things that the builder needed to fix.

478
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:22,549
But the bit the inspector also looked at how my house was graded in terms of where does the water flow when it collects?

479
00:53:22,550 --> 00:53:30,290
Is it moving towards your house or away from your house? Generally away is where it should go and then develop an evacuation plan.

480
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:35,000
Don't try to walk in water above your ankles.

481
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:42,109
The depths can be really deceiving. Turning off electricity and other utilities and then outwitting the outdoors.

482
00:53:42,110 --> 00:53:48,770
And then if you happened to be outdoors, avoiding underpasses and then underground parking garages and basements.

483
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:52,970
I remember from when I was a kid in Sacramento, it didn't happen a lot,

484
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:57,350
but because when we were in the valley, there would be times where there was heavy rain.

485
00:53:57,350 --> 00:54:04,399
And I remember as a kid like my mom going to like a Home Depot or whatever,

486
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:12,020
and then we would just get a bunch of sand bags and then line the bottom of the driveway with sand bags.

487
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:15,860
I don't know that it was that severe.

488
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:26,340
Because Californians, anytime it rains, they're like, oh, you know, but I do have a distinct memory of of that happening.

489
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:32,820
Most houses in the Midwest, in Michigan in particular, have some pumps, which is essentially in your basement,

490
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:38,430
this pump in a hole in the ground that's supposed to suck up the water in case it gets to above a certain level.

491
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:42,210
I see tons of people here driving into flood water all the time.

492
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:49,950
Yeah, Michigan is crazy, but you're not supposed to you because especially when it's dark, it's hard to tell with the depth of it.

493
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:54,030
And you might not be able to actually pass or you might get stuck.

494
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:58,729
But people still try to. Hurricanes again.

495
00:54:58,730 --> 00:55:08,690
Check the homeowner's insurance policy. Boarding up windows, evacuation plan, taking shelter, staying away from electrical equipment,

496
00:55:08,690 --> 00:55:15,410
cords, buildings, and then staying indoors until local authorities say that it is safe.

497
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:24,060
Okay. And then tornadoes. Generally, tornadoes are covered by homeowners and renters insurance.

498
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:30,500
Good news. But seeking immediate shelter in a low covered place, staying away from auditoriums,

499
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:35,630
upper floors, trailers, parked vehicles and windows in particular.

500
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:42,620
If you're outside, you're supposed to lay down in a ditch or low lying area, protect your head.

501
00:55:43,250 --> 00:55:47,720
And then if you are driving, you're supposed to drive at right angles,

502
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:54,110
90 degrees to get out of the tornado path or get out of your vehicle and then lie down.

503
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:57,410
How many you've ever been driving? And there's been a tornado coming.

504
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:03,890
Lexi, what did you end up doing a little faster towards it?

505
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:10,460
No, no. Okay. We were on our way because we don't have a basement, so we were on our way to a place with the basement.

506
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:15,440
Okay. And it was raining. It was going the opposite way.

507
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:20,040
Like it was far enough away that we really. You made it.

508
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:25,160
Yeah. Okay. Yeah, we just got a storm.

509
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:31,140
But it's not uncommon where we live. Like, there's quite a few tornadoes, so we're just kind of used to.

510
00:56:31,350 --> 00:56:34,560
Where are you from again? The thumb. Okay.

511
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:43,530
Yeah, it. It's just like it might take out one farm each time, but there's not a high population.

512
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:47,760
Wasn't there a big tornado like earlier this year in the U.P.?

513
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:54,280
Oh, Gaillard. Gaillard. Yes. One of my friends was in a basement of, like, a grocery store when it happened.

514
00:56:54,310 --> 00:57:00,060
Yeah. Yeah. Down there. That was that was kind of, like, unexpected, because it didn't happen a lot up there.

515
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:06,740
Right. I remember my mom texting me because she has no sense of, like, geography or whatever, and she was like, are you okay?

516
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:13,140
And I'm like, that's like 5 hours away. I'm fine. But that was I remember, very surprising and devastating.

517
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:16,310
And all of you have been through the experience of a tornado drill.

518
00:57:16,650 --> 00:57:23,250
I have gone when I was at Indiana University, we had to seek shelter for a tornado.

519
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:34,889
And that building was interesting. That School of Public Health was interesting because the gym was inside of that building.

520
00:57:34,890 --> 00:57:40,020
Like we had a gym. There were two indoor swimming pools, six indoor basketball courts.

521
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:44,400
It was a weird it was a weird building. But I was more motivated to work out when I worked there.

522
00:57:44,490 --> 00:57:51,719
So that because you would just like be walking from your office and see like there was also dance studios, you see, like little ballerina,

523
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:58,320
like children and like tutus and like swimmers, like running around in their bathing suit, people playing basketball.

524
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:08,910
The my male colleagues frequently like to play shirts and skins basketball at lunchtime, so I just like walk by briskly, but like,

525
00:58:08,910 --> 00:58:13,950
you know, you would be like literally walking from like the Dean suite and the next thing you know, like there's six basketball courts.

526
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:18,120
But that in particular where we sought shelter was the locker rooms.

527
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:25,110
So, you know, women would all just, like, go and huddle in the women's locker room in the basement,

528
00:58:25,530 --> 00:58:29,160
and then men would go huddle in the men's locker room. In the basement? Yeah.

529
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:39,250
Yeah. Interesting times. So people frequently will use these terms.

530
00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:44,110
Tornado watch versus warning. Now, what is the difference?

531
00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:51,040
They frequently use this cupcake analogy where the watch is less severe than the warning because you have

532
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:57,580
essentially what the components to a tornado yet but it's not fully formed where you're at the warning form.

533
00:58:57,910 --> 00:59:01,180
You spotted it. It's there. So.

534
00:59:02,270 --> 00:59:06,830
Yes. Yes, definitely. Do not take warnings slightly.

535
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:18,010
Okay. Okay. Okay.

536
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:20,870
I was like, I think it should be okay. Okay.

537
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:30,020
So emergency preparedness at homes or fires in particular minimizing risks with the ABC class extinguisher,

538
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:36,620
fire detectors checked in annually and be mindful when cooking and then having an evacuation plan in place.

539
00:59:37,070 --> 00:59:40,850
In the U.S., are home fires reported every 90 seconds?

540
00:59:41,990 --> 00:59:49,130
How many of you have ever been in a building or a room where something's caught fire?

541
00:59:51,410 --> 01:00:00,830
Me. Just me. Okay. In California, especially in particular, wildfires are becoming more pervasive with droughts and so on.

542
01:00:01,730 --> 01:00:05,209
Many people don't actually evacuate, but now.

543
01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:06,370
So it's more common that they do.

544
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:15,590
So if you remember, like a couple of years ago in in paradise in California, in northern California, a huge fire that devastated that community.

545
01:00:15,590 --> 01:00:18,570
Napa had one. San Diego had one.

546
01:00:18,590 --> 01:00:29,780
L.A. had one where like very large swaths of property got essentially burned down, like very nice houses in the hills in particular.

547
01:00:30,590 --> 01:00:36,080
So that's definitely something that people take into account now, like where your property is and how it's insured.

548
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:41,690
How many of you had a chance to use an extinguisher before?

549
01:00:42,770 --> 01:00:49,280
Yeah. Cooking. I know it was a part of training at a nursing home I used to work at.

550
01:00:49,310 --> 01:00:52,790
Oh, yeah. Okay. Did you? But you never had to use it.

551
01:00:52,970 --> 01:00:57,170
Not in, like, a real life experience. Just like training.

552
01:00:57,380 --> 01:01:03,980
That's good. That's good. Um, I do have an ABC class extinguisher in my home.

553
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:12,680
I've not used it before. Would you like to hear the story about how I caught my mom's house on fire?

554
01:01:13,310 --> 01:01:18,650
Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so maybe there's this anecdote, and then.

555
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:26,400
Then and then we'll see how far we get. So a lot less.

556
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:32,150
I was 19. Okay. So I was an adult, but my brain was not fully formed yet.

557
01:01:32,540 --> 01:01:36,049
So I had just finished final exams.

558
01:01:36,050 --> 01:01:38,600
It was you can you go? Quarters is still very intense.

559
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:47,540
I'd been up since 6 a.m. in the morning and I was flying home to Sacramento, but I wasn't landing until like midnight.

560
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:57,710
Okay. My parents are divorced, so my dad is the one that generally comes picks me up from the airport land at the airport, waiting at baggage claim.

561
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:03,450
Waiting. Waiting, waiting. Only one out of two of my luggage came.

562
01:02:03,450 --> 01:02:13,020
One was very heavy and one was not. And the heavy one was just full of, like, old textbooks and, like, all of my underwear.

563
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:18,910
Really? Right. So don't do that. But so then I had to make a claim with Southwest.

564
01:02:19,350 --> 01:02:25,470
And then by the time my dad dropped me off at home, at my mom's house, it's like 2 a.m.

565
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:34,890
My mom has gone to vacation to go see her family in Germany, where my mom's side of the family lives.

566
01:02:35,190 --> 01:02:38,570
She has not seen her family in ten years.

567
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:43,050
I knew she was going on vacation. This is the first time she's seeing her family in ten years.

568
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:52,139
She knew I was. I just wanted to come back for a break. This is when I actually liked coming back, so she knew I would be home alone again.

569
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:56,030
I'm 19 again.

570
01:02:56,040 --> 01:03:01,020
First time. She's very hard working woman seeing her family for the first time in a decade.

571
01:03:01,530 --> 01:03:06,480
My dad dropped me off 2 a.m. I'm very tired. I open the fridge.

572
01:03:06,510 --> 01:03:11,250
Oh, wow. You ever see anything to eat? But I'm very hungry.

573
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:16,050
So I was like, Oh, I'll make French fries.

574
01:03:16,590 --> 01:03:20,820
Generally, how I made French fries in the past, I would bake them.

575
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:30,900
I was an I was hungry. A Kaz and a Hari started heating up a small pan of oil on the stove.

576
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:43,890
In my disoriented state. Go to my room to start unpacking that luggage that I still had and assessing what I had actually lost.

577
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:48,780
Hear the smoke alarm go off, run into the kitchen.

578
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:57,060
Oh, beep. Literally the whole stove and the cabinet above it is on fire.

579
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:01,470
What are you not supposed to do to put out a grease fire?

580
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:07,760
One. I panicked.

581
01:04:07,850 --> 01:04:11,070
Okay, I, I.

582
01:04:11,510 --> 01:04:14,899
I think I grabbed, like, a blanket that was nearby.

583
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:24,140
Or, like, a tablecloth. Definitely use water, put out the fire, or put out the whole last fire.

584
01:04:25,060 --> 01:04:30,670
Com. I'm on one fire department, literally lives on the next block.

585
01:04:30,670 --> 01:04:34,210
It's like literally behind my mom's house, like in the backyard.

586
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:43,930
Come into the house. They don't even put on the sirens cause it's like a block and it's like three in the morning at that point,

587
01:04:44,290 --> 01:04:47,650
like six firemen traipse through the my mom's house.

588
01:04:48,070 --> 01:04:51,460
They were like, Where's the fire? And that was like, I put it out.

589
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:56,229
They were like, Why did you call us? But I don't in a panic.

590
01:04:56,230 --> 01:05:01,100
Okay. And so they were like, all right, like, how old are you?

591
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:04,150
Like, and I'm like 15 or something. 19.

592
01:05:04,420 --> 01:05:09,940
They bring in their utility sized fans to fan out the house.

593
01:05:11,510 --> 01:05:20,120
Of the smoke. I at this point do not realize, like my face is like covered in soot and I'm just like a mess.

594
01:05:20,390 --> 01:05:24,480
And I realize I had, like, a second degree burn on my thumb.

595
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:29,780
It wasn't. I mean, eventually, like, blistered, and then it popped and they were like, your thumb.

596
01:05:30,290 --> 01:05:33,620
Do you want to go on? Do you want to go to the E.R.?

597
01:05:33,950 --> 01:05:40,069
And I was like, How much is this going to cost me? And they said, probably $8,000 before insurance.

598
01:05:40,070 --> 01:05:43,280
And I was like, No. So I'll give me the waiver, I'll sign the waiver.

599
01:05:43,610 --> 01:05:44,930
And so they leave.

600
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:53,480
And if any of you have gathered anything about me now from this past, you know, eight weeks that we spent together, I am not a chill person.

601
01:05:53,780 --> 01:05:58,430
I'm an anxious person. And I generally like to be very organized and I'm a responsible child.

602
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:03,050
So that point I call my dad for him.

603
01:06:03,050 --> 01:06:06,110
Now, my dad said mom's house a fire.

604
01:06:06,110 --> 01:06:09,499
And he was like, Is the fire out? And I was like, Yeah.

605
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:14,180
And he was like, okay, I'll come by in the morning because they don't talk to each other.

606
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:21,230
They like purposely avoid each other. So he is not step foot in this house in like, you know, six years or whatever.

607
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:27,950
So I spent the rest of the night Lysol wiping the the windows, the doors, because they're covered in soot.

608
01:06:28,940 --> 01:06:39,290
And then I finally sit down and I opened this lovely, detailed note that my mom left me, you know, you know, again, I'm 19, but I'm the youngest.

609
01:06:39,290 --> 01:06:42,800
I'm the baby. So it's like never open the door for a stranger.

610
01:06:42,950 --> 01:06:47,810
Right? Don't. Don't answer the door to strangers. Here's some grocery money.

611
01:06:50,610 --> 01:06:56,330
I just rented a rug doctor and shampooed the entire carpet before you came on.

612
01:06:56,910 --> 01:06:59,969
Yeah. So the floor was, like, immaculate.

613
01:06:59,970 --> 01:07:04,920
And then not only is it now covered in sweat, like firefighters had, like, walked in there with their shoes on.

614
01:07:05,550 --> 01:07:14,990
And the last thing that she wrote was, if you're cooking something, never for a sack, you leave it unattended on the stove.

615
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:20,610
And I was like, yeah, the Asian child guilt.

616
01:07:20,610 --> 01:07:25,140
And then this was a time when I had to call my mom using a calling card.

617
01:07:25,350 --> 01:07:30,060
You know, one of those she wanted to cancel her trip and come back.

618
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:37,050
And my sister was like, my older sister was very no nonsense. She was like, Calm the f down, it's fine.

619
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:42,330
Stay in your trip. And I was like, yes, they are, you know, like I'm part of something.

620
01:07:42,930 --> 01:07:48,180
And then my dad came and repainted the cabinets, not in a good way.

621
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:52,050
And to this day in my mom's house, the kitchen is two different colors.

622
01:07:53,550 --> 01:07:57,240
So that is my kind of house on fire story.

623
01:07:58,790 --> 01:08:03,830
It was very scary. I did all the things you're not supposed to do. Agrees Fire out with water.

624
01:08:04,370 --> 01:08:13,430
Thank God the smoke detectors actually worked. Because I know so many people who when the battery beeps and it annoys you, what do you do?

625
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:19,220
Take the battery. Yeah. You don't replace it. So many people die.

626
01:08:19,490 --> 01:08:24,680
I could have got that whole house on fire. And the next two houses were very close.

627
01:08:25,430 --> 01:08:28,520
Very close. So I got very lucky.

628
01:08:29,150 --> 01:08:37,010
So don't be a dummy like me in that case and keep an ABC extinguisher present.

629
01:08:38,090 --> 01:08:42,200
There was an extinguisher. I did not think to use it. Because I was not.

630
01:08:43,260 --> 01:08:47,120
It wasn't my instinct. They also do have two different types of fire extinguishers.

631
01:08:47,130 --> 01:08:52,980
Yes. One for the kitchen and one for everything else. Yes. Because the kitchen, one in particular will get oils.

632
01:08:53,850 --> 01:08:59,020
Mm hmm. And then you're supposed to pull the pin, sweep and pass.

633
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:05,490
You don't aim it directly. You do a sweep and pass. You live and you learn.

634
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:15,720
Okay. As a fire story, I think I will stop there today because my tummy is round right now.

635
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:23,190
But we will continue on Thursday with vaccines and vaccine preventable diseases and hopefully by then.

636
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:33,100
I will be okay. This is what I get for trying a new sushi place to Megami sushi on Plymouth Road.

637
01:09:34,210 --> 01:09:40,390
Calling it out. Okay. Thank you, everybody.
