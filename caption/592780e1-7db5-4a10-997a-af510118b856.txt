1
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:06,270
Okay. So we'll go ahead and get started.

2
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:12,140
Welcome back. Everything okay?

3
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,510
Last week with a zoom zoom presentation.

4
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,520
Okay. Yeah. Thanks for your flexibility.

5
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,410
And moving to Zoom, that just worked out a little bit easier since I wasn't here.

6
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,610
So I'm happy to be back.

7
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,600
I'll be back today and then you won't see me again.

8
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,429
We won't be we won't meet next week because of Thanksgiving.

9
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,829
And then the following week I'll be in Israel.

10
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:48,240
And so Dr. Penny PEREIRA will be here to moderate the class for the four lightning talks that were going on that day.

11
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,129
And then we have just one or two more classes after that.

12
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:56,150
So we're getting pretty close to the end of the semester.

13
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,800
How's everybody hanging in there? Lots of exams and assignments, lots of due dates.

14
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:09,330
I know I'm feeling the the crunch this week. It's doesn't feel like it's a holiday at all because it's just so many deadlines.

15
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:16,710
But hang in there. We're getting close to finishing. We have four people going today.

16
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:23,070
We have Amber, we have Hailey, we have Jen and we have Savannah giving talks.

17
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:28,260
So I'll just turn it over to them. I don't know who wants to go first.

18
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,500
Yeah, I think about it. You started on the phone.

19
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:38,010
See, I see your point fidgeting over there under the table, which I totally get.

20
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:43,950
I do all the time. I pulled up everybody's talks, so I did.

21
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:52,500
So James is here and then Savannah, Haley and Amber are up here.

22
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,630
Okay, so I don't know who wants to go first.

23
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:06,700
Yeah. All right. I'm not sure.

24
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,950
Oh, no. It's like, oh.

25
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:20,100
I'm sitting here, like, thinking. You guys are seeing the projector and.

26
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,160
Yeah, there we go. Great.

27
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:30,260
You keep time, right? What's that? You keep time, right? Yeah.

28
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:33,470
Do you want me to just, like, raise my hand in your hand for a minute? Yes.

29
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:42,110
Okay. Yeah. Great.

30
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:51,969
Hi, everyone. My name's Haley Jenkins. I'm a first year Ph.D. in IHS, and today I'm going to be talking about my first research rotation project,

31
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:58,210
which is examining prenatal glyphosate exposure and childhood cognitive outcomes in a Puerto Rican cohort.

32
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:02,950
So I'll just briefly give you some information on the cohort and data collection process.

33
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,770
Talk a little bit about my project and my hypotheses and then very briefly review my analysis plan.

34
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:18,580
So for the cohort, I work with the Puerto Rico test site for Environmental Contamination Threats Project.

35
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,970
This is a really busy slide, but just kind of wanted to give you a background.

36
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:28,030
So these white arrows down here are kind of like the source to outcome flow.

37
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:35,409
So we have our Superfund sites, which are areas of serious environmental contamination, which goes to the groundwater,

38
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:41,080
which makes it to the tap water, goes to our participants, and then we have our observed birth outcomes.

39
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:45,730
These red arrows here show that we collect samples at every point,

40
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:50,129
both biological and environmental samples, and then the one through four at the top,

41
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:58,330
where the different research projects that are within this cohort umbrella and my lab is in Project one, which is environmental epidemiology.

42
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:05,679
So for data collection, our pregnant women come in up to three times during their pregnancy and we collect blood

43
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,760
and urine samples as well as some health and and health and demographic information.

44
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,930
Once their babies are born, they go into the secondary cohort called Crazy.

45
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:18,190
And then we monitor their growth and development throughout their childhood.

46
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,610
So why Puerto Rico?

47
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:31,749
So they have the highest rates of adverse birth outcomes in the US, very high rates of poverty and a very long history of environmental contamination.

48
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,000
And I don't know if you know what Superfund sites are,

49
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,930
but basically just places with serious environmental contamination and they have a high concentration of these.

50
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:50,230
So this is all kind of a recipe for serious environmental injustice and we're trying to help alleviate that burden.

51
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:56,530
So my project, like I said, I'm looking at glyphosate exposure and pregnancy and cognitive outcomes in children.

52
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:03,250
So my exposure, glyphosate, we measure that in biomarkers in those urine samples that we collected from the pregnant women.

53
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:12,969
The outcome is from what's called the Battelle Development Index body that measures child growth and development from birth to age eight.

54
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:18,370
And I'm specifically looking at the cognitive scores. A little background on glyphosate.

55
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:24,070
For those of you that don't know, it is the most commonly used agricultural chemical worldwide.

56
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:28,760
IT roundup is probably the most common one.

57
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,559
People are exposed occupationally a non occupationally.

58
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:39,430
For those that are exposed, occupationally tends to be the inhalation and dermal non occupational exposures are often ingestion,

59
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:45,130
has a really short half life in the human body, but it can persist in soil and crops for up to three years.

60
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:50,229
And NHANES has found 80% of the US population has glyphosate in their urine.

61
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:55,420
So it's very prominent in our population in this country and probably worldwide.

62
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:06,430
As far as safety goes, there's a lot of mixed info. The EPA says that it's safe, not carcinogenic, IARC says it is probably carcinogenic.

63
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:10,180
And then the European Food and Safety Administration agrees with the EPA.

64
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:18,610
So all this mixed information is kind of related to the lack of data in humans especially.

65
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:26,020
But it's also important to note that carcinogenicity is not the only important health outcome, and that's why I'm looking at cognition.

66
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,510
So in the research,

67
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:37,030
there is a lot of there have been a lot of animal models that show different mechanisms and how glyphosate exposure can impact learning and memory.

68
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:41,769
But one that has a lot of evidence is through this pathway.

69
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:50,379
So glyphosate ingestion leads to the degeneration of dopamine neurons and opening is really important in learning and memory.

70
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:56,770
So that's kind of one one thing that supports my hypothesis and these are my hypotheses.

71
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:04,330
So one, children whose mothers have high glyphosate urinary concentrations in pregnancy will have lower cognitive scores,

72
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,250
and also that the cognitive scores at each time point will be correlated.

73
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:18,489
And very briefly, because I don't have any data because I just started this like a month ago, my plan is to do some mixed modeling.

74
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:27,069
So this is an auto regressive model. So not only am I looking at glyphosate exposure in relation to each by cognitive score,

75
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:39,040
but I also am going to be looking to see if the scores over time, if preceding time points can help predict future scores and.

76
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:48,149
So far, a preliminary, preliminary kind of exploratory analysis is showing that there's probably going to be an association,

77
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:54,170
but my fingers are really crossed that they're not because we all have this in our bodies.

78
00:07:54,180 --> 00:08:01,559
So I'm hoping for a null findings, which I don't know if anyone has ever said that in history, but that is that.

79
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:07,350
Sorry, I know it was really fast, but there's a lot of information to get out in a very short period of time,

80
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:20,319
so I'm happy to take any questions you might have. What are the different beady eye cognitive scores like?

81
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:27,250
Is that a survey based? Yeah. So there are, I think, five domains.

82
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:31,840
Cognition is one of those. And then I think there are three sub domains.

83
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:41,409
I don't remember what all of them are, but yeah, there are just like there's one that is just like straight intellectual functioning,

84
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:50,010
like memory, recall, ability to retain information and a couple of other ones and they kind of build on each other.

85
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:59,379
So if you there, they're like set ages for each, each measure that you would use.

86
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:02,950
And then you kind of go as they age, you're evaluating different things.

87
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:09,900
Yeah. Your your research is going to be in Puerto Rico.

88
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:20,430
And how are you going to assess or are all the permissions that you have because you're going to have the samples from humans?

89
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:28,010
Yeah, I got permission is to sing for Darien, Puerto Rico or here or how are you going to track it down?

90
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:31,919
That's a good question. So this is secondary data analysis.

91
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,389
I'm not. So it's a Superfund funded project.

92
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:44,219
So the EPA has this site and has delegated a bunch of money to this project.

93
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:49,500
And then I'm several times removed from the actual data collection.

94
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,250
I just have the data and I'm analyzing it.

95
00:09:53,610 --> 00:10:02,730
So I don't know the specifics, but because Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory, I'm guessing like everything is is the same.

96
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,770
That's a good question.

97
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:15,720
So the question I'm curious if you're able to even like secure the total controls for the study because you mentioned some of us are some exposed,

98
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:21,690
like is there a possibility that you could convert to something that isn't expensive at all and see if there's any,

99
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:25,200
I guess, like positive associations with the environment?

100
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:32,640
Or is it mostly just like a creative analysis of higher exposure equals higher as it is more of a graded exposure?

101
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:46,230
Yeah, it's a really good question. I don't think that any I think that all of the people that we have data for have been exposed in this cohort.

102
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:52,440
So I don't even think that would be possible. But that is another limitation though too,

103
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:58,440
that because glyphosate has such a short half life and people are only giving us measures up to three

104
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:05,639
times that we we really can't even be sure of what their exposure is over the course of their pregnancy,

105
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,570
because we would just hope that hope that it's consistent.

106
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:15,780
But if it's a 15 hour half life, then, you know, they might have low levels on the day we see them.

107
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:20,280
But maybe because of seasonality like their entire first trimester, they were really highly exposed.

108
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:24,659
But we're not capturing that. So but yeah, that's that's a good question.

109
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:34,230
And I think for future research, people with a cohort that maybe has a wider variety of exposures, that would be a good thing to look at.

110
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:49,890
Anybody know anybody established how they've been quite busy interferes with don't mean all that I can find I'm a manager.

111
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:53,510
I guess it was dopaminergic neurons. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

112
00:11:54,380 --> 00:12:01,280
Just it I. I'm not a neuroscientist so it was the literature is really dense.

113
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:09,890
I can pour in on any of these articles, anyone who's interested but the I just that it caused degeneration of the neurons and so

114
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:15,290
they're not producing as much dopamine or the neurons aren't as sensitive to the dopamine.

115
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:23,380
And it's just like kind of a chain reaction inhibiting, um, recall and memory and that sort of thing.

116
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:30,260
Yeah. Yeah, that's interesting. And in the what they think, like the controls, it's like, it's like p fast.

117
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:33,590
We can't find anybody on the planet. Yeah.

118
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:43,160
And yeah. So just kind of looking at levels I guess like are you you have low exposure versus high exposure cancellation.

119
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:48,270
Yeah. Yeah. You know, it's.

120
00:12:51,680 --> 00:13:04,280
Who thinks. Yeah.

121
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:17,429
Yeah. Okay.

122
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:21,980
I have one. I'm simply I'm a second year Ph.D. student address.

123
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:27,590
Today, I'm going to talk about the Depression surveillance based on wastewater monitoring.

124
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:32,450
So wastewater is not totally useless.

125
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,910
Actually, by monitoring a variety of biomarkers, we can do a lot of things.

126
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,660
For example, we can estimate the population size.

127
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:47,420
We can monitor the chemical exposure, the infectious diseases.

128
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:56,300
We can monitor the health status, use of drugs, house behaviors, and the spread of antibiotic resistance.

129
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:06,290
And my project will be related to the monitoring of how mental health status and the use of antidepressants.

130
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:14,240
So why do we need to conduct wastewater monitoring for depression surveillance?

131
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:23,060
Traditionally, if you don't, you want to know about the mental health status of a certain community.

132
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:30,110
You may do self-report services or interview, but there are some drawbacks.

133
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:35,990
For example, the low, responsible rates of a variety of biases.

134
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:40,459
It's it's not real time. It's expensive.

135
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:43,640
And some but it may worry about privacy issues.

136
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:50,540
But wastewater surveillance can basically overcome all this drawbacks by nature.

137
00:14:50,540 --> 00:15:01,750
Because if one bottle of wastewater can represent the situation of whole sewer [INAUDIBLE], so it's it can provide objective data.

138
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,230
It's real time. It's cheap, and that's hopefully anonymous.

139
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:14,940
So although despite of all this advantages, there are still some research gaps.

140
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:23,460
So first one is a lack of method and practice to back calculate the use of drugs and the depression prevalence.

141
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:31,920
The second is lack of high resolution sampling, which means we took a wastewater at building levels.

142
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:37,680
And finally, previous study ignore the use of psychotropic substances.

143
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:43,650
Although these substances are reported to be related to the development of depression.

144
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:57,490
So my goal is to fill all this research gaps by first monitoring the use of substances and the antidepressant at a building level,

145
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:07,090
and second, linking the use of psychotropic substances and the antidepressants to the real clinical depression cases.

146
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:16,450
And here's my framework. So when somebody get depressed in the community,

147
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:25,540
he or she may are more likely to use all the substances and the antidepressant to cope with his or her symptoms.

148
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:35,050
And then after a series of metabolism, the metabolites will be discharged into the wastewater system.

149
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:45,310
And what I will do is to collect the wastewater, extract the metabolites, quantify them, quantify the concentration, and then back, back,

150
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:46,480
calculate the use,

151
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:57,130
the use of all the substances and drugs and compare the wastewater data with the clinical data so that finally we can build up a model.

152
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:08,920
And in that model, we can use the concentration of metabolites in wastewater to indicate the prevalence of depression in the target community.

153
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:18,760
And so far, I'm working on validation of the methods and the collection of clinical data.

154
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:26,200
And some studies show that the search trend all I can also indicate the prevalence of depression.

155
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,590
So I may want to include that data as well.

156
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:39,130
Once I get those two parts, then the next step will be the analysis of real wastewater sample.

157
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:55,540
And then build up the studies modeled so that we can link the wastewater data to real clinic data and we can compare which one is a better method.

158
00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:01,300
The with the survey method or the wastewater based monitoring.

159
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:10,090
And thanks for listening. I would like to take any questions.

160
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:16,780
Yep. So can you talk a little bit about the scale of the data that you're using?

161
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:26,420
Like, how extensive are, you know, how much are you trying to generate and how much with the clinical data that you're trying to match, like.

162
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:30,820
Yeah. Just a little bit about like the sample size, the size of the datasets.

163
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:38,950
Yeah. So for wastewater samples so far in our lab, you may have heard about like always monitoring the culvert.

164
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:50,190
So we basically collect a wastewater sample every day from the the residential house and around our campus.

165
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:54,250
So so far we have 4000 was water sample.

166
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,780
So I hope we can at least use 1000 of them.

167
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:08,440
Mm hmm. And we also have some sample from another wastewater treatment plant, so that sample will represent more people.

168
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:17,230
So basically, I don't know whether it will cover all people living in Ann Arbor, but most people are living in Ann Arbor.

169
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:21,760
And we we hope to get that data as well.

170
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:28,899
So we can compare like we would have type of sampling is better the the wastewater

171
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:33,670
sample or the wastewater treatment sample or the the building level sample.

172
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:40,360
So basically, you know, maybe once out of 500 sampled in the end.

173
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:46,330
And then I'm guessing each of those samples will generate like a ton of data just based on what's in those samples.

174
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:54,550
Yeah, we I'm target. I have basically six targets.

175
00:19:54,760 --> 00:20:02,940
Pablo's easy to measure so that will be if if that works mostly that would be a yeah.

176
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:09,880
Yeah. But we will see. We're currently collaborating with the School of Chemistry.

177
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:17,350
And so the analysis, the how the analysis go would depend on how far they work.

178
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,400
So, yeah, that's the hardest part. Great job.

179
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:25,450
Really great presentation. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. Great job.

180
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:32,860
And I had a similar question just about like the scale at which you're connecting the two different types of data.

181
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:40,989
Like the are you getting like addresses or like what building or what level of data are you getting from the clinics?

182
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:49,900
And then like the point of connection, is it are you getting looking at like certain regions or with the building data from the clinics,

183
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:53,890
are they telling you that rates of depression like in a specific residence hall?

184
00:20:54,610 --> 00:21:04,030
Yeah. And so we're trying to collect the clinic data from the mental health services in our campus,

185
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:13,870
but we are not sure whether they will include the rhythm with which residence hall the students are living that kind of information.

186
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:25,299
But we can't. What we can, we are where we are sure about is like those are students living on our campus.

187
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:33,190
So if if they if they have the residence hall, the information, we can use that.

188
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:40,360
But if not, we can just use a building that will sample to represent the whole campus because we're basically

189
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:46,240
like took sample but everywhere on campus so that would be for present still representative.

190
00:21:49,360 --> 00:22:02,680
It's like indiscriminate question, but how can you distinguish between the multiple users of use versus having users?

191
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:07,950
I mean, a few of us have. Yeah, we do.

192
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:17,980
We will do the normalization. So in wastewater, we will measure some something that is called biomarker of urine.

193
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:28,090
So by a measure that we can basically cover, like how many people was contribute, contribute to the sample.

194
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:35,680
So we do the normalization to see like, yeah, yeah, that will be, that will solve this, that problem.

195
00:22:42,980 --> 00:23:02,240
Yeah. Thank you. You. Oh, no.

196
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:08,150
Okay. Laurie and I pull this up.

197
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:22,229
Yeah. Oh, that. This is. So my name is Amber Cyclin, and I'm going to present to you on what I'm working on for my master's thesis,

198
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:30,060
which I have titled Investigating the Developmental Effects of PFOA on Human Derived STEM Cell, Pluripotency and Proliferation.

199
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:44,640
So just a background. Congenital heart disease is the most common birth defect, and it's affected 40,000 births in the U.S. every year.

200
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:51,209
Cardiac development relies heavily on epigenetic programing, such as DNA,

201
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:57,960
methylation and demethylation and it's the earliest one of the earliest organs formed during embryogenesis.

202
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:09,180
And biological sex plays a very large role in cardiac physiology impacting the development and outcomes of cardiovascular diseases.

203
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:16,200
So we've all heard a lot about us.

204
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:26,010
I'm not going to try to bore you guys, but PUS is a family of persistent organic pollutants characterized by their

205
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:31,080
inability to degrade in the environment and they accumulate in the human body.

206
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:38,880
So I'm sure we've all heard the statistic that 90% of humans, 98% of Americans have pee force in their blood.

207
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:44,340
And they're also linked to a vast array of health outcomes, including low birth weight,

208
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:51,900
immune effects and reproductive effects, alongside many, many different, many more.

209
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:59,910
I focus specifically on PFOA, so that's perfluorooctanoic phonic acid.

210
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:04,430
The structure is right above there. It's a C8 legacy chemical.

211
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:13,770
I'm sure you guys have heard of PFOA as well. And it is one such compound that is found been found to affect DNA methylation in Europe utero.

212
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:21,840
So my research question for my master's thesis is how does PFOA exposure during Early

213
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:28,380
Embryogenesis impact the proliferation of stem cells and the differentiation into cardiomyocytes?

214
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,510
So here are my methods laid out.

215
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:45,930
So we start out with a human derived induced pluripotent stem cells, which we place to a monolayer, which is a single cell layer on a plate.

216
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:55,290
These are then seeded on to 24 well plates and I have two aims to my thesis, so I have to experience experiments running out of time.

217
00:25:56,190 --> 00:26:08,890
The first would be ipsc experiments where I expose the the stem cells to DMSO five micro molar, 50 micro molar and 100 micro molar for us.

218
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:18,490
And that's a 72 hour acute exposure. And then we visualize that these wells in what's called an ink site.

219
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:30,000
So this is a it's like a it takes the picture of the cells as they proliferate and I collect them for genetic material.

220
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:41,280
And I also do a differentiation experiment where the plated ipsc is undergo small molecule differentiation into cardiomyocytes.

221
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:48,750
It's a six day long exposure, but it's an eight day long differentiation into cardiomyocytes.

222
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:56,730
These cardiomyocytes are then purified to remove any non cardiomyocytes and then collected for genetic material.

223
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:04,300
So I don't have any definitive results to show you guys right now.

224
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:12,130
But my plans are to use those cells I have collected for genetic material for a cure PCR analysis.

225
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:20,290
I want an analysis analyzed for pluripotency and partial proliferation genes in Ipscs,

226
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:32,950
which I plan to look at socks to NANOG and what more asked for as well as the DNA methylation machinery.

227
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:43,450
And I'm also potentially interested in looking at gene expression of different genes expressed in early committed cardiomyocytes.

228
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:46,630
So those are the cardiomyocytes that are newly formed.

229
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,559
And I'm also utilizing INC site software,

230
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:58,930
which is the live cell imaging I discussed earlier to analyze proliferation of the ipscs over that 72 hour long exposure.

231
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:07,509
So my my hope is that this future this research could describe a new mechanism in

232
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:13,150
which pif flask exposure impacts developing cardiovascular system early in life.

233
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:23,390
And that's my fish. His name's Theodore.

234
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:33,649
So anyone have any questions? I'm sure the best.

235
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:36,710
Free water. Yeah. Water? Yeah.

236
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:41,260
There's lots of studies that are done on the fish. Oh, no.

237
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:47,540
Yeah, he doesn't have any problems. Water? Well, he probably does, actually, what he does.

238
00:28:52,940 --> 00:29:07,810
So what? And. How many are there studies linking cardiovascular or congenital heart defects to keep us exposed?

239
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:10,420
Yes, but it's a different mechanism.

240
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:21,760
The mechanism that has been described involves like modulation of cholesterol, which impacts inflammation in the heart.

241
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:29,580
But otherwise our our schematic is new. Yeah.

242
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:34,260
You mentioned at the end that your main. Do you mind going back? Yeah, absolutely.

243
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:41,040
That your this research could describe any mechanism. Can you talk a little bit more about, like, the early life part of that?

244
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:46,440
Yeah. So DNA. So I'm sure we've all heard of epigenetics.

245
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:56,880
And epigenetics is essentially is the way that a cell can control genetic sort of genetic expression without actually modulating the gene itself.

246
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:03,810
And that plays a huge role in how proteins are expressed very, very early in life.

247
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:13,649
And those small molecule proteins, small molecules and enzymes expressed early in life can affect how the cell,

248
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:24,300
the stem cell that we are formed really early on actually pushed through like a like a line and become the cell that they need to become.

249
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:35,740
Is that does that make sense? Yeah. Are there any plans to do this also in Nice or just in the.

250
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:44,500
And what is the benefit of just doing so? So since it's my master's thesis, it will have to just be in the cell line.

251
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:54,940
I wouldn't know. It's okay. Well, that's kind of the benefit, though, is because my like, my my mouse experiment will take a really long time.

252
00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:02,440
And the cells, we just have the cell sitting around. And so they're ready to get poisoned whenever we don't.

253
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:06,760
We have to wait for, like, IRP approval and things like that for the mice.

254
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:12,570
Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. That's very interesting.

255
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:20,170
And also the stem cells, I only expose them for 72 hours when I'm looking at proliferation.

256
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:27,249
So that's three days. And then the cardiomyocytes directed differentiation, like I said, lasts eight days.

257
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:32,740
And it's from the time we get we have an ipsc to the time we have a cardiomyocytes.

258
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:37,390
It takes about 15 to like a beat in Cardiomyocytes. I mean, it takes about 15 days.

259
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:47,910
We would never be able to have those kinds of results with mice. The concentrations that you're going to be poisoning yourselves with.

260
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:58,170
How does this relate to the current regulations? So I chose my concentrations based off of what is relevant in humans.

261
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:09,870
So I between the five and the 50 micro molar, that's about where human beings are exposed on a like a normal basis.

262
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:16,830
Regulation wise, we are only allowed what so many parts per trillion.

263
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:26,460
PFOA is in our waterways and I don't really I don't know how to transcribe that to like how how much PFOA is in our blood per se.

264
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:33,770
But this is related to like what people are exposed to normal.

265
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,780
It's mostly like people who work around people a lot.

266
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:42,810
This is more like occupational exposure is around 17 to 20, like a molar.

267
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:48,990
Is that how much the mom is exposed to or the fetus?

268
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:52,320
Is there a difference? Does that make sense?

269
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:56,790
Yeah. Well, PFOA does cross the the blood placental barrier,

270
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:05,910
so I'd imagine that that the fetus would be exposed to the same thing as iteration the mother is exposed to, especially long term.

271
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:18,170
Yeah. Yeah.

272
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:27,750
Think that means love the fish.

273
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:48,309
Okay. Fly everyone. I'm Savannah,

274
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:52,990
Starla and today I'm going to be talking about my research on urinary carbon and phenol

275
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:58,479
concentrations associated with markers of inflammation among pregnant women in Puerto Rico,

276
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,720
also using the protect cohort that Hailey described.

277
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:08,410
So exposure to a phenols impairment is pretty widespread in the US population.

278
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:12,280
People are exposed through different things like personal care products,

279
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:19,030
food packaging, personal care, product and plastics and pharmaceuticals as well.

280
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:28,360
Sorry. Oh please. And then phenols impairments are suspected to interfere with hormone receptors and induce oxidative stress and inflammation.

281
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:35,560
And then inflammation during pregnancy has been linked to adverse birth outcomes like preterm birth and pre-eclampsia,

282
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:43,870
which is hypertension during pregnancy. And these may affect the programing of fetal immune metabolic and neurological systems as well.

283
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:51,729
We've also found racial and ethnic disparities in previous literature and these exposures.

284
00:34:51,730 --> 00:35:00,760
So these might be important contributors and for disparities, but their impact isn't fully understood and these pathways aren't fully understood.

285
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:06,310
But our hypothesis is that these exposures will contribute to imbalances and inflammation.

286
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:15,459
So my sample uses 579 pregnant women and I'm only looking at exposures in visit one of Visit three since we

287
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:25,480
don't collect urinary sap or blood samples that visit to and that's up 16 to 20 and 24 to 28 weeks gestation.

288
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:36,340
Most of our participants live in this northern region of Puerto Rico, and I'm looking at seven phenols, two parents and seven inflammation markers.

289
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,939
So I used this.

290
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:50,080
These results are from a linear, mixed effects model, adjusted for specific poverty, age, maternal education and maternal pre-pregnancy BMI.

291
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:59,559
And for anyone who's not familiar with looking at this type of figure, basically the confidence interval bars don't cross the dashed line at zero.

292
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:02,200
That indicates that that association is significant.

293
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:10,030
And overall, to go for this and briefly and this is kind of like a difficult figure to look at in a presentation,

294
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:16,419
but we found negative associations with inflammation markers and benzocaine benzophenone three,

295
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:24,069
which is that BP three BPA to five di coral female to four di coral phenotype,

296
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:33,250
blue carbon and triclosan all had significant negative associations and we found significant positive associations with BPA.

297
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:36,190
Methyl paraben and this. Phenol this.

298
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:47,440
And then in these models, I'm looking at a linear mix effects model on the left and a multi variable linear regression on the right,

299
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:52,600
looking at effect modification by fetal sex and by study visit.

300
00:36:53,470 --> 00:37:03,880
So these show results from stratified models and I indicated significance of the interaction term with different shapes from non stratified models.

301
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:14,079
And we've found that fetal sex significantly modified only the effect of methyl paraben on MMP nine,

302
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:20,740
which is Matrix Italia protein is nine and the study was significantly modified.

303
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:36,490
The associations between MMP two and bisphenol A, MMP nine and BPA and MMP nine and checklist in conclusion mostly found that the cams,

304
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:44,440
which are the cellular adhesion molecules and the matrix material protein ACS were most significantly associated with the most exposures,

305
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:54,399
suggesting that these exposures might affect the regulation of uterine remodeling or endothelial dysfunction during pregnancy and inflammation.

306
00:37:54,400 --> 00:38:01,240
Susceptibility may also differ based on differences in hormone production or immune responses based on fetal sex,

307
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:07,240
or also the different inflammatory stages and processes that occur at the different trimesters.

308
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:14,620
So in general, we found both pro and anti-inflammatory effects, but more so anti-inflammatory effects.

309
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:22,930
But future studies could also look at effect modifiers like co exposure, such as phthalates or oxidative stress in addition to inflammation.

310
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:32,750
Thank you for listening. Any questions?

311
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:36,620
Were you surprised to see that so many of those seem to have?

312
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:40,940
If I understood that correctly. And the planetary properties?

313
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:47,750
Yes, not necessarily so, but is pretty consistent with what has been found in the literature.

314
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:57,560
You know, some parents have pro anti-inflammatory effects, but that doesn't necessarily indicate what like the large scale inflammatory responses,

315
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:05,930
though, like if someone's in like a hyper inflammatory state that we indicated by like these markers and other cytokines.

316
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:11,060
So what some of these markers might indicate with the negative relationships can

317
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:16,280
be something like regulatory immune cells are being downregulated or suppressed.

318
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:24,680
So then that could be like downstream mechanisms indicate more inflammation and so be harmful, like preeclampsia, for example.

319
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:32,030
They identify it by like heightened proinflammatory markers, like decreased regulatory immune cells.

320
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:43,730
So it's very complicated and I don't and it's not really clear what like these different markers role exactly is just because it's downregulated,

321
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:50,050
it could still be harmful. Very complicated.

322
00:39:52,090 --> 00:40:00,800
Is just asking for a fabrication. But what did you say was associated with what direction was the association with Matrix Intelligence Services?

323
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:10,910
I said generally it was negative, but there's overall it's like a mix depending on which exposure and marker.

324
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:18,600
Is that consistent with what you would expect based on your offices?

325
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:30,580
Yes and no? I think so. And then peas in particular are like protein anti-inflammatory markers.

326
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:43,330
So but it sure has like saying it in both directions and based on which like pathway it's affecting with also

327
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:50,860
depend on like what effect it has since they're involved in both like protein and anti-inflammatory pathways.

328
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:57,000
Yeah. Yeah.

329
00:40:57,050 --> 00:41:08,360
The Olympics are pro and I'm involved in pro anti-inflammatory responses and CRB is nonspecific and the cams are activated by proinflammatory markers.

330
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:20,840
Doesn't make sense to look at the mix of this particular class of chemical like working out.

331
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,930
Make sure. Thanks just for this class. Yeah.

332
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:31,850
I think it would make sense to look at how like the combined effects of all these different classes of phenols impairments.

333
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:36,890
I just haven't gotten to that stage. Yeah.

334
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:41,169
I also just happened to know I think someone else did a presentation on this,

335
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:47,870
but a lot of times when someone has all the facts and certain direction, the figures have the opposite effect.

336
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:51,909
And so I would be curious about your study if,

337
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:59,680
like when you saw all these anti-inflammatory effects of erection, because I don't know why that happens.

338
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,950
It just seems to be a trend for some reason. Probably so.

339
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:05,530
Was understanding is that. No, no. But um.

340
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:13,940
Yeah, I think I'm so conditioned at least to hear the it was like better, but I don't think that's always true.

341
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:20,050
Yeah, especially in pregnancy. That's a complicated. I was curious to know in other studies.

342
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,640
Yeah that would be really interesting.

343
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:31,959
Like I haven't looked at quick how it affects like downstream information about what's in the fetus, but that would be interesting to look at.

344
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:40,550
And like cord blood, for example. Yeah. I took a cardiovascular pharmacology class when I was in graduate school,

345
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:49,410
and we talked about and we had a whole section on some Cox inhibitors and, you know, inflammation and cardiovascular system.

346
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:53,990
And I remember my professor, he passed away.

347
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:58,940
He he was like he was million years old, I think.

348
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:04,730
And he's like, you need inflammation to have healing.

349
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:10,220
He was like banging on the table every single time I go to take and I frozen.

350
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:16,340
But I guess it just reminded me of the this whole idea that, you know,

351
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:24,770
we do have a bias that anti-inflammatories is better and it's not necessarily the case like for cancers,

352
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:28,969
for example, or in the cardiovascular system or, you know, immune repair.

353
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:33,200
Like you need some inflammation. And and the relationship is very complex.

354
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,260
It's not this binary sort of. Right.

355
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:44,929
Yeah, that's really interesting. And also thinking about pregnancy, it's been like a little bit since I reviewed this, but I think in my view,

356
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:50,839
it's second trimester is like recognized as like a inflammatory state depending

357
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:56,270
on like what's going on and the different processes and like tissue remodeling.

358
00:43:56,870 --> 00:44:05,930
So if it's like suppressing that necessary information to for those different things to occur physiologically, that could be pretty harmful.

359
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:09,890
Yeah. Well, it's not my area of expertise.

360
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:14,990
It's not really mine, but it's very good.

361
00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:18,830
Yeah, right.

362
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:26,510
Thank you. Okay.

363
00:44:27,850 --> 00:44:32,150
That that's all we have today. I just wanted to quickly say two things.

364
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:37,580
Number one, the answers are you at 11 5989 critical anybody submitted their idea?

365
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:44,000
And I mean I mean, any problems when you go to the European?

366
00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:48,030
Yeah, that's fine. That's my problem. But some of you have been able to submit.

367
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:52,460
Okay. I just about this is a very important actually.

368
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:56,240
I just want to make sure everybody is able to. You don't run into any major snafu.

369
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:06,200
Right. The second thing I just quickly wanted to say was Caitlin's talk last week of I will post that Zoom video to canvas.

370
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:12,650
I just thought I realized that it was on Zoom. And so I didn't back up to canvas automatically the way Panopto does.

371
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:16,860
But I will put that up there in case anybody who's interested. And that's all I have.

372
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:21,320
So have a great weekend and I will see you in a couple of weeks.

373
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:28,340
And happy Thanksgiving. LAVON Thank you. Seven days total.

374
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:32,330
It's like I leave on Saturday, and then I come back the following Saturday. Hundreds.

375
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:40,460
Yeah. Yeah. It's like a research collaboration between Michigan and a couple of universities in Israel.

376
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:45,499
I can't remember the specific Israeli is Israel, Technion University.

377
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:49,780
And then there's like the Weissman or something like that. So yeah.

378
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:52,440
Excited. My.
