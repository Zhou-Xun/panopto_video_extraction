1
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:08,720
You are right.

2
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:42,710
The. Right.

3
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:53,730
All right, everyone. They all get started here.

4
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,750
So hopefully you guys are all here for us at 522.

5
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:02,070
Some nods, happy faces, sad faces.

6
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:06,510
So this is statistical analysis for health related studies.

7
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,920
So I'm just going to today, I'm John Rice. I'm the instructor for the course.

8
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:20,160
Today, we're going to go over essentially the course, outline expectations and then get into the review, which is the first module of the course.

9
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,230
I'm hoping everybody has had a chance to at least look at the canvas site.

10
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:30,780
I don't know if you saw my announcement, but we're going to be primarily communicating through canvas.

11
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:37,110
So if there are announcements to be made, I need you guys to be checking on there because there's a lot of you.

12
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,320
So I need to be able to communicate with you all kind of uniformly.

13
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:47,400
So let me know if anybody has trouble accessing that or any other other questions you have as we go along here.

14
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:59,129
Okay. So so this course is essentially designed to introduce you to some data analysis methods that are required for health studies,

15
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:04,890
primarily regression methods. So we're going to look at linear regression and then we're gonna look at logistic regression.

16
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:14,909
And these are methods that you can use to determine effects of, for example, treatments on various outcomes.

17
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:21,120
So linear regression is for continuous outcomes and logistic regression is for binary outcomes.

18
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:25,950
So kind of yes or no disease present or absent things of that nature.

19
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:33,959
And we're going to really focus a lot on implementation of the models as well as interpretation,

20
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:39,330
because interpretation is is really key for any statistical analysis because you can run all the models you want,

21
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:44,460
but if you can't interpret the outcome, then it becomes sort of a futile exercise.

22
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:52,660
So the few the core competencies here, as I said, the interpretation is key here.

23
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,499
I'm talking about higher order bias, tactical techniques.

24
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:03,120
So this is stuff that's going beyond your your T tests and you're you're more basic kind of to sample proportion tests,

25
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,840
which a lot of you may have seen in the previous course in this this sequence.

26
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,760
So when we talk about multivariable linear regression, for example,

27
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:19,470
that's when we have a number of explanatory variables that we're going to use to try to predict or understand an outcome.

28
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:24,510
As I said, logistic regression is a similar technique for binary outcomes.

29
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,659
And then graphical techniques, which I'm sure you've seen a little bit of.

30
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:34,140
This includes diagnostic plotting and just scatter plotting of outcomes versus predictors.

31
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:39,990
And again, don't worry if some of these terms are unfamiliar, we're going to go through all of them in a lot more detail.

32
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,260
This is just kind of a preview of what we're going be doing.

33
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:51,240
So, as I said, analyzing the data and interpreting the results from population health or clinical translational perspectives,

34
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:55,170
because we always want to bring this back to why are we doing these studies right?

35
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,700
There's always a research question.

36
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:04,350
And one of your one of your goals in a statistical analysis is to translate that research question into statistical terms.

37
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:09,209
So that's one of the things that I think is the most important about this physical approach,

38
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:17,040
is this translation from research question to statistics, because there are a little bit different languages, I think.

39
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:25,140
Um, so. Just some tips on how to be successful in the course here.

40
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:33,060
Start early with homeworks because that gives you more chance to ask me or the GSEs for assistance.

41
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:36,990
So the format of this course is lecture based, but there's also a lab component.

42
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,190
Hopefully you've all been able to register for a lab section.

43
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:48,900
We'll go over the lab sections later in later today, and I'll explain who's who's going to be your GSI.

44
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:57,120
But they your lab sessions are going to be where you're going to go over some of the homeworks and do some example problems, things like that.

45
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:03,989
So pen and paper derivations, I understand, you know, math is is kind of intimidating in a lot of cases,

46
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:10,709
but there are a lot of times when that's going to be a really good way to understand what we're doing in class.

47
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,540
And we'll look at a few.

48
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:20,730
During lectures, we'll look at a few kind of pen and paper derivations, and by that it just means kind of algebraic manipulations, essentially.

49
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,809
So this can be a good way to to gain an understanding of what you're actually doing,

50
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:33,990
because it's important that you not only understand the the software, for example, but also understand the the theory.

51
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:36,510
A little bit of the theory behind this is not a theoretical course,

52
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:43,590
but I'm hoping that we can get a better understanding of some of the reasons that we use the formulas that we have,

53
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:51,360
because there are things like you'll see sometimes something like a square root of N and a denominator and where does that come from, right?

54
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:58,019
So so these are the things that I think it can be helpful to do to work through some of these derivations for of course,

55
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:01,860
the programing aspect is, is what's going to be a lot of your time,

56
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:12,209
I think in this course is is learning how to to actually run these analyzes because in statistical analysis, the way that it's done is,

57
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:19,170
is through computer programing languages such as SAS and R, which again, many of you may be familiar with from the previous course.

58
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,770
We're going to we're going to talk about SAS and are in this course.

59
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:32,280
But that's of course key because that's how we actually do the analysis that ends up becoming the results that we're going to interpret.

60
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:37,960
So proper terminology and simple explanations.

61
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:43,410
Right. So so terminology is really important in statistics and in the area of science, right?

62
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:48,990
Because there's a lot of technical aspects and you want to make sure you're using terms correctly.

63
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:55,889
So, for example, when we talk about statistical significance, right, we want to be careful about that term, the term significance,

64
00:06:55,890 --> 00:07:04,020
because it has a very specific meaning statistically that we want and it has to do with P values and hypothesis testing.

65
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:12,810
So we want to be careful with our use of terminology, but then this idea of simple explanations so we, we,

66
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:18,600
what we want to be able to is this translation between the research question and statistical analysis.

67
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:26,910
So you go one way when you when you get a research question from an investigator or your own research and you translate it into statistical terms,

68
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,139
then you have to go back the other way, right? When you run the analysis, you have your results.

69
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:42,000
You need to explain what you found in kind of the quote unquote simple, which means not overly technical, statistically terms.

70
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:48,180
So that's really important to communicate your your results to to a wider audience.

71
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:52,500
And then the textbook, of course, is going to be a great resource for you guys.

72
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:58,230
And if you see the syllabus, there's going to be specific chapters that you can go to for each of the lectures.

73
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:04,060
So your teaching team is instructors myself.

74
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,320
I'm in the bio State Department here at at Michigan School of Public Health.

75
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:16,330
Your GSEs are listed here. Primarily, you'll be communicating with the GSA for your lab section that we're going to go through.

76
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:20,470
But any of them should be a good resource for you.

77
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,460
If you have questions, of course, certainly free to ask me as well.

78
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:35,560
I'm going to emphasize that it would be great for just general subject matter questions if you could use the the canvas discussion boards.

79
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:41,200
So that's going to be a place where you can ask questions that then your classmates can see.

80
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:51,429
I can see the GSA, I can see. And then everybody can kind of be on the same page as far as understanding whatever the question was.

81
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:57,190
Because most likely, and I'm saying this in preference to, for example, emailing me or the GSA GSEs,

82
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:01,870
because most likely your question is shared by some of your some of your classmates.

83
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:10,150
So that be the best way to make sure that everybody is going to understand the results of that question.

84
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:21,160
And periodically, I will also post discussion questions, maybe brief excerpts from articles or things like that, a figure or something.

85
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:28,960
And I would love for you guys to engage with that and respond to these sort of discussion or thought questions.

86
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:35,680
Um, I mentioned in my, my announcement that there's no formal participation requirement in this course,

87
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:43,809
but if you do engage on those discussion boards, it can, it could help your grade because it shows me that you're engaging with the material on a

88
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:49,300
level that is just a little bit above and beyond what's what's just required for the course.

89
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:56,100
So my office hours are going to be on Zoom Wednesdays 5 to 6 p.m.

90
00:09:56,130 --> 00:10:06,090
This is very much flexible. If there's a lot of you guys that have a conflict for that, then we can certainly work on adjusting these hours.

91
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:12,150
The format for this to begin with anyway is going to be pretty open ended.

92
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,209
You guys can come to me with questions.

93
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:24,420
I won't typically prepare anything for these, but I'm happy to address any questions that you all might have and we can have a discussion going.

94
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:28,859
It doesn't have to be about the homeworks. It can be about concepts from from lectures.

95
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:35,190
Or again, it could be about your research, it could be about studies you're working on that you want to just get some feedback about.

96
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:45,840
If you do have more kind of individual questions about, for example, grading or something, then you can make an appointment with me or your GSI.

97
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:52,430
They're there office hours. We're going to figure out kind of as we go.

98
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,960
And I think that's probably also going to be on Zoom.

99
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:05,240
But we'll just kind of have to see how that goes. So our lecture times.

100
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:10,520
Excuse me. Are going to be Tuesdays, Thursdays, 830 to 10.

101
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:15,590
They're going to be in-person in this room. So you all found it, which is fantastic.

102
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:26,330
They're going to be recorded on Panopto. So if you are unable to make the lecture for whatever reason, first of all, you don't need to let me know.

103
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:30,320
It's fine. I understand. There's no there's no attendance requirement if you.

104
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:35,390
So whatever the reason, just, you know, go ahead. Do what you need to do.

105
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:42,680
Please do try to come in person if you can, because then you'll have opportunities to ask questions, etc.

106
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:49,399
And I also there may be recording issues with Panopto that has happened in my experience.

107
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,620
So I'm hoping that we can avoid a lot of that.

108
00:11:52,370 --> 00:12:01,009
But just to kind of maybe think of Panopto as sort of a backup if you really can't come to class and certainly when you're studying,

109
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:04,070
it can be helpful to review the lectures on on the recordings.

110
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:10,670
So I mentioned we're going to use canvas for everything. I'm going to disseminate announcements that way.

111
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:15,259
I'm going to upload the the files.

112
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:20,490
For example, the course notes are going to be on canvas. Assignments will be posted there.

113
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:24,410
As I said, we're going to use the discussion boards on canvas as well.

114
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:33,770
I'm I'm going to do my best to post the the lecture notes at least a week prior to the corresponding lecture.

115
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,450
But there may be some delays on occasion as I sort of adjust the notes.

116
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:47,330
Um, yeah. So I mentioned about the, the preference for discussion boards on canvas versus emails.

117
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:55,940
And again, I don't want to say that like, you know, please, please feel free to email me if it's, if it's, if it's a personal issue or whatever,

118
00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:00,410
just for, for course, questions and things like that would be great if you guys could use the discussion boards.

119
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:07,670
And this has been a very dynamic way in my experience teaching to get students to engage with each other as well,

120
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:13,970
because it's really great to see when you all are on the discussion boards answering each other's questions.

121
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:20,510
And that's really because it's a good way for me to to assess where everybody's understanding is, because I can go on there and I can see,

122
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:26,330
well, you know, this this response to this question is, is almost right, but there's a little bit missing.

123
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:30,920
So then I can weigh in and then we can all kind of come to a better a better understanding.

124
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,610
So the Panopto recorders are going to be on canvas.

125
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:41,530
There's going to be a little bit of a delay. So they're they're automatically recorded.

126
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:44,680
So this is a new system. I guess they're automatically recorded.

127
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:52,220
So I'm going to have to review and make sure that everything got picked up correctly and there's no issues and then I'll make them available manually.

128
00:13:53,680 --> 00:14:01,690
So we have class every day, every Tuesday, Thursday, all the way through April, with the exception of the spring break week.

129
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:09,460
And there are going to be three exams during the time of the main lectures.

130
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:19,210
If you saw my announcement that we're going to do those on Zoom just to kind of streamline the process for you guys as well as the graders.

131
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:24,730
So we'll kind of figure out how to handle that as we go.

132
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:32,830
But I think it would be fine with me if you I think you guys can come in to to class if you want to, to do it in class.

133
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:36,370
You can do it at home, but you'll you'll do it through the zoom.

134
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:40,120
Sorry, not zoom the canvas quizzes functionality.

135
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:49,150
And that will be a good way, I think for for again to streamline the whole process.

136
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:55,870
So just to expectation wise, it's good.

137
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:58,450
It's going to be open notes, open books for the exams.

138
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:03,040
But the only, the restriction is that you I don't want you to talk to each other or anybody else.

139
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:10,360
Just do your own work for these exams. They're also timed. So they're going to be timed essentially to correspond with the 90 minutes of lecture.

140
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:14,290
So. So that's the way exams are going to anybody. Any questions so far?

141
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:28,630
Okay. So as promised, here are the lab sections and the size according to each lab section.

142
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:37,809
So as you'll see here, there's no no way to be sure that the lab sessions are going to be recorded.

143
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:42,460
So please do try to attend all of these, if at all possible.

144
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:48,340
If you are going to miss a lab section, I would like you to let your GSI know,

145
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:53,590
because those are these are these are obviously smaller sessions than than the lecture.

146
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:58,780
So it would be I think it would be good if you let the GSI know that you're going to miss a lab.

147
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:09,750
So if anybody has had trouble registering or has trouble finding a lab section, just email me and we can figure that out.

148
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:21,490
But yeah, so so you guys will have access to this so you can see who your GSA is and when you're meeting and what the room is that you're meeting.

149
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:25,420
And you guys may already know this from the from the registrar website.

150
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:30,880
I bet. Any questions about labs? Okay.

151
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,879
So the way that lab works,

152
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:42,620
it's kind of a weekly cycle because there's one lab per week and the cycle begins on the two and on a Tuesday ends the following Monday,

153
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:55,460
and it's going to start next Tuesday. So the 10th of January and this is going to be kind of a theme throughout the course

154
00:16:55,490 --> 00:17:00,920
is is that things might not exactly sync up in terms of the labs and the lectures.

155
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:04,940
We'll do our best, but we may fall a little bit behind in lecture.

156
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:10,669
We may get a little ahead and lecture and there just may be a little bit of a mismatch.

157
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:15,590
But I'm hoping that we can all kind of work through that. The gases are great.

158
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:20,720
You're going to I think you're really going to enjoy working with them and they're just going to

159
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:26,930
they're there to help you understand in a more kind of one on one setting or not one on one,

160
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:34,760
but small group settings. It's compulsory in the sense of you do need to show up for these.

161
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,390
But again, obviously everybody things come up.

162
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:44,059
Just let you guys know if something does happen. So as I mentioned,

163
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:48,950
and the whole idea of the labs is primarily to go over these programing questions

164
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:55,910
because the homeworks are often a mix of conceptual questions which are kind of true,

165
00:17:55,910 --> 00:18:00,080
false, multiple choice and then data analysis, which is the programing piece.

166
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:06,260
So, so that's one of the, one of the formats for the, for the labs.

167
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:16,220
But there will also be the sample, the sample exam, sample quizzes and then more examples for clarification from lecture.

168
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:25,370
So as far as grading goes, it's close to 5050 split as 45 homework.

169
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:34,819
55 exams. There's going to be nine homework assignments spread out the course of the semester, no dropping of grades.

170
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:44,030
So you do need to turn in all of your assignments. It's fine if you work in groups, but do turn in your own work.

171
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:48,980
We're going to be submitting everything again through canvas.

172
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:54,110
So I'll give you more more information about that as we as we move forward.

173
00:18:55,820 --> 00:19:00,290
The assignments will be weighted a little bit differently, not terribly differently.

174
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:06,260
But some of them, of course, are maybe a little bit longer, may require a little bit more programing or a little bit more thought.

175
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:15,260
And those will be weighted a little bit more heavily. And then the three exams are going to be 15, 20 and 20%.

176
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:29,240
And they are not fully cumulative because they're going to focus on the the material that we've learned up to that point from the preceding exam.

177
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:36,770
But they might use concepts that are sort of the base knowledge that you're building throughout your your statistical studies.

178
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:43,400
For example, by the time we get to Exam three, we're going to be looking at logistic regression.

179
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:49,970
But I still hope that you will remember things about t tests that we learn for logistic regression

180
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:55,280
or the just the idea of a wald test which we're going to introduce in linear regression,

181
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:01,360
but we're going to use in logistic as well. Anybody questions about the expectations.

182
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:11,950
Okay. So the homeworks, as I said, are a mix of kind of conceptual questions.

183
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:20,649
And these programing, our data analysis assignments in the SAS or are is is kind of up to you.

184
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:24,220
I think the the GSEs are going to be familiar with both.

185
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:34,120
I think there's a bit of a preference towards ah, but again SAS is is certainly a viable option.

186
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:40,450
SAS is a superior option for many analyzes and R is superior for others.

187
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:44,230
So I would actually encourage you to dabble in both.

188
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:51,940
If you're familiar with one, then you might take this course as an opportunity to to experiment with the other.

189
00:20:52,510 --> 00:21:03,700
Um, because as you go on to implement it, you may end up in jobs where you're required to use the one that you're less familiar with.

190
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,010
So it'd be good to have a little bit of a base of knowledge there.

191
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:14,290
I'm going to work very hard to include in the lecture slides the same analysis in both SAS and R.

192
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:19,570
So you can see again, there's, there's advantages and disadvantages to each language.

193
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:27,670
So I'm hoping to kind of walk you through some of those so that you can understand and choose the, the method that works best for you.

194
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:41,590
Um, for the exams, there will be questions where you have to look at sas r output and we will go through plenty of examples in lecture of

195
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:50,770
looking at output so that you know where to go to find the MSI or the F statistic or the P value for various tests.

196
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:58,479
So and again, as I, you know, I want to look I want to look at both SAS and R for that so that you are familiar with both enough that you

197
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:05,710
can see in the output where these these various quantities are that you might need to answer the questions.

198
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:11,760
Um. Right. So the exams, there's three of them.

199
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,850
We're going to do those through the quizzes in canvas.

200
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:23,370
Um, operationally, we'll kind of work on, on how this, how this goes, but I think they're going to be 90 minutes.

201
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:27,240
That's the length of class they may open earlier than 830.

202
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,860
Again, some of you may feel more comfortable coming in to do them. I don't know.

203
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:35,370
It's fine with me. We'll have we have the classroom for those periods.

204
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:41,790
So if you want to come in to take those, that's fine. I may or may not be here depending on kind of how how this goes.

205
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:46,740
Um, but the exams are marked on your syllabus for the dates.

206
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:55,770
Um, there will be a sample exam that you will go over with your GSI and lab prior to the to the exams.

207
00:22:57,030 --> 00:23:04,590
There will be a mix, as with the homeworks, they're going to be a mix of true, false, multiple choice and kind of short answer problems.

208
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:10,770
Um, you're probably gonna need a calculator or again, you're, you're free to use,

209
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:16,620
ah, as a calculator for these, for these exams if that's your preference.

210
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:20,520
Because I know, I don't know a lot of, if a lot of people have kind of the old school calculators anymore,

211
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:25,979
but there will be some problems where you need to calculate a T statistic or something like that.

212
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:31,050
So you'll need some sort of method to do that, whether it's a calculator or whatever you prefer.

213
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:38,970
Um, so the students with services for students with disabilities, if anybody needs that,

214
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:43,650
those resources, there's some information in the syllabus on that.

215
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:47,130
So please, please see the syllabus or, or ask me.

216
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:57,989
Um, so the, excuse me, the main restriction and the exams is don't talk to anybody, don't talk to other students, don't talk to anybody else.

217
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:06,210
And don't, don't Google things. I just want you to use your notes, your books, and your understanding of the material.

218
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:12,480
Um, and to, as far as I will be available for questions.

219
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:16,500
So again, I'm not sure we'll have to figure out the best way to handle that,

220
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:23,580
but I'm expecting that maybe emailing me questions during the exam could work.

221
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:30,300
That might. We'll see. But if you do have questions during the exam, there will be some way for for that to be resolved.

222
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:36,640
So the grading scheme, I think this is probably familiar to everyone.

223
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:38,590
I don't know if we need to go through this.

224
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:49,990
The primary textbook here is applied regression analysis and other multivariable methods, and this is listed on the syllabus.

225
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:57,660
The there's a few optional textbooks as well, which are going to be helpful for,

226
00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:03,040
for maybe further learning, but we're primarily going to base lectures and.

227
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:12,340
Just based, of course, materials on this this textbook. So I hope that you'll all be able to get access to this.

228
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:22,650
Programing is going to be in our SAS. So academic integrity I'm sure you're all familiar with with these concepts.

229
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:28,110
For for homeworks, please do work in groups. Just turn in your own your own work.

230
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:35,280
Exams are the only times when I don't want you to collaborate with each other because I'm really

231
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:40,020
trying to assess what those what you each individually know and what you understand from the course.

232
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:50,120
Um, okay, so, so just, I don't mean to belabor the software points here,

233
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:56,059
but I know that's a source of a lot of confusion and concern for some students because

234
00:25:56,060 --> 00:26:00,170
I but I want so I want to make sure that everybody feels comfortable with the software.

235
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:10,819
Um, as I said, I'm going to emphasize SAS and R in the lectures and you are free to use either for homeworks, um, for the, for the exams.

236
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:18,740
The output may be in either format. And again, that's going to be corresponding to what we've done in lecture.

237
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:23,000
So there should be, as it's an open notes exam,

238
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:30,740
there should be a similar example in your notes that you can go to and find the, the appropriate elements of the output.

239
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:40,370
So, so that's going to be, I think, the way that we're going to try to, to deal with this dichotomy of SAS and R.

240
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:46,460
So just briefly, um, so for your general knowledge.

241
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:56,410
SAS is is more. It's very common in industry because groups like the FDA require it.

242
00:26:57,070 --> 00:27:04,870
They require kind of the backing that SAS as a company provides because R is open source.

243
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:10,780
So there can be problems with it. There can be packages that don't work, there can be errors.

244
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:15,760
But in SAS, the company is charging for these the software.

245
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:25,870
So they provide support that these government industry and government regulators think is important to to have.

246
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:30,340
So so learning SAS is very beneficial for you if you are.

247
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:35,590
Either way. But especially if you're you're considering a career path in industry or government.

248
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,500
But excuse me if you're if you're probably if you're thinking about going into a more academic setting.

249
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:50,290
R is going to be more more helpful. And ah, of course, also has the benefit of being open sources that it's free.

250
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:56,020
You can download it, you can make your own packages, you can kind of do as you will with it.

251
00:27:57,370 --> 00:28:01,840
And it's also still used in some government settings as well.

252
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:16,510
So so again, I want to emphasize that they're both important in various different careers and they both have different strengths and weaknesses.

253
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:23,410
So you may just find that you're more comfortable with one, one package versus the other, and that's fine as well.

254
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:36,100
So for excuse me, for homework assignments, there are typically going to be due by midnight on Mondays, but this is all listed on the syllabus.

255
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:41,710
If there are updates to due dates, I will post these through the campus announcements.

256
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:49,899
Late homeworks are not going to be accepted if you if you do need an extension,

257
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:54,750
you have to let me know at least a few days in advance of the due date.

258
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:59,830
But if you turn in the homework late, then it's going to be it's going to be a zero.

259
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:11,170
So that's this is this is really important, guys. So let's again, I understand things come up, but just let me know in advance if that happens.

260
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:19,480
So the course topics in the schedule will it's all it's listed on the syllabus.

261
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:25,540
I don't want to I don't want to take too much time to go through that today because we have to get in for a review.

262
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:31,150
But it will all be on the syllabus for you to look at, at your leisure.

263
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:41,410
As far as the syllabus goes, like I said, with the potential mismatches between the labs and the lectures, there may be some deviations.

264
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:48,070
And as we go through the course, some lectures may take longer, some lectures may take less time.

265
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:56,620
But I will if there are major deviations, I'll try to kind of call those out to you via campus announcements or in class.

266
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:03,990
Okay. Anybody have any questions about the general course outline format?

267
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,620
Grading? Yes. Yes.

268
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:22,170
Mm hmm. I'm certainly open to that.

269
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:26,370
Yeah. So this is this is my first year teaching here.

270
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:30,810
So I'm pleased if you guys have thoughts about the previous semester, let me know.

271
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:37,380
I taught previously at my my last position, but it was kind of a different setting.

272
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:41,070
It wasn't as big a class. So whatever works here, I'm certainly happy.

273
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:44,430
So you said a two day window when you take the exam.

274
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:50,590
Okay. Sure. We have different classes that are.

275
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:02,800
Sure. Yeah, I think that's something that we can figure out. Absolutely.

276
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:06,979
Um. So you mentioned assignments as well.

277
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:11,730
Was that was that separately or. Okay.

278
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:15,540
Just exams. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I think that's fine. My my main.

279
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:20,020
My main thought there is, is just don't talk to each other about the exam after you're done with it.

280
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:25,980
Right. Any other questions? Yes.

281
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:34,310
Email me and CC your GSI. That would be best.

282
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:38,470
Yeah. Thank you. And any other questions? Yes.

283
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:48,840
So the lab that you have to turn in to the lab instructions.

284
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:52,190
I think that's I think it's just the homeworks for the lecture.

285
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:56,479
I think the labs are more kind of you show up, you work through the assignments there.

286
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:03,410
I don't think there's separate lab assignments for the labs where you're looking at the sample exams.

287
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:11,749
There may be something like if you do the sample exam in advance and turn it in, there may be some extra credit or something like that.

288
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:14,870
But yeah, I don't think there's a specific lab assignments. Good question.

289
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:20,130
Other questions? Yes.

290
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,250
So that is another good question. I'll have to get back to you on that.

291
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:35,490
I don't see a problem with that, but I think it may depend on the size and kind of the size of the lab because the rooms are maybe a limited capacity.

292
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:41,010
So we'll see about that. But yeah, I'll I'll check with GSI. Other questions.

293
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:52,299
Great. Okay. We are going to move in to the first module of the course now,

294
00:32:52,300 --> 00:33:06,670
which is the review of statistical concepts from 521 and the various aspects of two sets of statistics that you will need for for this course.

295
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:12,190
So we're going to talk about the idea of inference and general statistical inference.

296
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:19,330
We're going to talk about some different variable types, descriptive statistics, sampling distributions, and then the central limit theorem.

297
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:28,060
So I'm hoping that a lot of this is familiar to you all, but this is going to be a good chance for you to ask questions if there's areas of confusion.

298
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:34,540
So as I said, when we're looking into when we're when we're doing science, we're trying to draw inference.

299
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:46,540
So we're taking samples. We're looking at small representative samples from a population and trying to draw inference on the population as a whole.

300
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:53,860
So the whole issue here is the sample that we draw is random.

301
00:33:54,190 --> 00:34:05,740
So we want to be able to make confident predictions or statements about the population based on a finite and incomplete sample from that population.

302
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,520
So this requires that we state what the population, what the target population is.

303
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:17,950
And this is really, really crucial because it's a very different study.

304
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:27,490
If you're looking at, for example, men over age 50 versus men over age 50 with a particular health condition.

305
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:30,910
Right. The one group is a subset of the other.

306
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:43,660
So it's it's and any parameter, any aspect of a of a distribution that you're looking at is going to depend on the population that it pertains to.

307
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:50,380
So, for example, if you want to evaluate an intervention to reduce drinking in high school students,

308
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:56,530
what's the what's the target population in this study? So it's all high school students, right?

309
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:00,130
That's who you're trying to target with this intervention.

310
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:07,150
And that's the that's the population that you'd want to draw from if you were doing a study on this this intervention.

311
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:14,499
And when we say all high school students, we also think of kind of both current and potential.

312
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:21,579
Right. Because there's you do have a certain set of current high school students, but there's also this idea of potential high school students.

313
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:26,710
So there's sort of a even larger population of kind of hypothetical students here.

314
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:40,920
So the task of statistical inference is, as I said, to to understand aspects of the population based on a small finite sample from it.

315
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:48,780
Because typically it's not possible to look at the population as a whole when we do look at the population as a whole.

316
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:50,280
We call that a census.

317
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:59,130
So if you're familiar with the US government census, they actually try to measure every single citizen or permanent resident of the US.

318
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:03,240
And that is a huge undertaking. That's why they only do it every ten years.

319
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:14,400
So what we more often do is we take a sample from the target population, which is usually a random subset.

320
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:24,690
It's much smaller than the actual population. So if we're studying a new treatment for a cancer, a particular cancer,

321
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:33,570
then we would sample patients coming into a particular hospital or clinic who have this cancer.

322
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:39,270
And we would ask them, do they want to participate in this study? And if they do, then we include them in that study.

323
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:44,520
And that would be a sample of individuals with that condition and the population.

324
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:54,030
There would be individuals with that cancer. So one thing that we we have to be careful of is kind of the practical aspect of sampling.

325
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:57,330
We want to make sure that the sample is representative.

326
00:36:57,870 --> 00:37:07,140
Right. So what does that mean? So so we figure if again, if we're if we're trying to get if we're trying to study, let's say, lung cancer.

327
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:15,750
Right. And we are recruiting from our hospital and we are only getting men.

328
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:21,170
Right. This may not be representative because there's certainly plenty of women with lung cancer.

329
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:30,240
So so we want to make sure that our sample is representative in the sense of having similar characteristics to the target population.

330
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:35,550
And this is actually a really big issue with with medical research,

331
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:42,450
because in particular in cancer research, we often get a bias towards healthier patients.

332
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:53,310
Right. Because when there's the protocols that are written for these trials often require the patients to meet certain kind of health minimums.

333
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:57,110
So they have to have a lot of normal labs.

334
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:10,500
They have to have no other co-morbidities. So that creates the situation where the the sample may be healthier than the population that is drawn from.

335
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:16,530
And this is a problem kind of universally, but in particular in cancer research, I think,

336
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:23,970
because then what can happen is you can get an overly optimistic picture of the

337
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:28,260
the treatment because you have a healthier sample than your target population.

338
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:39,930
So so that's again, this idea of representativeness is very important and there's various ways to kind of ensure that we have representative samples,

339
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:48,240
but we won't get into that right now. So statistical inference is inductive, right?

340
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:54,270
Because we are taking a particular which is the sample and generalizing, right?

341
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:04,260
So so that's the kind of the reasoning that we're using is inductive reasoning because we don't have the populations data.

342
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:09,230
There's uncertainty in this projection or this generalization.

343
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:17,220
And uncertainty is the sort of the key component of statistical inference that we need to quantify.

344
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:21,899
You've all heard about confidence intervals and P values.

345
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:27,690
So these are different ways of quantifying uncertainty in our statistical inference.

346
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:33,600
So this is the do accounting for uncertainty, right? We're quantifying the uncertainty.

347
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:42,720
So a confidence interval. We'll talk more about this, of course, but a confidence interval is wider if you're less certain about this quantity.

348
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:44,940
Right. When you're estimating a mean,

349
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:54,000
if your confidence interval for that mean is wider than it means that you are more uncertain about what the true mean in the population is.

350
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:04,760
So relationships between variables is a key element of business school analysis as well.

351
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,040
Right. And in this course, we're looking primarily at regression methods.

352
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:18,799
So regression methods are ways to analyze the influence of various predictors or covariates.

353
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:26,450
We use some different terms. They're analyzing their relationship with an outcome or a response or a dependent variable.

354
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:34,680
So the relationship part is, is kind of like if we talk about like correlation and causation, right?

355
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:41,080
There can be different forms of relationships between variables. So when we're doing regression,

356
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:49,630
where typically the relationships that we're going to be able to assess are more going to be along the lines of correlation rather than causation,

357
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:55,330
because we're typically not going to be able to make causal statements.

358
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:03,220
That's a more specific kind of relationship. There can be, as you all know, there can be correlation without causation.

359
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:10,870
So so the relationships between these variables are what we're going to try to assess with our regression methods.

360
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:19,629
So there's a few examples here from various fields so we can think about secondhand smoking being associated with cardiovascular disease.

361
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:25,690
Right. So what's what's the outcome here? Typically, we would think of it as disease.

362
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:32,740
And the second hand smoking would be sort of the the exposure or predictor.

363
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:38,740
So there's a some of these terms are kind of I'm going to use them a little bit inter intermittently and overlapping.

364
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:42,940
Leigh But if there's confusion, please ask questions.

365
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:47,200
There's a lot of again, there's a lot of equivalent or similar terms.

366
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:50,919
And I mentioned at the outset the terminology is important though.

367
00:41:50,920 --> 00:42:00,040
So if there if you are confused, please stop me and I will explain if I'm just being a little bit sloppy with the terminology, I'll say that.

368
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:04,510
Or if it's, you know, if it really is not an important distinction, I'll explain that to.

369
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:14,559
So the idea, though, of kind of the exposure and the response sort of depends on the analysis.

370
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,170
And there are some analogies when we'll get to logistic regression.

371
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:24,340
Well, we'll look at there's a there's something of a symmetry in the analysis between the exposure and the response,

372
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:32,110
in the sense of in the analysis, you can reverse the roles of the exposure response and get the same conclusions.

373
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:38,290
So so this is this is what I mean by we don't want to talk about causation here.

374
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:41,590
Right? We're just talking about relationships right now.

375
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:46,940
So the environmental health example is exposure to pollutants associated with health.

376
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:50,510
Of course, human health here could be quantified in a number of different ways.

377
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:58,370
So that's an that's another important aspect. I mentioned the translation from research question to statistical question.

378
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:08,810
We would need to for this for this example here, we would need to quantify or specify or operationalize what we mean by by health.

379
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:14,570
Is that hypertension? Is that low birth weight?

380
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:19,670
There are many ways that we could we could quantify that that idea of human health,

381
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:24,680
the nutrition example, healthy eating, is that associate with chronic kidney disease.

382
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:27,440
We want to think about how we measure healthy eating.

383
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:33,200
So if you're in a position of designing a study, there are many ways to assess healthy eating, right.

384
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:41,360
There's food, diaries. You could quantify it through probably like blood tests, lipid levels, things like that.

385
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:43,450
There's a number of ways that you could think about this.

386
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:53,150
So whenever you're designing a study, you want to think about how to translate or operationalize these concepts into something that you can measure,

387
00:43:53,540 --> 00:44:00,619
something that you can measure, and then analyze its relationship with another another variable which you also need to operationalize.

388
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:04,429
Right? Chronic kidney disease that could be quantified in different ways.

389
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:08,240
That could be quantified as yes no to somebody. You get diagnosed with that.

390
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:14,810
It could also be a more granular scale in the sense of something like, again, lab levels like EGFR,

391
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:20,270
things like that newborn weight associated with mothers smoking during pregnancy.

392
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:25,280
This is a little bit reverse because now the first part of the sentence here, it was what we would consider the outcome.

393
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:33,469
And then the mother smoking would be the predictor. And when we talk about causation, of course, we require a temporal ordering, right?

394
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:39,380
Because the mother's smoking occurs prior to the birth of the of the infant.

395
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:44,299
So so again, we're we're we're sort of dancing around causation here.

396
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:50,180
And we always the gold standard is to make a causal conclusion or causal statement.

397
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:54,920
But in many cases, the only way to do this is with a randomized controlled trial,

398
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:59,480
because that's the only way that you can control for all the potential confounding.

399
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:04,490
Right. We'll talk more about that. That can occur in these real world studies.

400
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:11,720
But but at the same time, they're the only way to study a lot of these things is is through more observational studies.

401
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:19,639
And then the final example here is, is patients post-op pain reduced when they have massage versus no massage?

402
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:27,080
And this is actually something that you could randomize, right? You can randomize patients to either receive a massage or not receive a massage.

403
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:32,090
Right. And then we would measure their post-op pain. And that could be quantified a number of ways as well.

404
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:42,140
For example, there are pain scales. You can ask the patient to respond to a series of questions that then produces a score for their pain level.

405
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:46,040
Or you can measure it with things like heart rate, blood pressure.

406
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:56,970
These things can be elevated when someone's in pain. So once you have your study goals stated in those terms, we have to design the study, right?

407
00:45:56,980 --> 00:46:03,400
And that's there's many steps that go into that and you have to collect the data and then you have to plan the analysis.

408
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:06,520
And then this course we're going to focus on the analysis piece,

409
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:12,910
but we'll talk a bit about some of these other aspects because study design is also key, right?

410
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:19,240
Each of those research questions is going to correspond potentially to a different study design,

411
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:25,030
or at least it's going to limit or proscribe the kinds of studies you could do with it.

412
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:34,030
So that being said, there are different study designs that can be appropriate for each each research question.

413
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:46,990
So a case series study is, is a little bit kind of on the lower evidence and of scientific research in the evidence hierarchy.

414
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:55,600
The randomized controlled trial is kind of at the top there. As I mentioned, that's one of the most reliable ways to establish causal relationships.

415
00:46:56,230 --> 00:47:03,280
So a case series is really kind of where the clinician will look at typically a clinical investigator will

416
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:11,290
collect data on patients who come in with the same condition and just kind of describe what they find.

417
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:14,410
What what characteristics do these patients share?

418
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:18,460
What's what are the differences between them, etc.?

419
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:24,579
And there are certainly statistical analysis that can be undertaken with these these kinds of designs.

420
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:36,160
One example of a case series is when they look at vaccine safety, because the responses, adverse responses to vaccines can occur.

421
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:44,590
They are very rare and they can occur in lengthy intervals after the administration of the vaccine.

422
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:51,610
So what's what's done in those studies is they collect data on just the patients with adverse reactions.

423
00:47:52,420 --> 00:48:02,080
And what they can do is they can then compare the rate of events after the person's vaccine administration versus before.

424
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:09,670
So and then that's called self-controlled case series because each individual patient serves as his or her own control.

425
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:16,270
So that's a that's a very interesting statistical design for this case series study design.

426
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:22,090
So case control studies are where you sample on the outcome.

427
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:25,600
So we'll get into this in a lot more detail in logistic regression.

428
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:30,309
But in a case control study, you take a certain ratio,

429
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:38,950
often 1 to 1 of patients with and without the condition your study and this is again based on the outcome, right?

430
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:45,520
So if you sample on the outcome in general, you might think, oh, this is this man is biased, right?

431
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:49,870
Because we're sampling on the thing that we're analyzing. But one of the nice things I mentioned,

432
00:48:49,870 --> 00:48:56,709
there's a symmetry and how you treat the outcome and the response that's particularly relevant in logistic regression.

433
00:48:56,710 --> 00:48:59,470
And we'll we'll talk a little bit about that when we get there.

434
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:07,090
But a case control study is a very valid design that's helpful when you study a rare condition, right?

435
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:13,210
Because the next design, the cohort study is where you just take a sample of individuals and then follow them.

436
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:18,130
Right. You don't take take account of of what they have or don't have.

437
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:25,180
So if you have a rare condition and you just take a sample of random people, many of them won't get the condition.

438
00:49:25,570 --> 00:49:34,390
So when we talk about power and sample size, you may end up in a situation where you don't have enough patients to do your study.

439
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:40,660
So the case control is designed to sort of deal with that issue because then you

440
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:46,000
can be sure that you have 50% of your patients have heart disease and 50% don't.

441
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:48,850
That's a bad example because heart disease is much more common.

442
00:49:48,850 --> 00:49:59,020
But there's many, many rare conditions that you would want to make sure to have an equal rate or not an equal ratio, but some specific ratio.

443
00:50:01,690 --> 00:50:06,099
So cohort studies again are typically longer.

444
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:11,409
Right. So that's the other thing about case control is that it's a less expensive study design cohort.

445
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:15,790
Studies are longer to run. You have to follow people prospectively over time.

446
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:22,030
But again, it's a it's certainly a valid study. Design is very appropriate in many situations.

447
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:32,860
Quasi experimental designs are kind of a little excuse me a little bit more towards the the lower kind of evidence and on the spectrum.

448
00:50:33,850 --> 00:50:41,950
But they are often the best option when you have, for example, large scale interventions, right?

449
00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:49,780
If you're trying to assess the effectiveness of a training program for physicians on how to talk to their patients.

450
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:55,870
A. Out our how to talk to parents about vaccinating their children for HPV, for example.

451
00:50:56,230 --> 00:51:05,350
Right. So in this case, you want to it's going to be difficult to randomize people sometimes.

452
00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:10,210
So there's this whole field of kind of pragmatic trials.

453
00:51:10,930 --> 00:51:20,440
So I worked a lot on this in my previous position in Colorado is cluster randomized or stepped wedge studies.

454
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:31,630
So these kind of fall under the pragmatic trials realm, and these are cases where it's not quite possible to do randomize individuals.

455
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:37,240
So another example of a quasi experimental design is sort of pre and post, right?

456
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:45,580
So if you're introducing a policy initiative at sort of, let's say the state level, right, it's going to be hard to get a control group.

457
00:51:45,790 --> 00:51:48,790
Right. What do you do? Do you take another state where it wasn't implemented?

458
00:51:48,910 --> 00:51:52,500
That's certainly an option. But then there may be other variables, right?

459
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:56,229
There's different demographics in different states.

460
00:51:56,230 --> 00:52:00,910
Right. So so one thing that you can do there is is a pre post design.

461
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:06,190
So that's where you just compare your outcomes pre intervention and post intervention.

462
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:12,190
And obviously, there's going to be a problem there, right? Because there's going to be a time component.

463
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:22,150
You don't know if there are other factors that may affect your outcome other than the intervention that was implemented at that time.

464
00:52:23,590 --> 00:52:29,229
And then, of course, the randomized controlled trial, which is the gold standard and you're probably all familiar with this,

465
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:35,320
where you randomized individual patients different treatments, this will completely, if it's run correctly,

466
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:44,290
will completely control for potential confounding because the randomization process is not informed by any variables.

467
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:50,130
Right. The whole idea of confounding is that somebody can self-select into different treatment groups.

468
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:54,520
Right. And that could confound the relationship that you're trying to study.

469
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:58,990
So a randomized controlled trial deals with that because the assignment to the treatment

470
00:52:59,230 --> 00:53:05,740
is completely independent of any patient factors unless it's designed to be stratified,

471
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:15,290
for example. So when we when we start to translate between our research question and our statistical analysis,

472
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:20,200
right, we need to think about what's the independent, independent variables.

473
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:29,659
Right. So I mentioned about terminologies here, dependent variable, I'll call it response, I'll call an outcome independent variable.

474
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:35,240
We can call it a predictor. When we get further into regression, we'll call that a covariate.

475
00:53:36,230 --> 00:53:40,400
But what are the dependent independent variable in this question?

476
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:47,880
Does anybody have any thoughts on what the dependent variable is? You shout it out.

477
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:55,090
Exactly. Yes, the health outcome for the newborn. And then, of course, the variable would be the other one, smoking.

478
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:59,530
Right. And then how do we define and assess the newborn cell outcome?

479
00:53:59,530 --> 00:54:07,780
So this is this is this gets into that idea of operationalizing the the variables in our in our research question.

480
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:11,410
So what would the example that we're going to look at eventually?

481
00:54:11,410 --> 00:54:19,720
Not in this lecture, I don't think maybe in this lecture, but definitely as we as we move forward is smoking is going to be measured in packs per day.

482
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:23,410
Right. And then the newborn's health outcome will be birthweight.

483
00:54:25,350 --> 00:54:30,600
So a few variable types. You've probably encountered a lot of these in previous stats courses.

484
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:40,230
When we talk about continuous variables, we have an uncountable infinite number of observable values in principal, right?

485
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:46,080
So this is things like BMI, blood pressure, write minutes walked per day.

486
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:53,579
And this, this middle bullet point here is between any two observable values, a third can be identified.

487
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:57,630
So this is sort of a, a math, the notion of continuous, right.

488
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:03,180
Um, any two values you pick, no matter how close you can find a third between, that's,

489
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:13,290
that's how we think about continuity and in, in practice continuous these are all kind of negotiable terms, right?

490
00:55:14,070 --> 00:55:18,840
Whether or not you treat something is continuous could depend on the analysis you're doing.

491
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:25,139
But the the analysis will be it's very closely tied to the variable type.

492
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:32,670
So so these are some examples of continuous variables that are often just treated as continuous despite again,

493
00:55:32,670 --> 00:55:39,059
I mean, you can think of minutes walk per day as being discrete in the sense of minutes are discrete.

494
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:46,290
But so, so the, what I'm trying to say is variable types are not fixed, right?

495
00:55:46,290 --> 00:55:49,919
You can think about different variables in different ways depending on on your questions.

496
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,710
And we'll talk a lot more about this as we go through.

497
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:59,960
Because, for example, you can take a continuous variable and you can turn it into a discrete variable, right?

498
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:06,050
You can say blood pressure has this cutoff where below is normal, above is is hypertension, right?

499
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:12,620
So you can turn that continuous variable into a discrete variable and you can go the other way to in a sense.

500
00:56:13,490 --> 00:56:20,000
So if we talk about discrete binary count or ordinal variables, this is what we mean by this,

501
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:26,240
is that there is a countable set of values that can be observed or realized.

502
00:56:27,470 --> 00:56:35,090
So it can be infinite in the case of counts, right? Because if you have count of number of hospitalizations over the course of a year.

503
00:56:35,270 --> 00:56:38,660
Right. In principle, there's no upper limit. Right.

504
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:45,740
So that could be that's that's sort of we can think about that sort of an infinite set of possible outcomes.

505
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:53,440
But there's also finite sets. So that would be a binary, discrete variable where we can say yes, no, right?

506
00:56:53,450 --> 00:56:58,910
Hypertension or normal blood pressure, normal or abnormal results on some other test.

507
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:03,650
And some more examples here are obesity versus normal weight.

508
00:57:03,950 --> 00:57:08,259
But you can further categorize BMI, of course, myocardial infarction.

509
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:12,770
So that's a heart attack. Yes. Now, I mentioned number of hospital visits.

510
00:57:14,610 --> 00:57:18,150
So it's important to think about these variable types.

511
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:28,950
But again, the what analysis method you use, you kind of have to negotiate between the analysis and the variable type.

512
00:57:28,950 --> 00:57:32,790
So we'll talk more about that as we go as well. Okay.

513
00:57:32,790 --> 00:57:36,570
So, so thinking about another single variable in a univariate analysis.

514
00:57:37,410 --> 00:57:42,120
BMI. Right. So that's why we talked about continuous BMI, because that's a score.

515
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:45,240
It's calculated from somebody's height and weight.

516
00:57:45,690 --> 00:57:48,960
So it's in units of kilograms, four meters squared.

517
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:54,180
And that can be predictive of various health outcomes.

518
00:57:54,180 --> 00:58:01,320
Right. Because the higher the BMI, the higher somebody's weight relative to their height.

519
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:03,750
Right. Because we're taking a ratio of weight to height.

520
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:11,820
Um, so if we think about a study where the BMI is the outcome or response or dependent variable,

521
00:58:12,450 --> 00:58:17,249
what are some ways we can analyze BMI and how we summarize BMI?

522
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:26,100
Right. So we'll look at a couple of examples here, but some ways that we can analyze BMI, right?

523
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:31,259
So we can take the mean right. We can look at the center of the distribution of BMI.

524
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:37,260
We can look at the spread of BMI. And these are also ways to summarize BMI data.

525
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:40,530
You can look at Quintiles right in your sample.

526
00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:44,900
And this is all going to pertain to to a sample, right?

527
00:58:44,910 --> 00:58:53,640
When we take a sample and then we measure the BMI for that sample of individuals we're talking about, what do we do with that data?

528
00:58:53,730 --> 00:59:09,540
Right. So the BMI, the classification table here is a way to look at that continuous BMI as instead sort of a discrete variable.

529
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:13,889
Right. Because we can classify BMI into these ranges, right.

530
00:59:13,890 --> 00:59:20,430
So underweight is less than 18.5. Normal is 18.5 to 24.9, etc.

531
00:59:20,610 --> 00:59:25,770
And you can go even more kind of finely grained into the overweight and obese categories.

532
00:59:27,150 --> 00:59:35,700
But this is a weight this is what I'm talking about when I say depends on kind of the question that you want to answer, how you treat these variables.

533
00:59:35,970 --> 00:59:41,190
Right? Because you can certainly look at BMI as continuous and we can talk about means and standard deviations,

534
00:59:41,790 --> 00:59:46,949
but it can be more constructive sometimes or instructive to look at these categories.

535
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:55,380
Right. Because these are sort of these are groupings that have been defined to be relevant clinically.

536
00:59:55,920 --> 01:00:05,610
Right. So when we talk about people being overweight, we might want to talk about the proportion of the sample that's overweight.

537
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:10,980
Right. That could be more relevant than the average BMI of the sample.

538
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:19,950
Right. In certain cases. And as I said, the analytic approach is going to depend on the variable type.

539
01:00:19,970 --> 01:00:24,560
So I mentioned logistic regression is what we use for binary outcomes.

540
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:27,530
Linear regression is for continuous outcomes.

541
01:00:27,830 --> 01:00:34,250
So so we have to think about the variable type, how we're treating the variable when we go about designing our analysis.

542
01:00:34,610 --> 01:00:42,559
So for example, if we were going to analyze VMs continuous, we would look at means we would look at two sample T tests,

543
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:46,580
we would look at those kinds of approach linear regression.

544
01:00:47,450 --> 01:00:54,679
If we go about saying, well, let's just look at BMI as normal or greater than normal, right?

545
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:58,940
So then we would split this on the BMI value of 25, right?

546
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:03,860
So everybody with a BMI value below 25 would be considered normal even though there's an underweight category.

547
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:07,790
And we're going to ignore that because we want two categories, right?

548
01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:14,660
If we want a binary outcome, we want two categories. So then there's normal and underweight, and then there's the overweight and obese.

549
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:22,970
So in that way, we can talk about again, proportions, frequencies and then probabilities of being overweight.

550
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:29,980
Anybody. Any questions so far? Okay.

551
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:39,790
So, so a lot of us should be review. Okay. So this is getting back into the more statistical parts, the more mathy parts here.

552
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:43,870
I'm hoping you're all familiar with measures of center and spread.

553
01:01:44,230 --> 01:01:46,780
So we'll talk about measures of center first. Right.

554
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:57,070
So this is when we think about probability distributions, the center is kind of where is most of that probability mass concentrated.

555
01:01:57,940 --> 01:02:03,610
So it's the it can be measured as a mean or a median, and there's other ways as well.

556
01:02:03,610 --> 01:02:06,669
But we'll focus on the mean, which is the expected value.

557
01:02:06,670 --> 01:02:10,240
So this this E symbol here is how we write expected value.

558
01:02:10,250 --> 01:02:19,750
So when we apply that operator E to a random variable here, why we get the mean for that distribution.

559
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:23,800
So Y here is the random variable and it has some distribution.

560
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:28,580
And when we talk about the center of the distribution,

561
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:35,660
we're just trying to understand what it's a it's sort of a way to think about what's the what's the most likely value.

562
01:02:36,710 --> 01:02:41,030
And technically, the most likely value is actually probably the mode.

563
01:02:41,690 --> 01:02:48,050
But the mean is another way of thinking about the center. So it's it's all in, you know, I don't know if we yeah, we have some some plots here,

564
01:02:48,770 --> 01:02:54,649
but the mean is kind of the center of the distribution in a in one respect.

565
01:02:54,650 --> 01:02:58,900
Right. And the median is the center of the distribution.

566
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:07,430
And another aspect, it's kind of the middle they so the median is the value that splits the distribution into 50% of the mass on one side,

567
01:03:07,430 --> 01:03:16,580
50% on the other side. But the mean in the median are often kind of used in different ways and for different purposes.

568
01:03:17,510 --> 01:03:23,570
The sample mean, I just want to make sure we talk about that here. The notation, the hat is an estimate.

569
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:32,210
So when we have new hat, that is the estimate of MU from the sample and then y bar is another way to denote

570
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:38,780
the sample mean and it's calculated as just the sum of the observed ys divided by.

571
01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:47,239
N So when we multiply by one over and it's the same as just dividing that sum by n and it's going to have the same year as the original data.

572
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:55,610
And then the median, as I said, is going to be that value that splits the probability into 50% on each side.

573
01:03:55,970 --> 01:04:02,810
So so these are two example distributions, one symmetric and one is positively skewed.

574
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:15,100
So these are cases where we might the skewed case is a case where we might consider using the median as a measure of center rather than the mean.

575
01:04:15,820 --> 01:04:24,580
So in the symmetric case, the mean is going to be equal to the median because this so this distribution here is this is a probability density, right?

576
01:04:24,790 --> 01:04:34,840
So this is sort of a plot showing the likelihood of getting a certain value if you draw randomly from this distribution.

577
01:04:35,710 --> 01:04:39,340
So the mean in the median are equal here because since it's symmetric,

578
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:46,000
there's an equal probability of drawing a value on the left as there is a drawing value on the right.

579
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:52,629
Now, that is and that is a little bit different for this positively skewed one, right?

580
01:04:52,630 --> 01:04:59,290
Because when it's when a variable is positively skewed, there's this long tail over here.

581
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:03,070
Right. So the mean in the median are no longer equal.

582
01:05:03,370 --> 01:05:11,260
And what happens is because the this long tail exists, the mean is kind of pulled upward.

583
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:21,670
Right. Because it's the expected value, whereas the median is going to be sort of a more reliable measure of center of this distribution.

584
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:29,820
So so this this question here is what what measure of censure would you use if the data are skewed?

585
01:05:29,820 --> 01:05:33,620
And I've just answered that for you. It's the median, right?

586
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:39,060
Because the mean is going to be arbitrarily sort of pulled up there.

587
01:05:39,930 --> 01:05:48,450
And we can think about this as kind of what's the salary of the typical, um, employee versus the average salary of all union employees.

588
01:05:48,870 --> 01:05:52,560
So these terms typical on average are statistical, right?

589
01:05:52,950 --> 01:06:00,509
So the typical, um, employee though to make that statistical statement, we can say the median, what's the median.

590
01:06:00,510 --> 01:06:04,589
Um, employee's salary versus the average salary.

591
01:06:04,590 --> 01:06:08,970
So the average is also, again, that's a little bit closer to a technical term.

592
01:06:09,270 --> 01:06:15,210
But what we want to replace that with is what's, what's the mean of the salaries and salary.

593
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:20,579
You may be familiar with the idea of salary being very it's very skewed, right?

594
01:06:20,580 --> 01:06:25,890
There are some people with very high salaries, many more people with sort of middle of the range salaries.

595
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:32,940
So this is a case where if you see income data reported, it's often on the median that's reported not the mean.

596
01:06:33,550 --> 01:06:40,470
Um, so back to this question of, of what's the mean if y is only ones and zeros?

597
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:46,500
Zeba, I want to take a stab at that. What was the interpretation of the mean if y is binary?

598
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:57,819
Yes. Correct.

599
01:06:57,820 --> 01:07:01,530
Yes, it's the probability of a one in the sample. Yeah, exactly.

600
01:07:02,170 --> 01:07:11,260
So. So and the idea here is that you the mean is still a reasonable quantity, even if you have a binary variable.

601
01:07:11,590 --> 01:07:16,480
Right. And it corresponds to the probability of the value of the variable being equal to one.

602
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:20,680
So if it's closer to zero, the variables more likely to be equal to zero.

603
01:07:22,450 --> 01:07:27,309
We talked about that. So so I mentioned first measures of center.

604
01:07:27,310 --> 01:07:31,630
So there's also measuring spread or dispersion. So the center of the distribution is one.

605
01:07:31,660 --> 01:07:38,470
One thing to think about. But then how spread out is the distribution is another way to characterize it.

606
01:07:38,740 --> 01:07:47,290
Right. So variance is the way that we typically think about spread and that's the average squared distance from the mean.

607
01:07:47,310 --> 01:07:55,150
So we can write this as sigma squared is the parameter in the population that corresponds to the variance.

608
01:07:56,260 --> 01:08:02,049
The operator v here you also see it written as v r is the variance operator.

609
01:08:02,050 --> 01:08:11,620
So if you take the variance of the random variable y, that's the same as taking the expectation of y minus its mean square.

610
01:08:11,950 --> 01:08:15,490
So that's the average squared distance from the mean.

611
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:22,210
And there's two ways to calculate that you can either have new, known or unknown.

612
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:32,200
And if you is known, then you divide the average sorry, you divide the total square distance from the mean by n.

613
01:08:33,370 --> 01:08:42,940
And if the if the mean is unknown, you divide the total square distance from the observed or estimated mean by n minus one.

614
01:08:43,450 --> 01:08:49,930
And we'll talk a lot more about this idea of sums of squares when we get into the regression stuff.

615
01:08:50,320 --> 01:09:01,210
So this is the sum of squares of Y because we're measuring the total squared deviation from the mean y bar here.

616
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:12,040
And the reason that we divide by n minus one is because we have used up a degree of freedom in estimating the mu here.

617
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:20,120
Right. So in order to get an unbiased estimate of the variance, we have to subtract one here.

618
01:09:20,780 --> 01:09:28,220
Right. So. So that's the reason that n minus one appears in the denominator of this expression.

619
01:09:29,570 --> 01:09:34,040
So oftentimes the variance is going to be a less relatable quantity.

620
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:37,339
It's not going to be on the scale of the original variable.

621
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:44,180
So we can then think about the standard deviation. So this is the square root of the variance of Y, right?

622
01:09:44,270 --> 01:09:49,310
So this is probably a more familiar quantity because it's the same units as the original variable,

623
01:09:49,820 --> 01:09:53,270
because when you take the average square distance from the mean,

624
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:57,980
that's going to be in units that are squared, so that's not as helpful to think about.

625
01:09:58,970 --> 01:10:03,290
So the square root of the variance then is the standard deviation.

626
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:12,590
We denote that sigma we can abbreviated as S.D. Sometimes it's written as S and it has the same units as the original data.

627
01:10:12,830 --> 01:10:18,650
They many questions about the spread and center measure. The spread in center is mostly review.

628
01:10:20,850 --> 01:10:25,310
Okay. All right. Okay.

629
01:10:26,170 --> 01:10:35,320
So this is a picture just showing two different distributions with different the same center, but different degrees of spread.

630
01:10:35,740 --> 01:10:45,010
Right. So the smaller the standard deviation, the more tightly clustered the values will be about the mean.

631
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:49,000
Right. So these are normal or Gaussian curves here.

632
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:55,150
These are density functions and they are centered about the same value here in the middle.

633
01:10:55,480 --> 01:11:01,600
But because they have a different spread, they are they are different curves.

634
01:11:01,870 --> 01:11:10,420
And the the one with the larger spread, it's going to be more likely that we get values further from the mean if we draw randomly from this.

635
01:11:12,490 --> 01:11:15,760
So data example here. So we talked about this before.

636
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:20,940
We're studying smoking, the smoking affect birth weight of newborns.

637
01:11:20,950 --> 01:11:30,190
Right. We take a random sample of 20 women who are admitted who admitted to smoking during their first pregnancy.

638
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:35,350
And we have variables for age and years smoking packs per day.

639
01:11:35,350 --> 01:11:41,530
I mentioned that that was the way we quantify smoking because we can also think about smoking is just yes, no.

640
01:11:41,530 --> 01:11:44,800
Right. But we can move back and forth between those.

641
01:11:45,460 --> 01:11:48,880
Right, because we could. And these are all women who smoked as very few with zero.

642
01:11:49,870 --> 01:11:56,079
And then the outcome is birthweight. Right? So so this is super important.

643
01:11:56,080 --> 01:12:05,500
This this idea of looking at the data, because we want to make sure that there's no ages that are like 102 or negative five or something.

644
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:11,979
So it's very important to look at your data and make sure that there's no weird values.

645
01:12:11,980 --> 01:12:15,250
There's no values that are not possible. Right.

646
01:12:16,030 --> 01:12:22,780
So again, for age, it's pretty easy to to understand one thing to to really note, you may have encountered this,

647
01:12:22,780 --> 01:12:30,880
actually, but there some data collection or software quirks where missing values maybe required is 99.

648
01:12:31,210 --> 01:12:38,170
So that can be tricky, right? Because an age of 99 is probably not possible for this sample, but it could be for another sample.

649
01:12:38,170 --> 01:12:42,579
Right. So there's looking at the data is very important because that can alert use.

650
01:12:42,580 --> 01:12:51,820
For example, if you see, you know, 20% of your sample has a value of 99, that's a really good indicator that that may be a missing value.

651
01:12:52,120 --> 01:13:01,060
So this is when you discuss with your your collaborator, you go back to your who collected the data and you talk to them about what does this mean.

652
01:13:01,540 --> 01:13:08,739
So, so anyway, so this is the data that we have. And if we want to talk about the target population,

653
01:13:08,740 --> 01:13:17,889
which is women who smoke during pregnancy and their the weight of their newborns, we can look at the descriptive statistics, right?

654
01:13:17,890 --> 01:13:23,290
So when we talk about descriptive statistics, this is in contrast to Inferential.

655
01:13:23,590 --> 01:13:28,510
So when we say inferential statistics, that means more P values, confidence intervals,

656
01:13:28,690 --> 01:13:34,060
descriptive statistics are essentially we can call it we can think about them as point estimates.

657
01:13:34,450 --> 01:13:38,800
So a point estimate is, for example, the mean age, right?

658
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:45,700
So we can write that you had or we can write that a bar and that's 24.9 years in this sample.

659
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:53,139
Right. So this is interesting. This is instructive. This tells us that among women who smoke during their first pregnancy,

660
01:13:53,140 --> 01:14:03,190
the average age is estimated to be 24.9 years and the standard deviation is estimated to be 6.29 years.

661
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:12,459
Right. So this is the measure of spread. So if it's a little bit more difficult to think about here than the measure center and this

662
01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:18,220
is when we might just might start to want to think about graphically summarizing this data.

663
01:14:18,940 --> 01:14:25,240
And at some point I think it maybe not in this lecture, but we will look at histograms to show these things.

664
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:31,000
So then we can also think about the descriptive statistics for these other variables, right?

665
01:14:31,150 --> 01:14:38,410
The smoking is packs per day, the birth weights. But none of this, none of these.

666
01:14:38,410 --> 01:14:43,240
Tell us about the relationship between. Right. These are univariate statistics.

667
01:14:44,470 --> 01:14:49,660
However, it's still very important to summarize your data on this level.

668
01:14:49,810 --> 01:14:52,810
Right. It's the first step in any regression analysis.

669
01:14:53,230 --> 01:14:58,090
You can describe these variable individually you guys have looked at I've read

670
01:14:58,090 --> 01:15:02,770
articles where table one is essentially a collection of these kinds of values.

671
01:15:02,770 --> 01:15:06,040
You'll see means plus or minus the standard deviation.

672
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:09,220
Sometimes it's in parentheses, different ways of conveying that,

673
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:16,329
but these statistics on their own are not going to help us answer that question of

674
01:15:16,330 --> 01:15:20,860
does the mother's smoking level affect the birth weight because they're univariate?

675
01:15:21,190 --> 01:15:25,780
We need to think about bivariate relationships to get at that question.

676
01:15:26,020 --> 01:15:33,160
So that's what regression analysis allows us to do. That's where we start to look at the relationships between these variables.

677
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:45,280
And then, for example, what we can do is we can look at the mean change in birth weight per additional pack a day of smoking.

678
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:54,070
Right. And that's going to be helpful because that's going to tell us what is the association between smoking and birth weight.

679
01:15:54,550 --> 01:16:01,030
Right. As quantified by the mean change in birth weight per pack a day smoked.

680
01:16:02,180 --> 01:16:07,100
And then when we talk about adjusting for a variable that's holding something constant.

681
01:16:07,310 --> 01:16:11,330
So we adjust for age here and then we test.

682
01:16:11,930 --> 01:16:17,660
Is association significant? That's inference when we test a hypothesis.

683
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:21,830
That's where we get into inferential statistics. That's hypothesis testing.

684
01:16:21,830 --> 01:16:24,020
That's P values, right?

685
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:31,790
And when we talk and then when we can make the statement of this is a significant association or this is not a significant association.

686
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:37,770
So I think we're going to we're going to wrap up after this slide.

687
01:16:37,770 --> 01:16:43,319
But this is just a summary of kind of a preview of what you guys might go on

688
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:47,820
to in the the weight down here and what we're going to cover in this course.

689
01:16:48,090 --> 01:16:52,620
We're covering the first two rows here in the in the orange.

690
01:16:53,520 --> 01:17:01,679
So when we look at continuous or interval valued variables, we're going to be doing linear regression analysis.

691
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:07,950
So simple linear regression analysis has one independent variable and one dependent variable.

692
01:17:08,310 --> 01:17:14,340
Multiple linear regression analysis has any number of independent variable.

693
01:17:14,340 --> 01:17:24,469
Still one dependent variable. And the simple and multiple linear regression analysis distinction is is more didactic than important

694
01:17:24,470 --> 01:17:29,270
in the sense that we introduce the idea of linear regression using simple linear regression,

695
01:17:29,270 --> 01:17:39,170
because you can understand the concepts more straightforwardly, but in practice, they're all part of the same statistical framework.

696
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:47,270
So, so kind of theoretically speaking, there's not much distinction, but it's helpful to learn simple linear regression before multiple.

697
01:17:48,710 --> 01:17:54,330
And then the the last or the latter part of the course, we're going to look at outcomes that are binary.

698
01:17:54,380 --> 01:17:57,590
And this is very common in the health fields. Right?

699
01:17:57,830 --> 01:18:00,920
We can think about low birth weight. We can think about hypertension.

700
01:18:01,070 --> 01:18:07,580
We can think about presence or absence of heart disease. We can think about presence or absence of of cancer.

701
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:14,390
And then where we'll be talking about logistic regression or probit regression analysis.

702
01:18:15,260 --> 01:18:21,680
And that's a specific case of something called generalized linear models, which if you go on to the next course in the sequence,

703
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:27,919
523, you'll learn about all of this, this interesting stuff here, which is how you deal with things like counts.

704
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:31,100
We mentioned number of visits to the hospital.

705
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:37,580
Right. That's a count variable that requires a different regression method than ordinal variables.

706
01:18:37,940 --> 01:18:44,840
That's another regression method still. So Poisson variables is a it's a particular distribution for count variables.

707
01:18:45,830 --> 01:18:54,920
Ordinal regression. Again, this is a very important way to analyze data that's collected on a Likert scale or liquor scale,

708
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:58,190
if you pronounce it correctly, according to the journals.

709
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:03,590
But that's these kinds of scales where you go from great to poor.

710
01:19:05,300 --> 01:19:08,420
As I mentioned, though, sometimes you can treat those as continuous.

711
01:19:08,420 --> 01:19:12,590
So so this is all all these variable types are negotiable in the sense that you

712
01:19:12,590 --> 01:19:17,690
just want to make sure that your analysis matches up with the research question.

713
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:26,479
So again, none of these nudges variable types are sort of set in stone and then categorical

714
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:29,900
or nominal variables that starts to get a little bit more difficult to interpret,

715
01:19:30,410 --> 01:19:37,879
but there are certain ways to analyze those. And then finally, time to event, if you're looking at times recurrence of cancer, right?

716
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:41,630
You have a collection of cancer patients. You're trying to apply a new treatment.

717
01:19:41,630 --> 01:19:46,820
You want to understand how that affects their time for recurrence, that becomes survival analysis.

718
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:53,450
Okay, so we're gonna stop there. Thank you all. Looking forward to working with you this semester and let me know if you have any questions.
