1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:58:06,852
so I'll be you. you have any whatever you're doing here. okay.

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:14,760
so there when you're ready. you

3
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:22,680
and it right

4
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:43,720
right. we'll clean

5
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:56,580
everything out.

6
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:11,069
you can use four. okay.

7
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:51,949
better to use the right number. it's

8
00:01:51,949 --> 00:02:00,165
very hard to see

9
00:02:00,165 --> 00:02:06,485
okay. alright.

10
00:02:06,485 --> 00:02:28,465
okay well maybe.

11
00:02:28,465 --> 00:02:34,845
okay.

12
00:02:34,845 --> 00:02:39,865
okay. call back on your break. very glad

13
00:02:39,865 --> 00:02:54,545
to invite five sixty four and it is..

14
00:02:54,545 --> 00:03:00,065

if you got to see you. bye. bye.

17
00:03:11,945 --> 00:03:17,605
sorry. yeah I had today.

18
00:03:17,605 --> 00:03:27,085
I don't know if I can say that. I love

19
00:03:27,085 --> 00:03:32,125
you come back. yeah.

00:03:37,665 --> 00:03:42,765
we still be together again. so

22
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:48,145
we we we worked very hard. very

23
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:53,865
honored. my friend. bye.

24
00:03:53,865 --> 00:04:00,129
see what you doing

25
00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:06,549
listen at all. both

26
00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:13,409
you and Sally and Matt. so gimme

27
00:04:13,409 --> 00:04:19,629
a call. thanks thank you.

28
00:04:19,629 --> 00:04:24,629
so two things one I don't get what sense is intense inside of me he said maybe

29
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:29,769
I could talk about all the methodology issues. things that I've talked about. I'm not gonna do that

30
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:34,989
exclusively in fact that's the air pollution. the main story here but I see it raises a_lot_of

31
00:04:34,989 --> 00:04:40,389
issues that have attracted my intentions and starting this work on a few messages

32
00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:45,669
will get to that. later. haven't talk to anybody more about that afterwards. I will say

33
00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:51,089
that with that first cabinet the send that out. you know

34
00:04:51,089 --> 00:04:56,335
maybe we get nervous before they talk. but normally I think I don't get that service but

35
00:04:56,335 --> 00:05:03,875
this is Todd. gonna be Friday morning. because my step mother. perhaps later Farmers.

36
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:09,175
hey never see me do this before so bare with me when I tried. alright so thank

37
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:14,275
you for invite me so this is all got air pollution office and as I say that because was a compounded and I'm

38
00:05:14,275 --> 00:05:20,255
gonna use it just to be able to talk about happy message issues. so first

39
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:26,455
off is Missus Burton this is James at the sociology.. this

40
00:05:26,455 --> 00:05:33,015
this is a message for you. bye Leo or here in Baltimore.

41
00:05:33,015 --> 00:05:39,395
name form of autism in Vienna Austria. and

42
00:05:39,395 --> 00:05:44,975
this is period. you know what possible process but semi unfortunately

43
00:05:44,975 --> 00:05:50,195
I would say it one that supposed to quite push quickly back with but it's been a better time to publish

44
00:05:50,195 --> 00:06:00,043
a book called Fortress and my father now

45
00:06:00,043 --> 00:06:05,183
and this is one of the primary calls about this

46
00:06:05,183 --> 00:06:12,123
wife the refrigerator mother. mother not paying child

47
00:06:12,123 --> 00:06:17,483
almost at the same time there was this fellow remind who was a scientist and sort of you know Sally

48
00:06:17,483 --> 00:06:22,743
and Eric came up with this and I thought that it was biological

49
00:06:22,743 --> 00:06:28,183
in some. not because that home is really in the field that sort.

50
00:06:28,183 --> 00:06:33,243
that theory helps way it's one out for a longer time. I would say

51
00:06:33,243 --> 00:06:40,035
unfortunately. bye if you wanna call

52
00:06:40,035 --> 00:06:45,075
to follow by the way side and one of the reasons. it's fell by the way side work. early studies

53
00:06:45,075 --> 00:06:50,215
initially by posting and looking at rights of twin study. our way.

54
00:06:50,215 --> 00:06:55,555
probably on the house for slash getting a kind of genetic person non- genetic

55
00:06:55,555 --> 00:07:00,855
disorder. and they put a something to Jessie a very very high heard ability of autism

56
00:07:00,855 --> 00:07:06,135
so that that was nice and that it started to see the picture away from the story.

57
00:07:06,135 --> 00:07:11,295
mother's fault. in essence one of the pendulum on the way from that. it's a good thing. but it really swung

58
00:07:11,295 --> 00:07:16,295
it up dramatically to the genetic side in this. you know the early eighties when they published this kind of

59
00:07:16,295 --> 00:07:23,395
the beginning of the agenda and that run for a long time. with the idea that was fine.

60
00:07:23,395 --> 00:07:28,535
now I know that there's not the team for autism. there many that have been implicated and found but

61
00:07:28,535 --> 00:07:33,715
if you sort of some them all up you only get some small portion of cases that could be count

62
00:07:33,715 --> 00:07:39,116
for my jeans directly. but Larson because of this

63
00:07:39,116 --> 00:07:44,156
and both because things one so heavily towards genetic extent because it's really serious. I've got a

64
00:07:44,156 --> 00:07:50,176
refrigerator mother kind of an environmental exposure. and this is a couple that she's around.

65
00:07:50,176 --> 00:07:55,296
bye. bye. that hole in the way side

66
00:07:55,296 --> 00:08:01,416
and the scientific world. that made it very difficult studies and environmental factors.

67
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:06,696
either you or sort of week if it's relating that Ohio or you were you know one of these vaccine.

68
00:08:06,696 --> 00:08:11,756
praise science policy. those very hard to study environment at least one for

69
00:08:11,756 --> 00:08:16,756
genetics. since that's was only recently in the past maybe ten to fifteen

70
00:08:16,756 --> 00:08:21,856
years of people start to come back to this and consider the environment. it's potentially playing a role in in

71
00:08:21,856 --> 00:08:27,516
office. I will say that of course that early genetic studies that has the ability

72
00:08:27,516 --> 00:08:32,616
ninety percent or something like that but it was very very small. several others came after

73
00:08:32,616 --> 00:08:37,876
that. also just in general quite I heard ability but they're all very very small very small

74
00:08:37,876 --> 00:08:43,018
stuff so why don't you have a question about maybe there's a genetic

75
00:08:43,018 --> 00:08:48,458
water even bother sending that. bye. this is from

76
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:54,358
Israel. just trying to know.

77
00:08:54,358 --> 00:08:59,838
bye. bye. nine eight nine eight two. bye.

78
00:08:59,838 --> 00:09:04,858
this is Red Line office. this is Eddie Gay daddy.

79
00:09:04,858 --> 00:09:09,998
hey and you can see shooting.

80
00:09:09,998 --> 00:09:14,998
this will we're seeing all over the world that office. Helen and

81
00:09:14,998 --> 00:09:20,678
and so this is what's making it. you have chattering the attention of everybody.

82
00:09:20,678 --> 00:09:25,958
it is true that if this is not true but if this is

83
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:31,038
possible. bye. probably

84
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:36,058
play some role. this is something. a_lot_of day about

85
00:09:36,058 --> 00:09:41,802
what is on the line. Verizon offers on I was exciting up to switching his awareness about

86
00:09:41,802 --> 00:09:46,962
coming forward. for real file. that date

87
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:52,722
is not ended and I think it's some culmination of all those things. so it's hard to say that this necessarily

88
00:09:52,722 --> 00:09:57,822
says there has_to be final components. but it's a piece of the puzzle. I will also

89
00:09:57,822 --> 00:10:03,242
say that subsequent to that. both Louise in Madison. later. much much

90
00:10:03,242 --> 00:10:08,322
better. this is better. overall if he approaches to

91
00:10:08,322 --> 00:10:17,002
the same story. this is one California.

92
00:10:17,002 --> 00:10:23,962
so that was one out_of California. that

93
00:10:23,962 --> 00:10:29,402
that in fact suggested that the house about this. bye.

94
00:10:29,402 --> 00:10:35,082
oh seven one. all you

95
00:10:35,082 --> 00:10:40,112
kids right management also similar findings half and half. very

96
00:10:40,112 --> 00:10:45,232
more. maybe not quite as. I just wanted to environment side but still

97
00:10:45,232 --> 00:10:50,512
need my floor point study are now sort of changing the story bit from the early

98
00:10:50,512 --> 00:10:55,892
twin studies and saying actually you know it kinda looks like there maybe room for an important environmental

99
00:10:55,892 --> 00:11:00,972
components of this. again doesn't totally answer the question but it's it makes us wanna explore what's going

100
00:11:00,972 --> 00:11:05,992
on. so he said maybe that's it. bye.

101
00:11:05,992 --> 00:11:11,572
I'm now beginning to point to environment. there also some smaller studies in case reports of strategies

102
00:11:11,572 --> 00:11:16,832
that the mother is exposed to any vacancies or small case series. and also just suggest that

103
00:11:16,832 --> 00:11:21,992
something external to the body of the mother during pregnancy can lead to something that looks a_lot

104
00:11:21,992 --> 00:11:27,432
like autism. rebalance action for Linda my name is hopper Stall. these are all there also the stories

105
00:11:27,432 --> 00:11:32,732
behind these but the proof of concept here is it something in on

106
00:11:32,732 --> 00:11:37,820
environmental and that the mother is exposed to tens would be related to autism. there's

107
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:44,060
also a_lot_of immune and inflammatory just regulation and children with autism and of course

108
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:49,060
many study. this is a prime thing they do need confirmation because me and

109
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:54,520
reaction so if the idea that they would be involved in certainly certainly from

110
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:59,580
center set that up. the but

111
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:04,760
a_lot_of the day that is the idea that the pregnancy period maybe a very particular moment of

112
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:10,220
interest in this. the mother got I got it from him.

113
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:15,260
I got some dies I got it. but you have_to look at the difference between dots I got in trouble

114
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:20,380
right because they share the same jeans percentage of jeans in general but the only key

115
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:25,440
differences. I got a said in your environment and generally the numbers and this

116
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,560
is just the size I got made conference rates among siblings is higher than other

117
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,620
times. they're all a_lot_of jeans or exposure during pregnancy they also just trying to

118
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:42,484
see you're at in the sumner of pathology. it also suggest that something is occurring already.

119
00:12:42,484 --> 00:12:48,424
kids are gonna going to get office. so it's it's not up is an important. not important period.

120
00:12:48,424 --> 00:12:56,664
so that's it. bye. thanks. bye. status of

121
00:12:56,664 --> 00:13:01,744
the C5. the genetics much things are just way too

122
00:13:01,744 --> 00:13:07,164
much the medicine. people working final study. what how you guys got more

123
00:13:07,164 --> 00:13:12,164
labors and the parent community is actually saying with and we think something's going on and there

124
00:13:12,164 --> 00:13:17,304
will be some studies that came out there were several looking at different middle exposures

125
00:13:17,304 --> 00:13:22,524
the bottom tissue metal in here.

126
00:13:22,524 --> 00:13:27,664
see you're in whatever right. so that and they all had some claim about something

127
00:13:27,664 --> 00:13:32,704
being different between the kids about this and the kids without but they're huge. this is interesting in raising

128
00:13:32,704 --> 00:13:37,724
awareness here. she's got a_lot_of issues with this. all of them. largely very very

129
00:13:37,724 --> 00:13:42,784
small very question location control recruitment processes for all the of the students

130
00:13:42,784 --> 00:13:48,144
here. also something about. but also very very critically. they all suffered

131
00:13:48,144 --> 00:13:53,224
from the strong possibility of reverse position right which is if you're taking a blood sample from

132
00:13:53,224 --> 00:13:58,284
someone child at the office at eight seventy you're comparing that to the blood sample of

133
00:13:58,284 --> 00:14:03,444
another child does in our office. this is the. bye. bye. didn't

134
00:14:03,444 --> 00:14:08,764
go through but all the signs are but to with the office and but it's very very different. if you kids without office.

135
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:14,175
so they're actually by the fact. very different from about

136
00:14:14,175 --> 00:14:19,215
so the idea that you can take blood samples for my child's absence on that and see this. it's

137
00:14:19,215 --> 00:14:24,255
probably weird. thanks. see the difference is probably what you're gonna do in

138
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:29,375
any kind of samples because the disease itself affects their interaction with the environment.

139
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:34,495
that's what they get exposed to so they're going right in

140
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:39,515
that but that part of the office and it's still relatively rare so you know case control studies would like to

141
00:14:39,515 --> 00:14:44,615
go get some kids glasses and without compare them. it's it's hard to have a huge

142
00:14:44,615 --> 00:14:49,755
cohort. where no_one has a disease yet. you follow them forward. but this is sort

143
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:55,255
of the direction we're trying to go. later. following up for the small studies that were suggested

144
00:14:55,255 --> 00:15:00,275
by law to inform you better. obviously done

145
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:05,515
studies like the Child Study. California our seed. but they said they get around

146
00:15:05,515 --> 00:15:10,735
to be happy problems but they still have this funding up front that the recruit kids and I have office and they recruit you know

147
00:15:10,735 --> 00:15:16,445
kids are doing about this is first talk about issues. the

148
00:15:16,445 --> 00:15:21,605
problem that. so how do we deal with that. well this is this

149
00:15:21,605 --> 00:15:28,665
is why I think there has been more than two

150
00:15:28,665 --> 00:15:33,785
again today so far anyway. in the context of office. and

151
00:15:33,785 --> 00:15:39,525
and that's because of the way. so if you're careful action. and most importantly

152
00:15:39,525 --> 00:15:44,745
that we can separate that exposure estimates from an individual and stuff.

153
00:15:44,745 --> 00:15:50,245
so I'll go in to. this is a model of particular matter which is just kind of just in the air

154
00:15:50,245 --> 00:15:56,565
less than two and a half my phone the bye. have a nice

155
00:15:56,565 --> 00:16:01,805
holiday bye. and we can build models like this based on monitoring is going around.

156
00:16:01,805 --> 00:16:06,825
not whole country based on meter logical conditions and other plans. but

157
00:16:06,825 --> 00:16:12,125
importantly what I can for. the level of PM two point five in Baltimore

158
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:17,609
on a given day. given now whenever

159
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:23,349
Baltimore without any knowledge of an individual in my side. someone

160
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:28,809
from Baltimore. doesn't often separate

161
00:16:28,809 --> 00:16:34,069
this is Eastern exposure residence and so that takes away this huge problem of reverse because

162
00:16:34,069 --> 00:16:39,409
out to to a very large to me. so as I said I think

163
00:16:39,409 --> 00:16:44,949
that this is an area with a_lot_of work. many people looking at different aspects of air pollution.

164
00:16:44,949 --> 00:16:50,009
people of you CPA have toxic lease inventory is from industry there's you can just use distance to

165
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:55,289
rotor freeway. profit for traffic related pollution. there's this monitoring

166
00:16:55,289 --> 00:17:00,769
data around the country for criteria pollutants like PM or outside or things like that.

167
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:07,649
and then DPA also puts out his own model.

168
00:17:07,649 --> 00:17:12,989
across the United_States based on small version modeling and all certain points sources and things of that sort.

169
00:17:12,989 --> 00:17:18,669
and many many of have had to see some sort of association.

170
00:17:18,669 --> 00:17:23,689
one red. interesting. not. they are distinct from all of the

171
00:17:23,689 --> 00:17:28,749
others in that they're both in Europe and he's too anyways more he's still

172
00:17:28,749 --> 00:17:34,609
in our system. if you still have the cell one of the sweetest that he went on to do it

173
00:17:34,609 --> 00:17:40,669
with technical diagnosis and so we just did and also didn't see it but we can get into why why might later.

174
00:17:40,669 --> 00:17:45,669
so we did the one using the nurses health study here using the CPA modeling but

175
00:17:45,669 --> 00:17:51,009
one of the issues with a_lot_of is the resolution both in time and space

176
00:17:51,009 --> 00:17:56,249
that exposure and but the thing that I wanted to talk to you about today's critical windows

177
00:17:56,249 --> 00:18:01,249
of exposure and when the exposure matters and how important that is not only via logically but

178
00:18:01,249 --> 00:18:06,329
also Abilene logic way answer for that we needed. for more detail in terms

179
00:18:06,329 --> 00:18:11,589
of both space and time of exposures. then we had previously. so that's

180
00:18:11,589 --> 00:18:17,219
the main work that I need to talk to you about today. this is

181
00:18:17,219 --> 00:18:22,759
mind Ron on Ross. looking in the nurses health study too. so Harvard has

182
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:27,939
a very large nurses power. this is health study to was over. started in nineteen

183
00:18:27,939 --> 00:18:33,219
eighty nine. more than a hundred thousand female nurse is originally from fourteen states but now they've moved across

184
00:18:33,219 --> 00:18:38,259
the entire US and they were about twenty five forty two years when they recruited

185
00:18:38,259 --> 00:18:43,359
in nineteen eighty nine. so we decided that we could come along and actually find out

186
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:48,679
from the nurses whether they have some study there. so in two thousand and five.

187
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:53,679
we introduced the questions. I shall say if you're not maybe nurses right start to nineteen ninety

188
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:59,139
every two years I sent an extensive questionnaire. they said out on my side

189
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:04,159
I had also two different things and the also indicate whether they have certain diseases and if

190
00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:09,179
they do that's followed up and we verify that they had us in the office and the

191
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:14,179
children was not one of these things and that is an issue that is important to the nurses health study or

192
00:19:14,179 --> 00:19:19,513
set up to look at the health of the nurse not the health of the children which causes some issues

193
00:19:19,513 --> 00:19:24,573
and we're trying to left the children. we can get into but. Obama has it in two thousand five. we

194
00:19:24,573 --> 00:19:29,833
entered into the regular questionnaire did the nurse have any children with autism and we called autism

195
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:34,833
ass burgers syndrome works. other office and spectrum disorder. and we got eight

196
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:40,033
hundred thirty Adam reporting that they did. I just had a problem with starting the house of the nurses

197
00:19:40,033 --> 00:19:45,953
not their kids is at this stage then you know when you see if you're there. this is.

198
00:19:45,953 --> 00:19:51,293
need you to get together. bye. status on the questionnaire. bye. so

199
00:19:51,293 --> 00:19:56,579
that was all God. why do you have a kid with autism and actually asked a few other disorders but

200
00:19:56,579 --> 00:20:01,939
we didn't get very very important information like which did. when we did for

201
00:20:01,939 --> 00:20:07,839
anything else about the kids. so I was slightly slightly problematic but so what we were able to do

202
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:12,879
is follow up with anything or any of them. they're also our paper

203
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:17,879
rules about who you're allowed to follow up with extra surveys but for most of them we can said yes

204
00:20:17,879 --> 00:20:23,139
I have a child with this order. we followed follow up with something on a questionnaire. a_lot_of

205
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:28,239
to find out which did one other details very specific

206
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:33,559
details about the child's life. whether they had sort of other genetic type conditions

207
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:38,739
that may ask for. who made a diagnosis. things

208
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:44,099
of that sort. and we also had to follow up with a certain number of control

209
00:20:44,099 --> 00:20:53,259
kids mother she said they didn't have any kids about this and because those mother. also we have no.

210
00:20:53,259 --> 00:20:58,290
so we so for that for the study and who did that for all of those when we could

211
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:03,530
follow up with six hundred and thirty six of them which was an eighty four percent participation of those

212
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:08,830
we were allowed to contact. ninety percent to station the controls almost three thousand of them.

213
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:13,870
then we start to lose them. in terms of who we can use an analysis and the main reason we lose them

214
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:19,030
is that the child was born before nineteen eighty nine. and the reason we have_to get rid of those because we're we're

215
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:24,050
signing exposure based on where the mother's residence. we know that while she's

216
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:29,070
in the study because I mail these questionnaires all the time but prior to that we don't know and then we

217
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:34,850
lose a few others because they had some of these rare genetic conditions or you know a handful.

218
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:39,870
actually where the residence was using but in the end round up with

219
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:44,910
two or forty five cases and in the little over fifteen hundred controls with much more specific

220
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:50,030
date and now on exact birthday. who has autism. but it was confirmed

221
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:55,836
things of that sort. so a little on the

222
00:21:55,836 --> 00:22:02,996
hey seven this is the office. I know you don't have a file.

223
00:22:02,996 --> 00:22:08,036
this is a research gold standard is a very very indexed personal interview.

224
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:13,236
it takes three or four hours with the child. not possible for

225
00:22:13,236 --> 00:22:18,417
a study of nurses around the United_States. however we decided to give me

226
00:22:18,417 --> 00:22:23,736
a small validation which was administered last type. this is the office and diagnostic interview revised

227
00:22:23,736 --> 00:22:31,297
a D I R. my telephone to a subset of women.

228
00:22:31,297 --> 00:22:36,856
we we got quite a good correlation here validation

229
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:42,256
I would say. so forty three fifty years or

230
00:22:42,256 --> 00:22:47,396
eighty six percent match full fact area for autism. and this is autism not

231
00:22:47,396 --> 00:22:52,616
is is the spectrum and a full criteria and the IR is really the core office Tina

232
00:22:52,616 --> 00:22:58,068
type and so the spectrum even includes things that don't quite meet the office.

233
00:22:58,068 --> 00:23:03,068
and if you have another ten percent of these kids missed that part for cut off flight

234
00:23:03,068 --> 00:23:08,168
one point on one of three different sales. and the other two kids. clearly with of

235
00:23:08,168 --> 00:23:13,308
quite. so they were not typically developing children so.

236
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:18,808
so they gave us comfort that we were getting pretty good information from the mother

237
00:23:18,808 --> 00:23:24,389
on the top. there is also separate data by others. this mothers report.

238
00:23:24,389 --> 00:23:29,568
the child is reasonably good and we have the additional

239
00:23:29,568 --> 00:23:34,729
benefits of all of our mothers nurses at American Family Services.

240
00:23:34,729 --> 00:23:40,448
understand what this means. I talked a little bit about the

241
00:23:40,448 --> 00:23:45,688
substance of these are models that were developed. this is a paper by Jeff you know Steve

242
00:23:45,688 --> 00:23:52,889
was in the groups of two pretty models along with friends and waiting and others at Palm Harbor.

243
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:58,203
on Monday gator game owners press hey it's brother monitors from different studies that happened

244
00:23:58,203 --> 00:24:03,402
to face in different places. meter logical conditions and in the whole collection of land

245
00:24:03,402 --> 00:24:08,443
use characteristics for this evening. things of that sort. eight eight. thinking I didn't

246
00:24:08,443 --> 00:24:13,443
talk about some of the problems of the earlier push the other air pollution estimates that we use but this is really nice to

247
00:24:13,443 --> 00:24:18,863
the concert of be in her validated you can build the model based on all monitors except for say ten percent

248
00:24:18,863 --> 00:24:24,762
and you can see how for dismissal monitors. how about it.

249
00:24:24,762 --> 00:24:30,142
but it's a very high validated model that's gone through a_lot and if the models that have been used extensively

250
00:24:30,142 --> 00:24:35,142
to show you know p.m.. this is p.m. two. five is also PM tens like a

251
00:24:35,142 --> 00:24:40,343
larger fraction. have a place over on mortality and

252
00:24:40,343 --> 00:24:45,483
EPA regulations. as they currently exist. are based to

253
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:50,642
a large degree and a_lot_of work with come out_of these models in the harvest they have

254
00:24:50,642 --> 00:24:55,682
been applied to something like this before. so this is a new application of them and we as I said link the

255
00:24:55,682 --> 00:25:01,398
exposure to any point time. residence this is the nurses residence.

256
00:25:01,398 --> 00:25:06,458
to an individual nurse. we have_to have on monthly intervals and just an hours that way

257
00:25:06,458 --> 00:25:11,478
you could do much final but we are had his month in the road so we use that. so we're gonna do then

258
00:25:11,478 --> 00:25:19,339
with that be able to look at specifically exposures during the nine months of pregnancy.

259
00:25:19,339 --> 00:25:26,278
so it allows us to play a_lot with varying exposures in in time and space.

260
00:25:26,278 --> 00:25:32,378
again. so when there are some minor issues with using self study and that is

261
00:25:32,378 --> 00:25:37,558
one of them is that we know when they get the questionnaire to return the questionnaire.

262
00:25:37,558 --> 00:25:42,578
there's a possibility that somebody moves between the time they got one question nineteen

263
00:25:42,578 --> 00:25:47,719
ninety one and return just the next one the next ninety three and if the pregnancy occurs

264
00:25:47,719 --> 00:25:52,798
during those two. we're not quite sure where business wise. classes actually. bye.

265
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:58,895
bye so we need

266
00:25:58,895 --> 00:26:04,234
to run different models one model I assume if the nurse did move between you know

267
00:26:04,234 --> 00:26:09,395
over the before and after the question before and after pregnancy. we would look at

268
00:26:09,395 --> 00:26:14,895
seems you the first address. do another analysis of some issues at the second or the third one.

269
00:26:14,895 --> 00:26:19,974
only restricted to women who did not move across their pregnancy assuming that you know we can't really know

270
00:26:19,974 --> 00:26:25,195
where they are at the time of the pregnancy. so just you know

271
00:26:25,195 --> 00:26:30,555
typical statistics up. just the just a rush and we're looking at p.m. and four tiles or as a continuous

272
00:26:30,555 --> 00:26:35,895
measure. we I gonna go and all this so an important

273
00:26:35,895 --> 00:26:41,375
part is of course. this is house that he has a CD boxes. also to date on woman now.

274
00:26:41,375 --> 00:26:46,654
not quite so much about the pregnancy but there are some additional pregnancy question as we get information but

275
00:26:46,654 --> 00:26:52,015
there's a_lot_of extra information for the nurses cohort that we can use to adjust for compound found.

276
00:26:52,015 --> 00:26:57,135
but I want you to keep that in mind because this is one of the important message points I'm gonna

277
00:26:57,135 --> 00:27:02,154
come by. about what about what Bible.

278
00:27:02,154 --> 00:27:07,194
in fact now we have a_lot_of extra data. and I tell you I still battles and the nurses health study

279
00:27:07,194 --> 00:27:12,214
meetings where we present results and I haven't adjusted for something and they scream and yell at me they

280
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:17,834
say over. that's what that's why the is also good you have all. just for and I

281
00:27:17,834 --> 00:27:22,954
say. I don't think it's actually in founder and it would be in the State of Florida. so we have

282
00:27:22,954 --> 00:27:28,255
two people that I have_to try and convince that I'm going to try to convince you that some of this doesn't necessarily need to be.

283
00:27:28,255 --> 00:27:33,392
bye. happy day this is a snap shot of who

284
00:27:33,392 --> 00:27:38,412
these kids are off I didn't save any remaining you know if they have a lead mail skewed

285
00:27:38,412 --> 00:27:43,512
disorder. so it's about four to one or so. we see that in our data. eighty

286
00:27:43,512 --> 00:27:49,012
five percent of the kids them. we're mail half of the kids out is more mail.

287
00:27:49,012 --> 00:27:54,012
you see slightly older parents that's also something that is often seen and if you in literature

288
00:27:54,012 --> 00:27:59,512
on autism and you see slightly higher income in the family.

289
00:27:59,512 --> 00:28:05,172
have lots of them. also something in. we pretty

290
00:28:05,172 --> 00:28:10,372
strongly. I do feel that that is an asset payment issue or a Health Care access.

291
00:28:10,372 --> 00:28:15,652
when you go to vendors like Denmark or other places where there's more National Health Care. don't tend to see

292
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:20,672
that. yes greetings it's in the same way in the US is pretty strike that you see it but higher

293
00:28:20,672 --> 00:28:26,312
SES. no that's right. these are all nurses in the US. so it's a sort of clearly more restricted.

294
00:28:26,312 --> 00:28:32,142
let me there's a variety but it's not like the general

295
00:28:32,142 --> 00:28:37,342
this is a Mister basic characteristics by a particular matter p.m. two point five core

296
00:28:37,342 --> 00:28:42,342
tile. one support. one is the lowest. this is not a exposure of the nurses. court four

297
00:28:42,342 --> 00:28:47,442
would be the highest. you know it's one thing to point out here is that in that year of birth

298
00:28:47,442 --> 00:28:52,902
of the child. it goes down as you get to the higher four thousand p.m.. because

299
00:28:52,902 --> 00:28:58,142
we're actually been doing a reasonable job of bringing down here. so over the the positions

300
00:28:58,142 --> 00:29:05,822
come down. so the kids were born more in the morning early.

301
00:29:05,822 --> 00:29:11,162
okay so let me see I'm gonna cut right to the chase looking now at

302
00:29:11,162 --> 00:29:16,282
air pollution p.m.. two one five room nine months of pregnancy. and the office

303
00:29:16,282 --> 00:29:22,442
heading out to them and some others lives.

304
00:29:22,442 --> 00:29:28,008
Stan here. alright so we have in the different columns

305
00:29:28,008 --> 00:29:33,408
are. yes you know if the nurse moves between the two questionnaires.

306
00:29:33,408 --> 00:29:38,988
between over the course of the pregnancy. the first call is assuming she was at the first address the second column

307
00:29:38,988 --> 00:29:44,168
is the same issue with the second address and the third call is restricted to about thirty five. you have

308
00:29:44,168 --> 00:29:49,448
sixty five percent of C controls it didn't move over the course the price. we're much

309
00:29:49,448 --> 00:29:54,568
about where they were at the first row is looking at PM two. five that's

310
00:29:54,568 --> 00:29:59,888
fine. would you find a way. if you started monitoring for PM ten

311
00:29:59,888 --> 00:30:04,908
for those of you know and don't panic with five monitors for only later in

312
00:30:04,908 --> 00:30:10,048
part because it's been changed to start to come clear that p.m. two. five was more of problem right. so

313
00:30:10,048 --> 00:30:15,188
it's more just the part of your long. it seems to have more

314
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:20,408
settings. p.m. tennis in the in the bottom row here and so with this one by four tile

315
00:30:20,408 --> 00:30:25,408
of the PM exposure but I spend ten two twenty five. and actually this is not

316
00:30:25,408 --> 00:30:30,787
exactly ten the two. five. large two. five.

317
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:36,227
we really don't see any relation with the office but for the PM two point five five.

318
00:30:36,227 --> 00:30:42,188
as the quarter pallet exposure gets higher. we see a higher divorce.

319
00:30:42,188 --> 00:30:48,267
this is for the nine months. of course I want

320
00:30:48,267 --> 00:30:53,607
there so a rather strong association between PM two point five

321
00:30:53,607 --> 00:30:58,607
and the mothers the. so what I'm saying here's how just

322
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:04,767
work out for you. this is the Andre show for

323
00:31:04,767 --> 00:31:09,767
three. Sunday and for PM two point five and that was about five.

324
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:14,848
my again specific meters of each time you go up about five. Mike against receiving meters in

325
00:31:14,848 --> 00:31:20,568
solution one five. this is the amount. also have a job process and

326
00:31:20,568 --> 00:31:25,968
what we got here at nine months before pregnancy pregnancy period and the nine months.

327
00:31:25,968 --> 00:31:31,690
so just average those exposures we have_to those different time period first comp I adjusted.

328
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:36,730
this is adjusted but these two columns are running these separately Risa this is one

329
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:45,070
model for the ninth exposure nine month before pregnancy. separate models.

330
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:50,290
the last column that is putting on and off. okay so I must before

331
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:55,370
after and during in the model together and this is my cell phone back

332
00:31:55,370 --> 00:32:01,010
to you again. I think about

333
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:06,670
what you see here. we have really

334
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:12,490
limited our focus on the pregnancy period itself. and in fact the other two period essentially go away.

335
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:17,950
alright. so I mean the rationale for this is as if you're looking just for the nine months for pregnancy

336
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:23,230
air pollution almost wherever you are just correlated over time. so you're gonna get exposure today

337
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:28,790
or gonna be meeting with. so it's tomorrow and not even a month.

338
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:34,236
so association here with the prepaid pre- pregnancy nine months basically be that that is correlated

339
00:32:34,236 --> 00:32:39,556
with the pregnancy period. and it's actually a pretty secured matters but you're catching no early

340
00:32:39,556 --> 00:32:44,656
hanger on this with Jeff that is really the pregnancy period not the periods before

341
00:32:44,656 --> 00:32:49,676
and after. we also look at trimester the pregnancy. this is again in

342
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:54,736
ten to five of ten and two. five. Justin for various things during pregnancy. all

343
00:32:54,736 --> 00:33:00,396
trimester is looked reasonably elevated with the third being a little stronger but if you put them all in all together.

344
00:33:00,396 --> 00:33:06,896
through the third trimester are phone ways.

345
00:33:06,896 --> 00:33:12,116
this study along with almost the same time in which our printer publish

346
00:33:12,116 --> 00:33:17,190
study in this is the California Milwaukee area.

347
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:22,450
we are in County Court and I forget which board it was. I'm also looking

348
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:27,450
specifically at the time of the

349
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:33,010
year. after a period things like that but never initially address is model.

350
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:38,110
Amy did it and usually just models and also found that the third phone message seem to be a potentially

351
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:43,170
relevant period of time. for the relation between the PM and office

352
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:48,450
and what I'm wanna with you in the next message the part of this is very important

353
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:53,870
for many reasons for that. just a few extra things right. this is mousy

354
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:59,630
really don't get any changes in our results. if we additionally things like smoking during pregnancy.

355
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:04,810
you need your birth station diabetes frequency affecting your birth weight state and census

356
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:09,870
house. senses track house value issues or marital status population

357
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:15,617
density versus is pretty robust to a whole whole slew of other types

358
00:34:15,617 --> 00:34:20,797
announce the patient. so before

359
00:34:20,797 --> 00:34:25,817
I get in. bye. this is

360
00:34:25,817 --> 00:34:31,037
a big right we are signing exposure to the mother based on her every household residence.

361
00:34:31,037 --> 00:34:36,037
you spend all her time there. it's a model exposure it's not actually with the monitor out her

362
00:34:36,037 --> 00:34:41,297
household. it's outdoor estimates right to spend a_lot_of time indoors. sometimes

363
00:34:41,297 --> 00:34:46,577
you know the exact date of the movie she move but the results in rather with us different sensitivity

364
00:34:46,577 --> 00:34:51,717
and else is around that. this issue of time at home versus elsewhere that was is a big one right

365
00:34:51,717 --> 00:34:57,057
I mean you don't spend all your time at your house and we're estimating your exposure there.

366
00:34:57,057 --> 00:35:02,137
so all of those. so I would say including the ones that are on the outcome side

367
00:35:02,137 --> 00:35:07,597
that maybe we have some it's classification I think the validations. just forgot about the various exposure

368
00:35:07,597 --> 00:35:13,297
class station or even some space at payment. if we have some

369
00:35:13,297 --> 00:35:18,349
probably unrelated the other alarm.

370
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:23,829
so my guess is pretty reasonable so many fires she would be towards the know

371
00:35:23,829 --> 00:35:29,109
yet we still saw something but the last one of course is a big bugaboo that the genealogy

372
00:35:29,109 --> 00:35:34,149
is you residual component maybe we can confirm up an account for something and I can go

373
00:35:34,149 --> 00:35:39,549
any direction and maybe that is actually accounting for finding. but this is where the specificity of the time

374
00:35:39,549 --> 00:35:44,709
period. it's usually important for us. it's important but obviously through

375
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:50,009
to get this approved. this is a trimester of pregnancy

376
00:35:50,009 --> 00:35:55,129
it's medicine importance in Genesis and in the beginning of snaps formation in the brain. it's important for

377
00:35:55,129 --> 00:36:00,329
the. this is Brian with Mike

378
00:36:00,329 --> 00:36:05,369
we and set up those my could be of service. react the way they're gonna react. so it's biological is a very

379
00:36:05,369 --> 00:36:10,929
important time period and that would be important to know if it's true. obviously it's really important. also

380
00:36:10,929 --> 00:36:19,153
because it has very strong invitations about potential and sound. bye-bye

381
00:36:19,153 --> 00:36:25,193
so I have somebody but if you get Jack to your direct basically graph

382
00:36:25,193 --> 00:36:30,353
exposure. I got said about

383
00:36:30,353 --> 00:36:35,492
it later but don't really need to know much about

384
00:36:35,492 --> 00:36:41,153
it. I'll see you in Park session just the pitching possible relation between.

385
00:36:41,153 --> 00:36:50,992
bye. so can Valley would be something like a few variable here. that is

386
00:36:50,992 --> 00:37:00,512
that your variable

387
00:37:00,512 --> 00:37:05,833
right. that maybe related to both p.m. and the first trimester and PM

388
00:37:05,833 --> 00:37:11,373
and the third trimester of pregnancy. we can think of many guys standing by.

389
00:37:11,373 --> 00:37:16,992
also related in some way to this order. we got a statistical

390
00:37:16,992 --> 00:37:22,175
association between p.m. in the first semester or third trimester and the outcome. it is not calls

391
00:37:22,175 --> 00:37:27,555
all and that there is I pick it there's no arrow from p.m. one or three to the house.

392
00:37:27,555 --> 00:37:32,715
so I'm sitting here there's no possible association that I would see if difficult one because of the few variables

393
00:37:32,715 --> 00:37:38,115
and I could be you know such economic stuff. that that is a strong term. we're

394
00:37:38,115 --> 00:37:43,155
probably a solution therefore you got exposed to. let's say that that's related to your

395
00:37:43,155 --> 00:37:48,835
likelihood of taking so late in we think for late is very important for all go on and taking a note from you. bye-bye.

396
00:37:48,835 --> 00:37:54,415
pregnancy and so that maybe related office and so this is a classic potential.

397
00:37:54,415 --> 00:37:59,415
we try and measure aspects of social economic status and adjust for it. so we take

398
00:37:59,415 --> 00:38:04,715
it out_of the equation here but we're never totally sure right. can you convince

399
00:38:04,715 --> 00:38:10,155
me on you know. bye. so it's

400
00:38:10,155 --> 00:38:15,855
it's a concern. the

401
00:38:15,855 --> 00:38:20,997
first trimester that maybe the way by which. so checking on the status is related to

402
00:38:20,997 --> 00:38:25,997
developing office and that is you know that also happens to be related

403
00:38:25,997 --> 00:38:30,997
to p.m. in the third trimester. even though it's full of taking the first trimester just because it's compounded by us

404
00:38:30,997 --> 00:38:36,357
yes but those two are related. the problem is that any factors

405
00:38:36,357 --> 00:38:41,357
measured or not. and that also means not even known about. but you may

406
00:38:41,357 --> 00:38:46,777
not even understand what really happens in the real world. but any factor

407
00:38:46,777 --> 00:38:52,277
that is. that affects both p.m. in the first trimester and p.m. in the third trimester

408
00:38:52,277 --> 00:38:58,137
will be will have_to be ruled out. if you're only seen the association

409
00:38:58,137 --> 00:39:03,217
with one of these and a model that includes both. alright. and

410
00:39:03,217 --> 00:39:08,217
this relates to. so. so. so in this case. it's SCS press just

411
00:39:08,217 --> 00:39:13,657
to confirm via. but I'll be here for waiting for semester. if we can finally both

412
00:39:13,657 --> 00:39:18,977
be in the first semester. and if you move the trucks and so if you help PM in the third trimester constant

413
00:39:18,977 --> 00:39:24,151
and didn't allow it to vary you should still see association PM first. but we didn't

414
00:39:24,151 --> 00:39:29,231
see that in the all that had both of them together. both them together means I'm holding PM third. bye.

415
00:39:29,231 --> 00:39:34,351
so. so with that said yes is that instead. you have you

416
00:39:34,351 --> 00:39:39,571
probably have a structure that looks like that's right. if you I'm third is actually the third semester

417
00:39:39,571 --> 00:39:44,571
possibly later. bye. and you hold that. now you're not gonna see an

418
00:39:44,571 --> 00:39:49,691
association with p.m. because here for you not causing houses

419
00:39:49,691 --> 00:39:54,791
in second. so the only reason I see something when I look at p.m. in the first is it that for

420
00:39:54,791 --> 00:40:00,031
later in the p.m. and the third which is this is it. alright. so the fact that it's only

421
00:40:00,031 --> 00:40:05,071
seen in one critical window or one time period exposure period. and not the other

422
00:40:05,071 --> 00:40:10,151
one there in the model together. implies this type of situation is going

423
00:40:10,151 --> 00:40:15,171
on or something more to do that we're only one of them would be related. this is

424
00:40:15,171 --> 00:40:21,671
eight eight. expansion in editing all these calls. come to the next control exposure.

425
00:40:21,671 --> 00:40:27,071
finish what is done in the lab. all the time right if you wanna look at drug action

426
00:40:27,071 --> 00:40:32,131
with the drug actuals. you're not on of choice. you put your on

427
00:40:32,131 --> 00:40:37,531
choice in a dish. you had dry grass. you said is on. alright. John

428
00:40:37,531 --> 00:40:42,851
dies. do you conclude the drug test Hills. no

429
00:40:42,851 --> 00:40:48,211
not yet. you know there's always

430
00:40:48,211 --> 00:40:53,231
something headed on that small stuff. you better make sure that all that extra stuff.

431
00:40:53,231 --> 00:40:58,868
this is what till set up. so you would just put the and do the same process again. so

432
00:40:58,868 --> 00:41:03,988
call on this thing. thanks. this is this is the DNS on this

433
00:41:03,988 --> 00:41:09,148
case is a negative control exposure and if you if you see the cell died. when you put do that.

434
00:41:09,148 --> 00:41:14,308
can you check included it was your drug exit. alright. you wanna see that it doesn't kill the cell over here

435
00:41:14,308 --> 00:41:19,388
if you just do the so and now you're left to the conclusion that it was dry got chills myself. this

436
00:41:19,388 --> 00:41:25,788
is the concept in happening healthy and it will perform.

437
00:41:25,788 --> 00:41:31,088
this you and others Dana Flanders. who

438
00:41:31,088 --> 00:41:36,468
looked out in the air pollution contacts down at Emery. I just thought this is the ideal

439
00:41:36,468 --> 00:41:41,908
scenario and you have your phone. okay.

440
00:41:41,908 --> 00:41:50,708
why. telephone message. bye-bye. bye.

441
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:56,230
happy dad. Harlan you possible. see you hey

442
00:41:56,230 --> 00:42:01,550
this is Sharon. seeing

443
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:06,810
if you know that you're here. thanks. bye.

444
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:12,690
hey you know you got call. but if you put them all together.

445
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:17,950
see you. bye. bye something. I miss you. if you don't see an association

446
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:23,190
fee. the you know absence crazy or scenarios you can generally

447
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:28,250
conclude that you don't have that on measured and found. so anyway as

448
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:33,270
I said that was let's this another I on that. we recently extended that this

449
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:40,170
past year this. this is the deal scenario where you had

450
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:45,510
any plans at all use as an example of zone and asthma.

451
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:50,570
Vincent Hospital. I was on the day after the other. alright which we all as soon

452
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:55,730
doesn't possible. as of the day before. so it's an idea and I a control that you know I can't have called you have come

453
00:42:55,730 --> 00:43:00,752
the day before and shows is very what what what I did. here with the

454
00:43:00,752 --> 00:43:07,532
show that under with only minimal other assumptions that are not that hard to meet. if you

455
00:43:07,532 --> 00:43:12,572
don't know something is late or not. the first trimester. that's not an idea one because

456
00:43:12,572 --> 00:43:17,612
it could in theory be related to the outcome. but after the fact once you done your model if you see that that

457
00:43:17,612 --> 00:43:22,672
is normal. it's basically the same assumptions to say that one is actually acting in your model like a

458
00:43:22,672 --> 00:43:27,692
negative control exposure in telling you the same thing which is that you don't happen found the things that

459
00:43:27,692 --> 00:43:33,372
affect the end of the semester.

460
00:43:33,372 --> 00:43:38,852
so alright time. Barry and. so that is a problem right. so

461
00:43:38,852 --> 00:43:45,392
this would if we happen

462
00:43:45,392 --> 00:43:50,632
but I pulled up a whole new thing here that was it. so give me a call

463
00:43:50,632 --> 00:43:56,832
if you have something like be in the first message somebody. sorry. bye.

464
00:43:56,832 --> 00:44:03,450
bye this is

465
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:08,510
not the first. these things could be found right because they're separate by trimester. so you might have

466
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:13,630
something here. nothing there and if this is something that let me to see in association with

467
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:18,750
p.m. in the third trimester. so that's that's that it's hard to rule out any in fact one of the things

468
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:24,210
that may very well be happening. things that would fit this bill or other flu other.

469
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:30,010
in fact p.m.. if you get a matter I said it's just the stuff in here right that's just an overall measure

470
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:35,650
of the new bus. you know all sort of different components

471
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:41,110
and it that may differ in in in Arbor from LA or from Boston and so it maybe a particular component

472
00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:46,210
that p.m.. it is varying along with the PM five trimester. that could happen the fact

473
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:51,370
that we can't rule out and we do need to try and figure out is there a particular part of the PM. that's

474
00:44:51,370 --> 00:44:56,390
definitely an issue. but I'm trying to question everybody

475
00:44:56,390 --> 00:45:02,874
at this point which is one five three. hey this is so cold.

476
00:45:02,874 --> 00:45:08,334
she's not gonna wanna

477
00:45:08,334 --> 00:45:13,494
do the same thing for enforcement. so that will be very different

478
00:45:13,494 --> 00:45:19,854
mother in this message. is that a problem.

479
00:45:19,854 --> 00:45:24,874
maybe maybe the second level of physical activity maybe that's related on his own. maybe affects where

480
00:45:24,874 --> 00:45:30,594
she goes other exposure she just actually out_of them who knows right. so

481
00:45:30,594 --> 00:45:36,074
this is another issue which relates to anybody.

482
00:45:36,074 --> 00:45:41,114
I'm the concept of instrument about. and and how things are related to each other and I

483
00:45:41,114 --> 00:45:46,174
wanna go and you're more than that because it would take too long but this important point here is what we are actually measuring as

484
00:45:46,174 --> 00:45:52,314
our exposure is Andy mother.

485
00:45:52,314 --> 00:46:33,512
we are not this person on. bye

486
00:46:33,512 --> 00:46:38,832
home right. but all those all those behaviors are personal behaviors

487
00:46:38,832 --> 00:46:44,172
that may through many complicated weather. have a relation to the outcome that are very

488
00:46:44,172 --> 00:46:49,432
very hard. the total again. so be alright actually

489
00:46:49,432 --> 00:46:55,132
you personally. we are gonna be far more susceptible to consignment.

490
00:46:55,132 --> 00:47:00,252
we going because of weather and therefore

491
00:47:00,252 --> 00:47:05,272
internal exposed on your internal file whatever it is. it is affected by how you

492
00:47:05,272 --> 00:47:10,732
decide whether you go to lunch here. you take a trip there. you can buy a car when you can. bye-bye. bye.

493
00:47:10,732 --> 00:47:17,952
all things complete handle.

494
00:47:17,952 --> 00:47:23,252
Andy will present the personal exposure. but happy

495
00:47:23,252 --> 00:47:28,292
world Harlan this is gonna collide her and it's got two things to protect your rights

496
00:47:28,292 --> 00:47:34,589
in the important thing to know here is that. as this behavior is very

497
00:47:34,589 --> 00:47:39,609
as I said in the beginning of I letter it. they don't affect that price. you

498
00:47:39,609 --> 00:47:44,849
cannot and found. they do not affect the Ambien. that's

499
00:47:44,849 --> 00:47:50,649
right. this is the identical concept accepted. completely

500
00:47:50,649 --> 00:47:56,329
grandma's profile. when you read my profile. the

501
00:47:56,329 --> 00:48:01,609
preferred of the hospital. the one that is the least biased analysis

502
00:48:01,609 --> 00:48:06,749
that ran in my status in intention to treat trial right now that

503
00:48:06,749 --> 00:48:12,549
is. you simply analyze whether you assign someone to take your

504
00:48:12,549 --> 00:48:17,769
and you ignore entirely behaviors life. whether they actually for.

505
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:23,189
and the reason you do that this as soon as you start to analyze whether they actually just the drug levels

506
00:48:23,189 --> 00:48:28,869
of what you are opening up the whole house. bye. bye. you better

507
00:48:28,869 --> 00:48:34,441
be confident you were controlling and you may wanna so. so

508
00:48:34,441 --> 00:48:40,261
that's what we discussed in the paper it's coming up. awful long time.

509
00:48:40,261 --> 00:48:45,261
so I think this has important applications and I don't wanna say that we need to go waste disposal.

510
00:48:45,261 --> 00:48:50,281
in addition to doing. that's usually important. we all. we do wanna keep in mind.

511
00:48:50,281 --> 00:48:55,461
what happens when you're looking at all the personal measures and what can affect them. and if you had models

512
00:48:55,461 --> 00:49:00,841
of things. you can get around some of this potential compounding that maybe harder

513
00:49:00,841 --> 00:49:06,801
to address. when it something related to person. that's

514
00:49:06,801 --> 00:49:12,781
one fifty. Michigan time.

515
00:49:12,781 --> 00:49:17,961
so there is one another. okay. take with me here because this this

516
00:49:17,961 --> 00:49:23,441
is Burke it's really wonky in a little a little counter intuitive I think. but I'm gonna try and go through it

517
00:49:23,441 --> 00:49:28,521
because I had told you the total for. bye. and what is I'm told told to us about

518
00:49:28,521 --> 00:49:33,713
this is this this is. if you gonna use Andy exposure estimate. right we wanna

519
00:49:33,713 --> 00:49:38,753
be pretty confident that they do predict personal exposure reasonably well. alright and

520
00:49:38,753 --> 00:49:49,173
we all are aware of that did not do it perfect. this is the whole measurement and everything.

521
00:49:49,173 --> 00:49:54,193
but we had a slight problem here right which is that how well my estimate of

522
00:49:54,193 --> 00:49:59,273
your pollution at your address predicts you are actually actual personal exposure in any month.

523
00:49:59,273 --> 00:50:04,393
we'll absolutely depend on how often you are outside the house. how you commute to work. where

524
00:50:04,393 --> 00:50:09,593
you go to Florida for the whole month. right. that's is gonna affect the correlation

525
00:50:09,593 --> 00:50:15,073
between. so you know that may differ by trimester.

526
00:50:15,073 --> 00:50:20,513
so I may have in fact because of these personal behaviors. the worst prevention of your exposure

527
00:50:20,513 --> 00:50:25,753
in the first semester. second argument.

528
00:50:25,753 --> 00:50:30,993
and if that's the case. right now my estimate is predicting for some exposure

529
00:50:30,993 --> 00:50:36,195
worse I have more measurement let's just say the moment it's. it's it's not differential and with viruses

530
00:50:36,195 --> 00:50:41,295
and all. so it looks like all you got nothing in the first trimester. because your

531
00:50:41,295 --> 00:50:46,315
estimate is not as good of the personal measurement. as it is in the third trimester when the woman is

532
00:50:46,315 --> 00:50:51,375
really big and just either alternate. bye. so that is

533
00:50:51,375 --> 00:50:57,115
true. that is the problem that I can create a difference between the things but in

534
00:50:57,115 --> 00:51:02,135
most likely that is gonna be on differential. I don't know what we're doing.

535
00:51:02,135 --> 00:51:07,315
I think we know we could come up with. maybe it's different but I think I think it's it's reasonable to assume that

536
00:51:07,315 --> 00:51:12,515
it's lost in on the financial end but there four five. that is what I saw

537
00:51:12,515 --> 00:51:17,895
right up the two and together we don't see anything here here. so maybe just five

538
00:51:17,895 --> 00:51:24,555
something all because of my in perfect measure assessment of her actual purchase.

539
00:51:24,555 --> 00:51:30,959
so that argument on hold and would be true. but only

540
00:51:30,959 --> 00:51:36,339
there really is an association between the personal exposure and the outcome.

541
00:51:36,339 --> 00:51:41,539
okay. because you can only have this. this is

542
00:51:41,539 --> 00:51:47,939
the perfect measurement of that affects the outcome. if this really does. thank you.

543
00:51:47,939 --> 00:51:54,479
bye. bye for the now. if it's not all. there's nothing there isn't gonna do it.

544
00:51:54,479 --> 00:51:59,499
so that's the time. that's missing. so I'm not totally

545
00:51:59,499 --> 00:52:04,519
convince the third trimester. Ashley still thinking it. I don't think these are huge things but but

546
00:52:04,519 --> 00:52:10,059
it is a little weird that you can get this in area where it could affect it but if it's gonna affect that you have the first part you have_to

547
00:52:10,059 --> 00:52:15,079
have another line aspect of that argument that there is a real association to be bias to the

548
00:52:15,079 --> 00:52:20,339
know. bye. okay so hopefully

549
00:52:20,339 --> 00:52:25,399
we'll get more time to talk I just wanted to summarize a little bit. happy messages because are also some that I didn't go into

550
00:52:25,399 --> 00:52:30,679
that I think it's quite important. I highly recommend and if you starting

551
00:52:30,679 --> 00:52:37,693
and you're happy for EH feels reading those papers my lips which it's getting on the flight.

552
00:52:37,693 --> 00:52:43,093
I see this is very important that she use a_lot more. also

553
00:52:43,093 --> 00:52:48,093
for a very short time. so there's another scenario where you

554
00:52:48,093 --> 00:52:53,253
can use any FedEx. you have exposed to the fax in our time if you

555
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:58,913
know you can use it. open the details because I'm gonna get them jumbled in my mind now but you can use negative control outcomes

556
00:52:58,913 --> 00:53:04,613
another way to set this stuff out but it is. I'm missing family going on and

557
00:53:04,613 --> 00:53:10,113
looking under certain assumptions but the other thing is this race is that that is

558
00:53:10,113 --> 00:53:15,365
also important and I think they're still in session about

559
00:53:15,365 --> 00:53:22,565
which is that

560
00:53:22,565 --> 00:53:27,645
right. as I said. air pollution for this week to become a month or quarterly. so when

561
00:53:27,645 --> 00:53:32,805
you sir.. report related. we highly four

562
00:53:32,805 --> 00:53:37,985
ladies in the model together now. a_lot_of people I talked to find out about

563
00:53:37,985 --> 00:53:45,025
that and I know the person might happen.

564
00:53:45,025 --> 00:53:50,045
but this was a big issue that came up your house and you do this putting before they arrive and you get it. so I'm gonna go

565
00:53:50,045 --> 00:53:55,925
to the details. I can separately if we talked about Russian

566
00:53:55,925 --> 00:54:01,005
blessings. we're just going to have differences and call me back okay.

567
00:54:01,005 --> 00:54:06,665
read just recently just thought was a very good article. two thousand seventeen. showing that

568
00:54:06,665 --> 00:54:11,694
you know that one you can do this into. you really don't get hi

569
00:54:11,694 --> 00:54:16,954
it's an estimate and this is this is. I think there's a slight misconception that I putting some point

570
00:54:16,954 --> 00:54:22,194
putting very highly qualified as all together. Will on it's own independent of any

571
00:54:22,194 --> 00:54:27,474
underlying structure of your data on it's on fire suspect estimates in different directions and we're directions

572
00:54:27,474 --> 00:54:32,574
but we don't know anything about that. I wanna. this is this is Robert is not really the case

573
00:54:32,574 --> 00:54:37,674
and you can show many many recent recent service. you know one ten. so

574
00:54:37,674 --> 00:54:42,894
I'll forward. if this is gonna work things. fall apart but that's like one of point

575
00:54:42,894 --> 00:54:48,314
nine nine something. it's really contemporary I was calling back.

576
00:54:48,314 --> 00:54:53,474
all together and what Henrique showed is missing paper face. it's just illustrating. sometimes

577
00:54:53,474 --> 00:54:58,474
you have_to do it. if you understand the data structure underneath. if you don't do it. you will

578
00:54:58,474 --> 00:55:03,674
get a bias results and that's what I'm saying is likely happening with p.m. in the first trimester if I don't put in the third

579
00:55:03,674 --> 00:55:09,874
trimester in there. what I see the subpoena process the file.

580
00:55:09,874 --> 00:55:15,334
you have a problem I would say if I don't put it in there. I got a phone.

581
00:55:15,334 --> 00:55:20,514
but but we can look at but there's a misconception of the of the stuff that sometimes

582
00:55:20,514 --> 00:55:26,114
gets mixed up but when you actually put it in the bag. you can see quite quickly. that you need to do this and then

583
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:32,354
the problem is people raise putting for viable model become much more

584
00:55:32,354 --> 00:55:37,474
obvious why the problems when you put it in a bag frame which I can I can

585
00:55:37,474 --> 00:55:42,514
talk to anybody about. then this is a should more proxy versus personal exposure metrics I

586
00:55:42,514 --> 00:55:47,914
think five four and I don't know what exactly happened. I would say this is the whole

587
00:55:47,914 --> 00:55:53,334
program. you know trying to get more more personal exposure is great because obviously where the reality

588
00:55:53,334 --> 00:55:58,354
what's on board with somebody. but it raises all this is of how that stuff out there and all the behaviors that

589
00:55:58,354 --> 00:56:03,374
Mike found. so I would say that it's equally important for us to understand ways trying hold of

590
00:56:03,374 --> 00:56:08,674
that that are independent of those personal factors. but still have those expose

591
00:56:08,674 --> 00:56:13,822
on metrics because we wanna know how well our models protects those things on this

592
00:56:13,822 --> 00:56:19,502
is population we don't have problems of the disease. and if those can be quite good.

593
00:56:19,502 --> 00:56:25,602
then we can use the models and understand if you can potentially use the message. alright.

594
00:56:25,602 --> 00:56:31,022
alright. quickly since I don't know if I'm really running on time. just nothing is about this.

595
00:56:31,022 --> 00:56:36,082
I won't say much and we don't know exactly why the air pollution is doing this but one thing that is caught my

596
00:56:36,082 --> 00:56:41,422
attention recently is Mike probably in the brain. I really the first line of defense against

597
00:56:41,422 --> 00:56:46,982
exposure is like air pollution and they get activated and what we are understanding from the business and or biology now.

598
00:56:46,982 --> 00:56:52,322
Michael Green. this is nothing wrong.

599
00:56:52,322 --> 00:56:57,542
all the the other stuff. Mike with Leah. she's important in fact

600
00:56:57,542 --> 00:57:02,942
one of the role they play actively is to single and get rid of finances

601
00:57:02,942 --> 00:57:08,102
that are not supposed to be there's a_lot_of pruning we put a_lot_of snaps together. lot of communication and based

602
00:57:08,102 --> 00:57:13,482
on your experience if you away ones that don't matter and use both the adults bring. as it should be spelled

603
00:57:13,482 --> 00:57:18,662
Michael we are involved in the process of getting rid of the longs that may be relevant and often

604
00:57:18,662 --> 00:57:23,822
we think there's over productivity and the problem and in brain development there. maybe

605
00:57:23,822 --> 00:57:30,022
I'll find where they maybe over be anyway away. so that's is my mission.

606
00:57:30,022 --> 00:57:35,042
they're also the front line response to things like. so I think they're they're

607
00:57:35,042 --> 00:57:40,202
usually interesting and we're trying to see how they maybe playing out. so I will skip the last and just thank

608
00:57:40,202 --> 00:57:48,562
you very much.

609
00:57:48,562 --> 00:57:53,682
bye.

610
00:57:53,682 --> 00:58:02,288
we can. okay. I'm here. I'm here

611
00:58:02,288 --> 00:58:06,852
hey it's me. talk to you. I'd like
