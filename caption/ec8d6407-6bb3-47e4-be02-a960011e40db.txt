1
00:00:05,598 --> 00:00:08,256
In this module we're going
to talk about themes.

2
00:00:08,256 --> 00:00:12,510
I'm going to talk about what we do
with the data after it has been coded.

3
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:14,336
So we have two learning objectives.

4
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:17,907
The first is to learn what a theme
is in qualitative research.

5
00:00:17,907 --> 00:00:22,633
And a second is to become familiar
with thematic analysis as a method for

6
00:00:22,633 --> 00:00:23,744
data analysis.

7
00:00:23,744 --> 00:00:26,162
So themes are patterns in your data,

8
00:00:26,162 --> 00:00:29,441
at a minimum themes are used
to organize the data.

9
00:00:29,441 --> 00:00:32,876
Ideally the themes are used
to interpret the data.

10
00:00:32,876 --> 00:00:37,315
We identify themes by searching across
the dataset to find repeated patterns of

11
00:00:37,315 --> 00:00:37,920
meaning.

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,377
Identified themes should be meaningful,
and useful to your research questions.

13
00:00:42,377 --> 00:00:45,577
So themes can be salient
across the data set.

14
00:00:45,577 --> 00:00:50,263
But really more the value of themes are
judged by the importance to the research

15
00:00:50,263 --> 00:00:53,960
question, not necessarily by
their prevalence in the data.

16
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,761
So in general,

17
00:00:54,761 --> 00:00:59,270
themes capture something important about
data in relation to the research question.

18
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:04,157
And like codes, themes can be
based in data or based on theory.

19
00:01:04,157 --> 00:01:09,859
So initial theme development happens
throughout the data analysis process and

20
00:01:09,859 --> 00:01:14,209
becomes more active after
you've done the focused coding.

21
00:01:14,209 --> 00:01:17,586
You can start sorting different
codes into potential themes.

22
00:01:17,586 --> 00:01:20,903
I recommend that you begin to play
around with different ideas and

23
00:01:20,903 --> 00:01:22,602
build visual representations.

24
00:01:22,602 --> 00:01:28,496
As you identify the themes, while these
can be a lengthy and iterative process.

25
00:01:28,496 --> 00:01:31,998
So in reviewing themes,
you should start at the code level.

26
00:01:31,998 --> 00:01:35,837
Look at your exerted examples,
the code queries, and think about do

27
00:01:35,837 --> 00:01:40,218
these examples our web participants
are saying, do they fit under one theme?

28
00:01:40,218 --> 00:01:44,811
If not, ask yourself why and then think
about what some of these differences are.

29
00:01:44,811 --> 00:01:47,892
Then you move on to
the entire dataset level and

30
00:01:47,892 --> 00:01:51,138
think about do the themes
fit your overall data?

31
00:01:51,138 --> 00:01:52,673
And then again, if not,

32
00:01:52,673 --> 00:01:57,291
you should be asking yourself why to get
at some of the nuances in your data.

33
00:01:57,291 --> 00:02:02,158
So questions then to ask about your
themes are, what does this theme mean?

34
00:02:02,158 --> 00:02:04,936
What are the assumptions
underpinning the theme?

35
00:02:04,936 --> 00:02:07,595
What are the implications of this theme?

36
00:02:07,595 --> 00:02:11,132
What conditions are likely to
have given rise to this theme?

37
00:02:11,132 --> 00:02:15,852
Why do people talk about this thing in the
particular way as opposed to other ways?

38
00:02:15,852 --> 00:02:18,400
And what is the overall
story the different

39
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,958
themes reveal about your research topic?

40
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:25,574
So some ideas for how to identify themes
in your data are looking at repetitions.

41
00:02:25,574 --> 00:02:28,640
So where ideas happen over and
over again throughout the data, so

42
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,321
looking at some of these patterns.

43
00:02:30,321 --> 00:02:32,789
Second is to look at
indigenous typologies.

44
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:36,557
And so this is we're thinking about kind
of the NVivo coding comes into play.

45
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:41,403
So using the terms and ideas that
participants themselves express.

46
00:02:41,403 --> 00:02:44,371
Looking at similarities and differences so

47
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:49,512
through constant comparison of the things
and ideas presented in the data.

48
00:02:49,512 --> 00:02:53,374
Thinking also about missing data so what
is it that participants are talking about?

49
00:02:53,374 --> 00:02:55,252
But what is it that
they're not talking about?

50
00:02:55,252 --> 00:02:59,117
It could also be important for
identifying themes in your data.

51
00:02:59,117 --> 00:03:02,955
And lastly, bringing in theory and
thinking about theory

52
00:03:02,955 --> 00:03:07,434
related material can help you
identify themes in your data as well.

53
00:03:07,434 --> 00:03:11,551
So Brown and Clark defined
thematic analysis as a method for

54
00:03:11,551 --> 00:03:16,507
identifying, analyzing, and
reporting patterns within your data.

55
00:03:16,507 --> 00:03:18,927
Thematic analysis has several steps.

56
00:03:18,927 --> 00:03:22,486
The first is to familiarize
yourself with the data.

57
00:03:22,486 --> 00:03:26,567
The second is to generate
some initial codes.

58
00:03:26,567 --> 00:03:30,149
Then to search for themes in your data.

59
00:03:30,149 --> 00:03:32,724
Review the themes.

60
00:03:32,724 --> 00:03:36,976
Define and name the themes by
writing thematic statements.

61
00:03:36,976 --> 00:03:39,066
And then produce the report or

62
00:03:39,066 --> 00:03:43,756
produce the paper presentation
based on this thematic analysis.

63
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:48,382
So in conclusion, themes are patterns we
find in the data that are meaningful to

64
00:03:48,382 --> 00:03:51,086
our research questions or
study objectives.

65
00:03:51,086 --> 00:03:54,738
There are several techniques for
discovering themes in our data.

66
00:03:54,738 --> 00:03:58,069
Themes provides a way to synthesize and
organize our data for

67
00:03:58,069 --> 00:04:00,296
presentation to an external audience.

68
00:04:00,296 --> 00:04:03,776
And thematic analysis is a method for
identifying, analyzing, and

69
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:08,648
reporting themes in qualitative data,
