1
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,830
Multiple types of providers play

2
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,125
important roles in the
healthcare sector.

3
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:15,000
As we saw when we reviewed data

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,740
about the US Health Care System,

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,630
hospitals accounted
for about a third of

6
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,355
spending more than any
other type of provider.

7
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:23,690
Therefore, we'll be
taking a deeper dive into

8
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,820
this sector starting
with this video,

9
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,455
which will provide data about

10
00:00:27,455 --> 00:00:29,555
current market
structure and trends.

11
00:00:29,555 --> 00:00:30,920
In another video, we'll do

12
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,270
an economic analysis of

13
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:34,955
these trends and
their consequences.

14
00:00:34,955 --> 00:00:38,060
This video will help us meet
our learning objective of

15
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,890
describing the key
economic actors

16
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,105
in health and health care,

17
00:00:41,105 --> 00:00:44,179
including their objectives
and incentives.

18
00:00:44,179 --> 00:00:46,730
The hospital sector experienced

19
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:49,205
rapid growth in the
post-World War II era,

20
00:00:49,205 --> 00:00:51,020
fueled by investments subsidies

21
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,945
under the Hill-Burton
Act of 1946.

22
00:00:53,945 --> 00:00:57,005
Those subsidies were
available for several decades

23
00:00:57,005 --> 00:01:00,530
and targeted primarily rural
and underserved areas.

24
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:03,290
The number of general
hospitals in the US peaked in

25
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:07,910
1974 at over 7,000 and
has declined ever since.

26
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:10,550
Another important policy
change that affected

27
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:13,625
the need for hospital
beds occurred in 1983.

28
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:16,400
Medicare began paying
for inpatient care using

29
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,990
a prospective payment system

30
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:20,300
called Diagnosis Related Groups.

31
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,040
Rather than paying the hospital

32
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,870
for each day and each service,

33
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:26,000
DRG system paid a fixed amount

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,920
for the entire
admission based on

35
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,660
the patient's diagnosis and

36
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,490
the estimated average
cost of caring

37
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:33,800
for somebody with
that diagnosis.

38
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,100
This provided a powerful
incentive to discharge patients

39
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,660
sooner and contributed to

40
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:41,820
the development of
excess bed capacity.

41
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:45,910
Hospitals accounted
for 43 percent

42
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:46,970
of healthcare spending in

43
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:51,155
1980 versus 33 percent in 2019.

44
00:01:51,155 --> 00:01:53,690
Medicare's DRG
system contribute to

45
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:56,660
this decline as to the
development of procedures

46
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:59,390
like minimally invasive
surgeries that shorten

47
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,010
recovery times or allowed

48
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:03,970
procedures to be moved
to outpatient settings.

49
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:06,280
In 2019, there were

50
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,025
5,141 non-federal
community hospitals,

51
00:02:10,025 --> 00:02:13,750
2,946 of which were non-profit,

52
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,275
1,237 for-profit,

53
00:02:16,275 --> 00:02:20,969
and 962 run by state
or local governance.

54
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:24,485
To illustrate the trends
we've highlighted,

55
00:02:24,485 --> 00:02:26,810
inpatient days per
1,000 persons have been

56
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:29,180
steadily declining
with a total decrease

57
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,820
of about a quarter over the
two decades represented

58
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:35,550
in this figure from the
American Hospital Association.

59
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:40,580
The flip side of the decline
in inpatient days is

60
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,490
a steady increase in
hospital outpatient visits.

61
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:45,635
Over the same two-decade period,

62
00:02:45,635 --> 00:02:49,890
the rate per 1,000 persons
rose by nearly 50 percent.

63
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:54,260
Another strong trend in

64
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,675
the hospital sector
is consolidation.

65
00:02:56,675 --> 00:03:00,830
In 2005, nearly half of hospitals
were still independent.

66
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,360
About a decade later,

67
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,980
two-thirds were members of

68
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,545
a health system with
two or more hospitals.

69
00:03:06,545 --> 00:03:09,020
Economists and
antitrust regulators

70
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,280
refer to mergers between

71
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,390
similar firms like

72
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:15,180
two hospitals as
horizontal integration.

73
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:18,170
Another way of
seeing this trend is

74
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:20,165
to look at the
volume of mergers.

75
00:03:20,165 --> 00:03:23,000
In recent years, there
have been about 200 deals

76
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,610
announced and 100
completed annually.

77
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:30,005
In addition to
horizontal mergers,

78
00:03:30,005 --> 00:03:32,975
hospitals have been rapidly
integrating vertically.

79
00:03:32,975 --> 00:03:35,930
Vertical integration
refers to merging entities

80
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,915
that are at different stages
of the production process.

81
00:03:38,915 --> 00:03:41,885
This could be integration with
hospitals and physicians,

82
00:03:41,885 --> 00:03:44,300
insurers, post acute facilities,

83
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,520
or home healthcare agencies.

84
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:50,555
Such mergers could be driven
by desire for efficiencies,

85
00:03:50,555 --> 00:03:52,070
such as better coordination

86
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,900
across different levels of care,

87
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,060
a desire to extend market power

88
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,445
by negotiating
jointly with payers,

89
00:03:58,445 --> 00:04:00,710
or to take advantage
of public programs

90
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,880
like Medicare that

91
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,050
sometimes pay more for

92
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:06,245
the same service based on
where it was performed.

93
00:04:06,245 --> 00:04:09,110
Merges between hospitals
and physicians,

94
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:11,240
with hospitals buying
physician practices

95
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,100
or employing
physicians directly,

96
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,830
have been particularly rapid.

97
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,460
In just five years,

98
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,930
the share of practices owned by

99
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,655
hospitals more than doubled,

100
00:04:19,655 --> 00:04:21,665
and the share of
physicians employed by

101
00:04:21,665 --> 00:04:24,665
hospitals increased
by over 70 percent.

102
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:28,670
Nearly half of all physicians
are now hospital employees.

103
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:31,280
There are additional
joint ventures or

104
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,380
other relationships
between hospitals and not

105
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,970
employed physicians
that represent

106
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:39,020
partial integration of
operations or contracting.

107
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,420
Relative to prices set by

108
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,045
the traditional fee for
service Medicare program,

109
00:04:44,045 --> 00:04:46,400
negotiated prices
paid to hospitals by

110
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,815
private insurers are
about twice as high,

111
00:04:48,815 --> 00:04:51,725
with considerable
variation across states.

112
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:55,100
The difference between the
75th and 25th percentiles

113
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,680
is about 40 percent
of the Medicare rate,

114
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,660
and states with the
highest ratio of

115
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,060
private Medicare prices
are about double,

116
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,595
the states with
the lowest ratio.

117
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:07,280
Another important change
in the landscape of

118
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,165
hospital finances is the
decline in uncompensated care.

119
00:05:11,165 --> 00:05:13,280
This occurred primarily
as a result of

120
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,355
insurance expansions under
the Affordable Care Act.

121
00:05:16,355 --> 00:05:19,010
Nationally, the percentage
of hospital revenues

122
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:22,010
considered uncompensated
decline by about a quarter.

123
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,480
This decline could
have been even

124
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,670
larger at some
states not opted to

125
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,860
skip expanding
Medicaid eligibility

126
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,080
to include all
low-income adults.

127
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,315
This can be seen in
data from Michigan,

128
00:05:32,315 --> 00:05:35,465
which expanded Medicaid
in April of 2014.

129
00:05:35,465 --> 00:05:37,430
Uncompensated care as a share of

130
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:41,730
revenues sell nearly in
half after the expansion.

131
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,200
The data we've reviewed
in this video,

132
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,970
provide us with valuable context

133
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:48,470
to understand the
motivations and

134
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:51,440
consequences of
multiple recent changes

135
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,605
that have occurred in
the hospital industry.

136
00:05:53,605 --> 00:05:55,700
Although the US hospitals sector

137
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,070
still accounts for the
largest share of spending,

138
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,635
it has been declining
in size and share.

139
00:06:00,635 --> 00:06:02,930
We also saw structural changes

140
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,610
in ownership and care delivery,

141
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:06,860
along with significant
consolidation among

142
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:10,040
hospitals in between
hospitals and physicians.

143
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,380
Finally, the ACA decreased

144
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,779
uncompensated care
provided by hospitals,

145
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:16,040
primarily in states that

146
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,870
expanded their
Medicaid programs.
