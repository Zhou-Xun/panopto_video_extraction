1
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:13,200
It started before our class announcement on March one is still this Thursday, 5 p.m.

2
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:20,180
You. Thursday at 5 p.m. Make sure you attend the office hours.

3
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:25,400
They can be around the house. So we have office hours every day, Monday to Friday.

4
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:34,340
And the team has also posted to the office our locations or their office hours to my office all are going to be virtual.

5
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:42,950
So you can use things like of that throughout the semester on Monday.

6
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:46,580
And for Dr. Sen's office hour, I use his office.

7
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:57,180
You can also find all December on the syllabus. So the office hours are going to be in-person locations.

8
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:02,480
You can find me in the announcement notes first and second.

9
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,000
The first recitation session will be happening this Friday.

10
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,330
Currently, we set it to be 3 to 4, right?

11
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:21,230
3 to 4 and 1020. I'm still discussing with the the other instructors saying what if we can move

12
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:27,940
the stuff and 30 minutes ahead to accommodate all of your schedules in the end,

13
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:33,560
I just want to ask before we actually find out is the room can be reserved.

14
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:47,420
Is there any conflict from 230 to 330 and any conflict with your classes, 230 to 330 on Friday?

15
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,590
Oh, okay. Good. I'll discuss with the other instructor and say if they can make it.

16
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:59,900
But for now, without further notice, it's still 3 to 4 on Friday.

17
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:04,430
So we'll try to accommodate them later on.

18
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:09,980
So that's not. And any questions.

19
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:19,490
Okay. For the recitation, as I said before, no new material, but it's just going to be exercise sessions.

20
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,479
We may go over some actual problems, but no you topics.

21
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,240
Learning power at one is highly recommended.

22
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:37,130
And another thing that I want to mention and specifically get a shout out to one out one of you who pointed out a mistake that I made last, last time.

23
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:42,740
So recall that we talked about the Annapolis example last time.

24
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:47,050
Right. So a child is making out in that class using 20.

25
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:53,330
These are ten in one color. Five is not a color and another color and so on, so forth.

26
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:59,810
And we talk about if there's order other words, if there is attendance, you know where to start.

27
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:09,680
Then that puts the total number of choices is 28 factorial divided by seven, factorial eight factorial five, five, four, an outside factorial.

28
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:18,410
And that's what we have shown in class. And then I made the comment that the necklace does not have an opponent.

29
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:24,170
The other words you can arbitrarily rotate, then that list is still staying the same.

30
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,930
Then how many different necklaces can make? So the answer is not surprising.

31
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:33,650
It's not that original number divided by 28.

32
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:40,310
So in this case, actually, it's pretty complicated and quite interesting problem.

33
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:45,110
So I thank y'all don't write it down here.

34
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:51,530
Yeah, yeah. Very nice. So now I'm pointing out the problem and actually I gave a very nice example.

35
00:03:51,530 --> 00:04:00,110
So you can, you know, think about this example as a as a as a assume that's simplifying a problem.

36
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:08,479
Right. Just a if you have four for this to make a necklace and they only consider two different colors or types,

37
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,620
let's say just use square on the crosses to represent.

38
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:17,120
And so you have this four items that you want to make a necklace.

39
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:25,460
So if it's order to sampling how many cases to have, if there is the pendant now, how many physical.

40
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:38,030
Because order how many cases you have. Anyone.

41
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:45,230
My name's Hoskins, and I want to know.

42
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:57,050
Okay, so with that, I think that first random pick, the name of a baby is facial hair.

43
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,520
Yes. What's the. What's the answer?

44
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:16,110
If it's an order of sampling replacement squares, two squares of identical crosses are identical to that of a and two.

45
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:21,050
Yeah, exactly. That's the number that we have to look at last time.

46
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:27,490
Very good. By the way, so, as you know, are not rule stated.

47
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:33,600
Next time you're going to print out something. Okay. So if I don't do a Hong Kong show or do I start at.

48
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:41,020
Okay. But we got our first. Oh, okay.

49
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:50,330
So this is a number based on our sample and we actually calculate this is a six at any time.

50
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,079
Even write it out. So since it's all here. So what comes first?

51
00:05:54,080 --> 00:06:01,040
Actually matters. It can be squared. Square, cross, cross, square, cross, cross.

52
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:05,090
Square, square, cross, square.

53
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:19,050
Cross or star? Cross. Right.

54
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:24,430
These are all six necklaces. I assume that the you know, you arrange them in a circle.

55
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,950
These are six arrangement that I have.

56
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:35,230
But now the question is, if it does not have an order and other words, you kind of hate how many cases you have.

57
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:43,330
Now you have to think that not all, you know, rotation are different.

58
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:50,280
In particular, if you rotate base one on base one, they're going to be the same height.

59
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:58,480
This square is going to be next to one another and a across. That's going to be one that's for one another is going to become the same backwards.

60
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:04,510
Right. And this one also is going to become exactly the same necklace.

61
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:08,980
Same for this one. So the other words, these four.

62
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:14,470
Got to become what's right.

63
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:25,380
If you allow them to rotate and the order doesn't matter, then these four actually becomes one and Vegas two becomes another one.

64
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:33,450
So for this all ordered sampling problem with circular arrangement,

65
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:42,270
the actual final numbers two is not six divided by four, which actually doesn't make any sense.

66
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:47,100
Right. It's 1.5. So this is wrong and the actual number is two.

67
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:51,420
And the way to gotten this number, actually, it's pretty complicated.

68
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:57,230
It involves some more sophisticated theorem that is far beyond the scope of this course.

69
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,600
But if you're interested in looking to the so-called Burnside.

70
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:18,880
Precisely. So that would help us address this kind of problem that extended to more of these things concrete, like they are very, very dirty.

71
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:24,640
So involves how many permutations, how many cemeteries to have in that interval.

72
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:29,110
So just give me a little bit more insights into why that happens.

73
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:35,470
It's the right time because recall that last time when we talk about all our sampling, right?

74
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:46,330
The way that we typically do it is to divide the number of permutations or the number of, you know, the number of rotations.

75
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:51,310
In other words, we can start anywhere from this is for peace.

76
00:08:52,840 --> 00:09:01,660
So that's why we divide it by four. Not only works if you have not identical items, if you have six friends sitting at the table.

77
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:07,690
Every friend is different. So that's why you can divide it by six, because every rotation can be different.

78
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:17,700
But now is not really the case. So if you look at these two, there are actually intrinsically there are four different replications for this to.

79
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:23,170
And if you if you number them, for example, this is number one or number two,

80
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:28,750
there could be another copy that is for number two and square number one.

81
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:36,100
If I sense these, these two are identical. So we actually didn't even write it out in our original place.

82
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:41,470
So that's why instead of dividing by by four is okay, it's only have two.

83
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:48,910
So this is some insights into why.

84
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,520
And now simply divide by four to find the final number.

85
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:00,830
And again, if you want to look into it for any arbitrary number of beats with arbitrary combinations, look into this, for instance.

86
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:07,000
Okay. So very nice. Thanks to your home for this.

87
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:15,310
So thank you for putting this out very nicely.

88
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:23,290
And that's critical thinking. And so I definitely encourage you to find the mistakes, find the errors that I'm making,

89
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:28,330
boss, and let me know so I can guarantee that all all the things that I,

90
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:34,810
I teach, although I've tried many, many times, but still there could be hours like this over and over.

91
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:39,270
And so. Very good. All right.

92
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:45,520
Any questions before we get started on this topic? Okay, so let's get started.

93
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:51,820
So today we're going to talk about probability on Sims and conditional probability if we have time back.

94
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:01,520
Okay. First probability axioms and some calculus.

95
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:09,800
The honor two families we have sort of alluded to probability over and over again in the first.

96
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:13,600
How about lectures? Now less formal. Have you found what's probability?

97
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:18,230
You don't have to define them. Define it. We actually need the following axioms.

98
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:21,680
So axioms means something that we stated without proof.

99
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:26,740
Okay. Suppose there is an event e recorded event.

100
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:32,809
It's basically a collection of outcomes that allows the sample space as we want to assign probability to.

101
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:38,510
V So this key is going to be a real value of function and it's a function of the event.

102
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:47,209
E And that function is called a probability theory is satisfied the following three axioms The very first one

103
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:57,920
is the probability or the function apply to the fourth space or to apply to the sample space is equal to one.

104
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:06,890
Okay. And the second one say for any event, the probability is always great or equal to one greater or equal to zero.

105
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:20,690
Okay. And lastly, if you have a if you have a sequence of events, you are e to all the way to infinity that are mutually exclusive.

106
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:29,540
To other words, each pair has no intersection. Then we can every we can write the probability of the union,

107
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:42,650
this countable union of this E-I equal to the carnival sum summation of each probability then is called countable an activity.

108
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:48,440
If the function satisfy all the three axioms, we can call it a probability function.

109
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:58,250
And if you think about each one of this out sounds actually is is very reasonable in a sense.

110
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:03,530
Right. The probability as we know it should I'm should should always be between zero and one.

111
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,330
And of course, from all the possible outcomes, the probability is always one.

112
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:15,620
You cannot have a probability that it's active. And if you have a bunch of events that are mutually exclusive,

113
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:21,440
then the probability of going through that collection of events should be the sum of

114
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:28,370
the each individual probability you told them is pretty reasonable and intuitive.

115
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,590
These is called a common growth axiom, so probability.

116
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:42,740
So as long as you can verify a particular function, the function of the event satisfy these three axioms.

117
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:48,020
You can conclude that that particular function can be called a probability function.

118
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:52,670
So that's the ourselves.

119
00:13:53,300 --> 00:14:05,030
So a few remarks about this axioms. First, how do we understand this infinity countable, a infinite unit of events,

120
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:09,410
wanting to understand it from a calculus perspective, view them as limit operation.

121
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:14,540
So essentially you can consider the use of a finite number of events allowed

122
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:21,980
that the upper bound or allowed the number of events and goes to infinity.

123
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:28,130
So that's a that's the way to understand this countable an infinite unit.

124
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:37,070
And also the last axioms also have a hidden assumption that is that infinity uni out.

125
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:40,220
This event is also a event in this sample space.

126
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:47,030
Otherwise it doesn't make sense to define the probability function on something that is not even an event.

127
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:51,200
So that is a table, an assumption from the third axioms.

128
00:14:55,790 --> 00:15:03,290
So now we have defined a function. You are to have a well qualified, well defined probability space.

129
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:13,730
We need to have some other things, in particular when they are zero and a collection of subsets of its normal space, as is called a algebra.

130
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:23,300
So in other words, it's just a collection of subsets. They don't have to be all the subsets, just a few subsets.

131
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:28,100
As I said, it's for the following conditions.

132
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:31,880
First, the original sample space should be in this collection.

133
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:39,290
Second, if once that if one event is in this collection, the complement should also be in the collection.

134
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:43,610
And the third, if two are in the collection, then the unit is a collection.

135
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:49,670
If the collection within, what if I be satisfied with three constraints?

136
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:53,870
Then we call this be an algebra or a field.

137
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:58,760
And so this is a mathematical definition of algebra.

138
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:05,390
So the collection of B is also called a sigma. Algebra is replaced.

139
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:16,879
If you replace the third condition by this infinite union, countable, infinite union, there is a minor difference between these two.

140
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:24,410
Apparently this countable Jupiter unit is slightly stronger than just a paralyzed union because it goes to infinity.

141
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:30,650
In other words, if you have a contemplate infinity union of events,

142
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:36,770
if each one of it is in a B, in this field, the economy of a union is also in the field.

143
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:40,880
You can easily derive that by having a pair of events.

144
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:46,460
The units always seem to differ in the same algebra.

145
00:16:47,360 --> 00:17:01,700
Two B's, the new and the three prime implied three about three dozen reading prime you imply three prime rate prime is the stronger,

146
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:07,610
slightly stronger, but still stronger. And they're not equivalent events.

147
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:13,100
If you replace three by three prime intelligence thinking about algebra in this.

148
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:20,360
Mostly we're just going to focus on sigma algebra just for completeness.

149
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:31,200
These are just definitions and a couple of examples.

150
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,910
There are two specific algebra that is sort of trivial.

151
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:40,199
One is essentially called the Trivial Sigma algebra.

152
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:45,660
It's just the collection of the null set and the full size of the sample.

153
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:53,910
If you collect those to put them in the sack in the collection, that you can verify that that's a sigma algebra.

154
00:17:55,730 --> 00:18:01,280
Your Honor, to verify is a sigma algebra. What you need to do is to follow the three connections.

155
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:05,960
Check them one by one. Right. As they see that in the B.

156
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:13,760
That's obviously true. If one side is in the B, the complement is also in the B, since it only has two elements.

157
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:18,200
Right. And a one is a complement of the other. So that is also true.

158
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:21,850
And finally, the only of this two is still the full set.

159
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:31,670
So the third is also true. So that's why this is have a collection of nulls that this simple space is a trivial sigma algebra.

160
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:36,800
Another sort of a trivial example is the power.

161
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:42,500
The other words, the collection of all possible subsets of the sample space.

162
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:48,620
You can follow the same same steps to verify.

163
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:53,720
That's also a sigma observation. Right.

164
00:18:56,450 --> 00:19:03,530
And that's a Allama said even had a collection of subsets of the sample space.

165
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:13,430
And any collection of subsets now always exert a minimal family or minimal sigma algebra.

166
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:25,490
I contend that class which satisfied that would be a refinement of the three requirements and where matter required for any collection of subset,

167
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:32,540
you can always find a minimal sigma algebra that contends that particular subset, those subsets.

168
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:43,880
These are all my definition that you probably have already seen your real analysis and I just go over them quickly.

169
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:50,090
Another important special case of the Sigma algebra is called the Parallel Sigma Algebra.

170
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:56,420
So it's defined on the real space, the salary that by all the open intervals in the real space.

171
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:08,450
Now the word since we mentioned for any subsets, any family of subsets, we can always find a small, smallest sigma algebra that contains that family.

172
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:19,490
If we consider the family of subsets being all this over intervals and find the smallest sigma algebra that contains all this open intervals,

173
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:22,880
that becomes the parallel sigma sigma algebra.

174
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:32,690
And again, you can verify that this parallel sigma algebra actually contains all possible sets,

175
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:36,680
either open sets, close task black open right on closed.

176
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:44,150
That closed by open is all part of this parallel sigma algebra in the elements,

177
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:51,530
but not every reasonable subset of artists in the barrel is a barrel set for humans.

178
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:57,530
For our sigma algebra, all the words this barrel sigma algebra is not a superset,

179
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:05,840
is not the super, is not a class not superset, but the real space is smaller than that.

180
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:13,220
So you can find some additional discussion in the same probability books about this definition.

181
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:24,200
Also, you can find it in real analysis. So now we have talked about three things already before we have introduced the sample space.

182
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:31,940
Right. Essentially the collection of all possible outcomes. And in the beginning, we have defined what is a probability function.

183
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:38,240
And now we have known this sigma algebra.

184
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:43,970
With this three components, we actually formally define a probability space.

185
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,540
Yes. What does it mean? Every reasonable assumption.

186
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:54,270
So. Any reasonable essentially means what I just said.

187
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:57,670
So it's either it's closed. Right.

188
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:00,630
Open it up. Open. Right. Closed, open are closed.

189
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:09,720
All those fine accommodations help those up or find out or contemplate infinite combination of those the intervals.

190
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:16,390
It's called the reasonable subset. It's just in contrast to the color set.

191
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:23,890
So now let's define what is the probability space.

192
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:29,709
So before that, let's first define a probability measure.

193
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:37,450
Define on this sigma feeling of subset of has to be a real value function, satisfying the common ground axioms.

194
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:42,670
Just as we mentioned before. That's called a probability measure.

195
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:46,060
And with the three components that we mentioned, the sample space,

196
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:55,300
the barrel that the sigma failed, the sigma failed or sigma algebra of the sample space.

197
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,040
And this probability matter, we have a probability space.

198
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:06,430
So probability space consists of three main components.

199
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:12,740
We would define a space. Always make sure you have these three components right.

200
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:18,850
The sample space, a barrel, the sigma field.

201
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:28,840
In other words, a collection of subsets that satisfy these conditions and the probability function satisfy the axioms.

202
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:33,370
Once you have all three, you have a well-defined probability space.

203
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:38,440
All right. Questions?

204
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:51,210
So a few remarks before we talk about more examples to showcase how this is defined and for real problems.

205
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:57,959
First remark mark the axioms, the common graph outstanding.

206
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,930
So probability is mainly motivated from this random frequency idea.

207
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:07,940
Recall that probability really. And these originate from this gambling problem.

208
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:12,480
So the relative frequency idea is really the root of the probability.

209
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:23,290
Suppose it is an event. So we thought experiment is carry out and times and is a very large number and number of

210
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:28,740
e is a number of events that a year's observed number of times that event is observed.

211
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:38,820
Okay. So then following the same logic as in gambling, we can define the probability for this event e as the ratio between this two numbers,

212
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:45,960
the number of times this event happens divided by the number of experiments that are actually conducted.

213
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:53,729
If you have another event f that is mutually exclusive with our original event.

214
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:56,820
E The other words, if one happens, the other cannot happen.

215
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:04,410
Then you can calculate the number of times when both happens.

216
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:10,350
Now both happen when either one happens, and so that can be represented.

217
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:18,320
Either this number of the union. Of other words, the outcome belongs to either E or out.

218
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:26,010
That should be equal to the number of times when it happens or the number of times what happens.

219
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:37,520
And then following the same logic, before you can calculate the probability of union as the number of times when either e

220
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:43,920
or out happens divided by that which further we can break it down into this two parts.

221
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:49,890
And that is essentially the probability of E plus the probability of F.

222
00:25:51,120 --> 00:26:02,280
And if you look at it, it actually is sort of a simplified version of the of the third axiom of the third axiom beyond activity.

223
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:13,350
And so really the axioms, the common ground axioms is motivated from that right of a frequency idea, but a little bit more abstract.

224
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:22,620
That's a more important note on the Axiom, especially Axiom three,

225
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:36,660
The Carnival an activity is the following that if you consider a finite number of mutually exclusive events, you want it to all the way to the end.

226
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:44,520
And it's a finite number where they are mutually exclusive meaning and e.g. the intersection is is the null set.

227
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:48,360
Then the axioms axiom three that are.

228
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:56,420
We talk about this carnival of the additive three implies the following is finite additive any.

229
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:07,579
And maybe that's why, like I said, you can imagine there's a carnival, an infinite sequence of events.

230
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:10,850
You want it to all the way. Yeah, I'm plus one.

231
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:15,410
Plus two all the way to infinity. All need to do is to set e m plus one.

232
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:20,890
E m plus two. All the way to infinity to to be the empty set.

233
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:32,860
Then you follow the same logic, right? If you said yes, plus one plus two, all be equal to empty set.

234
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:38,230
They still you can verify every pair is mutually exclusive.

235
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:49,419
Every the intersection, it's always empty. And if you apply the third axiom now, you can have 11.

236
00:27:49,420 --> 00:28:01,000
So you're going to be the infinite union. Obviously I says all of these plus one above, they are anti-Assad.

237
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:05,260
This is essentially equal to the probability of this finite union.

238
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,200
Right. So this is the left hand side and the right hand side.

239
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:19,380
And we recall the third axiom is the infinite summation of egos are one, two and the probability of each event.

240
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:28,380
And this later, we'll show that the probability of a ampersand is zero, which you can imagine for now that.

241
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:38,940
Is equal to. I goes from one to and the probability of I says the original at 73 says black outside is equal to the right hand side.

242
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:50,790
Now you have this. You can easily reduce this finite additive, which is what is presented here on the lower stock.

243
00:28:53,530 --> 00:29:01,060
In other words, the comparable infinite ad activity implies finite additive.

244
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:13,100
Does everyone good with that? The Kingdom of the Infinite and activity implies this fire.

245
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:17,570
But the question is,

246
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:30,470
can we just assume this finite activity and replace the original third axiom with this finite activity and still have a probability of wildfire?

247
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:45,320
It's a question clear. So now we have know that the finite activity implies this as this sorry, this infinite, countable, infinite.

248
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:50,630
An activity implies the finite A.T. So they know that, right?

249
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:55,920
So the question is. And we show that.

250
00:29:57,470 --> 00:30:03,220
This also implies this carnival infinite additive it.

251
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:16,830
Lots of questions. You know, because of thinking of it in terms of frequency, we would have to divide by like a two.

252
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:23,100
The the answer is correct. No. Okay.

253
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:26,790
But the reason let's say why that's the case. Okay.

254
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:32,500
So first of all, let's get a better understanding of what this countable, infinite at activity.

255
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:37,440
Yes. I other recall that we can understand it using the limited operation.

256
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:46,490
So let's break down the lot and on. So that's going to be if you use the limit operation, it's going to be limited.

257
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:50,520
And it goes to Infinity Union. It goes from one and.

258
00:30:54,310 --> 00:31:00,670
Yes. Right. So that's how we interpret this finite union.

259
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:08,290
Infinite union. Similarly, on the right hand side, we can also express it using this alignment operation.

260
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:45,760
So the right hand side, you can also express how to use in this element Operation Angles, infinity, the sum, the fine I saw of this API.

261
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:50,000
Okay, from this finite amount time.

262
00:31:50,180 --> 00:32:00,080
What we know is that this guy inside this element operation is equal to this probability of the finite union.

263
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:10,720
Right. This particular term inside. So what is equal to is the limit and goes to infinity.

264
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:17,040
The probability goes for yellow.

265
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:26,260
So if you look at the side on the right hand side, there are similar, but they are not the same.

266
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:31,630
What's different is the order between this limit operation and the probability function.

267
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:37,810
So you cannot just switch the order without any additional conditions.

268
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:42,400
That's why they are not necessarily equal to one another.

269
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:51,760
You need stronger conditions in order to ensure that you can switch the order of this limit operation and the probability function.

270
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:56,290
They are not equal without conditions.

271
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:02,890
And so let me give you an example to say why that's the case.

272
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:23,280
You the space here. So consider the sample space of all the positive integers back then.

273
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:29,190
Consider the sigma alpha sigma algebra to be the power of.

274
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:42,130
The promise that just means all possible subsets, collection of all possible subsets of this small space.

275
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:52,090
Okay. And now let's define the probability function or let's define a function and show what a probability function or not.

276
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:59,080
Let's define a function of this Sigma Sigma field as follows.

277
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:22,240
Or any set in this Sigma Omega.

278
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:33,909
The other word or any subset of this, as we define this function P of A to be equal to zero in this set a as finite,

279
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:38,650
adamant, and to be equal to one if it has infinite animus.

280
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:44,500
Okay, so that's a well defined function and we agree on that.

281
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:56,170
Or any subset, you can apply this function. I've got a number and a unique number, right, depending on whether it's a finance subset or even a subset.

282
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:13,000
So it's a well function. Now, if you think about this function and a very fine of course, first I want this function apply to us is what?

283
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:19,610
That's the easy question. What is PR that's based on this definition?

284
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:30,030
But right. Because of course it's us is infinite is an infinite second for any a the

285
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:36,620
omega p of a apparently is always liquid on equal to zero inside of zero one.

286
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:47,690
So number number nine. So I claim to also satisfy the third one to say whether to satisfy the our activity and the

287
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:54,470
infinite the um the one I satisfied to find out that every hour can contemplate infinite additive.

288
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:02,360
So let's first check this finite and activity.

289
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:08,920
So for any. They want.

290
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:24,800
2 a.m. Omega finally one, two and omega.

291
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,190
The prob this function applied to the uranium.

292
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:40,080
Of this. You want to add? Really, this just depends on whether these stats are.

293
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:48,560
So this is going to be equal to one.

294
00:36:53,010 --> 00:37:02,880
The. No, actually, I mean, just.

295
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:13,389
I mean, the right way to construct a clear example to show that.

296
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:18,470
So, I mean, a collection of just one out of five.

297
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:25,390
Okay. So this is just one element and then one item an idea.

298
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:40,060
So then we can say that the probability or the function of A1 to all the way to me is what?

299
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:45,910
One is zero, right?

300
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:58,650
Because race is a finite union and only has a nanomedicine that is also equal to the sum of egos from 1 to 10 p.m.

301
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:06,120
Okay. But if you think about this limit.

302
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:32,150
This is also in part a zero because for each element we already show that a second zero and not have a of any effect has anything to do with it.

303
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:37,370
So if you got an infinity, the limit of this zero sequence is also zero.

304
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,220
But if you think about the alternative, you if you switch the order of the two.

305
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,510
And so I'll be different.

306
00:38:54,210 --> 00:39:05,190
Because if you look at what's inside this premises, if you take the infinite union of this API defining this way, it's going to be an infinite right.

307
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:10,740
It's going to be actually becomes us, which we know is equal to one.

308
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:16,350
So in other words, these two is not equal to one another.

309
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:28,110
So this kind of example shows you that if a function satisfy this finite activity,

310
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:32,340
it doesn't necessarily mean they satisfy a control and infinite activity.

311
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:40,110
So you can come up with other examples where you can show that the particular function satisfying

312
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:48,420
all possible finite activity or any construction of sets but doesn't satisfy this countable,

313
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:56,840
infinite additive. So that's why you cannot replace the original third axiom by this finite additive.

314
00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:03,660
The original third axiom is stronger. Okay, so now we know this is not true.

315
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:10,270
Just be careful when you define probability.

316
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:17,800
You need three axioms privacy or one key of a is always greater or zero.

317
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:22,210
And you need this you countable, infinite additive.

318
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:29,540
There's although three you have a probability of well-defined questions.

319
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:43,190
Okay. Third remark. What I meant was probability zero ever happens.

320
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:53,090
So let's say I get a omega p of a zero.

321
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:58,010
What ever happened to it?

322
00:40:58,010 --> 00:41:01,579
Once. Right. If it happens, then it should not have a probability.

323
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:06,110
Zero. So zero probability. That's also quite intuitive.

324
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:09,650
Zero probability simply means the event will never happened.

325
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:16,010
So that's the third axioms. All right.

326
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:22,130
Now, let's talk a little bit about how to define probability, especially for a finite set.

327
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:32,990
We actually have some this a couple of times in the previous examples of what I said about the sample space as being the collection of s12sn,

328
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:34,750
which is a finite substance,

329
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:49,250
and you cannot be the sigma algebra of the sum of subsets of us so that we can define the probability or define a value for each outcome as one to us.

330
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:52,700
Question I have a question about the remark three.

331
00:41:53,540 --> 00:42:02,560
Like, if you are playing a dart dart game and the probability of hitting on the point on the dart board is zero.

332
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:14,720
But it does have say that again that you are playing a dart game and the probability of hitting a point on the on the dart board is zero.

333
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:23,570
If you are to take the proportion of the square part of the probability it's there, but it does have.

334
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:27,020
So it depends on how you define a sample space in that case.

335
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:37,250
So how we define our event. So if your event is hitting every single point, then you have a number of infinite number of possible outcomes.

336
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:41,570
Right. That's even uncountable. Infinite amount of outcomes.

337
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:52,880
Yeah. So in that case, we say so it depends on how you define what one means happen, what it means not happen.

338
00:42:52,980 --> 00:43:06,020
Right. So the point here is that if you have a zero probability, essentially it's a given that on the probabilistic honor view never happens.

339
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:11,700
Yes. So it's just a matter of a how.

340
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:17,420
Describe the event about thing. All right.

341
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:23,580
So now let's define probability for a finite set.

342
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:29,010
Okay. So assume that we have a set as wins and possible outcomes as one to us.

343
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:38,460
And we can, if we can assign this numbers p 1 to 1 to each one of these receiving this possible outcomes.

344
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:50,880
Okay. If you want to satisfy the following, we can call it a probability that is each of them being a non active number that sum to one.

345
00:43:51,330 --> 00:44:02,640
And for any sigma, algebra B or any set in B, we define A to be the sum of the pi where I is in this event.

346
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:07,950
If we define the probability of if we define the numbers in this way,

347
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:14,490
we can call this p function defined in this way, a probability function on this sigma field.

348
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:20,400
B. And this also holds a base.

349
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:28,480
This is accountability. Infinite set. All right.

350
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:35,350
So that's how we can define probability for a fine asset or accountable, a infinite set.

351
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:48,060
So let's take a look at a couple of examples. First example, it's example in the in the textbook, 1.2.5 Cassano coin.

352
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:57,090
So assume that a toss, a coin and record what is outcome.

353
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:08,760
There is only two possible outcomes. So you can define the sample space to be the collection of these two outcomes hat or tails.

354
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:18,990
I did not order to have a probability probability measure in order to have a probability space.

355
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:24,900
We need the second item, which is this sigma feeling.

356
00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:31,080
So for this simple example, we just consider all possible subsets of the sample space.

357
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:46,050
So that gives us a collection of forces, the case that is H, g, t and the setup h ante.

358
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:58,320
So these are four possible events. And this empty set is one of the events.

359
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:05,220
So finally, in order to define our probability space, we need a probability function.

360
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:11,260
In this case says you only have two possible outcomes.

361
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:20,080
Following the previous slide, we can define two numbers one for each possible outcome as long as they satisfy the previous constraints.

362
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:26,840
Namely, they are now nested. They sum up to one. We can assign them, right?

363
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:36,040
We can we can assign we can define the function for each event in this segment failed and define the probability function.

364
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:46,060
In particular, if we define this PR age to BP 1t2, BP two is two numbers.

365
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:56,680
We know that p one plus p two should be equal to one and p one should be greater than or equal to zero, which would be great already.

366
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:59,830
Quite a zero, but more if it's a fair coin.

367
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:04,410
We also know that P one should be equal to two dividing.

368
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:08,320
We should have equal equal chance of getting a tail or a hat.

369
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:13,719
If it's a fair point, then with all of this we can easily solve that.

370
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:17,200
He was equal to P two equal to one half.

371
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:30,459
Right? Once we have those two numbers following the same rules before we can define this p function for each event in this segment,

372
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:38,830
fill took out the probability function. Oh he's not a PR officer.

373
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:42,190
Should be zero p of this h.

374
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:54,600
It's one half to one half and the final IPL pitch and tea is one.

375
00:47:55,500 --> 00:48:00,780
And then we have a function that is well defined with the three components.

376
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:07,050
As BNP we have a small space, we have a probability space.

377
00:48:09,410 --> 00:48:14,500
Okay. So this is how we can define a probability space for a real problem.

378
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:25,340
You just follow the steps and you first got the sample space, then got the segment field that you care about and then define probability function.

379
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:36,730
So this is a probability function in order to show that it can verify not following the three axioms.

380
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:40,930
Right. You can check the first one whether the full site is one.

381
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:46,930
That's correct. And you can also check the second one, whether it's all non-active, which is also correct.

382
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:50,350
And finally, Carnival, infinite activity.

383
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:58,360
In this case, it's just us simply find to this finite activity, since you only have a finite number of outcomes.

384
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:13,020
All right. So let's take a take a break and come back to come back to you.

385
00:49:19,110 --> 00:50:22,190
And, you know, when you hear something like this, we like to talk about what's going on with these kinds of things.

386
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:34,139
I'll have to assure you, I don't know anything about you know what?

387
00:50:34,140 --> 00:51:00,240
She's a world class model. So I thought that the closure of the shelter is going to elbow people also, because I think that you couldn't ask for that.

388
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:14,069
Yeah, but you know, each time it comes to the future is not a position right now.

389
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:27,290
It's just based on this new information in the same situation.

390
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:59,810
And I think we have to help them to figure out what not just in the last year, obviously, I'll talk with you.

391
00:52:00,370 --> 00:52:16,260
You know, I know the reason is really just how to break this terrible problem with the results.

392
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:27,050
So we always think about what's happening to take money away.

393
00:52:27,090 --> 00:52:39,230
It's just how do you feel about the impact?

394
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:54,440
So, you know, you're either, you know, now actually, you know, you know,

395
00:52:56,380 --> 00:53:47,420
you have something really positive or we don't want to be able to come up with something that is much smaller than some of your worry about happy.

396
00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:52,520
And that's why I do.

397
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:57,960
I just want to know, how did she get here, do you think?

398
00:53:59,490 --> 00:54:05,270
Know. You get out of those?

399
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:15,250
Yeah. There's a huge amount of wisdom in our field, at least for now.

400
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:25,970
There would be no medal to anyone.

401
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:30,490
Well, how about we ask that topic?

402
00:54:30,830 --> 00:54:37,730
I don't think. I think a lot of it is superstardom.

403
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:57,170
But then you couldn't just do it next week because there have been, of course, that that's one of the most difficult things that cannot just happen.

404
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:18,650
And the 4000 hours that I was lucky enough to have something, that is what you told me.

405
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:34,640
This was just a couple of different things.

406
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:45,260
You know, there probably going to be probably you know,

407
00:55:47,980 --> 00:56:20,330
this is the volume the you mentioned something about this is how could you look at this from the inside?

408
00:56:23,870 --> 00:56:35,390
I mean, the truth is that you are open to hearing.

409
00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:53,800
I'm sitting across from my kids in Philadelphia.

410
00:56:54,500 --> 00:57:03,950
She's going to make sure you go to lunch.

411
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:38,160
I want you to tell me all you have to say not to talk to you.

412
00:57:41,440 --> 00:58:55,730
You need to know that if you feel like you are actually seeing the market share your.

413
00:59:06,670 --> 00:59:31,090
You know, if you've got a problem, you had to do something.

414
00:59:39,920 --> 01:00:06,370
So Cuba has not been able to do something.

415
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:25,090
You got to take it to a train class.

416
01:00:25,510 --> 01:00:29,160
Continue to look at the examples regarding examples.

417
01:00:30,430 --> 01:00:34,930
So the setup is as follows Assume that if throw a card to a target,

418
01:00:35,050 --> 01:00:55,090
to a pawn and the pawn has five different areas of the house, outer circle is one, two, three, four, five.

419
01:01:00,470 --> 01:01:10,250
Excuse my joy, but assume that all this line segments are the equal and assume the the radius is r.

420
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:15,410
So each one of in each one of them is one fifth of this radius.

421
01:01:15,530 --> 01:01:19,940
They are over five, five, nine.

422
01:01:22,170 --> 01:01:27,990
So this is a setup. And if you throw a dart to this target, assuming that you always hit the target,

423
01:01:29,970 --> 01:01:38,100
then depending on first of all, in order to define a probability space, we need a sample space, right?

424
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:48,870
So we define our sample space to be the number we hit and either is one, two, three or five.

425
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:59,370
So only five possible outcomes. We forgot about that because there's worrying throughout the dart on the on the on the circle.

426
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:09,180
So those actually those are zero probability of zero probability depending on how you final event.

427
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:16,719
So if you want to really characterize that event, you have to be a little bit more terrible about how you characterize it.

428
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:19,830
But how we define our sample space for simplicity,

429
01:02:19,830 --> 01:02:26,910
let's just assume the role that the dart on the target and we got either one, two or three or four or five.

430
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:31,290
So that's going to be our sample space, right?

431
01:02:33,030 --> 01:02:39,030
And then we consider this sigma field, which is the superset.

432
01:02:43,550 --> 01:02:49,450
Of us all, a possible combination of the subset of us as our Sigma family.

433
01:02:51,020 --> 01:02:54,950
One of you raise the question, why do we care about this, this Sigma field?

434
01:02:55,430 --> 01:03:03,670
The reason is that in many cases, although this example, we use a super setup and in many cases we actually we do not care about the super.

435
01:03:04,370 --> 01:03:08,390
We want to focus on a much smaller collection of subsets.

436
01:03:09,590 --> 01:03:18,110
That's why Sigma Field actually matters, because it helps us to focus on a smaller, smaller collection of subsets.

437
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:23,510
It is close to all of these operations in probability function.

438
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:29,240
So that's why we care about this sigma theta and always consider the superset.

439
01:03:29,510 --> 01:03:33,110
And that's for many cases that's just going to be too complicated.

440
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:39,800
We want our probability function to focus just on the smallest subset, small collection of subset.

441
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:47,480
That's our sigma feel. Now we have this sigma felt and final in us.

442
01:03:47,510 --> 01:03:55,160
Define the probability. So in this case, assume that it would just throw the dart randomly to the board.

443
01:03:55,490 --> 01:03:57,050
Then, conceptually,

444
01:03:57,380 --> 01:04:12,020
the probability of hitting each number is proportional to the area of that particular wren compared to the entire area of the order of the target.

445
01:04:13,910 --> 01:04:17,060
And that is how we are going to define probability.

446
01:04:18,380 --> 01:04:34,190
In particular, let's define this quantity API to be the area of region high divided by the area of the board.

447
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:47,540
Okay. And from mathematics, we know the area of the board is this pi r square and the area of a region.

448
01:04:47,540 --> 01:04:51,350
I can calculate it.

449
01:04:53,630 --> 01:05:18,680
As. I might as I write this are square minus I I'm but it's all right I start square engines.

450
01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:27,590
But essentially the idea is just that using the page to circle the area of the paragraph circle minus the owner of the smaller circle,

451
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:31,970
so got the area of the rent. So you can simplify this.

452
01:05:32,510 --> 01:05:41,630
Essentially this is going to be six minus five by square, minus five I.

453
01:05:44,350 --> 01:05:58,460
Where we define this pie to be this quantity so far is not a probability yet.

454
01:05:59,140 --> 01:06:10,690
We have to verify that it's a probability. So the way that we verify is the probability for each possible outcome is following the axioms.

455
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:16,570
We need to show that all the axioms, congruent axioms, actually hold.

456
01:06:16,930 --> 01:06:20,350
Then we can. We can. We can declare this.

457
01:06:20,350 --> 01:06:25,090
This pie is a well-defined probability function for this particular example.

458
01:06:26,170 --> 01:06:38,170
So let's verify this axiom. First, we need to show that this p of us is equal to one and p of us.

459
01:06:38,470 --> 01:06:45,790
If you think about it, what as as is just collapsing in a one, two, three, four and five and they are mutually exclusive outcomes.

460
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:55,240
60 of us is just p one, two, three or five.

461
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:59,170
And if you add this numbers, it's actually 41.

462
01:06:59,980 --> 01:07:08,110
So assemble one holds a some two saying for any event, the probability functions should always be.

463
01:07:13,710 --> 01:07:23,550
Radar got a zero, which apparently is as we define this pie in this way is always query zero and find a subset of us.

464
01:07:24,470 --> 01:07:28,290
So as you add this numbers up, it's always on a zero.

465
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:37,500
So the second axiom also oh, and finally on the third one, we need to show that it's heavily in this case.

466
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:41,520
Again, it's a simpler this says we only have a finite number of outcomes.

467
01:07:42,060 --> 01:07:46,560
We don't have to worry about infinite Carnivale, infinite additive.

468
01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:49,710
All we need to show is the final activity.

469
01:07:50,740 --> 01:08:00,590
Okay, so that you can show for any side, any collection of this small space, as the probability is always the sum of this pi.

470
01:08:02,290 --> 01:08:16,770
So that can also be shown. And. So with those three confirmed,

471
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:24,870
now we can say this PI defines the probability of this of this sample's based

472
01:08:24,870 --> 01:08:32,939
on the barrel sigma less than the three in a collection known as the key.

473
01:08:32,940 --> 01:08:39,390
Defined in this way is the probability spikes. All right.

474
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:52,450
The real problems always follow this procedure and think about how we define the sum of space, how we define.

475
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:59,270
What do we care about in the sum of space? Not a view of the sigma filling and how we define the function.

476
01:08:59,780 --> 01:09:05,690
Only Sigma failed so that I satisfy all three axioms within three components.

477
01:09:05,930 --> 01:09:09,890
You got the proper basic questions.

478
01:09:15,750 --> 01:09:25,040
Right. So there are additional results from this axioms, from this probability formulas.

479
01:09:25,850 --> 01:09:29,290
Let's take a look at this. Found.

480
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:37,430
This result is pretty self-explanatory, but let's try to improve it from the definition using the axioms.

481
01:09:37,820 --> 01:09:42,710
And first one, the probability of this empty set is equal to zero.

482
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:49,310
So hopefully the probability of an empty set. Again, we have to follow the three accidents.

483
01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:58,040
What do we know is that probability of the full space is equal to one right?

484
01:09:58,850 --> 01:10:05,150
And we also know that this ampersand, this complement of this false space.

485
01:10:09,390 --> 01:10:16,440
And the intersection of these two is also equal to the fourth space.

486
01:10:18,150 --> 01:10:25,920
So using that activity, we kind of show that the intersection,

487
01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:35,460
the union of this small space on either side is equal to the probability of the sum of space.

488
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:43,620
Plus the probability of the empty space on the left hand side is equal to the probability of the small space.

489
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:49,650
So you can cancel them out and show that this is the probability of having this size zero.

490
01:10:51,690 --> 01:10:55,860
So here all we need is first the first axiom.

491
01:10:56,490 --> 01:11:00,420
The first axiom and the third axiom, actually a simplified version of the third.

492
01:11:03,630 --> 01:11:14,370
And the second one for any event is the probability that's always last equal to once again the union.

493
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:18,750
The complement is the sum of sample space.

494
01:11:20,070 --> 01:11:26,250
Now you can apply that activity to show that p e unity complement.

495
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:36,600
One, which is he was the accompaniment.

496
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:43,590
So that's an activity because he and he complementary are mutually exclusive.

497
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:49,020
He is a zero.

498
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:53,160
So p the complement must be less or equal to one.

499
01:11:53,940 --> 01:12:03,900
Can move it to the left hand side. Similarly, you can do exactly got the third result which is complement.

500
01:12:04,110 --> 01:12:11,150
The probability of the complement is always equal to one minus the probability of the original element.

501
01:12:14,670 --> 01:12:19,530
So as you can say, the way to show this results, you just need to ask them.

502
01:12:19,830 --> 01:12:25,200
That's why it's called the absence, right? That's all you need in order to show that it's a probability.

503
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:28,950
And once you have a probability function, these all follows.

504
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:36,660
So why don't you take a minute or two to show four or five and six?

505
01:12:38,430 --> 01:12:43,140
I don't know. So I'd say whether you can prove it just using the absence.

506
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:44,300
Hey, we got it. Okay.

507
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:50,330
Let's look at this together. So number four, first of all, the first doesn't.

508
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:55,490
You don't have to show because that's the definition I have minus e the difference between that and ye.

509
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:59,300
It's just a half E complement. That's how we define the difference.

510
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:04,040
Okay. All we need to show is, is this equation.

511
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:10,700
The probability of AP complement is equal to the probability of AB minus the probability of the intersection.

512
01:15:14,660 --> 01:15:23,900
Order to show that we need to to use the SAT operation and we need to take a look at what Alpha complement is.

513
01:15:24,650 --> 01:15:29,330
Assume this is our sample space. You have a half, you have a Yi.

514
01:15:29,870 --> 01:15:39,840
So you complement his this area, right?

515
01:15:41,180 --> 01:15:46,790
All the element that belongs to a not a he. So that's the difference between these two sets.

516
01:15:47,810 --> 01:15:53,000
So what it tells us is that the probability of these shaded area is equal to

517
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:57,920
the probability of minus the probability of an intersection between the two.

518
01:15:58,430 --> 01:16:06,200
So from the figure is pretty obvious. So the area of this shaded area is exactly equal to the area of this I'll of minus

519
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:11,930
that small intersection part where they are show that in a mathematical way.

520
01:16:12,230 --> 01:16:16,100
We need to use the axioms first.

521
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:20,390
We notice that half is equal to.

522
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:52,480
We have this relation. Right. Is set out as equal to have a complement union.

523
01:16:53,290 --> 01:17:00,010
AP are yeah you can divide this set up into this two parts.

524
01:17:00,490 --> 01:17:03,490
And furthermore we know that ABC.

525
01:17:05,550 --> 01:17:10,110
And you know, that that they said, yeah, there was this study,

526
01:17:10,470 --> 01:17:16,260
the intersection of it and the intersection of complement have they are mutually exclusive.

527
01:17:17,250 --> 01:17:23,910
And both of them becomes they start out with this, we can apply that activity.

528
01:17:24,510 --> 01:17:32,100
Right. So the probability of of now can be expressed as a probability of EOF clause,

529
01:17:32,250 --> 01:17:39,420
a probability of the complement or of e complement, then can move one to the other side.

530
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:48,880
Exactly to the result. So use the figure if that helps you understand what the probability is about.

531
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:51,670
And Nancy is content enough.

532
01:17:51,970 --> 01:18:04,540
So the probability of E is always the last time it goes out that similarly you can express out as E union and e complement.

533
01:18:06,370 --> 01:18:11,140
And so ski is contenir. So you can verify this is actually true.

534
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:15,070
And also the right hand side is two sides are mutually exclusive.

535
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:21,880
So if you write it in the same way, using that activity, you can show that he is always on that side to appear.

536
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:25,690
And finally, you can use the same idea to draw the figure.

537
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:29,220
I use a Venn diagram to show you. What is that, a union?

538
01:18:29,230 --> 01:18:33,940
What is the intersection? And you can prove that number six.

539
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:37,480
Okay. I'll leave it to you. All right.

540
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:49,590
Any question? So nice example.

541
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:54,670
Let's consider again tossing the coin now, tossing three points.

542
01:18:56,190 --> 01:19:03,780
So you toss three points in a row. The other words, it's an ordered sequencing on our sequencing away with replacements.

543
01:19:04,150 --> 01:19:12,220
Each time you're going to add or tail, it's always a hat or a tail, so it's not always a replacement or something with replacement.

544
01:19:12,610 --> 01:19:17,740
Then the sample space essentially contains 2 to 3 different options.

545
01:19:18,970 --> 01:19:22,480
That's what we have learned right at each opportunity for Safaricom.

546
01:19:22,750 --> 01:19:28,720
Each option should have equal probability, so all possible outcomes are listed below.

547
01:19:28,930 --> 01:19:34,150
x12x8 either three has two has one hat or no hat.

548
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:44,110
These are all possible outcomes. So our sample space in this example cannot be the collection of all possible outcomes.

549
01:19:44,170 --> 01:19:52,610
All possible outcomes. And again, our simplicity.

550
01:19:52,610 --> 01:19:55,620
Let's just consider the super sat here as our segment.

551
01:19:56,300 --> 01:20:02,930
If we define the function P for each possible out on that side to be one over eight,

552
01:20:04,220 --> 01:20:11,720
we can verify again following the three axioms the p of housing or one of a we are equal to

553
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:17,480
zero and these add activity we can verify this is actually a well-defined probability function,

554
01:20:19,550 --> 01:20:23,300
so each outcome has probability of one over eight.

555
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:29,480
Then with this defined, we can calculate any event that is defined on this problem.

556
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:35,150
In particular, we consider this a is a event of.

557
01:20:38,490 --> 01:20:44,460
At least two hearts. And so that's defined a to be this event.

558
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:59,510
The outcome has at least two hats. Now, what's the probability of a recall that in order to calculate the probability of this event,

559
01:20:59,930 --> 01:21:04,220
we need to know how many elements to compensate, how many horsepower comes.

560
01:21:05,090 --> 01:21:09,500
In this example, we know each outcome has equal probability one over eight.

561
01:21:09,950 --> 01:21:17,030
As long as we know how many possible outcomes are in this event, we can easily tell what is the probability.

562
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:25,250
So what is this a translates to? At least two hearts.

563
01:21:25,940 --> 01:21:29,090
So it can't have three has our two hearts. All right.

564
01:21:29,450 --> 01:21:38,360
So you can tell the outcome. X what about x2i3x4.

565
01:21:38,730 --> 01:21:42,080
And I also know. Right? That's it.

566
01:21:43,010 --> 01:21:47,530
So these four possible outcomes are the cases where you have at least two.

567
01:21:50,330 --> 01:21:57,020
Now you have translated this event a from this verbal description to a to a set

568
01:21:57,980 --> 01:22:02,200
of this possible outcomes where you can play this probability function not.

569
01:22:04,610 --> 01:22:17,890
As you know, Peel Eye is on one H, so p0a is just calling that activity just as the iron goes from one to 4pa backside,

570
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:27,340
which is part of a file to give you the probability and event that is defined on this sample space.

571
01:22:31,690 --> 01:22:37,300
So another question. Let's define B to B.

572
01:22:48,610 --> 01:22:53,350
You've got to have before tail. So what's the probability of being.

573
01:23:03,620 --> 01:23:08,860
Everyone. Question.

574
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:12,190
Yes. So does that mean you have to go to jail at least once?

575
01:23:12,460 --> 01:23:23,370
Yes. Eyes make it easier without ambiguity of not saying You've got to hide after you.

576
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:39,300
So what's the probability? I'll be gone and I'll tell. It's still one.

577
01:23:41,650 --> 01:23:47,410
Can you first define this, this particular asset or this event?

578
01:23:49,270 --> 01:24:01,180
We have. x2x2x3x3x4x4656.

579
01:24:02,290 --> 01:24:11,349
And that's all right. X four as far as what's going to happen after a so far does not satisfy that.

580
01:24:11,350 --> 01:24:16,320
Right. So as to you got to hand out a tail.

581
01:24:16,330 --> 01:24:19,569
So that's good x three. You've got a hat off the tail.

582
01:24:19,570 --> 01:24:24,300
That's good. And it's x seven, right?

583
01:24:24,310 --> 01:24:28,600
You've got a hat out and a tail and axes. Right.

584
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:36,280
So it should be x two, 3x7 and max eight.

585
01:24:38,050 --> 01:24:47,340
So really the key here is to translate the verbal description of a event to a collection of possible outcomes.

586
01:24:48,490 --> 01:24:52,060
Once you have this, then the next stop is pretty straightforward.

587
01:24:52,360 --> 01:25:02,589
By just applying whatever probability function that you have defined or his outcome to this particular set now give you just four over eight again.

588
01:25:02,590 --> 01:25:06,120
One over. Oh, wow. Okay.

589
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:11,890
So in context, when you calculate the probability in many cases and actually follow this logic,

590
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:19,150
your first need to properly define what is the event is in your notation,

591
01:25:19,780 --> 01:25:27,130
and then apply the function that you have defined to that particular set of probability questions.

592
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:34,150
Okay. So last example to go to this.

593
01:25:37,150 --> 01:25:51,050
So if I throw two days in a row, again, this falls into a corner standpoint with replacement because each dice is a separate dice, right?

594
01:25:51,070 --> 01:26:02,020
You can got 1 to 6. And if you were to decide that it's all or sampling with replacement from here to the table give you all possible outcomes.

595
01:26:02,350 --> 01:26:08,110
The first dice you can have one, two, three, four, five, six. And the second night it can also have one, two, six.

596
01:26:09,850 --> 01:26:16,380
And this tape, I just give you all the summations for the two numbers that I get from this two throws.

597
01:26:20,230 --> 01:26:26,440
And in this table are these numbers are these are each entry have equal probability.

598
01:26:28,540 --> 01:26:36,040
They do. Right. Because as again, as I said, it's an ordered sampling with replacement.

599
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:42,100
So these 636 possible outcomes have equal probability.

600
01:26:44,620 --> 01:26:54,200
But these outcomes, they are not all different. As you can see, you have one, two, two, three, three, four, etc., right?

601
01:26:54,460 --> 01:27:02,080
But each number, each entry have a equal probability of this entry.

602
01:27:02,410 --> 01:27:07,120
It just means you have six from your first row, one from the second row.

603
01:27:07,660 --> 01:27:11,530
That exactly. Having a probability of one over 36.

604
01:27:12,910 --> 01:27:17,110
So now the question of what is the probability of summing to seven,

605
01:27:19,450 --> 01:27:24,960
then the problem, then you want to calculate not what do we need to do is to count.

606
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:30,430
How many sounds do we have in this table divided by the total number of possible outcomes?

607
01:27:31,790 --> 01:27:42,750
Right. So if you look at this table, these are the cases where are you going to get at 7 to 6 in total divided by 36 of outcomes.

608
01:27:43,420 --> 01:27:56,510
I just give you one over six. Alternatively, you can also use the content that we have learned before the Article seven.

609
01:27:59,300 --> 01:28:03,050
Well, in total, you know, you have six squared possibilities.

610
01:28:03,050 --> 01:28:10,070
You already got seven basically, or any number from the first time.

611
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:13,910
You know exactly what number you need from the second time.

612
01:28:15,790 --> 01:28:19,940
Right. So you total how many different possibilities. Just six.

613
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:25,580
Each number you got from the first. I know exactly what number of eight from the second.

614
01:28:26,450 --> 01:28:33,380
So there are only six possibilities. So that's why you have six divided by six could also give you one over six.

615
01:28:40,980 --> 01:28:46,510
Questions. Okay.

616
01:28:47,680 --> 01:28:57,460
MAXINE, sample is the urn sampling. So assume that we have an urn with white balls and rad balls and w is the number of white balls.

617
01:28:57,550 --> 01:29:02,530
R is the number of grand balls and we have equal probability to be drawn from the urn.

618
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:11,770
So let's let w I define that event, assuming that we only want to draw one ball from there.

619
01:29:12,070 --> 01:29:13,630
And so that's our experiment.

620
01:29:14,110 --> 01:29:26,590
And why is the event of drawing that I white ball I goes from one to W and j is the event of drawing that j radical j from one to r.

621
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:32,680
So all these balls are identical. You have equal probability to be drawn from the urn.

622
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:42,040
Then what do we know? Is that p of that? If I an appeal by p of RJ, they should have equal probability.

623
01:29:43,570 --> 01:29:53,260
And if they define on probability p then following the axioms we can say that the sample space essentially of the union of all of these events,

624
01:29:53,590 --> 01:29:59,560
because we're going to draw one ball from the R is either a particular liberal or particular radical.

625
01:29:59,650 --> 01:30:08,680
So as is just a unit of all of these possible outcomes and if you sum the probability of this of all possible outcomes,

626
01:30:08,680 --> 01:30:16,030
now initially it's closer, right? You can calculate this P has to be said to be this number one over a total number

627
01:30:16,030 --> 01:30:21,070
of balls in there that actually gave us the probability of drawing each ball.

628
01:30:22,300 --> 01:30:28,540
With that, we can calculate the probability of an event, for example, the event of drawing a white ball.

629
01:30:28,780 --> 01:30:39,610
Essentially, you can express that as a union of w12w small W says they are mutually exclusive event.

630
01:30:40,120 --> 01:30:48,070
The probability is just the sum of this. Individually probabilities is being p which is one over w plus right.

631
01:30:48,250 --> 01:30:54,070
So that give you the probability of drawing a white ball from this urn is w over w plus r.

632
01:30:55,330 --> 01:31:03,310
So the same logic as before, what we need to do is to first define the probability for each event or each possible outcome,

633
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:07,960
and then you can use that to calculate the probability of an event.

634
01:31:09,250 --> 01:31:13,480
That's. All right.

635
01:31:13,490 --> 01:31:25,399
So next, let's take a look at two famous inequalities that it's commonly used in in probability calculation, especially later on.

636
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:31,760
We want to prove, you know, more sophisticated algorithms, more sophisticated theorems.

637
01:31:32,150 --> 01:31:36,110
You will use this inequalities for probability.

638
01:31:36,530 --> 01:31:38,450
One is called the both inequality.

639
01:31:38,900 --> 01:31:51,950
So it's stated as follows Let's assume you want to use the events and defining this are in the Sigma Theta and we have this inequality.

640
01:31:52,280 --> 01:31:58,970
The probability of the union of these events is always the last or equal to the sum of individual probabilities.

641
01:32:01,770 --> 01:32:05,550
This is very close to what we have seen before. You add activity, right?

642
01:32:05,570 --> 01:32:09,500
But the difference is that we do not require them to be mutually exclusive.

643
01:32:10,270 --> 01:32:19,460
If they are mutually exclusive, as you can imagine, the probability of the union has to be equal to the sum of the individual probabilities.

644
01:32:20,300 --> 01:32:25,070
But if they are not mutually exclusive now, we always have.

645
01:32:25,490 --> 01:32:30,690
The probability of a union is smaller again graphically.

646
01:32:30,690 --> 01:32:36,980
It probably is easier to understand if you have a bunch of sets that have overlap.

647
01:32:42,740 --> 01:32:49,580
The left hand side is just going to be the area of all of these events.

648
01:32:50,340 --> 01:32:55,760
Right and the right hand side is going to be the area, the sample barrier of each event.

649
01:32:56,270 --> 01:33:02,480
Apparently, there are some areas are going to be double content or even triple calls in this example.

650
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:08,180
So that's why the left hand side is smaller or equal to the right hand side.

651
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:14,480
It always will be equal if there is no overlap between these different events.

652
01:33:16,340 --> 01:33:22,460
So that's the reason why this is actually the case, why this inequality holds.

653
01:33:24,950 --> 01:33:29,870
But that's actually why that that's that's the case. So I want you to follow through it.

654
01:33:30,140 --> 01:33:41,630
We have to strategically construct a sequence of events, a sequence of new events that are mutually exclusive so that we can apply our.

655
01:33:45,940 --> 01:33:49,630
We can apply our axioms to prove this in a.

656
01:33:51,790 --> 01:33:57,640
Okay. So this idea of constructing a new sequence of events is also very important.

657
01:33:58,460 --> 01:34:03,790
So it is a very common technique that can be used in other scenarios as well.

658
01:34:04,210 --> 01:34:10,570
So let's take a look at it together. So the way to construct a sequence of events that are mutually exclusive.

659
01:34:12,100 --> 01:34:18,460
So the reason why we want a mutually exclusive is because once we have that, we can apply what we have, what we know.

660
01:34:18,550 --> 01:34:26,650
Right? We can apply the third axioms. So that's why we need mutually exclusive sets or mutually exclusive events.

661
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:30,250
So the way to do it is that we start from the first one.

662
01:34:33,270 --> 01:34:40,679
We said we want this new event to be one equal to the original E1 and NULL,

663
01:34:40,680 --> 01:34:48,840
and that b two is set to be the intersection of this e two and E one complement.

664
01:34:50,070 --> 01:35:03,360
So think about this is you want this is e to the only thing that gave us trouble is the intersection area, right?

665
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:10,030
You want to get rid of that part. The way that we construct is for the.

666
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:23,720
For be what we just constructed to be the same as our year one and four might be two.

667
01:35:24,170 --> 01:35:28,370
We take out this intersection part and all.

668
01:35:28,370 --> 01:35:33,170
I consider the remaining party two as RB two.

669
01:35:34,950 --> 01:35:41,820
I weigh this B1, B2. First of all, the unit of this two is still the same of the unit, if you want to.

670
01:35:42,920 --> 01:35:47,310
And second, they are mutually exclusive. Right.

671
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:51,870
And third, if you have additional sets.

672
01:36:00,130 --> 01:36:10,000
This is our E3. We follow the same logic and define the PS3 as this art.

673
01:36:10,450 --> 01:36:18,320
Okay. It's been to.

674
01:36:23,430 --> 01:36:24,810
But this is three.

675
01:36:27,810 --> 01:36:38,190
And then you can follow this procedure to construct all of this, the entire sequence of this event be as a result by this construction.

676
01:36:38,550 --> 01:36:41,490
What we can tell directly is that, first of all,

677
01:36:41,820 --> 01:36:51,510
the union of B1 to be and is always equal to the union of you want to a union and mathematically also prove that in a more rigorous way.

678
01:36:51,750 --> 01:36:55,470
But at least graphically you can easily say that.

679
01:36:56,130 --> 01:37:00,990
And the second base that as we construct it, they are mutually exclusive.

680
01:37:01,110 --> 01:37:05,970
There is no intersection between any pair of this of this be events.

681
01:37:06,120 --> 01:37:11,760
That's because we are ready to take the previous ones out.

682
01:37:13,680 --> 01:37:24,720
So this is a very clever construction of a new sequence of set up sets, not only how by being mutually exclusive.

683
01:37:28,540 --> 01:37:38,739
And the union is also equal. Then the origin of life outside now becomes the probability of a union.

684
01:37:38,740 --> 01:37:47,920
Ion goes from one to and beyond, says by our mutually exclusive and compliant activity from the axiom to get that,

685
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:51,520
that's also equal to the sum of this individual probability.

686
01:37:53,250 --> 01:38:04,210
But. Now all that's left is to show that this guy, some of this PBI is always the last week or two of the some of P.E.I.

687
01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:15,890
And there is another thing that we can see from this graph is that each P.E.I. is strictly a subset of the corresponding year.

688
01:38:16,790 --> 01:38:24,160
Because the way that which was struck by is, to me, the Origin II intersect with some other stuff.

689
01:38:25,070 --> 01:38:28,340
So it's always going to be smaller or equal to the Origin II.

690
01:38:29,090 --> 01:38:32,120
So that tells us why it's.

691
01:38:36,740 --> 01:38:40,270
The probability API is always the last one equal to the probability.

692
01:38:41,060 --> 01:38:47,540
So putting everything together we can grab this inequality because a couple of blocks are true.

693
01:38:47,570 --> 01:38:54,440
But this idea actually can be widely used to other scenarios as well.

694
01:38:55,020 --> 01:38:57,680
So construct a new sets based on what you need.

695
01:38:59,210 --> 01:39:10,730
In this case, our motivating, our motivation is that we know the third axioms tells us we can change the probability with the summation.

696
01:39:11,810 --> 01:39:17,060
Right. You look at the original inequality that we are trying to prove.

697
01:39:17,060 --> 01:39:20,630
There is some exchange between the summation and the probability.

698
01:39:20,870 --> 01:39:27,440
So our motivation is that we want to use the third axiom, but he already use that we need mutually exclusive.

699
01:39:28,250 --> 01:39:32,180
So that's why we need to construct a sequence that satisfy that constraint.

700
01:39:39,400 --> 01:39:48,629
Any question. All right.

701
01:39:48,630 --> 01:39:55,590
So that's probably not a very important theorem or inequality as kind of bumper on inequality.

702
01:39:56,160 --> 01:40:03,960
So apparently inequality is also about bounding the probability of the union of a bunch of events.

703
01:40:06,030 --> 01:40:11,099
So in the middle we still have this probability of the union of e12 yet again.

704
01:40:11,100 --> 01:40:15,930
You want. Yeah. Or events that are not necessarily mutually exclusive.

705
01:40:16,770 --> 01:40:23,970
So the upper bound is the both inequality varied and no that is a summation of individual probability.

706
01:40:24,300 --> 01:40:30,420
Now we also have a lower bound which is unique to this operative quality.

707
01:40:30,870 --> 01:40:38,400
The lower bound said this probability of the union is lower, bounded by the sum of individual probability,

708
01:40:38,700 --> 01:40:47,730
minus some quantity, minus the sum of pairwise the intersection probabilities.

709
01:40:50,660 --> 01:40:54,830
Again. Let's first look at it graphically. Say why that's the case.

710
01:40:54,900 --> 01:41:02,020
Okay. We have this a1 e to e three again.

711
01:41:02,030 --> 01:41:13,770
And this, this, this thing in the middle is essentially you can consider it as the area of this of the 330 X.

712
01:41:14,610 --> 01:41:19,830
So it's super bounded apparently by the sum of the of the areas of each of the circle

713
01:41:20,130 --> 01:41:32,340
and lower about it by the sum of the three circles minus every pairwise shaded area.

714
01:41:34,590 --> 01:41:41,490
And the reason why is the lower violated by it is because we actually subtract the area more than what do we need to.

715
01:41:42,120 --> 01:41:49,800
We subtract this middle part where the three intersect with one another three times.

716
01:41:52,460 --> 01:41:57,430
We actually only need to subtract one time.

717
01:41:57,440 --> 01:42:00,020
But when I say something, some try to do it three times.

718
01:42:00,380 --> 01:42:08,720
So that's what we're going to end up with a quantity that is much smaller than the average of the three so called combine,

719
01:42:10,180 --> 01:42:13,460
but because actually that's why it's the lower bound by this quantity.

720
01:42:13,910 --> 01:42:20,600
So now let's take a look at how to prove that this is the lower body by the right hand side.

721
01:42:20,600 --> 01:42:25,670
We don't need to prove it to this inequality and the left hand side, we're going to use induction.

722
01:42:28,310 --> 01:42:39,590
So for those who are not familiar induction essentially the idea is you should first show it for anyone to to is satisfied and then if and equal

723
01:42:39,590 --> 01:42:50,630
to and if satisfied then for any plus one it also satisfied then by induction you can show that for any I number and it always satisfies.

724
01:42:51,470 --> 01:42:55,870
Okay. So first, let's take a look at any quarter two angles.

725
01:42:55,950 --> 01:42:57,680
The two just means you have two assets.

726
01:42:58,250 --> 01:43:10,370
There is a reduce as to the equality that I was shown before, but that that equality number six now is shown in the previous slides.

727
01:43:11,810 --> 01:43:19,670
So the probability of the union two is equal to the probability of one plus the probability of E two minus the probability of intersection.

728
01:43:20,300 --> 01:43:23,600
It's not exactly the same reason, right?

729
01:43:23,880 --> 01:43:36,170
The area of this to combine is the area of each of it minus this overlap because we cut it twice when we sum up the area of the two circles.

730
01:43:37,250 --> 01:43:40,850
So that's going to be exactly equal. Sign says it's equal.

731
01:43:40,850 --> 01:43:48,560
It also satisfied is equal equal to and you got to do as good.

732
01:43:50,390 --> 01:43:55,700
Now let's assume only for the minus one. Then we have this inequality, okay?

733
01:43:56,870 --> 01:44:00,469
Or Union Chi goes from 1 to 1 minus one.

734
01:44:00,470 --> 01:44:06,870
We have this inequality in the same format. What we need to show is that they also hold four.

735
01:44:07,030 --> 01:44:14,210
And now once we show that we can use induction to to conclude that all satisfied.

736
01:44:18,360 --> 01:44:26,160
So the idea again is the same as using the same construction to convert the original site to a new sequence of events.

737
01:44:26,820 --> 01:44:30,360
So the way that we construct it is exactly the same as before.

738
01:44:31,380 --> 01:44:40,400
So we end up with these mutually exclusive sets and the universal BCI.

739
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:48,440
Now, is that now is equal to the CPI? I want to end by this one and also we define it to be ex.

740
01:44:49,020 --> 01:45:00,300
Exactly. Now what in the middle that we need to care about is a unit I goes from one to.

741
01:45:01,650 --> 01:45:04,730
Recall that. And it's a number that we need to consider now.

742
01:45:06,980 --> 01:45:08,730
This is what we want to show in the middle.

743
01:45:09,510 --> 01:45:19,290
And this can be now expressed as the union I goes from one to another side is equal to the union of B and A.

744
01:45:19,290 --> 01:45:22,720
Yes. I construction. Right.

745
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:28,290
Because this fee is equal to the union of the.

746
01:45:29,090 --> 01:45:32,180
All right. I just want to add a minus one.

747
01:45:33,350 --> 01:45:41,480
So the first equality and second, that we can apply the same equality that we have shown before.

748
01:45:41,870 --> 01:45:49,910
Just to break down this second term into the three terms, p, b plus P minus p, b.

749
01:45:56,230 --> 01:46:03,400
I think everybody go good with that. They just applied the same in quality and quantity, same quality that we have.

750
01:46:04,270 --> 01:46:11,400
We have no one else. Break it down to the three parts. And the reason for that is really we want this here.

751
01:46:11,770 --> 01:46:19,330
We want to extract this piece. We need to pull this piece together with the summation of other pieces.

752
01:46:20,260 --> 01:46:23,320
So that's why we need to apply bass equality.

753
01:46:24,220 --> 01:46:32,470
And once we have that, we know PBE already from minus one is quite able to based on it.

754
01:46:33,510 --> 01:46:36,930
Okay. It's great. I go to a start.

755
01:46:36,930 --> 01:46:41,560
I goes on one, two and minus one, minus the sum of its paralyzing assumptions.

756
01:46:42,750 --> 01:46:48,230
And anyway, just follow what it is down here about it.

757
01:46:49,710 --> 01:46:57,990
And we got this first inequality. It's not there yet, but it's getting close right now.

758
01:46:57,990 --> 01:46:59,490
Let's do some a recombination.

759
01:46:59,610 --> 01:47:08,880
So since we already have this some sum of I goes from 1 to -1 and this additional probability of yeah, we can combine them.

760
01:47:09,210 --> 01:47:19,640
So it becomes the first quantity of not only right always keep in mind the first quantity is the summation of individual probabilities.

761
01:47:21,300 --> 01:47:29,430
So if you sum up this to exactly give you the sum of individual probabilities, so we already have the first time.

762
01:47:29,850 --> 01:47:33,180
So all we need to care about is the second term, right?

763
01:47:33,420 --> 01:47:40,860
This pairwise intersections and from minus one we already have the pairwise intersection for minus one pairs.

764
01:47:41,670 --> 01:47:49,410
Now we can break down this additional part B in a section with the I construction.

765
01:47:49,650 --> 01:47:52,920
This B is equal to this yeah.

766
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:58,770
Intersection with B one union B to all of us to be minus one.

767
01:47:58,890 --> 01:48:02,250
And this piece, they are mutually exclusive.

768
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:05,880
So is equal to BS, mutually exclusive sets.

769
01:48:08,680 --> 01:48:17,770
Which follows the last term in this double star formula is equal to the summation of these pairwise intersections.

770
01:48:20,230 --> 01:48:23,470
Right now. It's gotten really close.

771
01:48:23,830 --> 01:48:31,750
We already have the first term and the second one. We already break it down into a bunch of some of probability of intersections.

772
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:37,930
The last step is to replace this MBI with the.

773
01:48:39,220 --> 01:48:50,379
Yeah, and that is exactly because your bye bye construction is a subset of.

774
01:48:50,380 --> 01:48:55,750
Yeah, yeah. So we can have another, you call it equal inequality.

775
01:48:56,410 --> 01:49:03,490
That is the probability of B is less or equal to the sum items from 1 to 1.

776
01:49:03,910 --> 01:49:19,190
P Yeah. Now, if you put everything together, eventually you got the lower bound that you desire or an equal to it.

777
01:49:22,260 --> 01:49:24,420
So after class you can go over this proof.

778
01:49:25,080 --> 01:49:33,240
But the idea behind this proof is it's really just constructing this new sequence of cells that are mutually exclusive.

779
01:49:34,860 --> 01:49:38,159
Although it's similarly complicated.

780
01:49:38,160 --> 01:49:47,530
But once you got an idea of how to construct this sequence of mutually exclusive sets, the race is just applying.

781
01:49:47,990 --> 01:49:53,730
There's no inequalities, and they can't figure out where we might go.

782
01:49:56,130 --> 01:49:58,980
So it would be helpful if you.
