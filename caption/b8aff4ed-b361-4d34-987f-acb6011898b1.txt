1
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,970
Imagine waking up and
finding toxic waste

2
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,460
bubbling into your
basement or living

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,680
their local lake that
so contaminated with

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,695
hazardous waste that
birds land there and die.

5
00:00:19,695 --> 00:00:21,330
This may sound like
a horror film,

6
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,220
but in fact this is a
situation that's been

7
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,635
faced by many
communities in America.

8
00:00:25,635 --> 00:00:27,480
In this module, we're
going to focus on

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,675
one particular seminal
hazardous waste event.

10
00:00:30,675 --> 00:00:33,450
Many of you may have
visited or at least heard

11
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,900
of Niagara Falls in New York.

12
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,445
So Niagara Falls has been

13
00:00:37,445 --> 00:00:40,370
a very successful community
with lots of industry.

14
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:42,755
The photo you're looking
at here is a view

15
00:00:42,755 --> 00:00:45,785
of one of the canyon
walls in Niagara Falls.

16
00:00:45,785 --> 00:00:48,425
You can see how much
industry has built up there

17
00:00:48,425 --> 00:00:51,610
to take advantage of the
hydro-power opportunities.

18
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:54,440
Now, just upstream
from the actual

19
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,635
falls is a little community
called Love Canal.

20
00:00:57,635 --> 00:00:59,600
So you can see here that

21
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,450
Niagara Falls is the
white spot in the map,

22
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:03,860
that's of course the froth from

23
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,270
the water going over the falls,

24
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:07,070
and just to the right
of that you'll find

25
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,105
a little icon that's

26
00:01:08,105 --> 00:01:10,520
the location of the
Love Canal community.

27
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,870
Let's talk about Love Canal.

28
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,780
So Love Canal actually
began in 1892.

29
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,685
A man named William T Love

30
00:01:16,685 --> 00:01:19,190
proposed what he called
a new model city,

31
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:21,530
and as part of this
development plan,

32
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:24,500
he wanted to build a seven
mile canal connecting

33
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,720
the upper and lower
Niagara River basically

34
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,165
allowing boats to get
around the falls.

35
00:01:29,165 --> 00:01:31,700
So Mr. Loves started
construction on this canal,

36
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,260
but unfortunately
abandoned it after

37
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,000
an economic depression occurred.

38
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,685
What he did complete
was a section of canal

39
00:01:37,685 --> 00:01:40,985
about 60 feet wide
and 3,000 feet long.

40
00:01:40,985 --> 00:01:43,310
So that canal or portion of

41
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,680
canal set dormant
for a decade or so,

42
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,450
but in the 1920s this

43
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:50,135
completed 15 acre section
of the canal became

44
00:01:50,135 --> 00:01:52,580
a municipal disposal
site that was used

45
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,630
by the City of Niagara
Falls and the US Army.

46
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:58,250
Now, a company called
Hooker Chemical

47
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,220
purchased Love Canal in 1942,

48
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,410
and they use the site
to dispose of almost

49
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:06,335
22,000 tons of chemical waste.

50
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:08,150
So this chemical waste
was sealed up in

51
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:10,430
metal drums like you see in
the image on your slides

52
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:15,100
here and was buried about
20-25 feet below ground level.

53
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,360
In 1953, the canal was

54
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,370
filled and covered
with clay and dirt.

55
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:20,795
This was standard practice to

56
00:02:20,795 --> 00:02:22,610
seal up a landfill at the time.

57
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,860
Now, the Niagara Falls
Board of Education

58
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:25,940
was actually interested in

59
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,320
this property because
they wanted to build

60
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,825
a school and a new
community in the area.

61
00:02:29,825 --> 00:02:31,820
They actually threatened
Hooker Chemical to

62
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,740
condemn the property
and ultimately

63
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,750
Hooker Chemical sold the property

64
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,170
to the Board of Education
for one dollar.

65
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:39,920
But in the deed transfer

66
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,560
Hooker Chemical put a warning
noting that there are

67
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,650
chemical wastes buried on this
property and also included

68
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,600
the disclaimer
basically absolving

69
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,585
Hooker Chemical of
any future liability.

70
00:02:50,585 --> 00:02:53,210
So the Niagara Falls
Board of Education

71
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,260
and proceeded to build

72
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,790
what was called the 99th Street

73
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,650
Elementary School
right on the site.

74
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,720
In the 1954, contractors we're

75
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,790
working on to build
the school and ended

76
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,710
up hitting soft
spots in holes and

77
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:06,515
countering very strong
odors and chemicals.

78
00:03:06,515 --> 00:03:08,630
In fact the situation was
so bad that they ended up

79
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:11,030
moving the whole school 85 feet

80
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,980
poured a new foundation
and completed

81
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:16,195
the school one year
later in 1955.

82
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:18,350
Shortly after the
school was completed,

83
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:21,170
homes began to be
constructed sewers

84
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,290
were put into place
and roadways as well,

85
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,280
and all of this
construction breached

86
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,280
the clay and soil cap
over the waste dump.

87
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,050
Homeowners were not warned in

88
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,520
any way that their property was

89
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,580
located near or on a
hazardous waste dump,

90
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,990
and ultimately the area

91
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,940
developed into a blue
collar neighborhood with

92
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,860
about 800 single-family homes

93
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,520
in 240 low-income apartments.

94
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,160
Between the 1950s and

95
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,300
the 1970s people in the
community repeatedly complained

96
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,580
of odors and substances
coming up in

97
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,010
their yards and in the
school playground,

98
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:53,390
they noted this to
the government and

99
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,145
the City of Niagara
Falls officials were

100
00:03:55,145 --> 00:03:58,000
basically indifferent
to these complaints.

101
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,380
Now, there was unusually
heavy rain and

102
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,300
snowfall in 1975 and

103
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,190
1976 that actually raised

104
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,950
the groundwater levels
in the Love Canal area.

105
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,335
This actually allowed
the chemicals to

106
00:04:09,335 --> 00:04:11,855
move throughout the
environment and

107
00:04:11,855 --> 00:04:14,540
enter the sewer system
and also enter basements

108
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,300
and yards and again appear
in the school playground.

109
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,830
So you can see an image here of

110
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:21,130
chemicals coming up
through the ground there.

111
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,000
Actually the water table raises

112
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,680
so dramatically that
the land became

113
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,950
unstable and portions of the
landfill basically subsided.

114
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:31,160
So this brought 55-gallon
drums will have chemicals to

115
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,050
the surface ponds and

116
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,885
other surface water nearby
became contaminated.

117
00:04:35,885 --> 00:04:37,970
People began to notice
that their basements were

118
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:40,460
filled with this
Oozie oily residue

119
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,830
and also noxious chemical odors

120
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:45,140
were uniformly noticed
around the area,

121
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,120
and homeowners also
noticed that there was

122
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,220
chemical corrosion
of the sump pumps

123
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,060
in their basement and
their basement walls.

124
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,160
In 1976, the city
and county hired

125
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,935
a consulting company to
investigate the situation.

126
00:04:57,935 --> 00:05:00,620
So that Cal span Corporation
came in and they found

127
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,600
toxic chemical residues in

128
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,010
the air and in the sump
pumps of many homes.

129
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:07,010
They found chemical drums just

130
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:09,455
beneath or in some
cases on the surface

131
00:05:09,455 --> 00:05:11,630
and they found very high
levels of chemicals

132
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:14,380
called PCBs in the
storm sewer system.

133
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,940
Now unfortunately the
city did not act on

134
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,530
the mitigation
recommendations that

135
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:20,300
cows band Corporation made.

136
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,300
So the photo you see here
is basically evidence of

137
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,730
community activism
that was necessary to

138
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:29,125
raise awareness and try to
trigger government action.

139
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:31,510
In March of 1978,

140
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,590
the New York State
Department of Health began

141
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,690
to sample air and soil in

142
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:38,330
people's basements and
also began a study

143
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:41,200
of the health of families
immediately around the canal.

144
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,000
The study concluded in 1979

145
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,790
and noted an increase in
reproductive problems among

146
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:49,535
women in the area and also
noted very high levels

147
00:05:49,535 --> 00:05:52,885
of chemical contaminants in
the soil and in the air.

148
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:55,940
Now, in August 1978 the
Department of Health issue

149
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,260
to health order that recommended

150
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,760
that the 99th Street School be

151
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,190
closed that residents
not eat out of

152
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,930
their home gardens
and that they spend

153
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,860
limited amounts of time
in their basement.

154
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,930
In August 1978, the
federal government

155
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:11,570
got involved when President
Jimmy Carter declared a state

156
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,010
of emergency and negotiated

157
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:14,690
an agreement where
New York State would

158
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:18,545
purchase the 239 homes that
were closest to the canal.

159
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:21,395
The federal government would
relocate those families,

160
00:06:21,395 --> 00:06:24,365
fences would be placed
around the evacuated area.

161
00:06:24,365 --> 00:06:25,850
Unfortunately, there were 700

162
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,875
additional families
that were considered at

163
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,870
insufficient risk
of health outcomes

164
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,970
to actually warrant relocation.

165
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:34,070
But there was
additional outcry and

166
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:36,020
activism from the
community and that caused

167
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,415
President Carter to declare

168
00:06:37,415 --> 00:06:40,325
a second state of
emergency in 1980.

169
00:06:40,325 --> 00:06:42,320
This was basically
an evacuation order

170
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,420
for all pregnant women
and children under

171
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,400
the age of two and resulted in

172
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,360
the remaining 700 families
getting relocated.

173
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,800
Now, in a previous module,

174
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,850
we talked about the
Comprehensive Environmental

175
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,430
Response Compensation
and Liability Act

176
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,980
or CERCLA that was
passed in 1980.

177
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,945
This is also called
the Superfund Act.

178
00:06:59,945 --> 00:07:01,130
Love Canal was actually

179
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:03,050
the very first site
that was placed on

180
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:05,180
the national priority
list that guides

181
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:08,540
superfund and prioritize
the sites to be cleaned up.

182
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,490
So clean up was undertaken by

183
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:12,335
the Environmental
Protection Agency.

184
00:07:12,335 --> 00:07:14,120
Most of the clean-up
was completed by

185
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,760
1989 at a cost of $400 million,

186
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,445
you can see some of the clean-up
activities picture here.

187
00:07:19,445 --> 00:07:21,650
Most of the toxic
area ended up getting

188
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,810
reburied with a plastic liner
and offense put around it,

189
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,810
and in fact in 2004 the site was

190
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:29,950
removed from the Superfund
national priority list,

191
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,350
but the waste is still there.

192
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,950
So there's ongoing maintenance
and monitoring activities

193
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,060
the landfill cap is

194
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,490
inspected regularly
and groundwater

195
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,040
is also monitored
on a regular basis.

196
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,290
Nevertheless, there are ongoing

197
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:44,030
and in recent years increasing

198
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,920
complaints of chemical
contamination

199
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,790
among the homeowners
who remain nearby.

200
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:52,415
So let's review the legacy
of this tragic event.

201
00:07:52,415 --> 00:07:54,200
The people in this
community we're exposed to

202
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,050
at least 12 human or
animal carcinogens things

203
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:00,260
like benzene and
chlorobenzene and dioxin,

204
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:03,530
and there were more than 200
distinct organic chemicals

205
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:06,355
identified at the
toxic waste site.

206
00:08:06,355 --> 00:08:08,750
Unfortunately, in the
community members exposed

207
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,835
there's evidence of
reproductive effects,

208
00:08:10,835 --> 00:08:13,910
chromosomal damage, and a
range of other health impacts.

209
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,070
So this truly does
qualify as among

210
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:18,245
the worst US
environmental tragedies.

211
00:08:18,245 --> 00:08:21,155
There's also a major
environmental justice piece here.

212
00:08:21,155 --> 00:08:23,720
So people were forced
to abandon their homes.

213
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,225
Entire families
were displaced and

214
00:08:26,225 --> 00:08:28,100
unfortunately
vulnerable children and

215
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,390
low-income families were
among the most impacted.

216
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,850
So this is a tragedy
make no mistake,

217
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,750
but it did fortunately result

218
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,760
in some improvement
in the way that we

219
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,430
regulate and deal with
hazardous waste as

220
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:43,100
I said superfund was
passed basically as

221
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,050
a direct result of this incident

222
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:47,570
and gives us more
powerful tools today

223
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,625
to make sure that we
don't have a repeat

224
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:54,080
of the very unfortunate
Love Canal incident.
