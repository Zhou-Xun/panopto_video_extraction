1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:08,070
If there is no questions about logistics, just remember we'll vote next time on.

2
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:15,540
If I finish that reading, talk about the midterm one. It's actually not much to talk about, I think.

3
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:22,980
Fair to say it's not difficult. But, you know, I think some of these things, you just need to pay attention to details.

4
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:29,960
Things are. Well, this isn't like research and commentary in the future.

5
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:36,150
It's not really we're not working on any you know, it's like a hundred years math problem.

6
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,330
You have to have some special angle to tackle the problem.

7
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:41,970
I think we everybody has seen this.

8
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:49,800
You know, where is the right angle is you just need to pay attention to the details and find the right tool and then.

9
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:56,730
To find the solution. And the other important thing is, is know how to communicate.

10
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:07,410
An exam is a way you communicate with me. If I can follow your thought process, you know, I can say you are your successful.

11
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:12,750
If I don't know where you're going, and I think it's rather a communication problem,

12
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,409
then, you know, I would believe that's your communication problem.

13
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,530
Rather. But you have just no clue about this class.

14
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:26,010
However, if you are really no clue about this, you need to let me know.

15
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:32,490
Okay? I don't think anybody fall into that category at all.

16
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:40,740
All right. So second half of the class will be focused on the first time.

17
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:47,640
So testing process, process. And then today we're going to start discussing what's on process.

18
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:56,249
So this is the first continuous time stochastic process.

19
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:03,930
We can only investigate in details and then that actually will present a way.

20
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:15,870
So this is the first one is the most popular one, and it is a very classic one in terms of how we define the process, how we study the process.

21
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:22,890
Right. So this will be a little bit different than what we have been doing when it's discrete time.

22
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:30,750
So classic process because it's a continuous time. So you will see that different mathematical tools will be applied here, namely.

23
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,900
Some calculus and then some differential equation, I should say.

24
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:43,180
I don't expect anyone remember how to solve.

25
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:50,890
So the differential equation sometimes is also a result of the partial differential equation.

26
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:57,219
But I would expect that during the exam, you're not out of sight, out of mind setting them up.

27
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:04,600
It's not that difficult solving. I know it's in some cases it could be challenging.

28
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:09,580
And a lot of these are only half numerical solutions.

29
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:18,460
All right. So first of all, for person process, we first focus on this the state space.

30
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:26,080
So we first that define the so called the counting process on a continuous high intensity.

31
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:42,430
So this is a second. So counting process is kind of a jargon, a terminology so often used in a lot of application.

32
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,750
So counting process, it's also a stochastic process.

33
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:52,210
It's usually a continuous time and stochastic process.

34
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:58,450
The important thing here is the random variable in the collection.

35
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:15,589
They have specific interpretation. So entry here individual so this is a member random variable represents the total

36
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:36,250
number of events that occur the by time of the T so therefore the name concrete.

37
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:45,440
So so from time zero. So usually if you have a counting process, then automatically it tells you at the time zero.

38
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,750
Here is a counter recite to zero.

39
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:57,110
And then at the time t you can have run the variable and it's just represent that the number of events occurred by that point.

40
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,000
By that point, as simple as that.

41
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:08,420
So again, so the specific meaning and then this is also defined as a so the state space must be not negative integer.

42
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:14,270
So it's a number of events. You cannot fractional number.

43
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:19,310
Not irrational numbers for sure. Okay.

44
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:28,160
So it's just a terminology process of what is a counting process.

45
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:33,890
So that's why we need to first define counting process.

46
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:39,740
Then then we have the definition for closing process.

47
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:50,869
So our counting process itself is set to be a process that's used the same and the

48
00:05:50,870 --> 00:06:17,030
same is said to be an awesome process if it follows the following five assumptions.

49
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:21,830
So those are. So this is the new thing, right?

50
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:30,770
So we're going to define this process by five different assumptions.

51
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:34,639
And now we're going to go through all five of these. Some of these.

52
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:42,719
Those are trivial. Some of those are. You know, he's a bit of a spy nation.

53
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,010
So a gun zero equal to zero.

54
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:52,050
So. So this one is sometimes you don't see this.

55
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:59,670
If you say something similar idea in person, the same reason I said but you know,

56
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:07,040
if you don't define counting all times upfront and that you probably need a00 and then say that as an integer.

57
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:11,850
So that's actually represents the number of events that occurred.

58
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:19,430
So with counting process and but the first assumption is a bit redundant.

59
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:23,060
Nevertheless, this is the first one. So it's a four left.

60
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:30,120
This is not a lot to explain. So the second one is called the independent increment.

61
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:40,200
So this one is a important one.

62
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:55,950
What it means in the event that increment assumption means if you insert arbitrarily some marker points on the timeline,

63
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:08,060
so t0 next time you want someone to do so and so forth, you can have less than T and so the following random variables.

64
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:25,360
So you insert. Finite mark time the marker points on the timeline and now you can ask for, you know, the ante at that time point, right.

65
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:34,120
So you can construct the following run the variable 91 minus and zero.

66
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,810
You have plenty one and that's a time insert.

67
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:48,940
That's the time occurred by time t one So the t0 is time event occurred by time zero.

68
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:59,080
So empty one -0 is essentially the time the event occurred during the time interval from zero to t one.

69
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:11,050
Right? So those are the time occurred in this interval while we independent of 92 -21.

70
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:21,250
So you can actually draw the timeline and that insert was t0 e1p table, so on and so forth.

71
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:34,570
So this is the increment in this interval that's empty one minus t0 the interval here this until -21, so you get the random variables.

72
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:40,630
So the event occurs for these are non-overlapping intervals,

73
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:51,729
they're going to be independent because we're going to have an empty two and so on and so forth.

74
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:56,380
So you can write right down. The whole thing is not just consecutive intervals.

75
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:05,170
So those are mutually independent. That means empty one -0 is going to be independent of indeed three -22.

76
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:11,530
So as long as the time interval not overlapping the event occurred,

77
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:16,600
the number of events occurred in those non-overlapping intervals cannot be independent.

78
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:20,440
All right. So this is an important assumption.

79
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:24,459
Yes. Because they're the intervals, virtually the same ties are.

80
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:27,580
Can they be right? Good question. They don't have to be.

81
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:33,010
Let me draw this one. That's not longer. Yes, good.

82
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:36,820
As long as they are fixed. Very good.

83
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:44,340
And they don't have to be the same lines of there is the only restriction is this ordering.

84
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:49,330
Right. So just for the bookkeeping purpose and t zero less than two, you want less than two.

85
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:55,630
All right. So this is kind of an independent assumption.

86
00:10:56,650 --> 00:11:02,080
So what this kind of a property reminds you of?

87
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,220
So. So later on, you're going to see what I see.

88
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:20,440
We going to see this one is actually not to the mark of property, but this one nevertheless is stronger than the mark of property.

89
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:28,629
So. So we're going to have a version of Marvel property in the field lectures about time you should be able

90
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:36,340
to see or you should be able to do other derive is if you have independent increments assumption,

91
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:40,760
you should get the Marcos property right.

92
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:46,690
So we haven't talked about that. So we're going to delay that discussion for a few lectures.

93
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:53,220
However, if you have Marcos property, you may not have this.

94
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:57,300
So this is a stronger assumption is even stronger.

95
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:01,959
But Mark but you see the the connection, right?

96
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:09,940
So there are some something you need to know. So you feel so that 81 minus t0 22 -21.

97
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:12,220
So this is that you want to move this to,

98
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:24,780
but if you want to discuss this somehow you need to condition along the t one and you want so make the zero 92 independent sort of.

99
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,709
You can see that flavor.

100
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:37,720
That's not rigorous argument because we haven't, you know, discuss what is the the the mark of property but remember this the whole.

101
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:44,020
So this is one it's actually directly linked to mark of the property is a stronger version of mark on the property.

102
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:49,290
Okay. Where it's a new thing.

103
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,900
I think it's a connection, right?

104
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:01,830
The third one. It's called a stationary increment.

105
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:18,930
So we have A, B and C here. Conservation improvements.

106
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:35,930
So this assumption is again. So this is I have the following statement.

107
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:45,360
What that means is I'm T plus S, minus X equals K.

108
00:13:47,400 --> 00:14:01,500
So what happens here? So you have a timepoints s, and then you have a s plus T, so you have a time interval with the lines being T.

109
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:11,639
So this from S to s plus ts. So this is if you're using seconds, minutes, how many units this is t, right?

110
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:22,560
So. So the increment. Well we only dependent on the interval length, not necessarily the anchor point where you start.

111
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:25,440
So, so that's stationary increment.

112
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:34,620
So to write this out as y equals, if I change the anchor point s or just arbitrarily assign that to as equal to zero.

113
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:48,000
And so again, and T -0 equals K station or increment, that means these two probabilities are the same.

114
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:56,440
I saw that in as far as the internal lines remain, the constant, the probability remained the same.

115
00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:02,049
And then we have just the point over there and zero equals zero.

116
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:07,210
So this one can be further simplified us and.

117
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:13,660
Okay, right. So I'm involved.

118
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:26,120
I'm invoking the first assumption here. So that's the meaning of this station are increments.

119
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:36,720
So the increments, the random increments only depend on the random increments only depends on the interval length,

120
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:40,750
not necessarily where the interval is. Right.

121
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,910
Anchor point what we see. So this should also.

122
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:51,020
Reminds you something we have learned in the Markoff train.

123
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:59,780
Something is only related to or not related to the anchor point.

124
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:05,480
So this is a related to the whole type homogeneity of the Markov chain.

125
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:16,370
Right. So where the kernel where you where you start to calculate the kernel, there are the same the P and plus one equals K.

126
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:24,830
So the P so is from just one state transition, no matter where the anchor point is.

127
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:31,250
So that J remained the same. Right. So this is a time homogeneous assumption for the mark of chain.

128
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:38,690
So this one should remind you, remind you of the same thing as long as the the time interval remained the same.

129
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:43,820
No matter where you make the transition, they have the same increment.

130
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:51,210
So here is the probability x plus one of j conditional.

131
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:59,989
Right. So this transition probability is not the function of and here I can use arbitrary.

132
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:04,760
And as long as as a one stop solution, they are the same. Same thing here.

133
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,709
As small as the time interval. We're talking about a continuous time.

134
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:13,250
So there is no one step transition sort of a concept.

135
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:24,800
But as long as the interval remain the same, stationary increments essentially saying the underlying Markov process is kind of homogeneous,

136
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:30,140
but we use a different name called the station or increment.

137
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:43,100
Okay. By the way, all these assumptions can be relaxed later on and then they give us a different types of stochastic process.

138
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:48,620
But this is the baseline or study we have ABC now.

139
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:53,420
So just three columns. We have a00 counting process.

140
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:59,239
We have independent increment A come from Markov property and now we have station increments.

141
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,360
That's coming from the kind of homogeneity assumption.

142
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:09,600
Only interwar London matters. Remember this? We're going to cost up your business.

143
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:17,490
All right, so A, B, C, this is kind of a global properties.

144
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:22,900
There are two assumptions. Last these two assumptions.

145
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:33,370
So the D and E going to give the more detailed description of how this person process behaves.

146
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:54,930
However, in this continuous time, sarcastic process, what we do here is we write the DNC considering a very small time window.

147
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:00,100
So this is a like the the the motivation for calculus.

148
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:05,310
Right. So the calculus is usually considered continuous functions.

149
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:13,770
And the way we think about to do how the derivative appears, how this integration you can act on.

150
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:17,760
You can see there are a small change on the act side.

151
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:26,580
That's right. So, for example, you have Act F acts and then you have X plus scale to act.

152
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:34,080
And then the difference here. So the calculus, the way to to think about calculus.

153
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:39,600
And so you could actually see some motivated calculus from the the usual algebra,

154
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:45,630
but you need to consider something like small window or this small increment delta x.

155
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:49,050
So what we're going to do for the Poisson process is similar.

156
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:58,650
We're going to consider the small time interval from T to keep hostility.

157
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:06,000
In this case we probably use a different notation just h.

158
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:13,740
So the probability of h so enough h h.

159
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:22,650
Here I'm going particularity. You know, if this is going to be a small window, very small, the h going to be goes to zero.

160
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:27,360
Just like in the calculus motivating you with the array.

161
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:35,910
So in the small window, the probability that have more than one events occur.

162
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:45,329
This one as lambda can be approximated by a linear function of the times.

163
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:52,270
H, O, H, or h goes to zero.

164
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:56,579
So usually right this way. So I'm down to zero from above.

165
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:01,890
That means h always positive. An alarming rate of zero.

166
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:11,980
All right. So a few things to explain. This is not a precise definition.

167
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:20,170
It's rather a linear approximation, just like in the calculus where we did, like, calculate trying to calculate the derivative.

168
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:24,730
So this part is the linear part. So it's going to be here.

169
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:35,770
So that means more than a Y event occurs during this time interval can be approximate about in their function that lambda is the rate.

170
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:50,210
So the pause on the rate of the pause on process. So it's a known parameter times the interval length plus o h so the O is the small notation here.

171
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,160
So that's also come from calculus. So a function.

172
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:00,680
So that would result in a class of function here. So one class of function.

173
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:15,740
So math belongs to this old age function if and only if the limit one h goes to zero after an age divided by age.

174
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:23,520
So that means F of age approaching zero faster than a linear function, right?

175
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:29,540
So H square in that category edge h cubic.

176
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:38,510
So this is just. Those are coming from calculus.

177
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:53,909
If you're not quite remember, these things are helpful to a quick review on the small notation and then also a following.

178
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:57,209
This functions the definition.

179
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:59,040
We have a bunch of rules, right?

180
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:07,410
So you've got the sum of two old age function remains as old age function, the product remains a wage function, so on, so forth.

181
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:09,480
So we're going to use that property later on.

182
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:20,970
If always function multiply by a constant, a still age function, all of these can be pulled from the definition.

183
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:30,150
But anyway, the D and E are two related assumptions.

184
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:36,690
So they trying to describe the behavior of the process in the small window.

185
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:40,140
Small window behavior. Okay, but this is not complete.

186
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:48,360
This is only D and you need that because what?

187
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,610
So the D I need you.

188
00:23:50,610 --> 00:24:10,230
What can I do is you can give me a rather complete and a rather complete the specification of this random variable and of h1h goes to zero.

189
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,330
Okay,

190
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:31,800
so D is up there and then that E we're going to use in the lecture models the probability an age greater or equal to two equals 0hh goes to zero.

191
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:41,880
Okay. I mean, right, it's all right.

192
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:54,060
So what happens is up to the three global properties, it's rather actually simple as saying counting process, Markov property type homogeneity.

193
00:24:54,540 --> 00:25:03,209
We got D and E and a dang if the first look on the did seems maybe puzzling if you're the first

194
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:10,230
time you see this but I will say this is nothing more than trying to define an H completely.

195
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:14,940
Right? Remember what an h is. So it's a random variable.

196
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:18,390
Describe what happens in the small time interval. H.

197
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:22,229
Right, because it's time homogeneity. Because of the station.

198
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:31,020
Our increment is everywhere, the same as one of us and they represent old t plus age minus and right.

199
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:37,890
So an H is a non negative integer value or a random variable.

200
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:42,310
How do we fully specify this distribution?

201
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:49,180
We need an HD code to zero and HD one.

202
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:53,350
We need to find, you know, when you can find the probability, right?

203
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:57,010
We don't need to go down that road to say we need that.

204
00:25:57,370 --> 00:26:15,400
Well, if you can use the probability generating function, let's do an H two and a probability and then three, so and so forth.

205
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:19,440
Right. So if you figure all of these, you get the food distribution of an H.

206
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:25,000
Let me ask, based on the DNA, what is the probability and equal to two?

207
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:36,490
You may not have a specific answer. You could have approximation.

208
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:46,620
Yes. 0hy. All right.

209
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:55,770
So the the E is actually a very strong so that an age greater or equal to two is actually all the probability add up together, right?

210
00:26:56,100 --> 00:27:02,130
The an h equal to two and H included three equal to four and so on, so forth.

211
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,459
So they must have each individually have always for one of them.

212
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:10,440
This is it's not a wage then that this is not true.

213
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,030
Right. So.

214
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:23,030
So we'll figure out actually for majority of things that we just need to figure out what an H equal to zero is and what is an H equal to one is.

215
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:27,300
Right. So what is actually equal to one?

216
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:40,610
Whitney London Age under age opens right up to the old age here.

217
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,770
So remember, this is only approximation. Yes.

218
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:50,800
How do we figure all these? We use the rule if either all of these.

219
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:55,220
That's one right. So we already know that.

220
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:01,670
So all these I thought I would just write this one minus the age.

221
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:09,320
Old age. Right. So an age greater or equal to one equals OTOH.

222
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:19,999
But you have to remind yourself old age is as representation of older functions is not precise.

223
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,330
Well, you know, precisely specified all ages.

224
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:26,900
So this is always along the age class, our age. So that's right.

225
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:34,160
And then if you add all these things up, what you get, you get the age plus age.

226
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:39,110
So that gives you an age equal to zero equals one minus lambda age.

227
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:43,370
You may want to do it minus old age. It actually doesn't matter.

228
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,390
Active old age is still considered a function of old age.

229
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:53,490
So just get familiar with the old age. So what happens is D 40.

230
00:28:53,570 --> 00:29:00,940
Well, in the way of fully specifying this, render the variable in the small window.

231
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:05,000
So a small window increment is 40 specified by D and E.

232
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:10,250
So you can change this a little bit. You don't have to.

233
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:20,910
So the current form of the U. To define the food distribution, what you could do is using this one as the this one, Nancy.

234
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:31,430
So so you can see the changes. D is not universally applied in defining pull some process some of the definitions.

235
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:40,190
And later on we're going to do is instead of giving the current form, we may want to define just probability.

236
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:49,040
For example, we could it keep the year the same, but we say p the probability an equal to one equals lambda h plus ohange.

237
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,030
Okay. And now you going to get the same conclusion.

238
00:29:54,260 --> 00:30:10,880
Point is this is a fully defined by this D and E with the o h notation, but that actually implies we know this food distribution of an age.

239
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:18,500
Okay. Right. So that's actually very important that we can use this in the property.

240
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:25,370
Any questions? I guess you probably don't have a lot of questions, but you should get familiar with.

241
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,910
Just reveal a little bit about the old age notation.

242
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:35,410
I will. So that's it.

243
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,850
That's how we define person process.

244
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:49,659
We define that's basically a markup process and that leaves time homogeneous mark of process with this small window behavior especially it's easy

245
00:30:49,660 --> 00:31:01,820
to remember is only one event occurred during the small window can be described by a linear function from the time stage as really is right.

246
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:10,780
The rest of these are just follow from simple calculus rules and then from the the probability rules.

247
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:16,560
Yes, I have a question. So it's is like a class of functions rather than a section itself, right?

248
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:21,370
Why is it that we don't write like probability and h equals two is within no age?

249
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:30,850
See again, why do we write like equals to age that the probability energy goes to is equal to oh age rather than writing is within oh age.

250
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:37,110
All right. Good question. So always you actually represent the functions.

251
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:50,460
I think this is. Right.

252
00:31:50,490 --> 00:32:11,530
I understand your question. So I was trying to say is the left hand side is a number you want is the right hand side being a number?

253
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:20,380
I think, oh, age. I should be clear about the age.

254
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:26,660
So it does represent a bunch of functions can give you this type of surveillance.

255
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:43,750
I do think sometimes people write philosophy and it's always hard to figure out the notational problem.

256
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,500
I didn't invent this notation. I think I'd take it over.

257
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:52,960
But that's a really good question. So the question is, should we write it just away?

258
00:32:53,590 --> 00:33:02,590
I think that this is probably make more sense. But that can make the whole thing a little bit tricky to write later on.

259
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:13,540
But if you understand that that's some function place, you know, approaching to zero faster than linear function, that's sufficient.

260
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:18,350
Right. So it could be arbitrary. So I have no objection to using this.

261
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:25,059
So. So is it actually true from this that probability and h equals two is equal to probability and h equals three?

262
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:29,560
Or is that not true? It's all equal. But they're on the same magnitude.

263
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:37,060
Okay. Right. Right. You don't have that equal. So just all the old age is not really comparable.

264
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:42,579
So, yeah, that's a really good question. So sometimes people write notations differently.

265
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:46,210
So this old age function. Zero age.

266
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:50,560
One age to age. Three age. I think the lecture notes.

267
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:56,350
So they all belong to the old age family, but they probably different functions.

268
00:33:56,470 --> 00:34:01,810
Yeah. Okay, that makes a lot of sense. But when they add up, they still belongs to the old age families.

269
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:10,390
Right, right, right. So that's a bit confusing as kind of a we are being a little bit loose in the notations.

270
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:14,110
So those are not equations. So this is not.

271
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:23,590
So this is why I say that the imprecise specification of the probability distribution, because age is never given the specific form.

272
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:33,790
But I think it's just by saying five up to the point you understand that these are those

273
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:38,020
are the that those are of functions approaching zero fostered by the linear function,

274
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:41,650
let's say. Okay, good. Very good.

275
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:54,600
So what matters is so this defines an age, but not necessarily 90.

276
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:09,340
So the question is, is this type of the, you know, imprecise definition of old age, at least to some precise definition?

277
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:16,300
Right. So after all, we're not really interested in the age.

278
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:22,440
We're interested in the word function. And T here one t is not necessarily small.

279
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,590
So like in the Markov property.

280
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:50,650
So this one you should says this is defined as transition kernel and you addition this should give you that implies the distribution function.

281
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:54,500
So the next question we're interested. So that's the definition.

282
00:35:54,520 --> 00:36:02,650
So the five assumptions, three of those are, although two of these, the remaining two trying to define the age.

283
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:10,420
So with this assumption, can we figure out the marginal distribution of each, the number on the variable?

284
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:23,590
And so that's the question. So let's do the marginal distribution.

285
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,970
All right. So I'm going to use some notation.

286
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:49,380
So now I'm consider the large scale time time line.

287
00:36:49,410 --> 00:37:03,780
I'm going to use the P Avanti denote the probability and T plus s minus as equals.

288
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:12,630
So essentially it's just saying the time interval we're considering is T.

289
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:17,370
Now the T is not it's not necessarily small. I think it's new will be large.

290
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:28,340
And then the increment is F, so the anchor point is S and then this one equals probability and T equals.

291
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:32,700
And because of the station of increment assumption.

292
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:40,170
Okay. All right. So to figure out this, it's the same thing.

293
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:53,430
We need to figure out the probability and key. There are all probability and t equal to one and that probability until you go to K all the way out.

294
00:37:53,790 --> 00:38:01,410
So if you know this, then you know the question for any time interval t what is that the increments would be.

295
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:05,309
Okay, let's take a small example.

296
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:15,330
Let's start from an equal to zero. So in that case, we're interested in an 0p0, sorry, p zero.

297
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:18,570
T So how we calculate p0t.

298
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:24,970
All right. So what happens here is.

299
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:45,750
And this is. So we're going to wait.

300
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:53,350
We're going to start using the UN. But the problem is starting from the space in our increment.

301
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:04,300
All right. All right. So what we trying to find is from 0 to 19, right?

302
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,580
We're trying to figure out what that is.

303
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:18,430
Ira, we don't really know how to you know, first of all, put all these assumptions, especially D and E to the large interval.

304
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:26,650
Right. But we could manufacture something. We can put a small h small h window right here.

305
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:31,300
And I'm thinking about a relationship between TNT plus H.

306
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:38,690
So the benefit of that is we know t pass h if we know and assuming we know that.

307
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:47,440
Right. So even a conditional and we would fully know the behavior of 90 plus H and I would just say you have that idea,

308
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,810
it's just like a T at the H goes to zero or something like that.

309
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:54,250
Maybe we can figure out what he is.

310
00:39:54,820 --> 00:40:06,910
So this type of the diagram you're going to see consistently in the second part later on, this one has a name is the core rules forward equation.

311
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:13,600
You're always trying to get core my growth forward equation set up.

312
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,930
So those are you have a large interval key.

313
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:20,260
And then look, I had for the small window age.

314
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:33,010
All right. So what we need to do all know is just figure out what is p0p plus h, which means as.

315
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:44,270
Probability of T plus h also equal to zero.

316
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:47,840
Right. So I'm just rewrite the destination numbers.

317
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:57,740
All right, so if we want T plus h equal to zero, then it's fair to say in this interval.

318
00:40:57,770 --> 00:41:04,520
Well, I mean, this is a from zero to T plus h, so it must be the case probability.

319
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:08,389
And so in this interval and then there are two intervals,

320
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:16,460
one is the large interval we're really interested in and then the small interval we're kind of an argument song, right?

321
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:26,000
So these two interval, we already know from the the definition of the person they are, the increments are independent.

322
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:42,320
So it has to be the case. If the total interval equal to zero, they must be 292 zero and the probability and h equal to zero.

323
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:47,690
Right. Because of independent increments.

324
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:52,910
Right. So you have two non-overlapping intervals. This has to be true.

325
00:41:55,190 --> 00:42:01,520
And then we just write this one. That's php0t multiplied by.

326
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:07,610
So we know what an h equal to zero from the previous definition.

327
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:12,559
The whole the full specification of a nature.

328
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:22,100
So this one, this one minus lambda t plus o h and I would just write down this two forms.

329
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:29,179
One is the point of interest. This is a P, zero, T plus H, and then there's a one minus lambda t.

330
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:32,400
So this is an equal to zero. Check your note we have.

331
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:47,680
Okay. Although we're essentially done, the remaining thing is collecting terms and so you get rules.

332
00:42:50,650 --> 00:43:11,560
So this one, if you read right and you get he is zero T plus h minus p0t equals negative lambda t times p0pi now we have ap0t multiply o h.

333
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:16,570
So p0 t is a probability is a constant.

334
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:21,340
So it's a it's a number bounded between zero and one.

335
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:26,340
So it says multiply by o h, you still get o h, right?

336
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:36,920
So that's why I think they want to train o h on some number, although they represent a lot of things.

337
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:40,780
So you got this right on what I. All right.

338
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:47,990
Sorry. So someone should point out that right from wrong.

339
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:55,490
This is a longer age and instead of tea. So this is a small window into role is age, but it's a one minus along age.

340
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:02,960
Sorry, that's a mistake that make the whole thing wrong.

341
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:08,259
Right. So this is just adorable. I got this and that.

342
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:11,430
We're going to divide it by age up to both sides.

343
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:16,329
And now we're going to take a limit on both sides.

344
00:44:16,330 --> 00:44:39,160
We divide it by age. I don't think of a limit. So on the right left hand side, we got the p0t and this meant h00hh.

345
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:47,280
All right. So you see why I'm going to leave one side by definition.

346
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:50,810
So if you believe ap0 is a continuous function, then.

347
00:44:53,830 --> 00:44:57,250
On the left hand side is essentially the derivative.

348
00:44:57,340 --> 00:45:09,760
So we're going to write this if we have to evaluate at the time p h close to zero and then the right hand side along the key.

349
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:18,190
And then this term, by the definition of H notation, this one is exactly zero.

350
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:31,720
So we don't need to write this. So what we got here is it's a simple this one is the simplest differential equation on the differential equation.

351
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:35,799
And then, you know, you don't need to know the the rules.

352
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:40,630
And this is a linear. So we don't need to know the formula. This must be exponential function.

353
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:52,390
So this is a actually you don't need to solve it, but can you zero t first there.

354
00:45:55,390 --> 00:46:09,430
Schools won't close. That's why.

355
00:46:13,330 --> 00:46:19,660
So the p0t is exponential function of this form.

356
00:46:21,310 --> 00:46:25,389
So if you solve this differential equation, you've got this.

357
00:46:25,390 --> 00:46:32,050
Or the other way to say is if this is ap0, t is a derivative of p zero, you what you get.

358
00:46:32,350 --> 00:46:39,960
So for this one, you get c e negative along with a p times negative lambda.

359
00:46:40,150 --> 00:46:51,200
Right. So. You know, that is exactly negative along the pipes.

360
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:56,900
This is you know, it's a quick chat.

361
00:46:56,950 --> 00:47:00,010
This is a correct answer. But this one is.

362
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:04,780
If you solve the differential equations, the answer you should get.

363
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:13,150
Okay. But this isn't all the complete answer. We don't know what C is, what C should be.

364
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:24,540
Hmm. So how do we figure out the constant in determining the constant in differential equation we always use boundary.

365
00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:30,060
Um, you know, the boundary conditions.

366
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:34,140
So for this one, the boundary condition we know is ap00.

367
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:39,210
So there is no increment at a time zero if you consider this.

368
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:43,850
So that has to be one one.

369
00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:47,790
Very good. So you plot V and T for the zero. This one give you a one.

370
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:54,970
So that means C equals one. So this implies C one.

371
00:47:54,990 --> 00:47:59,610
So what you get is negative. All right.

372
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:12,510
With all of these work, what we got is probability and t equal to zero equals negative velocity.

373
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:13,920
Right.

374
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:29,250
So this is a far away from the food distribution, but we make some very significant progress here because now we know, at least from a small window,

375
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:37,079
that the nation destroying the property and h we could indeed find, you know,

376
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:45,630
these marginal distributions that's actually large windows through the idea of that looking to have a slight edge.

377
00:48:46,050 --> 00:48:54,230
So we can apply the same idea to figure out all the other increments instead of thinking of all the P zero plus h.

378
00:48:54,870 --> 00:48:58,920
We could just go p m, t plus H going into the channel.

379
00:49:00,290 --> 00:49:08,900
Right. So the reason? They need to find this ap0p1p to changing the index here.

380
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:12,170
Right. So let's do that. It's not that hard.

381
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:25,220
And then the key things remain the same. The key the key properties is this two non-overlapping windows going to be independent.

382
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:31,160
Okay. All right. So instead of my thinking p0t plus H.

383
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:39,950
Now we're thinking about p m, as do the general p m.

384
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:59,590
All right, so we still have this two windows. Now, if you have a00 to a T plus H equal to M, then the only separation is zero zero.

385
00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:03,470
Right. You must have zero even in the large window.

386
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:07,820
And then you have zero even. There is no other possibilities.

387
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:12,590
So here we can see there are General m1m which is greater than zero.

388
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:18,140
Then you have multiple ways to display the integer m into this two windows.

389
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:24,410
But think about the bright side. M is finite, so there are only finite way to split it.

390
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:28,279
And so let's just do the splitting. Right.

391
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:37,040
So is it. So the splitting must be if I have five on here, I will have I minus I1 in the small window.

392
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:43,910
If I have I in in the the big window though now we have you know,

393
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:54,200
I'm subtracting I so that basically if I run high or zero to m colors all these possibilities.

394
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:59,040
So we have p I I'm you see that's.

395
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:06,900
All right. I mean, the note in the notes I use, I'm like this.

396
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:17,530
I hear, I hear. Okay, I'm the I is the you know, the event occurred in the small town.

397
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:32,040
All right, so I have p, um, I'm I minus I keep in mind again the reason and I can write them as a multiplication.

398
00:51:32,310 --> 00:51:36,240
So I, I have the independent increment assumption.

399
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:47,370
So those two are and then this is all over the possibilities, how we split the evenly distributed ambivalence into this to not overlapping with those.

400
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:51,000
There is no exception other than these.

401
00:51:55,140 --> 00:52:01,890
Okay. This looks tedious, but when you start writing this, so we're going to start writing this.

402
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:11,630
So we have p and minus p m P multiplied by P zero, if you feel better about this,

403
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:21,210
because we already have zero to figure out and then I have P and -1 to 8 times P one.

404
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:27,800
So, um. Oh, I'm sorry. This is hp1.

405
00:52:27,810 --> 00:52:34,260
H, I'm still feel I'm, I'm still feeling better because I know what p1h is.

406
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:42,900
It's about the age plus age, right? Keep writing p m minus 2pp to age.

407
00:52:44,490 --> 00:52:48,720
All right, up to this point, I realize, oh, these are become our age.

408
00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:54,630
We have the marginal distribution for this more age and so on, so forth.

409
00:52:54,640 --> 00:53:08,280
So I'm just right p minus, k, p, k, h, so k, let's make it three, two.

410
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:21,210
All right. I realize I don't need to write them anymore because again, I'm this is a bounded and a positive number multiple.

411
00:53:21,470 --> 00:53:24,230
I don't need to be positive, but nevertheless it's positive.

412
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:31,700
So it's a probability times wage and then the rest of these are low probability times peak.

413
00:53:32,030 --> 00:53:36,499
So I have more than two events occurring this morning, though.

414
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:40,220
We have a wage. So all these things can be combined.

415
00:53:41,870 --> 00:53:45,920
Into an age. Right. So let's just do that.

416
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:52,400
Okay. So, actually, you just left the two parts out to the house.

417
00:53:56,690 --> 00:54:08,830
And now we can further simplify them this.

418
00:54:16,430 --> 00:54:41,420
All right, so what we got is he the plus h equals hee hee hee hee zero h plus he m minus one tu1h.

419
00:54:42,890 --> 00:54:46,940
Um, and then the rest of those are just all h.

420
00:54:47,810 --> 00:54:53,650
All right. And now we actually know p0h and then p1h.

421
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:58,750
Let's just write them out and then pull the all of the OAG together.

422
00:54:58,760 --> 00:54:59,959
So here you got.

423
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:17,960
P So this one is one minus lambda t plus o, h plus p, minus one t so this one this lambda t alarmed that h and keep writing this wrong.

424
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:25,580
I'm so sorry. Lost o h and o h.

425
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:37,250
Right. So this is just expand the p0h and then p1h into the corresponding linear function.

426
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:44,210
And if you click the terms you realize, oh, the OAG can be put together to represent a simple Osage.

427
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:47,690
So this gives you.

428
00:55:54,020 --> 00:56:21,440
Our is 7 p.m. and mine has a p p h so this pretty times always I'm gonna sort into this old age up plus p I'm minus one p lambda h so those are all h.

429
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:26,570
It's not just disappeared. They got absorbed into this o h notation later on.

430
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:32,630
I know we can do the similar things,

431
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:47,240
just like in the case before we can move the PM in the left hand side and then divided by H on the both side and take the limit.

432
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:55,630
So the point here is making up. So above here, it's a different situation.

433
00:56:55,900 --> 00:57:00,220
We want to turn that differential equation into that differential equation.

434
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:16,630
So you need to manufacture the derivative so that the derivative actually exists because

435
00:57:16,990 --> 00:57:24,220
the small window of definition is actually making sure poppy is a continuous function.

436
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:34,750
Right. So that's also come from the. So I didn't emphasize that, but you should get that point yourself.

437
00:57:35,830 --> 00:57:40,780
Okay. Anyway, the rest is calculus.

438
00:57:41,320 --> 00:58:16,650
And you're going to get. Even on stage minus the Yankees, a move to the term divided by age equals P10 plus P minus one plus voltage divided by age.

439
00:58:18,090 --> 00:58:22,680
And then you take the limit on both sides. So these are no function of age.

440
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:28,080
So those are just constant. And then you can take limit. This one, this car is a zero.

441
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:33,780
And this one becomes prime.

442
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:37,470
The derivative equals log.

443
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:44,760
He was alone like this one.

444
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:53,550
So that's the differential equation you can obtain at the end of the day.

445
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:59,250
All right. So those are solvable differential equations.

446
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:07,260
So, first of all, I think it's important to get them. And then we can talk about solving both solving this equations.

447
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:17,220
So this is a have a kind of also a simple structure.

448
00:59:17,910 --> 00:59:21,450
The the point is, if you think our arbitrary M,

449
00:59:21,810 --> 00:59:28,830
it seems like unsolvable because you need a m and then you need a minus once you don't know what January and minus one is.

450
00:59:29,430 --> 00:59:41,130
But luckily we did the P zero first. So we know P zero, which is negative, right?

451
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:46,920
So that's what we solved. And now we can think about plugging is equal to one.

452
00:59:47,760 --> 01:00:01,260
So if you have that, you have p zero, t is null and you can solve a linear differential equation with respect to PM p1t Right.

453
01:00:01,290 --> 01:00:06,779
So that's a there is a lawgiver, actually. But you don't you can either use that.

454
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:13,200
So you are just trying to make the perfect exponential function.

455
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:23,320
But anyway, you have to find a solution for p1t and then if you know the p1t the same way you can solve for the p to t and so on.

456
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:28,950
So forcing again the class is not the problem. Now you're solving those equations.

457
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:39,730
I would just tell you the answer you want to eat is going to be so low.

458
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:46,660
I think it's important to emphasize some of the problem, the boundary conditions.

459
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:52,510
If you plug in ap0t, what you can look at is something like this.

460
01:00:54,910 --> 01:01:05,920
And to the longer the tp1 equals A of the t plus.

461
01:01:06,190 --> 01:01:16,989
So if you use a formula or you're trying to do something like make a exponential function using a general four months financial function,

462
01:01:16,990 --> 01:01:19,570
plugging in and then trying to figure out the different terms.

463
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:30,410
You're always going to end up with unknown constant because for the difference, you know, if you take the derivative for this C doesn't matter right.

464
01:01:30,550 --> 01:01:39,400
But the right hand side, it's for sale. So this is up to a you solve this whole thing up to a constant of unknown constant.

465
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:43,420
But how do you determine those are not constant? So this is ap1.

466
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:47,770
T okay. So you always need to use a boundary condition.

467
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:53,290
So the way to use boundary condition is to think about the p10.

468
01:01:54,070 --> 01:02:00,250
If interval is zero, what is the probability you have one event occur in that interval?

469
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:09,210
So in other words, what is the p10? Zero zero.

470
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:15,510
Very good. Hope to be clear. Right. So if you plug in T or the zeros of this one is zero.

471
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:19,940
The left hand side is zero. That means C has to be zero. Right.

472
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:29,940
So this one implies. But this implies just what you want.

473
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:42,000
So you get this somewhat familiar form for p wanting to reserve.

474
01:02:54,300 --> 01:03:04,620
So if you want. Because. Me too.

475
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:15,990
Right. If you know one thing, you can solve 42 and then if you're doing this for a while,

476
01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:28,770
you'll realize PM B Essentially the annuity equals M and then the lambda two that he allowed

477
01:03:28,770 --> 01:03:39,910
the T to two I'm going to find the comma function appears like all right therefore the name.

478
01:03:39,930 --> 01:03:44,330
So this is a you realize is a course on distribution so this is a problem of

479
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:49,350
the this is a for the probability mass function for full time distribution.

480
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:57,570
Why you should realize. So what happens is the way we define the stochastic process,

481
01:03:57,570 --> 01:04:10,950
the counting process with the three global properties plus the some sort of a linear assumption on the small window leads to this conclusion.

482
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:19,190
So marginally, the member random variable in the stochastic process are also distributed.

483
01:04:19,770 --> 01:04:26,790
So the poor song the mean it's alarmed the times t so that's definitely related to the interval months, right?

484
01:04:26,790 --> 01:04:31,259
A longer the interval the larger the mean the expectation,

485
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:56,129
but nevertheless they are so closely related and as well as long I know we've

486
01:04:56,130 --> 01:05:01,710
got this from the first principle basically from the over the properties.

487
01:05:03,010 --> 01:05:09,210
In the process. Let's see what time we have.

488
01:05:09,390 --> 01:05:14,400
45 feet. Okay, so we have 5 minutes and we just talk about the last.

489
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:20,280
The topic just start to talk about philosophy. And so.

490
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:37,730
Alternatively, you could you could define the person process in a different way.

491
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:42,860
So you have the three global properties intact.

492
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:46,430
So you still have an zero equal to zero you have.

493
01:05:48,330 --> 01:05:54,870
You're going to and you're going to have incremental independent increments and then the stationary increments,

494
01:05:55,350 --> 01:06:04,800
and then you can go define those probability and you just say each member run the variable.

495
01:06:07,110 --> 01:06:11,250
This is true. You had nine points on top of this.

496
01:06:12,690 --> 01:06:18,330
You should try this yourself. So this is at least to the same equivalent, the definition.

497
01:06:18,870 --> 01:06:20,580
So this only gives you.

498
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:38,190
So now the question is do you get to the same distribution for the small would know about a h so you can if you know this so what we

499
01:06:38,190 --> 01:06:48,450
have been doing is we know this part and h part small window behavior and now we deduce the the marginal distribution and is pausing.

500
01:06:48,540 --> 01:06:53,580
So you should ask yourself the question if you get from here to here.

501
01:06:55,230 --> 01:07:02,670
You probably got a little bit more rides you? Well, I mean, not necessarily a lot more, but you can see the difference.

502
01:07:03,210 --> 01:07:10,500
Do you still need the old age notation or the old age notation as specified through through the post?

503
01:07:10,630 --> 01:07:14,459
You should figure that out yourself. But this is general.

504
01:07:14,460 --> 01:07:23,700
The way how stochastic processes define the way we do is we define the small window behavior.

505
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:32,120
Those small window behavior, usually it's going to be a linear function or the combination of the linear function.

506
01:07:32,130 --> 01:07:45,710
Later on we're going to see. Not much you can do for other things or not much we will discuss for anything other than in your function.

507
01:07:46,310 --> 01:07:49,380
So but still things can be relaxed, right?

508
01:07:49,490 --> 01:08:00,170
So that stationary remains and then those are independent increment that can be relaxed that to certain degree.

509
01:08:00,170 --> 01:08:04,400
So those are going to be the focus for the next few weeks.

510
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:09,979
But this is how we study continuous tight spot casting process.

511
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:18,740
It's not that hard is just a way of thinking things a bit differently using the right tool, so to speak.

512
01:08:19,550 --> 01:08:26,090
Okay, hopefully I think we're done here if we can see everything was.
