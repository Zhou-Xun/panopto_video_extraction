1
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:22,110
All right. Hi, everyone. Welcome back. I hope you have a lovely couple of days off.

2
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,810
I'm feeling really excited to be back here with you all. This is our second to last class, if you can believe it.

3
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:36,360
So we'll be talking about hypothesis testing today. We'll also wrap up the end of the graphing lecture and I have several announcements today.

4
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:43,680
You may have noticed something that happened in the last week. They have been announcing this for a while and it finally happened.

5
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:50,580
So very exciting happened during our class. They are transitioning the whole our studio.

6
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:54,900
Brand marketing to this company called POSIT.

7
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:03,030
The idea is they want to not just have programing and are that you could also program in other languages.

8
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:11,459
So when we're doing these quarto markdown documents in those curly brackets, we're typing the letter R indicating we're coding in R right now.

9
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:17,340
But you could also use the same software to code in other languages, like sequel, like Python or other languages.

10
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:24,840
Okay. So the idea is they felt like they were too tightly coupled to are people didn't realize you could use it for other languages.

11
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:29,220
So it's got this rebrand when we go to the Our Studio Cloud website.

12
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,420
It'll redirect us to posit cloud, that is.

13
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:41,920
Well, from now on, I have links. Now to posit cloud, but all of our prior links would have been our studio clerk.

14
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:47,190
But so so going forward we'll use this link. We should you should be able to be redirected from the previous links.

15
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,320
Let's just pause there.

16
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,950
If people have questions about this, this it is particularly confusing to have this happen in the middle of a seven week class.

17
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:02,280
So this applies to the RCA cloud that we're using for class.

18
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:08,040
This will also apply to the. Desktop software that you might be using our studio as well.

19
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:14,900
You're on the pulse of what's happening right now in coding language.

20
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:21,920
I guess it's good to have it happen now as opposed to like when you're out in the workforce and you're like, what's happening?

21
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,799
I didn't learn about this. You. We'll work through it together.

22
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,180
I'm sure there'll be some hiccups that come up along the way, but it's always a learning experience.

23
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,890
The troubleshooting and debugging.

24
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:39,139
Okay, just a reminder to get your assignments in and we'll talk about hypothesis testing this week and the other logistics comments,

25
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:45,720
questions, concerns. Oh, right.

26
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:55,170
All right. So we'll recap last class. We'll do some slides about types of plots, coding about that slides.

27
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:01,410
Right. Well, and you can see we will get to hypothesis testing kind of until the end of class.

28
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:09,800
Okay. So what did we learn last time we learned about an introduction to plotting and plot to you?

29
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:13,339
This was two weeks ago. So before the break, let's see.

30
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,780
Can anybody help me remember?

31
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:22,490
There are three required elements to make a plot and plot, and there's a whole bunch of bells and whistles we can add in addition.

32
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:26,479
But what are the three minimum features we need in a plot?

33
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,650
Plot? Oh.

34
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:39,990
Tricky, tricky. S So that stands for esthetics and that's a function.

35
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:48,059
It's right in front of a round in parentheses. And in this case, that refers to mapping what elements of the dataset do we want?

36
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:53,040
Where on the plot. So that's where and the a function and the esthetics function.

37
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,770
We would specify what this variable on the X axis and this other variable on the y axis.

38
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:06,710
We want the third variable for the color in the plot. So any variable you want to link to a feature on the plot, that's where you specify it.

39
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,370
Wonderful. Well, so we've got one of the three. Anybody giving one of us just.

40
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:16,350
Exactly. We got to tell them where to find the variable. So what dataset is in it?

41
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:21,940
Okay, so we're going to give the dataset the esthetic mappings of the variables in the dataset.

42
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:28,430
Both of those are within the juju plot to function or within the juju plot function.

43
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,640
The package is called juju plot two and there was a third element.

44
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:45,130
The assumption for this type of not that we want exactly the function for the type of what we want and then do your problems are called geometries.

45
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:49,930
So the first one we did was G on point doing a scatterplot.

46
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,200
And this next section where we'll do a whole bunch of different types of plots,

47
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:59,109
we'll do histograms, box plots, all kinds of stuff, and those are specified with the geometry.

48
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:06,940
So these three required elements of every good plot we need to specify the data that we need to specify the esthetic mapping of the variables.

49
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:11,170
And we need the geometry where we tell what type of plot to make.

50
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:18,640
So once you start to notice these patterns, like spending time to learn how to make one specific type of plot,

51
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:22,630
then you can apply it and all these other types of plots just by changing out the geometry.

52
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:29,660
What are some of the plot options? What are the bonus features we can add to class?

53
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:35,420
What are some of the. We can override the default options in those functions.

54
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:39,530
What are some of the ways we can make our plots?

55
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:43,430
So if it's a plot just for me, I'll probably leave all the default settings.

56
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,290
But if it's a plot I want to share with my collaborators who spend a lot of time jazzing it

57
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:52,610
up to make it exactly the way I want it so that I can most clearly convey my information.

58
00:05:52,790 --> 00:06:01,040
What are some things you want to change to your plot? How do we do these things? Yeah.

59
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:04,490
What's. The weakness of the.

60
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:14,110
Yeah. I love changing labels, making sure we have units, making sure they're not just the internal variable names.

61
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:18,100
But so those are describing words. We saw others.

62
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:27,640
You can you can add these with labels functions so you can add a plus sign and then add more features with the labs to the to the plan.

63
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:31,120
You can add labels for the axes overall label for the title.

64
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:36,250
You can even add a label for the legend. With the color label.

65
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:46,190
That's another thing we like to add a plus. We can change out those colors with the scale sort of functions.

66
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,239
So we can do this at the plus side.

67
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:58,850
And then one of the scale functions either manually provide colors or use some of these preexisting color palette that

68
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:07,460
other people have used their lovely design esthetics to assemble complementary colors or contrasting colors or maybe.

69
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:20,040
Well, that's. Please change the size, shape and concentration of the transparency.

70
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:26,390
Yeah. What about it was described here. We can also change specifically on that point graph.

71
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,740
So for the geometry of point, each of those points can have different design feature.

72
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:37,139
So they have different sizes, different shapes, different colors and different transparencies.

73
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,720
And the option to set transparency, it's called alpha.

74
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:51,439
But we'll continue to add some of these features that anybody at any anyone who attempted the first problem of homework for.

75
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,160
Did anybody add any features to it to try to jazz it up a little bit?

76
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:07,690
You know, also I've been to plots which are like if you want to change the background color, these are the type of information as well.

77
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,920
You can see how you can spend a lot of time on a plot if you wish.

78
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,530
What we're going to get into today is how we choose plot types,

79
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:23,260
and essentially we're going to group our plot types based on whether that variables continuous.

80
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,750
Or whether that variable is categorical.

81
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:33,150
So our selection of plot types and how we communicate data are going to be guided by the shape of the variables.

82
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:36,110
So this will be something we spend a lot of time on.

83
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:44,419
When we were cleaning the dataset originally, making sure we understood whether variables like numeric or factor and all of that is going to pay off,

84
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:48,650
continue to pay off here and in the future when we hypothesis test of the class.

85
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:54,140
So you start to see all these principles of data management are going to pay it forward.

86
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:59,059
And this will also be helpful as we're plotting,

87
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:07,130
we can check our work and this will help us set underlying data like expectations as we get into the hypothesis testing as well.

88
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:12,500
Okay. All right. So this initial short module is going to be all about plot types.

89
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:18,320
So we're going to practice trying to prioritize plot types based on the underlying structure of the data set.

90
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:25,130
And we'll try to talk about features of common plot type. So I'm bringing it to that plot to construction.

91
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:29,540
What kind of patterns are we starting to notice across the code to make these plots?

92
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:40,280
All right. So when I was trying to think about like, what do I do in my head when I'm deciding what kind of plot to make?

93
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:44,870
There's so many options out there. How do you even decide what plot type to make?

94
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:52,370
So I try to give myself or try to share with you a flow chart because I realized I was kind of doing something like this subconsciously and I want to.

95
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:59,340
Bring that out in the open and see if you all may have a related or a different flowchart that works for you.

96
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:03,419
But I want you to have some tools once you're in the workforce and you have your data set,

97
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:09,510
or if you already have your data set, be thinking about it's up to you now to decide what type of plot to me.

98
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:17,820
So one of the things that I do when I'm deciding what type of plot is, I think about what type of variable is of interest to me.

99
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:23,370
It's a categorical variable. Maybe I'll make a bar chart. You might make a different choice.

100
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,550
You might want to make a pie chart.

101
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:31,480
You know, there's other choices you could make here so you can feel free to customize this type of flowchart with what works for you.

102
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:41,980
If it's numeric and I have one variable, I'm probably gonna make a histogram or a density plot and we'll see how to make both of those types of plots.

103
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:51,590
If it's numeric. And we have two variables. If that second variable is also numeric.

104
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,470
So we've got two numerics, we're probably going to make a scatterplot or a line plot.

105
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:03,710
If I buy a second variable. So the first variables numeric and the second variables categorical,

106
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:08,090
then I'm probably going to make one of these sort of called box plot, violent plotter based on plot.

107
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:11,750
Sometimes you can stack things on top of each other, so you can make multiple plots in one.

108
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:16,800
There's other ones related to this called like a raindrop plot. Yeah.

109
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:22,120
Anyways, for each of these choices, there's a lot of different options and there may be different norms in your field.

110
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:28,410
So like in omics, where I operate, we love violin clouds rather than box file other.

111
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:33,310
You'll see that within within your field there might be different preferences.

112
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:39,730
So feel free to use something like this as a starting point, but customize it to your needs.

113
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:48,010
So first of all, sir, let's start with this first one and we'll work with some categorical variables and we'll try to make a bar chart together.

114
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:55,470
So here's an example, a bar chart in our enhanced dataset.

115
00:11:55,490 --> 00:12:00,320
So working with a variable called educational attainment, this is a categorical variable.

116
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:03,260
We worked with this previously. It's a factor variable.

117
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:10,370
We've got four categories that are mutually exclusive and these are the beans that people are in in our study.

118
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,430
We're gonna make this. So we've already decided.

119
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:22,480
We figured out that this is a factor variable. We're going make a bar chart and how we're going to make that with a geometry bar geometry.

120
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:31,419
So this type of coding, this initial arrow, this time, remember based we don't type this.

121
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:38,020
This is just the command prompt telling us it's ready to accept code, but it's going to follow the same pattern we learned with the point.

122
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:43,350
So we start with a deploy function and the first thing we give it is the data set, right?

123
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:51,190
So it's one of our non-negotiables. So again, the data set, the second non-negotiable is we have to tell it what our static mapping.

124
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,960
So, Larry, where are you expecting to see the education variable in this class?

125
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:04,700
And the Y axis that we're expecting education to show up on the Y axis.

126
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,890
If I wanted it to be on the x axis so those bars were vertical, I would just specify x here.

127
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:15,920
I'm also doing something else with that education bearable. What am I? What's the spill option, do you think?

128
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:24,280
Yeah, I heard about that. Yes, I heard about the full color of the bars.

129
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,560
So if I have left this part off, we would just got all of these would be dark gray bars.

130
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:35,020
So you don't have to do that. You can set whatever esthetics you want.

131
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,270
So these are two of the non-negotiables. We've got the data set, we've got the esthetic mapping.

132
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:44,159
Now our third non-negotiable, we're setting our geometry and we're doing that.

133
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:50,190
So we got a plus that we close out that juju plot function out of plus five, the average number.

134
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:55,290
And you can see I'm continuing to go further. I've got another plus sign.

135
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:01,800
But here's how we can add all those bonus features if we want. So here I'm adding labels.

136
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:10,320
So I'm using the lab function and saying I want my Y label to be educational attainment, and then after a comma I can specify another.

137
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,740
And on the x axis, I'm up to the number of participants.

138
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:16,920
All right. So this is building on the structure of the G on point.

139
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:23,640
Really, the only thing we've changed out is this gem bar to have it go from a scatterplot to a bar chart.

140
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:28,500
You might want to comments questions about a bar chart here.

141
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:44,210
Let's keep going. These are bar charts are just kind of like a very entry point playlist.

142
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:52,730
Let's keep it moving. So for when we have numeric information, then we might start with a histogram.

143
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,370
So a histogram. Can anybody help me here? How do we interpret this?

144
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:59,540
Would you say how would you describe this distribution?

145
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:12,120
What information is conveyed in a histogram or. We see how we interpret histograms.

146
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:24,930
These little boxes represent. Well, the number of people with a specific red blood cell count.

147
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:29,690
Exactly. So each one I almost think of this like an extended bar chart from the last slide,

148
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:39,880
because we're still counting the number or the frequency of people who are now within some boundary on the X axis, within some criteria here.

149
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:47,540
So these are the millions of cells for my girl, leader of red blood cell count that's relatively normally distributed to me,

150
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:51,570
center somewhere around 5 million cells from each other.

151
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:55,540
So let's see how we code it. All right.

152
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:59,620
So in doing this with the UV light function, we've got our first non-negotiable our data set.

153
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:06,470
Then our second Nano. Gosh, well, we've got our esthetic mapping. What are you expecting to be on the axis?

154
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:10,460
What if you weren't even able to see this plot?

155
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:14,660
What axis? How many esthetics are we providing?

156
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:20,670
Where are we putting it? You see this function here?

157
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:32,540
Just one variable idea. Yeah, we've only done one variable and we're putting it on the x axis and that's what we see over here.

158
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:41,540
So we've only got one variable that's on the x axis. And the y axis is the number of people meeting those criteria on this axis.

159
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,360
Then our third non-negotiable.

160
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:52,220
We're providing the geometry and to make it a histogram instead of a giant bar like we did last time that we're doing G on histogram.

161
00:16:53,650 --> 00:17:00,500
You might have an animation here. And all of these functions have a ton of options you can specify in.

162
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:04,070
So you could just close this out right here at the parentheses.

163
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:09,740
You don't have to specify any of these options. I just wanted to show you a couple because each of these geometries.

164
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:20,460
Have their own little unique spin that you can play with a little bit. So the histogram one has an option called vignette where you can decide how.

165
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:26,960
Why or how skinny you want these beans to be so you could make a bean with really big.

166
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:31,700
So this we have, like, large steps. You can make the bean with really narrow.

167
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:38,840
So this curve would look very smooth. Okay, so you can convey different information to your audience by some of these esthetic choices.

168
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:47,860
I set my fill color, meaning the color that's painted inside these boxes and the Dodger blue, that's like my favorite color.

169
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:52,610
And then color. This is the outline color of the boxes.

170
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:55,900
I set that as black. All right, so you don't have to do any of those.

171
00:17:55,910 --> 00:18:04,600
These are I'm just showing you. You can implement options within these geometries and slightly different ways depending on the geometry.

172
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:16,390
An alternative option for histograms is a density plot is very similar to a histogram, except it's done just a smooth curve.

173
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:25,719
So we're no longer dealing with any of those boxes now we're just getting a smooth curve and we can do this with the jam density.

174
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,470
So you start to see how you have a preference as the analyst.

175
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:35,160
If you have a numeric dataset, it's up to you to choose whether you want a histogram or density plot,

176
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:39,220
whatever version you think is conveys the information better for you.

177
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:47,469
So here I'm starting out with the the first required, but for the juju plot of the dataset the second required.

178
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:52,120
But I'm doing what I started mapping so I got this red blood cell variable on the x axis.

179
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:59,480
And I'm adding density. That's why I've got a new option here.

180
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:05,690
The size option. That is an option to make the line width wider.

181
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:11,389
So the default size is one that would make a skinny line. I made the line with two slots.

182
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:15,290
Makes a double wide line. So you can play all these things I do trial and error.

183
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:20,059
I might submit it with a size 1.5 and see if I like it better.

184
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:25,670
I might come out with a size five, so bring a sense of experimentation and see what you like.

185
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:33,129
And I thought the color here was the color of the lime. All right.

186
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,970
So we're making our way along that flow chart. We've done the two top tiers.

187
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:41,110
We've done. If the data are categorical or factor, here's one option.

188
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:46,810
If the data are numeric, here's another option. Now we're getting into some of the situations where we've got two variables.

189
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:53,730
And we're probably going to do this. We'll do them.

190
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,930
We'll do them one by one. So what do you see here?

191
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:02,970
So this one is the G on point on. This is the same function we used previously.

192
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:11,370
Can anybody help me interpret this? What do you. What do you see in this plot? How do we interpret this plot that we see here?

193
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:17,390
Epidemiology is a lot of just like looking at data and trying to decipher it.

194
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:30,730
Yeah, I see that too. I see a little bit of positive relationship and then I logic check.

195
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:36,490
I see. Does that match my expectations? Yes. We've got higher blood bloods among folks who are older ages.

196
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:39,700
That is consistent with my understanding of public health policy.

197
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:45,160
So it's like. Think through and make sure that my thoughts make sense.

198
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:55,090
There's a couple conventions with scatter plots. Usually we put our predictor variable on the x axis and our outcome variable on the y axis.

199
00:20:55,300 --> 00:21:05,890
So here I was testing to see is age a predictor of. But you might be testing to see is drug dosage associated with disease outcome.

200
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:11,260
So usually the predictor is on the x axis and the outcome variables on the Y axis.

201
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:16,210
If you if you want to play into what your reader expectations are.

202
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:22,360
All right, so here we're working with our first required part.

203
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:26,260
So we've got our data set, our second required part,

204
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:33,910
we've got our static mapping of H on the x axis and here I've got log10 of blah blah on the y axis.

205
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:44,530
As a spam customer and my computer.

206
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:57,640
Premier interpret and then I'm adding the G on point to the scatterplot there.

207
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:03,550
Here I've got a couple a set of choices I made, so I set the alpha equal to the point I want.

208
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:06,310
What's that thing doing? The Alpha. Can we remember what that one did?

209
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:13,340
That is the transparency and as a value of point one, making it more or less transparency than the default.

210
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:24,810
More transparent because the default setting is one. So this is less than one.

211
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,040
So ah, ah ah. Like transparent.

212
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:31,770
It's getting morphing. So it's a strategy I'll do if we have a ton of data.

213
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:39,660
Yeah. It starts to get over. I also shrunk the size of the points, make them very tiny because this is a relatively big dataset.

214
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:48,400
You might want to add a line of best fit either to that previous fire or instead of it.

215
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:52,990
So here again, we got age and years on the x axis and blah blah on the y axis.

216
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:58,870
Because here you might be having a hard time identifying is there an actual trend there?

217
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:05,680
So we can have it plot a line of best fit and we can do this with the function G on the smooth.

218
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:13,020
So again, she fought on the darker side of esthetics for a ton of blood.

219
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:16,349
But so this is essentially the exact same thing as the last plot.

220
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:22,350
The only thing I'm swapping out is the geometry. And here I set a couple specific.

221
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:30,810
So geometry, specific options like here, I'm saying the method I want to use is l am the sense for linear model.

222
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:39,400
We'll get into regression modeling in the last class. You'll see that we'll use the term L, M or the function L and they're over regression modeling.

223
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:43,750
But this is to have it be a linear model. The default is to make it a wiggly model.

224
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:48,600
I'm saying yes, give me a standard error that's giving me the space around the line.

225
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:54,610
And I said, I want it to fill the standard error with with the color red.

226
00:23:55,270 --> 00:24:07,960
So our options you can decide whether to use or not. What if we have one numeric and one categorical variable?

227
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:15,250
So in this case, I've got categories on the x axis with age groups and I've got blah blah on the y axis.

228
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:20,530
So that's a continuous metric. And these are five categories.

229
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:24,430
A common way of presenting this data are with box plots.

230
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:28,870
Can anybody help me interpret this black plot? Like what?

231
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,500
What is this first box telling us? What does this mean here?

232
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:53,290
Oh, the boxes mean. And it gives the medium the interplay between the men and the men.

233
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:59,350
Yeah. What if also this having a line in the middle saw media, the edges of the box.

234
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:04,030
These are the 25th percentile in the 75th percentile.

235
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:09,610
So the difference between them exactly is the interquartile range really stretches out here on either side.

236
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,450
So these take you all the way out to I. We can double check the default here, but I think it's the 95th percentile.

237
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:20,500
So what does that mean? Or that there is nothing beyond that.

238
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:26,340
That means the 95th percentile is the same as the maximum answer.

239
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:31,080
I mean, here we're going out to the fifth percentile and we have a couple individual points that are beyond the.

240
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:38,310
All right. So this is usually when I'm looking at this, I'm looking at the median and I'm kind of looking at the idea of a spread.

241
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:44,710
You can also use this to try to compare across categories.

242
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:48,520
Are there any differences in the medium here?

243
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:52,900
And I think I've switched over. Now we're doing iron instead of one.

244
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:59,230
And I don't know about you. I don't. Maybe it's my angle that I don't really see any differences across these age categories personally.

245
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:10,620
All right. So how are we doing this? We are doing our our apply, our dataset, our esthetic mapping of age groups versus iron.

246
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:15,330
And then we're over here, we got Indian Box lots.

247
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,780
And I filled the boxes with another one of my favorite colors.

248
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:36,040
And are the dark or give color. An alternative approach you can take you can swap these and out.

249
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:40,750
They provide equivalent information. This one's called a violin plot.

250
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:49,300
A violin plot is essentially a combo deal between a box plot and a histogram.

251
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:53,510
So if you kind of like. Turn your head sideways.

252
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:58,790
This is that histogram. So here's the redundancy plot.

253
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:02,830
Here's the density plot of this strata of the data.

254
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:09,540
And then these lines across it are the box plot lines. So this is very common in.

255
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:20,070
About molecular epidemiology. I do like RNA sequencing data is often conveyed this way, but sometimes in other fields this is less common.

256
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,760
So we've got a category and we've got a continuous variable over here.

257
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:29,730
And who does this? Setting our esthetics and then setting our genome violence.

258
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:34,560
I specified where I wanted to draw those horizontal lines,

259
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:39,840
so I wanted a horizontal line at the 25th percentile, 50th percentile in the 75th percentile.

260
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:43,050
And then I filled it with another color.

261
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:54,660
There's a third related type, especially my friends in the laboratory sciences and like toxicology really like to see the individual data points.

262
00:27:55,410 --> 00:28:05,129
So this is called B swamp plot or a jitter plot where we can overlay the points in front of either the box plot or the violent plots.

263
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:17,590
We're stacking plots on top of each other. So here we're setting the plot, and then I'm filling it just as before is the same as before.

264
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:23,860
But what's new here is I added a plus line after the by line to add these dots.

265
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:30,519
And the reason I have to do this with the generic function instead of the zero point

266
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:37,060
function is because these are every single point would be exactly along this line.

267
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:43,060
Every single data point on the x axis is only there's only five possible values.

268
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:47,230
So jitter as a little bit of random noise,

269
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:54,460
a little bit of random spread about it to help with over plotting when we're trying to use individual points for categorical variable.

270
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:59,799
So maybe that's a little bit too in the weeds, but this is how we're able to get points on top of this,

271
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:05,650
and the points are not directly on top of each other. So just like G on point, we can specify what shape doing the that's the B.

272
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:12,930
What transparency do we want them to be? And how much of x axis wiggle do we want them to go here?

273
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:17,280
I've got like a point to and wiggle.

274
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:22,080
This is essentially plotted like one unit between each the other self.

275
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:27,180
I've got 2.2 that's wiggle on either side there and I set the size here.

276
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:33,090
So I'm just giving you a few options in your arsenal of like ways to do this.

277
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:37,080
And you can continue to add features with a plus sign and add.

278
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:41,309
You can see we've got two geometries on one plot. Same thing.

279
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:49,860
You can do a g point and a on smooth on top of our wheel point plot, whichever one you provide first on the bottom.

280
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:55,740
So this is putting the violin plot on the bottom and then the jitter, the points on the top.

281
00:29:56,190 --> 00:30:01,020
If you wanted to flip the order, you just provide the jitter in front and the violin in the bottom.

282
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:04,560
So it's going to do these steps in the order that you provide them.

283
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,460
All right. Here's our recap.

284
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:18,320
So essentially, when I'm when I'm working with a new set of data, I select what plot type based on the shape of the variable.

285
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:25,240
So if that variable is numeric is that variables factor, I'm going to add in different plot types.

286
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:31,750
And then based on usually I'll start looking at a single variable at a time and once I start to feel comfortable with that,

287
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,610
until I've looked at all the variables individually,

288
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:39,430
then I build up to pairwise relationships so that I'll look at two variables together to see if they're related.

289
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:45,429
And there's additional choices you can make there. But I think hopefully you've seen that there's this repeating pattern.

290
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:53,950
And maybe, maybe I was born how many times we looked at that same pattern that juju plots have those same three non-negotiables.

291
00:30:54,640 --> 00:31:04,060
And so you can feel empowered to go out and explore and try new juju plot types based on your needs that are going to all follow this framework.

292
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:08,260
So one option, if you have categorical data, you can use the jump bar.

293
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:13,690
If you have numeric data, you can use jump density or jump histogram as you wish.

294
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:19,990
And if you have two variables together that are both numeric and you use the on point and origin, I'm smooth.

295
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:25,380
And if we have one numerical one categorical, we can use the on box clarity on violin.

296
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:31,209
So you've got options. Let's cross first fact that what kind of comments?

297
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:47,540
Questions, concerns about plotting. Cliff, click on the position.

298
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:52,460
Yes. Yes, we can.

299
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:55,700
I'm not. Yeah.

300
00:31:56,630 --> 00:32:01,940
There's a little bit in the weeds, I guess. So when what do you provide categorical variables to our.

301
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:12,140
It's going to plot them like it's going to call this X axis, essentially one unit to unit three unit for unit five unit.

302
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:16,640
And here I was saying, how much wiggle do I want around this?

303
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,800
So I'm having it wiggle point.

304
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:30,950
Two units on either side, those two points, but all of them because the only actual values these points can have are exactly on at this point.

305
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:36,620
The only true values on the x axis are exactly along these like white lines here.

306
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:41,060
So I'm introducing random noise in the data.

307
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:48,170
This is not actually a higher age than this one. There is no meaning to the x axis spread here.

308
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:51,980
This is just so that the points are not directly above each other.

309
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:58,460
So we can see a little bit like, okay, there's more darkness here, meaning more points are here.

310
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:04,940
That's consistent with our blowing out of the. Density plot, and there's like few observations.

311
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:13,500
Kind of out here in the extremes. So if you wanted to make that position and we can play with this in the code, we want to make that position.

312
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:21,580
Bigger. These will spread out wider. If we make that gesture smaller, they'll be tighter.

313
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,890
So usually that's when I'm curious about stuff. I just like mess with it and see what it does.

314
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:32,410
But essentially this'll make them come out. And every time you render this, this points audience slightly different.

315
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:42,100
X-axis, the y axis is actual data. So this one will always be along this line here, but it might move a little bit left or right.

316
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,220
Yeah. Let's jump into it.

317
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:55,740
You may notice I have a closet club link for you here and hopefully we're able to get in there.

318
00:33:56,610 --> 00:34:02,310
I checked it and I think all of our stuff transferred over. But I want everybody, let's make sure everyone's there.

319
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:06,930
So you should be able to follow that link and get into your closet cloud account.

320
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:14,310
Which should transfer over from your our studio cloud account. We're going to reenter the graphing class.

321
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:26,930
So if you are joining us, weren't here last time find my instructor graphing class projects and click copy to make a new one versus if this

322
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:33,660
is if you're returning if you were here last class find your individual student account for the graphing class.

323
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:05,379
Okay. So I have my notes that we we left off right after this.

324
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:08,390
Check your understanding about making a scatterplot with colon.

325
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:15,160
If you're having trouble finding that this is the quartile marked down on the right hand side for graphic class.

326
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:19,150
So you can use the outline or scroll down and navigate.

327
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:28,690
We're going to work with the section that's talking about scatterplot with lines of best fit and to run all the code from the prior contracts above.

328
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:33,429
If people need to catch up to where we are, what's a button we can push?

329
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:42,520
What's a trick we can do to run all the prior code? Yeah.

330
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:49,710
I was wondering why you had to drop out and then all home.

331
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:54,820
Oh, I didn't even know about that one. That's wonderful. I love figuring that out.

332
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:59,910
Okay, so we can put my cursor somewhere in this current coach that I'm interested in.

333
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:03,410
I click Run, Run, alternate coach.

334
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:07,130
Thanks above. Thank you, son. Sure.

335
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:20,800
Yeah, because they're not. I might put.

336
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:31,600
Not all of them, but I've done something. All right.

337
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:37,750
I think it was 112. This one equals false.

338
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:45,500
This should not be running. All right. We have our enhanced data set.

339
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:55,670
We've got some plots happening. All right. The other way I think we could do it is with this down arrow that also does the exact same thing.

340
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:59,690
I'm assuming a little bit to get a little bit closer.

341
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,930
Is this more visible from that?

342
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:12,899
Excellent. All right, so let's deal. Let's do some plot lines here.

343
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:16,670
I've got the plots showing up on the right hand side for visualization and class.

344
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:20,760
I did that with this button. Here with the gear.

345
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:25,290
I'm saying trunk output in the console. That puts it over here.

346
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:31,710
If you want it to show up back on your markdown document, you do trunk output in line.

347
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:38,250
It was just something I thought. It's easier to see stuff side by side as opposed to me scrolling up and down.

348
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:44,990
All right. So what are you expecting here before we even make this plot?

349
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:48,729
Let's logic check that. What do you think is going to be on the different axes?

350
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:51,790
And how do we know? What kind of plot are we making?

351
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:16,440
Yeah, please. Scatterplot shows h on the x axis and blood red on the y axis with a line.

352
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:20,070
Go in there. Yeah, you've lost that.

353
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:26,129
So we're making a scatterplot. We go back to the socio point and the variable we've got on the x axis.

354
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:32,580
We're expected to be h the y axis. We're expecting the, the log ten of blood but and then are also making a line of best fit.

355
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:36,030
And which one do you think is going to be on top the line of best bet or the points.

356
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:42,670
So I'm the one because I ask to do whatever is at the bottom more recently.

357
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:46,480
How does it know what's going to be on the axis of the line of best bets?

358
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,920
Yeah. These esthetics apply to all of the subsequent geometries.

359
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,560
I just thought, it's kind of nice.

360
00:38:57,570 --> 00:39:04,580
We don't have to keep saying from both the points and the line of us of it, but we're having these things on the x and y axis.

361
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:24,300
This is going to apply to everything that's connected there. Hello.

362
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:39,080
How? And I like. I got an error message on my library wasn't loaded, so I went back and looked at my library.

363
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:44,320
All right. So here's what we were expecting about it.

364
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:50,330
On the x axis, blah, blah, on the Y axis, we've got points in the background and we've got the line of best fit in the foreground.

365
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:57,830
Here I did. The method equals Alam, which is not to put a linear model on that line of buffer.

366
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:05,930
If we what we can do. What happens if we take out that method equals out and give it the default line?

367
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:09,530
It's quite round. We get squiggly. Yes.

368
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:15,110
Well, that's essentially what I'll do. I like add and subtract options and just see what happens.

369
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:22,850
Here. We've got two variables in the plot. I can add a third variable.

370
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:34,120
What's this third variable? I'm adding in the ascetics. So we've still got age on the x axis, we've got blah blah.

371
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:46,350
On the y axis was this third variable I'm bringing into the plot. Yes.

372
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,040
We're going to make this even more complicated.

373
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:54,070
And this is going to correspond with the shape of the clients and the color of the points so that are going to make points.

374
00:40:54,340 --> 00:41:06,450
Now we're gonna make a smooth line from labels. So impact on one plot.

375
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:11,920
We've got a lot of information being conveyed, so we've got three variables being plotted.

376
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:19,750
Can anybody help me interpret? What do you see here? With respect to sex, what what's happening with these different colors and shapes here?

377
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:38,000
How are we telling what's going on? Blood let levels seem to be consistently.

378
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:44,710
Lower came out. Yeah. And these lines are almost, like, parallel to each other, right?

379
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:50,089
So across all ages, we're observing that there's lower blood, blood levels for female participants.

380
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:53,300
The male and we know in blue are female because we can see it in the legend.

381
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:57,139
So we've got the line above it in blue also at that point.

382
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:01,280
So the blue triangles are the individual observations for female.

383
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:05,090
And the red circles are the individual observations for male.

384
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:08,810
So we're trying to indicate the differences between these groups a couple of different ways.

385
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:19,490
Any comments, questions about the scatter plots. These are incredibly powerful.

386
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:27,040
I use them all the time. All right, let's jump in to plot type.

387
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:36,640
So when we've got a categorical variable, so if we've got a categorical variable here, I just pull out a sex as an example.

388
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:41,440
We can make a simple bar plan. Check out what are the default settings?

389
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:49,010
All right. So how do we interpret this? This. Is this very helpful to you?

390
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:53,150
Well, this is just kind of two enormous black boxes.

391
00:42:53,180 --> 00:43:00,799
I guess what I can tell here is that there's about 4500 participants who responded to the mail

392
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:09,710
categorical question and maybe 46 or 4700 participants who responded to the female categorical question.

393
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:15,120
Not super effective visualization for a wider audience.

394
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:19,680
If you want, you can start adding some colors with the esthetics.

395
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:28,590
So we can specify that we want the variable to pertain to the outline color as well as the fill color.

396
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:36,530
What if we want to flip? The axes.

397
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:41,780
We could we can specify this on the Y axis instead.

398
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:52,580
If we want to flip it on the Y axis or we can leave it exactly the same as the before and change the coordinates.

399
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:59,089
So coordinates is a set of options where we you can use different mapping patterns here.

400
00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:03,590
I'm just saying flip those coordinates. So this put it on the Y axis as well.

401
00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:08,240
Even though I'm saying put it on the x axis there, it might actually saying your version.

402
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:20,880
Where you need. Here. I'm adding some labels so that things have a little bit more information.

403
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:32,660
No. I forgot to highlight the. You can tell down here I didn't finish submitting it, but it's not ready to accept new information yet.

404
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:41,210
I don't have a console Pac-Man fix, so I did that highlight the last parentheses.

405
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:46,530
So I just submit the last parentheses and give that new plot type.

406
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:57,510
These are the default colors, blue and red. We can start to set more specific colors through.

407
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:02,820
Scale field manual function misses out.

408
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:08,700
Does anyone remember what these? Values after the hash tag, after this.

409
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:11,839
Look familiar? Now these are our tax code.

410
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:18,530
So you can specify whatever you want in there. If you want to manually set colors or you can provide the color names.

411
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:38,630
You just make stuff up and see what color is in there. So apparently this color, this tax code that I just invented is a lovely shade of purple.

412
00:45:42,370 --> 00:45:48,040
And then here would be, if you want to combine two variables together, two categorical variables together.

413
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:56,860
So we're looking at. The frequency of educational attainment by the two different sex categories in this dataset.

414
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:06,380
How did we get two variables. I started with one variable on an axis and one variable in the film.

415
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:16,629
So in your homework, the homework question to I'll ask you to make a bar plot with two variables in it and to try playing with some of the colors.

416
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:27,970
Try playing with some of the labels. Yeah.

417
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:31,610
How would you check the coverage of different education level?

418
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:36,010
Yeah. That's. Oh, how to change these colors.

419
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:41,370
Yeah, we can do this. So does anybody have an idea how we can change these colors?

420
00:46:41,370 --> 00:46:44,620
So these are the default colors? When did you plan to.

421
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:53,820
How can we change those default colors? We have a caller.

422
00:46:56,750 --> 00:47:03,230
Yeah, we could add a skillful manual, and then we could specify what we want those values to be.

423
00:47:05,510 --> 00:47:12,470
What we can do. Dark or good or bad or blue.

424
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:20,420
Uh, fire. Bright red. Sea green.

425
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:25,040
Many do I need. One, two, three, four. I need a fifth one. Are those two gray?

426
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:28,640
No. The 38 gray is in there. I'll do orange.

427
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:40,160
Why spell it wrong? I found out I spell it wrong. So I got an error that told me I can't find that function called skull filled manual.

428
00:47:40,670 --> 00:47:43,850
So when I get an error like that, I'm like, Oh, what function is this?

429
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:48,610
Oh, I actually typed that one wrong. So it's very normal to get these errors and just work.

430
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:55,340
Check out the messages and work through them. Well, I still spelled it wrong.

431
00:47:55,850 --> 00:48:01,630
Manual. Wow. All right, so here's one way to change the colors.

432
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:07,580
I set the I added a new function to it, and I manually set the colors.

433
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:12,690
So here are just five different colors present in the language of.

434
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:18,620
Another option we could do. Oh, it looks like the any category is not accepting a color.

435
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:24,380
So I think this would work even if I did not specify this, if I only specified four colors.

436
00:48:31,310 --> 00:48:34,610
If. If we didn't want to use manual colors.

437
00:48:34,610 --> 00:48:39,200
What if I wanted to use a preexisting color palette?

438
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:47,690
How can we do that? Every year we access some of those color palettes.

439
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:59,320
We could I could hashtag this out. And we could do scale fill.

440
00:49:02,990 --> 00:49:08,390
Brewer, which is one of these packages that is full of color palettes.

441
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:13,550
And so we just threw the default first.

442
00:49:14,570 --> 00:49:20,420
And see that the default color palette is blue, but we can look up.

443
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:24,440
There is there's a whole bunch of other ones. So we could do palette equals to.

444
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:36,080
And that's with shades of green. We could try and check out all the different palette.

445
00:49:37,310 --> 00:49:40,010
So this was two ways to change the colors on a histogram.

446
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:47,360
One was manually filtered, changing the film, and one was using other package and other software.

447
00:49:47,570 --> 00:49:53,630
Ah it's still in our package, but using another package to somebody else's picked colors to be nice.

448
00:49:54,960 --> 00:50:00,860
Two. It's time to change up those colors. That's a great question.

449
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:07,459
You may have other. I'm using the hashtag in front of it to comment it out.

450
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:12,530
So here I can turn on you can comment this one out and turn this one on.

451
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:18,230
That's kind of the problem between the two is ignoring whichever one I put the hashtag in front of.

452
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:25,930
You can see it. Great greens it out. Yes.

453
00:50:25,930 --> 00:50:37,850
It's going to bring a spirit of experimentation. For me, I kind of rarely use the bar plus more comment for me as to use history.

454
00:50:37,850 --> 00:50:41,900
And maybe, maybe because more of the variables I work with are continuous.

455
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:52,250
But so if we want to start getting into looking at numeric variables individually, we can start using John Histogram.

456
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:57,800
So we've got, here's our red blood cell variable. Which axes are you expecting it to show up on?

457
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:05,380
Yeah. That one's going to be on the X. Plop that out.

458
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,160
What if we want it to be on the Y?

459
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:15,180
We can give it to Y and I'll draw it there so it'll follow specifically whatever instructions you give it on y axis.

460
00:51:18,130 --> 00:51:21,430
One of the unique options within histogram.

461
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:26,380
We can specify how wide we want these bins to be and go back to the default.

462
00:51:30,370 --> 00:51:34,720
We can sit here. I think I'm going to make the bins a little bit smaller.

463
00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:43,180
Oop. Now it looks like they're even a little bit bigger, so our benefits are a little bit wider if we want.

464
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:48,730
We could take these all the way down to .05 and then we get a bunch of very tiny bits.

465
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:54,310
So you can see how your interpretation of the data gets modified a little bit based on how many bends you did.

466
00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:58,870
So here, I mean, very tiny bits as well. So before they were bigger bins.

467
00:52:03,310 --> 00:52:10,480
If we're gonna look at two variables at once. So here I've got one variable, and I want to look at a second variable.

468
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:18,010
I can use overlapping histograms. So I'm looking at.

469
00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:23,610
What are the iron levels? And I'm splitting by a second variable by sex.

470
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:33,360
What's your interpretation here of these iron levels? Does this look normally distributed to you, these iron levels?

471
00:52:36,310 --> 00:52:41,380
Now there's a right skew to it. And do they look the same by sex?

472
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:53,070
It looks like their females have lower iron levels, but it's hard, right, because they're stacked on top of each other and none of them are.

473
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:56,550
There's no transparency. I can't I'm guessing what the data are underneath.

474
00:52:57,530 --> 00:53:00,380
So I was kind of step the data one at a time.

475
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:09,980
So I'm going to do that, redo that, where I'm going to add some alpha transparency to it so we can kind of see the underlying information.

476
00:53:11,210 --> 00:53:17,870
So if what we have now in light gray is the female category and in dark gray or black is the male category,

477
00:53:18,290 --> 00:53:23,000
and we get this intermediate color where they're overlapping. So now can you.

478
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:27,040
Do you have any assessment do you think these values are consistent across the two groups?

479
00:53:29,390 --> 00:53:33,020
It looks like the whole curve is kind of shifted higher for the group in this case.

480
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:43,110
Yeah, yeah, yeah. What is the difference between the identity versus the stack?

481
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:52,260
Oh, yeah. This is. Let's try it. So what if we do position equals or if we take this off?

482
00:53:52,890 --> 00:54:04,760
Or if we do position equal stack? Then if instead of cutting them, it's like stacking them on top of each other.

483
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:09,230
So it's plotting the female category, the blue category first,

484
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:14,420
and then any additional observations in the male category in the red, it's stacking them on top.

485
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:20,420
So it's not treating them as like two separate distributions. It's looking at the cumulative distribution.

486
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:27,159
So with this type of visualization, we can see the. By considering both colors together.

487
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:31,690
This is the total, the cumulative of the whole population.

488
00:54:32,530 --> 00:54:37,510
So by doing position equal stack, we can see the cumulative distribution across the entire cohort.

489
00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:43,510
Because the colors are stacked on top of each other versus by doing that identity.

490
00:54:44,230 --> 00:54:52,120
They're next to each other. So if we did that one with the transparency, we would see there would be no actual.

491
00:54:55,130 --> 00:55:00,230
There's no actual overlap. We've lost that intermediate gray color because it's just stacked in many

492
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:06,590
observations on top of each other instead of putting them next to each other. So the identity allows them to be side by side.

493
00:55:09,590 --> 00:55:16,760
Great questions. Right. And the biggest difference for me between them is when I look at the Y axis.

494
00:55:16,970 --> 00:55:24,740
So here, when their identity when they're side by side, the Y axis only goes up to 400 when I stack them.

495
00:55:29,270 --> 00:55:34,460
Y axis goes all the way up to eight, seven or 800. So we're looking at the whole.

496
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:43,260
Population all together. The question was I can see some of the your question to nice.

497
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:49,310
But anything else? Anyone who wants to experiment with anything you want to try.

498
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:55,730
Messing some of the settings I learned so much about what happens.

499
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:16,320
All right, let's make a density plot. Those are very similar to a histogram, but then we don't have to mess with any of these, um, bin sizes.

500
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:19,740
Now we're just making a smooth line across the whole distribution.

501
00:56:23,430 --> 00:56:26,910
So here I make a smooth line for those red blood cell counts.

502
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:32,280
I can specify what do I want the line color to be? What I want this line size to be.

503
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:36,540
I can make it huge. So I set the line size to eight.

504
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:43,200
Otherwise I might want the line to be a .05 for my make the line extremely thin.

505
00:56:43,890 --> 00:56:52,830
All right. So you can see how playing with these values influences your choices here.

506
00:56:52,830 --> 00:56:56,220
I've overlaid add density plot on top of a histogram.

507
00:56:57,910 --> 00:57:01,170
So if you don't want to have to choose, I can say why not?

508
00:57:01,410 --> 00:57:10,160
So we've got a histogram and a density plot on top of. Surrounded the density plot to be first in the histogram.

509
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:18,230
In the background. We could put the. Anybody here?

510
00:57:19,230 --> 00:57:25,970
And then the histogram a move to the front. Now, of course, that's the plot in the background.

511
00:57:27,550 --> 00:57:30,850
So this kind of plot, whatever you want, first up above.

512
00:57:48,410 --> 00:57:52,729
Let's make our first box spot. What type of data do we usually work with?

513
00:57:52,730 --> 00:57:57,040
With box plots? American.

514
00:57:58,090 --> 00:58:04,419
Yeah. So to make a single box, we need numeric data. So we need at least one of our variables to be numeric or if we only have one variable

515
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:08,230
should be number and then the second variable should be categorical if we have one.

516
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:14,200
So here I'm just plotting one variable and it's a continuous variable in numeric variable.

517
00:58:14,650 --> 00:58:18,760
And you notice I'm specifying two different things. I'm specifying the fill and the color.

518
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:23,860
What's the difference between fill and color when we're talking about plotting and you can plot?

519
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:36,780
And. The colors that exactly fill will be the color of the box interior is filled with and color will be the outline color.

520
00:58:38,090 --> 00:58:44,260
I'm specifying a couple features here you don't have to do like a notch equals true that's going to put a little synch

521
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:50,989
of the way around the media and here I'm specifying how synch do I want that it don't have to do any of these things.

522
00:58:50,990 --> 00:58:54,920
I'm just trying to make it so that it's available.

523
00:58:57,150 --> 00:59:04,590
Well, it's actually hard to see because those data are so you can see that notch a little bit of a stretch it out.

524
00:59:08,830 --> 00:59:14,380
Yeah. These data are very compressed. There's a very small notch happening here around the media.

525
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:20,050
So a little bit of daylight between there, but not much for this particular opportunity.

526
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:24,340
Now I'm going to add a second variable to our exploration.

527
00:59:25,150 --> 00:59:32,300
So I'm still looking at Ion, but now I'm going to add age groups. This is the default I would express if I had no options.

528
00:59:32,990 --> 00:59:37,460
This is what I'm seeing by default of a of a box plus.

529
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:43,220
Can anyone remind me how do we interpret these age group variables?

530
00:59:43,390 --> 00:59:47,010
Like, what does a 64 and 80 mean over here?

531
00:59:48,780 --> 01:00:02,840
All of these rounded parentheses and square brackets mean. So it's gone all the way back to when we were making variables, I think in week two.

532
01:00:04,370 --> 01:00:08,660
Those rounded parentheses in the square bracket. What ages are here? Yeah, the square.

533
01:00:09,810 --> 01:00:13,910
Sacrilege. And pregnancy goes all the way up.

534
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:18,580
Yeah, exactly. And this is just one of those things we've got to memorize.

535
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:25,660
There's a couple of these, like when we're navigating positions in a dataframe are always wants rows first and columns second.

536
01:00:25,930 --> 01:00:31,450
Another thing we have to memorize when our is using both of these this is saying

537
01:00:31,450 --> 01:00:37,000
these are participants who are greater than age 64 and less than or equal to 80.

538
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:44,860
So just as it was described, the square brackets are including that number and the rounded parentheses up to that value.

539
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:50,890
So greater than 64 and less than or equal to 86. Our largest group in our oldest age group.

540
01:01:01,110 --> 01:01:02,880
Specifying a third variable now.

541
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:14,920
So it looks like in this first plot there was no at least by my age of my eyeballs, it looks like there's no relationship between age and iron.

542
01:01:17,230 --> 01:01:21,100
But we saw that there was a relationship between iron and sex.

543
01:01:21,430 --> 01:01:27,550
So I'm going to try to bring it all together. And here, what do we see?

544
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:32,110
So can anybody talk me through this plot? We've added a third variable.

545
01:01:32,110 --> 01:01:35,530
So we've got age, iron and sex together.

546
01:01:35,540 --> 01:01:42,380
So what is happening here? How do you interpret these results?

547
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:53,270
Yeah. So I remember overall, our Lord for the mills.

548
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:58,910
Yeah. But I mean they get we stay consistent by age.

549
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:01,790
Yeah. Yeah.

550
01:02:01,790 --> 01:02:09,950
We're seeing that females have lower iron levels overall than male and that's consistent with what we saw in the, um, the scatterplot as well.

551
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:14,000
So we're able to like start to build some internal consistency.

552
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:23,150
Does this make you think anything if we go to modeling, if you were to if we are interested in relationships with iron,

553
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:27,829
maybe we want to consider like a stratified model by sex or something like

554
01:02:27,830 --> 01:02:32,690
this because there appear to be different differences happening potentially,

555
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:37,300
or at least with our outcome, whatever our outcome variable is, we want to check that by sex tip.

556
01:02:41,570 --> 01:02:47,970
I'm really just bringing some exploration. You're welcome to swap out different variables.

557
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:55,130
We could look at education. You know, bring some experimentation to your analysis.

558
01:02:55,670 --> 01:02:59,149
Try different combinations of variables. Check things out.

559
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:06,210
See what? See what you see. Okay.

560
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:14,120
A violent plot is very similar to a boxer, but it is a little bit swoopy.

561
01:03:14,990 --> 01:03:20,230
So on this axis, our our is essentially a density plot for that age.

562
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:30,230
So this is I think I've switched over to bloodline. We can see that there's higher blood, but with age as expected.

563
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:36,170
And then here I'm adding some points on top.

564
01:03:36,170 --> 01:03:45,050
So this is where I'm adding that jitter to add the dots on top because it feels a little mysterious, like what's behind these big blobs.

565
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:53,750
So now we can see where the actual data points are falling, what's represented by the by the density plot.

566
01:03:53,960 --> 01:04:00,110
If we want to make the the points have a random spread that's a little bit wider.

567
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:08,780
We can make those jitter bigger. So I made that jitter go up 2.4 and they spread out here.

568
01:04:11,030 --> 01:04:14,750
Eventually, if you make it too wide, it'll start to overlap with the next category.

569
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:19,520
So it's just a purely lifestyle choice, whatever you think is the best way to.

570
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:28,620
Portray that information. By adding some colors, adding some labels from.

571
01:04:29,820 --> 01:04:33,280
Making it a little bit more fancy checking it out. I just.

572
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:41,770
Here. I change the colors, I use the scale. I feel brewer and I use the blue palette.

573
01:04:42,970 --> 01:04:48,070
But you could use palettes that are from your national parks palettes.

574
01:04:48,070 --> 01:04:57,510
There's all kinds of different palettes you can operate here. Let's pause.

575
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:03,700
How are we doing? All right.

576
01:05:03,730 --> 01:05:09,129
This is going to wrap up the plot types portion and then we're going to get into multi panel plots.

577
01:05:09,130 --> 01:05:14,860
We're going to take a break now. But the key thing I want to leave you with here is that all of your data management steps earlier,

578
01:05:14,890 --> 01:05:21,190
when you are making sure that a variable was numeric, if it was supposed to be numeric, making sure variables factor was supposed to be factor.

579
01:05:21,430 --> 01:05:26,650
These are continuing to pay off down the line because we're able to plot them properly.

580
01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:32,480
All right. Let's take a let's take a five minute break. And when we come back, we'll do slides about multi panel plots.

581
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:59,230
But I don't want to start.

582
01:06:07,670 --> 01:06:34,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

583
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:52,530
Oh, okay. I know who you are, what you expect.

584
01:06:53,720 --> 01:07:22,730
Yeah. What do you expect them to do with it as well.

585
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:29,330
Yeah. Yeah.

586
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:37,040
People. Are you aware of that?

587
01:07:41,380 --> 01:07:56,350
It's like, what. Look how far we have come.

588
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:10,800
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

589
01:08:21,660 --> 01:08:35,920
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

590
01:08:36,250 --> 01:08:43,070
I know, I know. It's horrible.

591
01:08:47,930 --> 01:09:17,700
Oh, you know, I knew it was going to take the edge off.

592
01:09:19,970 --> 01:09:26,400
Oh, my God. I think I.

593
01:09:26,510 --> 01:09:56,440
Yeah, I think for me, when I was a little basically, I was like, I want to talk to you.

594
01:09:58,890 --> 01:10:38,080
I probably shouldn't talk too much more because it's like, well, you can walk in China to have you here.

595
01:10:39,070 --> 01:10:52,670
Oh, my God. How many years since she to do the hard questions?

596
01:10:54,820 --> 01:11:00,160
I mean, if you wanted to.

597
01:11:01,660 --> 01:11:05,290
All right. Welcome back. We'll talk about some multi panel plots next.

598
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:16,950
So our goals and this module will be to generate from multiple panel plots, will also be talking about this is applicable to all plots we make,

599
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:22,330
but how to export them out of our studio for use and sharing with folks in other platforms.

600
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:33,700
So multi paneled plots are very useful opportunity for when we want to display kind of categories on a plot.

601
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:40,810
So with multi panel plots, we could make each of these plots individually, but we would have to set them.

602
01:11:42,460 --> 01:11:46,600
To have the same limits on the axes we might have to crop off.

603
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:49,690
So we're not repeating the same axes, labels over and over again.

604
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:56,630
We can have our align everything for us so that we are not having to, you know,

605
01:11:56,740 --> 01:12:00,520
drag everything and make sure it's all lining up in word after the fact.

606
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:07,719
So we can essentially ask our to make a whole bunch of plots together and align everything perfectly.

607
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:13,180
So in here in this four panel plot, all four panels have the exact same X axes.

608
01:12:14,380 --> 01:12:20,860
So can anybody interpret this? What do you what do you see here? How what do you see in this results of this plot?

609
01:12:21,990 --> 01:12:29,459
What's what's being depicted here? What are on the different axes?

610
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:49,700
What are the different colors? So each one of these panels is a histogram, right?

611
01:12:50,690 --> 01:12:57,620
So the x axis is the age and years. The y axis of the histogram is the number of participants meeting that criteria.

612
01:12:58,010 --> 01:13:02,360
And then what are these four different panels shown here? Educational.

613
01:13:03,140 --> 01:13:07,070
Yeah. Our data are stratified by educational attainment categories.

614
01:13:07,310 --> 01:13:10,880
So here are the folks in the more than high school age category.

615
01:13:11,210 --> 01:13:16,760
Does this make sense? People are tend to be 18 plus if they have more than a high school education.

616
01:13:17,510 --> 01:13:21,950
If folks have a high school agenda, they tend to be 18 plus approximately.

617
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:26,420
If folks have less than a fifth grade education, they tend to tend to be children.

618
01:13:27,290 --> 01:13:33,080
And if folks have less than a high school education, a large number of children, but there's also adults in this category as well.

619
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:40,910
So by aligning everything on this X axis, by looking at different panels, we're able to see some differences across here.

620
01:13:41,180 --> 01:13:46,200
We could have done these with overlapping histograms, but I find that, you know,

621
01:13:46,250 --> 01:13:51,410
when we were like put them blue in the red on top of each other, or we put the two shades of gray on top of each other.

622
01:13:51,810 --> 01:13:54,920
I think that for me, that reaches limits.

623
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:59,810
There's only so many like overlapping colors you can make before it gets very muddy.

624
01:14:00,350 --> 01:14:04,370
So sometimes these type of multi panel plots can indicate that information as well.

625
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:10,310
Another object. So essentially with these type of multi panel plots, they keep the axes and the plot style the same,

626
01:14:11,930 --> 01:14:14,990
but they essentially have a separate panel for each category.

627
01:14:15,860 --> 01:14:25,460
So this is a plotting style called facts, adding where we're having different panels by a categorical variable.

628
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:30,470
This allows us to make comparisons across groups because everything's already lined up for us.

629
01:14:31,190 --> 01:14:39,769
So here's the code we use to make this. Essentially, we have our non-negotiables, so we specify our data that we specify our prosthetics.

630
01:14:39,770 --> 01:14:44,030
What's on the x axis, the age variable, what's our fill color to be?

631
01:14:44,030 --> 01:14:51,350
Education. We're doing a histogram. All right, so all of this is the same as before, but now we're making a facet graph.

632
01:14:51,830 --> 01:14:55,220
Which variable do we want to specify? The facets?

633
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:01,250
That's the educational variable. So I want each of the panels to be educational attainment.

634
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:06,140
And then what do you think is here? What's your best guess for RN Call and row?

635
01:15:06,170 --> 01:15:12,579
What do you think that's talking about? Columns, a number of columns, number of rows.

636
01:15:12,580 --> 01:15:16,149
So this is saying one column for rows. So does that make sense?

637
01:15:16,150 --> 01:15:20,110
Does that match what you observe here? We've got one column for rows.

638
01:15:20,740 --> 01:15:22,330
So you can come up with different shapes.

639
01:15:22,330 --> 01:15:29,200
Maybe you want a grid pattern of things side by side so you can change up the columns in rows and how you want that displayed.

640
01:15:31,610 --> 01:15:35,509
So this is the variable you want facet in meaning the variable you want the different

641
01:15:35,510 --> 01:15:39,530
groups showing in a number of columns in the output and number of rows in the output.

642
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:44,430
So again, you could make all of these individually and stitch them together.

643
01:15:44,430 --> 01:15:49,469
They'll be time intensive and error prone manual process, but we can have a nice,

644
01:15:49,470 --> 01:15:56,070
elegant code to do it and it's designed to work very effectively with this juju plot coding style up above.

645
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:13,720
If we want to export those plots so that we can do additional activities with them, we can actually assign those plots as objects.

646
01:16:14,740 --> 01:16:25,380
So we could. Traditionally we've been doing good plot and has said the esthetics and edging on point and show it right now in the output.

647
01:16:26,810 --> 01:16:30,500
Now I'm using what? What's the word we have in calling this little arrow here?

648
01:16:34,050 --> 01:16:35,580
It's like the assignment operator.

649
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:43,410
And instead of just showing the plot and assigning that plot as an object name, you can call this whatever name you want, calling it a plot object.

650
01:16:43,770 --> 01:16:48,420
But we're unlocking a new object type. So far we've had vectors, we've had data frames.

651
01:16:49,110 --> 01:16:56,550
Now we've got a plot object and we see it'll show up in our global environment with the name plot object and it's got a new type.

652
01:16:56,700 --> 01:17:01,200
This is called a large G type. And that well, we'll look into it, we'll explore it.

653
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:05,940
There's a whole bunch of information embedded in there. But essentially all of these things are in there.

654
01:17:06,270 --> 01:17:12,600
So the esthetics are in there. The fact that we wanted to scatterplot all of the information is embedded in that object.

655
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:21,810
If we use this exploring function we've been using previously.

656
01:17:21,810 --> 01:17:28,230
So the structure function is something we can use to explore an object and we can see some features of it.

657
01:17:29,070 --> 01:17:37,560
So there is information about the genome, there's information about the data that there's information about the esthetic parameters.

658
01:17:37,740 --> 01:17:46,690
So all of these are. Information points we added to the object are embedded in this complex structure.

659
01:17:51,270 --> 01:17:57,720
Once we have that object, once we have that plot assigned an object name.

660
01:17:58,380 --> 01:18:02,580
We can do all kinds of stuff with it. So for example, we can add features to it.

661
01:18:02,590 --> 01:18:06,570
So I'm saying start with that object and now add a smooth line.

662
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:14,280
Or maybe you want to add new labels so you can use that as a base to build more complex plots off of that.

663
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:20,550
Or we can use it to combine multiple different types of plots into one plot and save those plot objects.

664
01:18:22,590 --> 01:18:30,600
So a second way to make multi panel plots besides fastening, fastening kind of required everything to be the same plot type.

665
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:38,050
Ginger range is more flexible. This lets us make. Any any combination of plot type we want.

666
01:18:38,830 --> 01:18:42,220
So here we're using a function called your range.

667
01:18:43,330 --> 01:18:46,520
We're just specifying all of our plot objects.

668
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:51,530
So these are names we made up for all of the plot objects we made previously.

669
01:18:51,580 --> 01:18:59,080
So we made a plot previously a violent plot, previously a scatterplot, a histogram, and then how are rearranging those together?

670
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:04,010
What are the columns and rows we've specified here? Yeah.

671
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:09,200
Two rows and two columns. And what's your best guess? What order do you think it's going to put these in?

672
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:18,380
Yeah, that's the order we specify. So I'm expecting if we're doing a two by two, we're now in the bar plot in the upper left.

673
01:19:19,170 --> 01:19:23,420
We've got a bar plot in the upper left. Ah, violent. It looks like it's going across.

674
01:19:24,020 --> 01:19:29,870
And so then our violent plot is the upper right scatter flies in lower left and then histogram and lower right.

675
01:19:30,530 --> 01:19:32,270
So this can be a way to stitch it all together.

676
01:19:33,740 --> 01:19:40,100
If you see like a science and nature articles these days will be these complex multiple like 12 panel plots.

677
01:19:40,340 --> 01:19:50,040
And this is the way you reproducibly create this. The plot objects, the number of columns in the plot, the number of rows in the plus.

678
01:19:50,260 --> 01:19:56,370
When I didn't even show it here. But there's a code we can add the like A, B, C and D for the different panels of it too.

679
01:19:56,700 --> 01:20:08,610
So you don't have to manually do any of that work. When we're ready to take the plot out of our studio cloud or in this case, posit cloud.

680
01:20:09,740 --> 01:20:12,860
It's going to take me a minute to transition my language.

681
01:20:13,070 --> 01:20:19,370
So if we want to take the image out of POSIT and share it with colleagues in another setting,

682
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:26,150
we have several quick options so we can render the causal markdown file,

683
01:20:27,110 --> 01:20:31,760
so we can click the render button and our portal markdown will create output there.

684
01:20:32,330 --> 01:20:35,540
That's going to produce the plot in the markdown structure.

685
01:20:35,540 --> 01:20:41,209
So it'll show the code and then the output. Another option is when we're in our interactive coding session,

686
01:20:41,210 --> 01:20:48,740
we can right click on the plot and now copy and paste that as a picture so you can drop that in your PowerPoint or wherever you need it.

687
01:20:53,250 --> 01:20:58,680
That is a little bit risky business because we don't totally have control over the dimensions of everything.

688
01:20:59,430 --> 01:21:07,890
If we want to have greater control over the size of the dots per inch of color, we can use code to do it.

689
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:12,820
So we can use the juju safe. Function.

690
01:21:13,570 --> 01:21:19,240
Specify a file name and I'd say which plot object we want to actually save.

691
01:21:19,510 --> 01:21:24,380
So we specify which object and give it the file name. And where do you think that is going to?

692
01:21:24,410 --> 01:21:27,700
Where where is it going to show up if we set it to save?

693
01:21:33,670 --> 01:21:40,540
Should show up in our cloud projects that we're working on from class, but working on your personal computer,

694
01:21:40,550 --> 01:21:44,170
I'll show up on your personal computer as a project that you have specified.

695
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:46,540
Here I'm making a PDF.

696
01:21:46,570 --> 01:21:54,220
Alternatively, you can make a JPEG applying whatever file extension you want and the output I'll match whatever you tell it to be.

697
01:21:56,560 --> 01:22:00,580
So recap. We can make multi panel plots.

698
01:22:00,580 --> 01:22:08,020
We can assign plots as objects. We've unlocked a new object type today to go with our vectors and our data frames

699
01:22:08,980 --> 01:22:13,570
and we can make multiple panels of the same plot using the facet wrap function.

700
01:22:14,750 --> 01:22:19,750
And we can, if we want to stitch together diverse plot types to a multi panel plot,

701
01:22:19,750 --> 01:22:26,550
we need to arrange, answer, save and export plots from our we can use juju save right?

702
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:30,580
So these are the three main functions we're going to work through in this next section.

703
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:37,320
Any comments? Questions. Let's get into it.

704
01:22:38,330 --> 01:22:41,880
Let's jump back into our cloud.

705
01:22:43,350 --> 01:23:25,500
So I'm going to return to the graphing class. Okay.

706
01:23:26,250 --> 01:23:35,250
So we're going to work. For me, this is code around 400 and might be different for you, but this is a section about facet wrap.

707
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:37,210
All right.

708
01:23:39,450 --> 01:23:50,550
So in this case I'm making and you just want I see this that I'm supposed to iron on the x axis, my fill color sucks and I'm doing a histogram.

709
01:23:50,850 --> 01:23:55,800
And what's new about this section I pass that wrapping sucks and I want one column.

710
01:23:56,910 --> 01:24:00,910
So now we're getting these values stacked on top of each other, I guess.

711
01:24:00,910 --> 01:24:06,030
See, there's like a slight shift up here. So now category has slightly higher levels.

712
01:24:06,780 --> 01:24:11,219
What if instead of having these on top of each other, what if we wanted them side by side?

713
01:24:11,220 --> 01:24:15,030
How would we update those cards? Yeah.

714
01:24:15,030 --> 01:24:20,940
We can try and ro equal one or n call equals two.

715
01:24:22,710 --> 01:24:26,850
Neither one should do it. And we guess we got a slightly different configuration.

716
01:24:26,850 --> 01:24:30,630
So you can think about what's the best way for me to convey my information.

717
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:45,590
Similarly, we can do this by any other variable we want to go on and click on.

718
01:24:46,730 --> 01:24:52,130
So here I just did it by the educational, you know, you can do this swap in and out, whatever variables you're curious about.

719
01:24:57,310 --> 01:25:00,370
Let's do this activity of assigning plots as objects.

720
01:25:00,380 --> 01:25:06,670
So usually the before I here is like a quite complex plot.

721
01:25:06,670 --> 01:25:11,850
But this is. You may recognize this is code that came from above.

722
01:25:12,420 --> 01:25:15,230
So I was doing other ideas that are required.

723
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:23,090
Component is the enhanced status that my second required component is the esthetic mappings on the x axis of my age groups, the y axis at that level.

724
01:25:23,430 --> 01:25:31,889
And then the fill I have is age groups. And my third required element, I've got a geometry of a violin and then I have some bonus feature.

725
01:25:31,890 --> 01:25:38,640
So I'm adding jitter points on top of the violin. I'm taking my color palette and I'm adding some labels.

726
01:25:39,510 --> 01:25:45,059
So usually before I sign it, I make sure that this I highlight just that part and I make sure I run it and say,

727
01:25:45,060 --> 01:25:52,020
okay, this is my plot, this is what I want, and then I'm going to run this whole thing with the assignment.

728
01:25:52,020 --> 01:26:04,960
So let's look at the environment put. And I'm expecting once I run this line of code, I'm expecting an object to show up over here called Vile Plot.

729
01:26:05,620 --> 01:26:09,759
We'll see what happens. All right. So this showed up over here.

730
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:14,320
And what happens if we click on it? We see that there's all these components to it.

731
01:26:15,670 --> 01:26:18,970
And so the data set, the scales, the mapping.

732
01:26:19,660 --> 01:26:22,780
So all of these components of a plot are present in here.

733
01:26:25,780 --> 01:26:31,500
If we want, we can just make it so we can do it via Pluto.

734
01:26:32,510 --> 01:26:38,290
Our object and the soul run it. So if we just type that object, it'll make that.

735
01:26:38,890 --> 01:26:43,060
It'll show that object there. I'm going to assign this next line.

736
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:49,840
Let me. Just look at it first. Double check that this works.

737
01:26:49,850 --> 01:26:54,890
Okay, so this was a scatterplot we made above, and I'm assigned this as an object name called scatterplot,

738
01:26:55,340 --> 01:27:01,469
and I'm expecting this to show up in the environment. All right.

739
01:27:01,470 --> 01:27:06,660
So we've got the scatterplot showing up. We'll do the bar plot and we'll do the FAFSA plot.

740
01:27:06,900 --> 01:27:10,800
So we've got four plots present in our object.

741
01:27:10,810 --> 01:27:17,250
So now we're going to stick them together. So our Grinch is going to take all of this.

742
01:27:19,510 --> 01:27:24,070
Oh, and here's how I added that like A, B, C, and D, I did it with the letters labels.

743
01:27:28,650 --> 01:27:32,190
From stitching them all together. Here's panel. Here's panel.

744
01:27:32,190 --> 01:27:42,470
B, here's panel. See if there's panel de. So is this kind of a way of polishing it up when you're ready to share it with like a journal or something?

745
01:27:51,580 --> 01:27:58,650
So anybody have any questions about how we assign plots as objects and how we arrange them in a grid?

746
01:27:59,010 --> 01:28:03,870
What if we want to make it four columns and one row?

747
01:28:05,850 --> 01:28:09,990
They're going to all be stitched kind of side by side each other.

748
01:28:10,270 --> 01:28:14,310
You know, you can figure out what configuration is right for your scenario.

749
01:28:18,610 --> 01:28:23,410
Once you feel like you've got it right, you can take your compile and plots and assign that as an object.

750
01:28:25,430 --> 01:28:29,870
And now we're ready to save and export it. So I'm using the same function.

751
01:28:32,570 --> 01:28:35,990
And I'm going to save that compiled as a PDF.

752
01:28:37,130 --> 01:28:42,200
And you can say how many inches you want the width and height and everything to be.

753
01:28:42,980 --> 01:28:44,780
So you have greater control. So when I run that code,

754
01:28:44,780 --> 01:28:54,050
I got a compiled plot showing up as a PDF in my file folder and I see here this is like this nice big pdf of everything I saved.

755
01:28:58,300 --> 01:29:06,960
Another option. You can always like right click a copier or right click and save that image as.

756
01:29:07,570 --> 01:29:11,140
So these are kind of like the quick release if you want to share this with people.

757
01:29:13,100 --> 01:29:16,430
Here. I'm doing it as a slightly lower resolution with the ping file,

758
01:29:17,570 --> 01:29:25,670
so you'll be able to see that this shows up as a slightly different file size or slightly different file type.

759
01:29:27,050 --> 01:29:33,980
Looks very similar because once we make a plot, we want to make sure you can share it with everybody.

760
01:29:36,220 --> 01:29:39,880
What are our comments? What are our questions? What else are you curious about plotting?

761
01:29:39,910 --> 01:29:46,540
What else do you want to plot next? I can't wait to see what you all will do for your projects.

762
01:29:47,350 --> 01:29:50,470
All kinds of plots left and right with your data sets.

763
01:29:52,650 --> 01:29:57,390
Hopefully some ideas are percolating about what type of plot might be best for your scenario.

764
01:30:06,690 --> 01:30:11,310
All right. And that's this will wrap up the plotting section and we'll transition and talk about.

765
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:21,260
Hypothesis testing. Right.

766
01:30:21,830 --> 01:30:37,659
Go on. I think I can go on. So you may notice I'm doing this in order for six weeks.

767
01:30:37,660 --> 01:30:44,890
And this class, we haven't even generated a p value yet because usually I like to look at the distributions,

768
01:30:45,250 --> 01:30:48,969
make some plots before I'm generating a statistical test.

769
01:30:48,970 --> 01:30:51,730
I, I don't want the answer to be a surprise.

770
01:30:51,730 --> 01:30:57,910
I want to already have an idea of what we're going to observe based on all of these other techniques of looking at the data.

771
01:30:58,390 --> 01:31:02,200
And that also helps me have a deeper understanding of what the P value actually means,

772
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:05,440
because I have looked at all the relationships between all of these variables.

773
01:31:05,950 --> 01:31:08,679
So I kind of view this hypothesis testing as a pinnacle.

774
01:31:08,680 --> 01:31:15,940
This is like a trait we get to do once we've already done all of our data management and our data visualization are describing the data set.

775
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:24,130
So here we'll talk about some introductions. So hypothesis testing, hopefully this is familiar concepts from your file statistics courses.

776
01:31:24,430 --> 01:31:30,790
So first we'll do a lightning round where we'll try to understand independent versus

777
01:31:30,790 --> 01:31:36,430
dependent variables and we'll do one candidate hypothesis test the correlation test.

778
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:46,160
In the next module, we'll do different types of hypothesis tests. We'll practice the output for some of these tests and hour can be.

779
01:31:47,370 --> 01:31:53,290
A little intimidating, a little muddy at first. And we'll practice drawing meaning out of that.

780
01:31:53,800 --> 01:32:03,620
Out of that output. So the first thing we need to be on the same page with before we do a hypothesis test is this language about independent

781
01:32:03,620 --> 01:32:10,189
versus dependent variables and people in different fields might call it exposure and outcome might call it x variable,

782
01:32:10,190 --> 01:32:15,620
y variable. But can anybody help me out here? What's the difference between an independent and a dependent variable?

783
01:32:17,460 --> 01:32:29,380
Those familiar with those kind of terms. It's an independent versus a dependent.

784
01:32:31,330 --> 01:32:35,200
Please. Maybe the independent variable isn't quite here.

785
01:32:36,670 --> 01:32:45,579
Well, the independent variable. Yeah. The idea is the independent variable is like your risk factor, your exposure variable that you're testing.

786
01:32:45,580 --> 01:32:48,790
And then the dependent variable is the one you think might be affected by that.

787
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:53,380
So the dependent variable depends on the independent variable is the idea.

788
01:32:54,640 --> 01:32:59,950
Granted, we're not always doing like causality testing. I'll give you a caveat, but this is the idea that there.

789
01:33:00,610 --> 01:33:05,530
So the idea would be like your independent variable would be your x axis variable, your predictor variable,

790
01:33:05,890 --> 01:33:12,640
and then your dependent variable would be your outcome variable or your this would be your health status,

791
01:33:12,640 --> 01:33:18,940
your disease status kind of thing and public health examples. So a little bit more formalized.

792
01:33:19,960 --> 01:33:28,360
This might be your exposure, your risk factor. Other characteristic that you're measuring in your population and the dependent variable is what,

793
01:33:28,720 --> 01:33:34,360
what values you think are a function of that independent variable. So a kind of input output.

794
01:33:37,780 --> 01:33:48,010
As you might imagine, just like how we picked what plotting type, how we picked which descriptive variable like summary statistics to provide,

795
01:33:49,240 --> 01:33:54,120
how we pick a hypothesis also depends completely on the shape of the variable.

796
01:33:54,520 --> 01:33:56,170
So all of these things are building on each other.

797
01:33:56,800 --> 01:34:04,390
So we have to figure out is our independent which variables are independent, independent variable and what shape are they?

798
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:10,120
So in this first case, we're going to walk through both our independent, independent variable, our continuous variables.

799
01:34:10,690 --> 01:34:15,040
So here I gave an example of an independent variable might be age,

800
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:21,460
it's continuous and a dependent variable might be systolic blood pressure or this outcome that's also continuous.

801
01:34:21,700 --> 01:34:30,430
Can anybody else give me an example of two variables they might test in this case where they are both continuous?

802
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:35,100
And it doesn't have to be related to our data status that could be in your work.

803
01:34:38,790 --> 01:34:48,729
Trying to make it a little more concrete. To scan a sample of two continuous variables.

804
01:34:48,730 --> 01:35:00,660
So maybe looking at. It's kind of hard to come up with examples in class why these teachers always take the same example of age.

805
01:35:09,610 --> 01:35:15,219
It's another example of two continuous variables in processing place, light and weight.

806
01:35:15,220 --> 01:35:20,310
Are those two related? Yeah. Maybe.

807
01:35:21,930 --> 01:35:26,220
I don't know. Cholesterol and some kind of test score.

808
01:35:27,120 --> 01:35:32,490
You know, thinking about two things that are already continuous and we're looking at how those are related.

809
01:35:36,660 --> 01:35:46,350
We'll also go forward and test some of these other ones, including what if our independent variable now is no longer continuous?

810
01:35:46,380 --> 01:35:50,910
What if it's dichotomous meaning two categories and our outcome variable still continuous?

811
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:57,149
So here's an example I give us. Like the exposure might be, are you taking a drug, a pharmaceutical?

812
01:35:57,150 --> 01:36:01,760
Yes. Now, and the outcome might be blood oxygen levels. Can anybody think of another example there?

813
01:36:04,790 --> 01:36:08,490
Smoking status with for sure.

814
01:36:08,510 --> 01:36:11,629
So the independent variable might be smoking status.

815
01:36:11,630 --> 01:36:14,900
Yes. Now the outcome variable my coat needs status.

816
01:36:15,260 --> 01:36:24,379
What me levels. Excuse me, continue us. We got another one where our independent variable might be categorical smoking status could even pertain here.

817
01:36:24,380 --> 01:36:34,520
This might be if we're treating smoking status as a three level variable current former never and our variables cotinine level continuous.

818
01:36:35,240 --> 01:36:38,990
Your set occupational category and cognitive score maybe.

819
01:36:40,780 --> 01:36:44,980
We can also have situations where both are categorical. Can anybody think of one of those?

820
01:36:54,170 --> 01:36:59,700
Both are categorical. Yeah.

821
01:37:00,150 --> 01:37:02,730
Education, maybe. Simplicity.

822
01:37:03,570 --> 01:37:10,580
Yeah, maybe we have one of these as categories of educational attainment, and one of these is categories of race ethnicity.

823
01:37:10,590 --> 01:37:15,720
So we're talking about two categories, two categorical variables. And it doesn't matter how many categories are in each one.

824
01:37:17,530 --> 01:37:23,530
All right. So we found all of these situations. You can probably have more situations here, but we'll see that there are different.

825
01:37:24,500 --> 01:37:32,210
Hypothesis test that we can do. And they're all going to be based on the shapes of the variables of your specific situation.

826
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:35,330
So it's your job as the analyst to be able to tell, first of all,

827
01:37:35,570 --> 01:37:40,310
which variables your exposure or which variables your outcome, and what are the shape of each of those.

828
01:37:40,910 --> 01:37:50,240
And we'll talk through the choices there. The second thing we have to choose is, is it applicable to do a parametric or non parametric test?

829
01:37:50,720 --> 01:37:56,570
Can anybody help me? Help remind me, what's the difference between a parametric and a non parametric test?

830
01:37:56,580 --> 01:38:10,460
This is familiar from your biostatistics class. If you're doing an entire semester worldwide in about 10 minutes.

831
01:38:14,290 --> 01:38:17,720
Remember that we measured the perimeters.

832
01:38:18,670 --> 01:38:25,149
Yeah. So this is saying parametric tests are saying that we're making some assumption about

833
01:38:25,150 --> 01:38:29,380
the parameters or some assumption about the distribution of the underlying data.

834
01:38:30,640 --> 01:38:37,900
Non parametric tests are making those same assumptions. And so whether those assumptions hold is another factor.

835
01:38:39,490 --> 01:38:44,050
So parametric is the test that's making some kind of assumption about the distribution.

836
01:38:45,280 --> 01:38:48,280
Not parametric. We're not making those assumptions.

837
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:52,140
So how do we check if those assumptions apply?

838
01:38:52,150 --> 01:39:00,070
Some of these as checking are things normally distributed, which we've just seen we can make with plotting some of these?

839
01:39:00,460 --> 01:39:06,640
So what would you say here with this first one? Would you say that this is meeting our normal, normal distribution assumption?

840
01:39:07,510 --> 01:39:12,100
Yeah, this one, this red blood cell count looks pretty normal. What about this blood blood level?

841
01:39:12,830 --> 01:39:17,170
I mean, look normal. Now, this one's a pretty right skew, and you'll notice that.

842
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:20,110
So these are usually kind of like judgment calls.

843
01:39:20,230 --> 01:39:25,510
So this one's, like, pretty clear to me, but there might be other situations that are more on the line.

844
01:39:27,730 --> 01:39:33,910
So you can either in this situation where it's not normal, we can run a non parametric test, no problem.

845
01:39:34,630 --> 01:39:40,020
But if we want we could log transform it and see if check to see if it matches the function.

846
01:39:40,030 --> 01:39:44,110
So you may have seen a lot of those plateaus in log distribution of some of these things.

847
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:47,680
And I'm big reason why I would do this is to give it a more normal shape.

848
01:39:48,280 --> 01:39:54,100
So this looks like this one's pretty normal. So I could go forward with a parametric test on the log distribution there.

849
01:39:54,430 --> 01:40:01,540
So you've got two options. If it's you'd like this, you could proceed with a non parametric test or transform it and then go with the parametric test.

850
01:40:02,170 --> 01:40:05,770
Again, a lot of decisions for you to make as the analyst.

851
01:40:06,550 --> 01:40:13,770
Both. Both are totally fine. So now we're adding another component to this table.

852
01:40:14,040 --> 01:40:19,769
So these first two columns were present last time. So this was an example of two continuous variables.

853
01:40:19,770 --> 01:40:22,170
I think we talked about age and systolic blood pressure.

854
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:30,870
The parametric approach would be a Pearson correlation test and a non parametric approach would be Spearman very similar,

855
01:40:31,470 --> 01:40:36,510
but we're going to use different tests if we're meeting those assumptions or not.

856
01:40:38,570 --> 01:40:44,809
If we've got that dichotomous versus continuous smoking, yes or no versus codeine level.

857
01:40:44,810 --> 01:40:52,850
If it's parametric, we can do a t test with non parametric and we can do it ranks on two us three categories continuous.

858
01:40:52,850 --> 01:40:55,429
We can do a nova, otherwise we can do a Crisco.

859
01:40:55,430 --> 01:41:04,220
Wallis and categorical, categorical we can do chi squared if it's parametric and Fisher If it's not parametric.

860
01:41:04,610 --> 01:41:08,860
For me, this is not a biostatistics class. You don't have to memorize this like I pull.

861
01:41:08,940 --> 01:41:12,660
I made this here, but I pull this from the internet all the time. You can like this.

862
01:41:12,680 --> 01:41:16,850
There's like tons of these grids on the Internet and some of them have many more rows as well.

863
01:41:16,850 --> 01:41:20,930
There's like more scenarios, right, you could imagine that exist for we'll walk through these.

864
01:41:21,980 --> 01:41:29,750
So it's your job as the analyst to be able to figure out which variable is which, which ones, the exposure, which the outcome.

865
01:41:30,650 --> 01:41:34,670
That's your first choice. Second choice is what is the shape of each of these?

866
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:39,630
And then third choices do parametric or non parametric things hold.

867
01:41:40,530 --> 01:41:43,680
Okay. So in the homework assignment for this week, I'll have you go through that process.

868
01:41:43,710 --> 01:41:45,210
I'm not going to tell you which tests are on.

869
01:41:45,510 --> 01:41:50,610
You've got to work through and see which test is most applicable, and then we'll run the art script for it.

870
01:41:52,260 --> 01:41:56,100
So first in this first module, we're just talking about continuous, continuous.

871
01:41:56,850 --> 01:42:08,310
And so we've got a function called core dot test or specify the ion variable in this case as the exposure.

872
01:42:09,030 --> 01:42:15,240
What's this dollar sign here mean? Was this I mean. If you have a very variable.

873
01:42:16,170 --> 01:42:18,540
Yes, I'm saying within that enhanced dataset.

874
01:42:19,380 --> 01:42:25,590
Run the test just on the iron variable and then after the time specifying the second variable, that's also continuous.

875
01:42:25,590 --> 01:42:30,990
So within the enhanced dataset, run the test on the I think this is the red blood cell count variable,

876
01:42:31,410 --> 01:42:35,880
close it out and the default setting will do the Pearson correlation coefficient, which is the parametric one.

877
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:42,960
So the null hypothesis is that the correlation is equal to zero and the alternative is that it's not equal to zero.

878
01:42:44,580 --> 01:42:52,320
So here's what we get for the output. And as I said, the output is a little intimidating at first, but we'll practice talking ourselves through it.

879
01:42:52,810 --> 01:43:00,230
Okay, so this is the output at the top. And we'll start to notice hopefully start to notice some patterns.

880
01:43:00,920 --> 01:43:06,200
So what our tells us first at the top is as a reminder, here's the test you did.

881
01:43:06,920 --> 01:43:09,920
So it's telling us we did a Pearson's test. This is a good logic check.

882
01:43:09,950 --> 01:43:14,980
Okay. I wanted to run the Pearson test to actually run the Pearson test. That is going to tell us what dataset it ran.

883
01:43:15,680 --> 01:43:20,340
So I ran on the enhanced iron dataset and the enhanced red blood cell dataset.

884
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:26,089
Okay, perfect. That's what I wanted it to run. So in the first two rows, we haven't gotten into any results yet.

885
01:43:26,090 --> 01:43:38,239
It's just double checking, letting you know what it did. The next is the T statistic so you could look this value up in the back cover of your

886
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:44,180
biostatistics textbook and see what p value it corresponds to based on the degrees of freedom,

887
01:43:44,720 --> 01:43:48,680
which is a relationship of your sample size and the number of variables are testing.

888
01:43:49,250 --> 01:43:54,230
But essentially we end up with this very small p value and this looks a little intimidating as well.

889
01:43:54,260 --> 01:43:58,460
What how do we interpret this? What is this wild notation here?

890
01:44:00,580 --> 01:44:04,899
Very, very small. It's a very, very small number. We know because it's saying the p value.

891
01:44:04,900 --> 01:44:07,210
It's not even saying the P value is equal to something,

892
01:44:07,570 --> 01:44:14,130
saying the P value is smaller than something and we kind of gave up, but it's smaller than something here.

893
01:44:14,140 --> 01:44:19,870
So what this e stands for is ten to the something power.

894
01:44:20,290 --> 01:44:27,880
So this is saying our p value is smaller than 2.2 times ten to the -16.

895
01:44:29,200 --> 01:44:34,480
So we're going to move, take those 2.2 and move this decimal point, 16 places to the left.

896
01:44:36,030 --> 01:44:41,219
Okay. So the p value is actually like 0.0000 are all the way out.

897
01:44:41,220 --> 01:44:48,280
2.22. How would you interpret that p value?

898
01:44:48,340 --> 01:44:52,480
Would you say? Yeah, we would reject the null in that case.

899
01:44:52,780 --> 01:44:57,220
We also have a little bit more information in this output. Next, I usually go all the way down to the bottom.

900
01:44:58,360 --> 01:45:01,510
And we got a core value of 0.14. What do you think that is?

901
01:45:03,330 --> 01:45:10,830
We've got a correlation coefficient. So it's a thing. The correlation coefficient is .14 and I put some information at the bottom.

902
01:45:10,830 --> 01:45:16,500
I pulled this plot from the internet. So if that the null hypothesis is that the correlation is zero.

903
01:45:17,220 --> 01:45:20,220
So that would be this case. That's just a random scatter.

904
01:45:20,940 --> 01:45:26,489
If there was a perfect positive correlation, that value is one, it would look like this.

905
01:45:26,490 --> 01:45:34,200
And if it was perfect negative, this would be a value of negative one. So this value could range from -1 to 1 and then now being zero.

906
01:45:34,380 --> 01:45:39,530
So how would you describe this correlation? Positive.

907
01:45:39,950 --> 01:45:43,550
I agree with you, too. It's kind of a slight positive. But somewhere in between these two.

908
01:45:43,850 --> 01:45:49,910
A little bit closer to this one by here. So we have a significant correlation, but the magnitude of it is pretty small.

909
01:45:50,630 --> 01:45:55,220
And now we've got this 95% confidence interval, which is how much spread is along this.

910
01:45:56,030 --> 01:46:00,589
So we see that the lower confidence interval is slightly smaller than the upper confidence interval,

911
01:46:00,590 --> 01:46:05,720
slightly bigger than this, and this falls right between the two. And do either of these cross zero?

912
01:46:07,220 --> 01:46:09,260
Now. Is that consistent with the p value?

913
01:46:09,980 --> 01:46:15,230
Yeah, because the p value and the confidence interval are both telling us that they don't cross zero, they don't trust the null.

914
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:20,840
Right. So this was kind of an intimidating output, but we can talk ourselves through it and interpreting it.

915
01:46:22,660 --> 01:46:27,129
So we can look at the magnitude of the association with the correlation coefficient and we

916
01:46:27,130 --> 01:46:32,470
can look at the level of significance either with a confidence interval or with a p value.

917
01:46:32,620 --> 01:46:36,849
You've got two options for describing that a little bit about preference,

918
01:46:36,850 --> 01:46:49,120
about how you like to communicate that if we want to specify method equals spearman because the parametric assumptions don't hold,

919
01:46:49,780 --> 01:46:52,509
we can do that after a comma. So we say method equals spearman.

920
01:46:52,510 --> 01:46:57,879
Now instead of doing Pearson correlation, it's doing spearman correlation and we can talk ourselves through it.

921
01:46:57,880 --> 01:47:02,050
So up at the top it reminds us, What test are you doing here we're doing?

922
01:47:02,050 --> 01:47:08,650
Spearman Then the second thing that reminds us what variables are we doing on here, on pain status, I think I'm doing alright.

923
01:47:09,040 --> 01:47:12,850
And the enhanced dataset I'm doing lab, which was that really skewing variable.

924
01:47:13,890 --> 01:47:18,060
Okay. Now what do we see? What else do you see in the output? Do you see any magnitude?

925
01:47:18,060 --> 01:47:24,210
Anywhere. I do think the magnitude might be higher.

926
01:47:25,050 --> 01:47:28,460
Yeah. All right. Joe Roe is the correlation coefficient for Spearman.

927
01:47:28,470 --> 01:47:33,190
So it's a it's a value and it's it's just labeled a little bit differently forever.

928
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:37,920
Yeah. So our magnitude is here. So a magnitude 2.56.

929
01:47:38,130 --> 01:47:43,330
How would you characterize that? That positive, -0.

930
01:47:45,160 --> 01:47:48,790
As a passive one, I would characterize that as a pretty strong correlation.

931
01:47:49,750 --> 01:47:52,870
Is that consistent with what we saw in our plots when we were plotting it?

932
01:47:52,900 --> 01:47:55,740
Yeah, we saw agent led. We're related. Okay.

933
01:47:55,780 --> 01:48:03,370
So I'm logic checking out, making sure things make sense with all of the other explorations of the data set, and then we can get those p value.

934
01:48:03,370 --> 01:48:08,480
So can I. You want to remind me, what does this p value mean? And numbers.

935
01:48:11,410 --> 01:48:16,150
Yes. P-value is less than 2.2 times ten to the -16.

936
01:48:16,840 --> 01:48:23,260
So again, we would reject the null hypothesis. In this case, this correlation coefficient does not equal to zero.

937
01:48:23,500 --> 01:48:26,829
What's missing relative to the parametric test?

938
01:48:26,830 --> 01:48:30,729
The Pearson one? We do. We don't have a confidence interval and that's normal.

939
01:48:30,730 --> 01:48:35,440
So you've got a little that's a kind of a tradeoff. You get a little less information when you do a non parametric test.

940
01:48:35,440 --> 01:48:49,840
So we don't calculate a confidence interval in this case. So when we're doing hypothesis testing, we're going to use these basic four types of steps.

941
01:48:50,140 --> 01:48:54,520
So first, we're going to figure out what's our independent kind of variables based on your research question.

942
01:48:55,980 --> 01:49:00,180
Next year, you figure out what's the shape of the categorical numeric, how many categories?

943
01:49:01,050 --> 01:49:07,050
When you're going to test to see if you meet your parametric assumptions, and then you can use that table to select a test.

944
01:49:07,050 --> 01:49:10,020
And we've done our function for each of those tests.

945
01:49:10,020 --> 01:49:16,589
Or sometimes as here with core test, it was changing an option within the test to toggle between parametric non parametric.

946
01:49:16,590 --> 01:49:19,830
Sometimes there's different functions between parametric and non parametric.

947
01:49:21,540 --> 01:49:25,710
So when we start next class, we'll do coding for hypothesis testing.

948
01:49:25,920 --> 01:49:31,930
Thanks everyone for your attention and I hope you have a great week. He.
