1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:11,280
I think we'll go ahead and get started. So good morning.

2
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:22,920
Few things. I did put out an announcement for the certificate in public health genetics.

3
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,389
I hope you are interested.

4
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:35,580
But so this is this is a certificate offered by the school public health and it's

5
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:43,020
available for graduate students and complete set of courses that basically gets tax free.

6
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:51,780
Dr. Jennifer Smith, the student director, is going to have a session to kind of talk about it.

7
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:59,820
So it's on Zoom if you're interested. The link is is put in the announcement for you to sign on.

8
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,790
It's today for me.

9
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:21,450
Any question about that? But even that, I think I'm still missing about ten people who said you can't complete that integrity pledge.

10
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:26,730
So if you just added the class or I'm not sure we're talking about.

11
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:32,710
So it's on it's on the home page. Go to the integrity affidavit here and just complete that.

12
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:43,680
So one question, how much about I'm not talking about the course material to other students outside of class.

13
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:49,890
So, yes, please go ahead and do it, I think has a due date like maybe sometime next week.

14
00:01:49,890 --> 00:02:02,310
So if you haven't done that, go on to let me know what you think of everyone every time we want to complete the class survey form.

15
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:10,260
But if you advertise great or if not again, then you can access that with the home page.

16
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:19,330
Now that's any any questions about. Okay.

17
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:30,730
So for today, you were supposed to watch some lectures on the overview of the human genome, an overview of your patients,

18
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:37,690
and you should be somewhat that you already know how, how hard or how,

19
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,800
how many of you think it was like just the revision and you all know what's going on.

20
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:49,870
Now this does anyone have any questions about those?

21
00:02:52,120 --> 00:03:01,659
And I go through them. And then if you remember something like that, I know you heard that wasn't clear and stuff.

22
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:05,400
I mean. Yeah.

23
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:09,900
I actually did have a question kind of on the Southern block.

24
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:18,200
Yeah. So you're looking at the balance of the size of the bend within like the two base pairs of these things.

25
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,130
This one is wider than the other. We're looking at like two samples.

26
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,400
That doesn't matter, right? What do you mean, doesn't matter?

27
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,400
It was just like, this. Is it here? This one.

28
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:39,720
Anything? Yeah. Yeah.

29
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:45,200
So you're talking this? Yeah. Yeah. I go to the slide prior to my.

30
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:51,570
Yeah, yeah. Because they're looking down at the two sides.

31
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:55,740
One of the bands there. One. One. Yeah.

32
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:59,970
Bigger than we do. Yeah. Matter. Any significance?

33
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:08,160
I think so. It basically means that there are two, two repeats kind of fragments.

34
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,150
Like this person doesn't have any, so they're kind of overlapping.

35
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,510
So I guess you can assume that. Yeah, it's slightly bigger.

36
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:22,380
It is that overlap. Maybe 2 to 1 to each.

37
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,590
Question about that or should I go from the beginning and see if you.

38
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:38,940
You can think of any question. Okay.

39
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:57,310
So. So basic structure of the human genome could extend the.

40
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:05,220
College. It has a C, T and G bases that make up the human genome.

41
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:11,700
So it has any findings t c binding to make the double helix.

42
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:18,540
And then some of those are basically just condensed DNA.

43
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:27,570
It's just so you have the DNA wrapped around the histones proteins and kind of compacted inside the nucleus.

44
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,719
This figure here shows the replicated chromosome, which is not typical.

45
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:39,930
It's not that's not how it typically existing replicate before meiosis for mitosis, before division.

46
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:51,630
But technically you could have a basically a single copy of this one coming from your mom and dad.

47
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:56,970
This idea only of chromosomes.

48
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:04,560
So depending how it's decorated the anti regions and later in the same gene.

49
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:13,260
So remember get 23 chromosomes from each parent.

50
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:20,910
22 autism's and then one sex chromosome. And in normal type would have 46 chromosomes.

51
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:28,140
So that's how the chromatin is folded inside the nucleus.

52
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,070
You come at it and it's when it's not very condensed.

53
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:40,950
Those regions are actually transcribed often gene rich when it's kind of compacted and kind of like looped and folded,

54
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:47,190
then these are kind of elements that are they don't have a lot of genes or coding regions.

55
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:56,760
Just this nomenclature about how we refer to regions on the on the on the chromosomes.

56
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:03,150
You know, you just you should just be familiar with them at the time.

57
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:10,680
Really. We're not just test you about those structural abnormalities.

58
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:16,620
You could have extra or missing genetic material,

59
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:23,729
but within within having like the normal number of chromosomes or you can have numerical abnormalities.

60
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:28,170
So that's what you have an extra chromosome. We're missing a whole chromosome.

61
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:36,030
These are changes in the chromosome structure. So the extra or missing genetic material.

62
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:46,670
Just how we name those abnormalities.

63
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:52,049
And again, these are, you know, maladies.

64
00:07:52,050 --> 00:08:02,480
So when you have a whole set of a whole chromosome missing or a whole host of extra questions about that left,

65
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:13,250
you know, okay, the human genome, about 2.2 billion pieces.

66
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:20,120
The variation between people is very small. So 99.9 is exactly the same.

67
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:32,390
It's just how the genome is this kind of brain switching, gene dense regions in sheep or desert.

68
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:39,610
The central dogma should be through some of your DNA transcribed into Mani.

69
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:49,239
Then as an assistant, as it is transported from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, you have to call it a tail.

70
00:08:49,240 --> 00:09:01,620
So the sale of a base is added to protect it, and then the mani is translated by the ribosome machinery to produce proteins,

71
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:12,700
and then you have some sort of processing for those proteins folding and other processing steps.

72
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:21,490
And this is kind of important to know that, but only about 2% of the human genomes actually coding majority,

73
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:28,390
but the vast majority is not repetitive elements in the DNA.

74
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:33,700
Some sequences in the DNA are just repetitive.

75
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:47,529
They could be coming from old viral genetic material or just repetitive sequences that are often found at the centromere.

76
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:57,670
So that's kind of the middle of the chromosome, where then the telomere reaches the top end parts of the chromosomes,

77
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:04,570
and these repeats can be useful in identifying kind of unique people.

78
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:12,180
So it's a unique DNA fingerprint. That's the southern gloves are.

79
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:23,560
So. Any question about this one or should?

80
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:42,670
So we basically kind of. Use the Southern blot to identify how big of a repeat you have and that can be used to identify a person.

81
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,549
I think this example is pretty helpful.

82
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:56,620
Like if you have kind of a suspect sperm DNA, then you want your child to match, whether it matches with the suspect one to or the boyfriend.

83
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:03,550
So the overlap is very clearly with suspect one.

84
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:16,510
Then. And those are the 13 factors that could be used to identify a unique DNA fingerprint.

85
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:23,650
Any questions? Okay.

86
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:33,250
So in John's, Exxon's. We've got three other ones.

87
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:55,290
So these are changes in the DNA sequence.

88
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:02,550
They can happen in in the somatic cells or during the development of gametes.

89
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:11,340
They could be just a single based nucleotide substitution, more than one single base.

90
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:19,720
Insertions. Deletions could be changes in the number of tandem repeats or could be splice that variation.

91
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,740
So the way the protein is made is different.

92
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:35,100
Just because you're kind of taken out maybe an egg zone or it's or just variation in how the final proteins meet.

93
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:45,920
It's just the code on. So the types of mutations, so it makes sense.

94
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:53,750
That's when you would have a whole amino acid change based on a single base change.

95
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:59,000
So you're now coding for a different amino acid. Nonsense is when you have a stop coding.

96
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,130
These are more you can have more dramatic effects on the on the protein.

97
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:07,819
So that mutation, although you have a single base change,

98
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:13,010
but you do end up with the same amino acid and then frame shift is when you have

99
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:18,680
more than when you have insertions or deletions that are not multiples of three.

100
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:25,860
So the whole code is shifted and it's also it also has a more dramatic effect on the protein and functional.

101
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:35,410
King. And then see so these.

102
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:46,750
They could be in the coding regions or noncoding regions and they can affect how much of the protein is made or change the structure of the protein.

103
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,660
This is the example and the cystic fibrosis gene.

104
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:03,220
Any question about this. Like it was explained pretty well in that recorded lecture.

105
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:13,040
Okay. These are. Kind of fragile.

106
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:23,720
Huntington's disease and other conditions that are related to kind of repeats that are

107
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:33,770
kind of expand with generations how we think mutations can happen with the last one.

108
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:45,830
So you become like with Fragile X, like you become a carrier like or like do you need another carrier to like pass on that to the child?

109
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:50,760
So we need another carrier to pass along the channel.

110
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:57,870
I guess it depends. It's like it depends on a female or male, for example, for fragile x.

111
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,650
I'm not really sure exactly.

112
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:08,160
Like how like if it's like you're talking like kind of such a dominant like how many didn't have both copy affected or not?

113
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:12,030
I think I'll have to look into that.

114
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:22,080
But like for Fragile X, it depends on whether it's like defective copies, like from the mom or dad.

115
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:28,900
And then so usually typically have have 50 repeats.

116
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:35,870
That's normal and that's kind of stable. And then if you have more, that's when you're kind of a carrier in it.

117
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:46,230
Once it's inherited that, that's when it's more susceptible to kind of expanding and causing the actual, actual condition.

118
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:54,930
Probably if you if you're if you're male, then that that that's when you are more affected, especially for fragile X.

119
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:03,090
Any questions about that? Since.

120
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:14,560
So causes of mutation repair mechanisms that can help fix any errors.

121
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:25,820
So another way we were going when a mistake was made.

122
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:35,760
Methylation is like a kind of a signature that's added after the DNA is copied and the cell is able to note that this is oh, this is like that.

123
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:39,049
There is a parent strand.

124
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:43,250
This is the new one because it doesn't have the methylation signature on it yet.

125
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,390
That's so it happens to just the red strand and not to the parents and.

126
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:55,960
Yeah. So no question. Yeah.

127
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:02,990
So, yeah. About the last slide. Yeah. So it says it recognizes one, but others don't as it is not methylated.

128
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:11,280
Yeah. So after repairing it, does what like does the mismatch repair system.

129
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:14,710
Methyl eight. That new strand or. Yeah.

130
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:19,150
Yeah. Not probably not the mismatch repair. Probably something like a methylation mechanism.

131
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:24,070
So like something else. Yeah. Yeah. So. So methylation.

132
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:32,410
So methylation are those kind of methyl groups that are added to, to the bases and that that usually happen,

133
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:37,020
that usually they're used to kind of turn genes on or on or off.

134
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:44,409
So this is related to epigenetics and DNA methylation and then those marks are inherited.

135
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:51,010
So once the DNA is copy, whatever methylation marks are on the original or the parent DNA,

136
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:57,190
they're copied to the to the daughter DNA or the replicated DNA.

137
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:06,910
So here the the mechanism is able to know that this one still doesn't have the methylation pattern on it.

138
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:10,389
So that's the new one. I'm going to repair that.

139
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:18,160
And then and then the full methylation of DNA and then those methylation marks are added again.

140
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:25,280
Clear? Kind of. Since.

141
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:49,809
Okay. So today we had to get the readings and the ENCODE project and I was thinking we could maybe split into groups, maybe groups of three.

142
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:57,280
It doesn't have to be a group because I know we're assigning groups for the for the problem sets, but maybe now she can get into groups.

143
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:00,950
Kind of talk about the paper with us.

144
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:08,590
There's a set of questions I posted on canvas, so try to think up answers to those.

145
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:17,800
Do you need help? As I'm saying, the groups are mostly rich.

146
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:25,870
Yeah. Okay, here's the question.

147
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:34,810
They should be on campus, so why not?

148
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:43,043
Who's going to go in there?

149
00:19:43,137 --> 00:19:50,477
And I was like, that would be all done in extra time.

150
00:19:50,547 --> 00:19:55,077
Know, I think it's like, you know, it's like she's, she's.

151
00:19:58,517 --> 00:19:58,797
Okay.

152
00:19:58,967 --> 00:20:15,647
So were there any questions about the meeting itself or McLachlan questions or maybe the try to answer the questions that we had posted together?

153
00:20:17,567 --> 00:20:31,667
So tell me like what do you think was the overall goal of the project was to discover how the regulatory process for the gene,

154
00:20:31,667 --> 00:20:43,396
how it influences the gene methylation transcription and how the non-coding gene have been dismissed by whatever

155
00:20:43,397 --> 00:20:47,866
liquid medical you may just have ignored that I'm quoting here and they were focus of the court in case in

156
00:20:47,867 --> 00:20:53,907
their relations with seizes with a great degree was based on the studies and how they relate traits with certain

157
00:20:53,907 --> 00:21:01,907
key expression is actually work was it diseases or the traits occurred or expressed by the non-coding genes.

158
00:21:02,867 --> 00:21:13,097
Yeah. So, so yeah. So the encode was the main goal was to kind of characterize those non-coding regions of the DNA.

159
00:21:13,487 --> 00:21:22,766
So try to understand all those functional elements that that are especially like so do do us studies or genetic

160
00:21:22,767 --> 00:21:31,577
quite association studies over the last 15 years looking at different phenotypes or different outcomes,

161
00:21:31,577 --> 00:21:36,527
different diseases, we found out that most of the hits, most of the significant,

162
00:21:36,977 --> 00:21:43,067
significant locations that we're getting are actually to not map back to a coding region of the genome.

163
00:21:43,067 --> 00:21:45,287
So they're mapping back to an ethnically region.

164
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:55,247
And that kind of pushed the whole idea of, well, what's going on in that 98% of the DNA that doesn't really code for genes.

165
00:21:55,247 --> 00:22:00,286
So what does it do? So that's the idea of the and pilot project.

166
00:22:00,287 --> 00:22:03,867
So try to understand the regulatory kind of.

167
00:22:07,757 --> 00:22:13,547
Any function that affects gene expression, the amount of gene expressed and all that.

168
00:22:13,547 --> 00:22:17,387
So. So that's basically it. Yeah.

169
00:22:19,247 --> 00:22:22,607
So we kind of touch upon that.

170
00:22:22,617 --> 00:22:28,547
So what do you think are some of the important things we learned from this project about the non-coding regions?

171
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:45,837
Should. It's like you've talked about how we thought it was interesting that a lot of the diseases that we had

172
00:22:45,837 --> 00:22:52,077
previously identified as being genetic or having a strong genetic component were located really close or,

173
00:22:52,527 --> 00:23:00,507
you know, really, really close to these non-coding areas that could have to do with the way and predicting how they're inherited address them.

174
00:23:02,607 --> 00:23:10,967
So yeah, so basically so if we're looking at the genome, it's not enough to just look at the coding regions.

175
00:23:10,967 --> 00:23:19,016
So that would be tell us the whole story. There's a lot of lot of things going on in the non-coding regions that really

176
00:23:19,017 --> 00:23:25,287
affect how think the disease or the outcome of interest or your phenotype.

177
00:23:25,287 --> 00:23:33,447
So so what are the DNA one hypersensitive sites and why are they important?

178
00:23:38,947 --> 00:23:41,707
Yeah. So according to the article,

179
00:23:42,097 --> 00:23:52,867
the bishops are the genomic regions are accessible by the summary cleavage and it's important is the hallmark of the cell type specific enhancers.

180
00:23:53,497 --> 00:23:56,707
Yeah. So these are hyper sensitive sites.

181
00:23:57,067 --> 00:24:05,057
So, so using NSA that has a DNA is an enzyme that will break down the DNA.

182
00:24:06,007 --> 00:24:11,617
We can we're able to tell which regions of the DNA are accessible and open to that enzyme.

183
00:24:12,007 --> 00:24:21,757
And we decide is that these regions, since they are open and open for the chance for transcription, then these are important.

184
00:24:22,057 --> 00:24:31,717
These are regions that are actively expressed and these regions are more likely to be in promoter regions or enhancer regions.

185
00:24:31,727 --> 00:24:34,987
So. So they're they have important regulatory function.

186
00:24:36,697 --> 00:24:46,607
Yeah. Except that we're. So so these have to do with, like, the folding of the DNA.

187
00:24:46,617 --> 00:24:52,047
So it's like. So they would be in regions where the DNA is not, like, folded or wrapped.

188
00:24:52,047 --> 00:25:01,407
They're open. Open regions of the DNA. So what do confidence structure and histones have to do with gene expression?

189
00:25:12,147 --> 00:25:18,897
So we talked about noncoding regions, so that specific variation of the DNA sequence in cells.

190
00:25:18,897 --> 00:25:24,147
But what else kind of plays a role in gene expression?

191
00:25:25,197 --> 00:25:32,516
Yeah. This is kind of like the chromatin and heterochromatin where when they're highly condensed,

192
00:25:32,517 --> 00:25:39,597
it's less likely that they're expressing genes or going through like creating proteins that way.

193
00:25:39,927 --> 00:25:45,897
But if they're open, they're more likely to be able to undergo, like, protein creation and Gene's gene expression.

194
00:25:46,017 --> 00:25:54,117
Yeah, exactly. So this is another way that with which you kind of have variation related to the genome,

195
00:25:55,137 --> 00:26:04,917
which is related to just how accessible the DNA is, how tightly wrapped it is and folded, and how open it is for transcription.

196
00:26:06,207 --> 00:26:08,307
Those histones can have markers,

197
00:26:08,307 --> 00:26:20,757
they're called histone markers that kind of would enable the DNA to be tightly packed or open and affect just overall how accessible it is.

198
00:26:23,817 --> 00:26:27,747
So what do the authors mean when they say these binding force?

199
00:26:28,617 --> 00:26:33,567
I you think of the definition of a gene and of the minimum unit of humidity.

200
00:26:37,117 --> 00:26:47,047
I guess that based on previous articles of this regard, they consider that according to Jesus Jesus, and they have no fear whatsoever.

201
00:26:47,347 --> 00:26:54,517
So the ENCODE project have redefined those encoding genes and how they can be so functional in so many ways.

202
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:57,977
We haven't looked at or received before.

203
00:26:58,897 --> 00:27:02,317
So they are actually functional genes. They are not just the genes.

204
00:27:02,317 --> 00:27:06,997
Anyone. Yeah, they make more than 90% of the human genome.

205
00:27:07,237 --> 00:27:09,427
Yeah. Yeah. So, so yeah.

206
00:27:10,687 --> 00:27:22,387
So it kind of forces the rethink that just this gene or that coding region of the DNA is what really cool or affects what your outcome is.

207
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:29,167
Kind of forcing us to look at the non-coding regions, regulatory functions,

208
00:27:29,497 --> 00:27:37,747
anything that would affect gene expression and even variation in the end trials which we thought are just spliced out when the protein is made.

209
00:27:38,047 --> 00:27:46,117
These are also things that we now know can play a role in and in some conditions.

210
00:27:48,337 --> 00:27:53,257
So what are the implications for disease research in general?

211
00:27:54,357 --> 00:28:01,657
Yeah, we talked about how these projects have identified so many variants, mutations with those diseases.

212
00:28:02,237 --> 00:28:12,877
But so there are associations and that causality is so hard to understand, like how much is associated to that.

213
00:28:13,267 --> 00:28:19,807
And then especially cancer in the non-coding regions, like under single function of that from the start.

214
00:28:20,197 --> 00:28:23,317
So that's one indication that I suppose. Yeah. Yeah.

215
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:28,747
That's that's that's exactly true. So so yeah.

216
00:28:28,777 --> 00:28:32,606
You kind of touch upon findings from genetic associations.

217
00:28:32,607 --> 00:28:40,977
Studies are basically just association. And other than that, then a lot of the heads are actually in non-coding regions.

218
00:28:40,987 --> 00:28:45,307
We still have an issue of is that really the causal snap or is that really the

219
00:28:45,697 --> 00:28:50,077
the variant that's causing the disease or is it something associated with it?

220
00:28:50,077 --> 00:28:55,656
Or is it just having and is this just an interim order that's kind of affecting the function of something else?

221
00:28:55,657 --> 00:29:05,767
So. So it kind of also forces us to dig deeper into not just heads but regulatory function

222
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:15,577
supplement with looking into the kind of regulatory functions and things like that.

223
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:22,837
Anything else? Something else. Even 17 at.

224
00:29:25,287 --> 00:29:32,997
Does anyone do any research related to this they think can have some implications in your.

225
00:29:35,347 --> 00:29:46,287
Your study and your research. Yeah, I guess I do a little bit of work with like epigenetics and stuff and so like a lot of it is like CPG sites.

226
00:29:46,287 --> 00:29:55,426
So just like knowing this like and understanding that this is like the direction, especially with like age acceleration and stuff,

227
00:29:55,427 --> 00:30:01,607
but it's not just in most concentrated sites, but it can be a lot of not like regions as well.

228
00:30:01,787 --> 00:30:13,187
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, um, so yeah, this, this related epigenome mechanisms that regulate whether the genes are expressed or not.

229
00:30:16,687 --> 00:30:24,167
Anyone else. Okay.

230
00:30:28,007 --> 00:30:41,777
So I feel like the slides, the slides we have next are no the same for the same things, not including DNA.

231
00:30:52,847 --> 00:30:59,237
So I'm not completely over those because we won't be touching you most of the ideas.

232
00:31:02,787 --> 00:31:10,677
So this is trying to address the whole concept of the 98% of the DNA being noncoding or junk DNA.

233
00:31:14,117 --> 00:31:18,397
So. So again,

234
00:31:18,397 --> 00:31:31,686
what pushed this forward was the whole idea that association studies are reporting signs that are actually not located in gene coding regions,

235
00:31:31,687 --> 00:31:41,837
and we are interested in knowing how this influenced gene expression and how these influence diseases or whatever we're looking at.

236
00:31:44,107 --> 00:31:53,016
So transcriptional regulation seems to be just a kind of refresher.

237
00:31:53,017 --> 00:31:57,327
So promoter is where transcription starts.

238
00:31:57,337 --> 00:32:05,407
This is where you have the machinery and are in a polymer attached with the help of some transcription factors and proteins.

239
00:32:06,397 --> 00:32:13,297
And then in addition to the transcription factors playing a role, you also have enhancer elements.

240
00:32:14,077 --> 00:32:22,657
These could be located somewhere on the same chromosome, but just kind of further away from the gene itself.

241
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:30,487
And then depending on how the DNA is actually kind of folded in the nucleus, they could even be in a different chromosome.

242
00:32:30,487 --> 00:32:33,937
So depending on how the DNA actually sits together,

243
00:32:34,897 --> 00:32:45,877
then those enhancer elements that also affect gene expression can can affect how much of Gene A is, is, is transcribed.

244
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:57,756
And then this this figure here shows additional regulate like a transcriptional regulation mechanism related to just the bending of

245
00:32:57,757 --> 00:33:06,907
the protein depending of the DNA to make it accessible and kind of put together this machinery that would do the transcription.

246
00:33:09,877 --> 00:33:17,887
This one here is just showing another enhancer driven gene regulation mechanisms for this sense.

247
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:25,626
In addition to having the promoter, the RNA polymerase transcription factors binding,

248
00:33:25,627 --> 00:33:32,497
you also have you can have also enhancer RNA that's that is expressed by a different

249
00:33:32,497 --> 00:33:38,107
chromosome that also helps with the binding and affects the gene regulation.

250
00:33:38,117 --> 00:33:43,627
So it's like a double double enhancer mechanisms.

251
00:33:47,947 --> 00:33:54,186
So this is just an overview of gene regulation beyond transcription.

252
00:33:54,187 --> 00:34:05,617
So talked about how transcription is kind of regulated in terms of where promoters are and enhancers,

253
00:34:06,097 --> 00:34:11,107
and then you could have regulation at all those different steps.

254
00:34:11,437 --> 00:34:17,197
So from MRN splicing, so that's when you are taking out the drones.

255
00:34:17,587 --> 00:34:29,286
So that could also be regulated. That could also result in variation ion a m RNA protection processing of RNA and then initiation of

256
00:34:29,287 --> 00:34:37,237
translation these and then how the final protein is kind of processed and and folded and put together.

257
00:34:37,237 --> 00:34:40,337
So these are all steps that we're doing.

258
00:34:40,337 --> 00:34:49,447
The regulation can happen beyond where that's these are all steps beyond having a specific variation on your DNA sequence.

259
00:34:50,667 --> 00:34:59,437
Any questions? This is this is just showing an example of a small interfering RNA.

260
00:35:00,427 --> 00:35:06,957
So so basically this. Figure for that.

261
00:35:07,197 --> 00:35:12,267
But you would have a double stranded irony that's expressed by.

262
00:35:12,297 --> 00:35:18,266
That's produced by some by like a different chromosome that would come in.

263
00:35:18,267 --> 00:35:27,347
And it is cleaved so that it's open and then it's kind of attaches to the mine and cleaves it.

264
00:35:27,357 --> 00:35:33,176
So it would if you have an MA and a that that you don't want to be translated,

265
00:35:33,177 --> 00:35:39,087
it's kind of a double stranded that would open up attach to the RNA and that would induce cleavage.

266
00:35:39,417 --> 00:35:44,156
So that whole section would be kind of cut and then not translated.

267
00:35:44,157 --> 00:35:49,287
So it's kind of, it's kind of neutralizes them.

268
00:35:49,297 --> 00:36:01,707
Ah and that was transcribed. And this is basically just going over the ENCODE project.

269
00:36:03,057 --> 00:36:08,127
Just basic points from the paper to know and be aware of.

270
00:36:08,967 --> 00:36:18,837
So again, the 98% of the non-coding DNA in test datasets from 147 sometimes,

271
00:36:19,437 --> 00:36:26,957
and it's meant to characterize all those functional elements that could do that,

272
00:36:26,997 --> 00:36:32,577
have maybe enhancer functions, promoters, regulatory ironies and so on.

273
00:36:35,757 --> 00:36:44,217
And this is interesting that all the like, although it's just that 2% is actually coding, 75% is transcribed at some point.

274
00:36:44,847 --> 00:36:50,217
So, so the majority would have been on the coding strand or this and strand.

275
00:36:50,217 --> 00:36:55,887
But then there are some, some transcription or some,

276
00:36:56,157 --> 00:37:05,457
some some transcription happening from the other strands and those elements are thought to have some regulatory function.

277
00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:14,757
Um, so even though we thought that they might not be transcribed, we now know that about 75% is transcribed.

278
00:37:16,527 --> 00:37:25,287
And then those kind of code for regulatory RNA is regulatory molecules that also affect gene gene regulation.

279
00:37:31,447 --> 00:37:43,237
So and overall, like we like those regulatory functions, we also know about how important it is, how the the chromosome is,

280
00:37:43,237 --> 00:37:52,296
it's little bit and how it's kind of compacted inside the nucleus and how that can maybe bring four elements together.

281
00:37:52,297 --> 00:37:58,297
So elements from different from asylum affecting the gene expression and different on totally different

282
00:37:58,297 --> 00:38:07,776
chromosome or things related to how accessible the chromatin is in terms of folding or unfolding.

283
00:38:07,777 --> 00:38:16,657
Yeah. So ah the irony is part of that 75% that's transcribed from the non-coding region or is that from the coding.

284
00:38:23,137 --> 00:38:26,317
We want regulatory. So. So.

285
00:38:29,197 --> 00:38:33,867
Nacho. So, Megan, your question. So are you asking if this is the short stint?

286
00:38:34,267 --> 00:38:38,737
Are they are are those from the non-coding regions?

287
00:38:40,537 --> 00:38:49,417
Oh, yeah. I mean, I probably goes I'm not sure specifically, but the I think the point here is that.

288
00:38:51,917 --> 00:38:58,396
So that that those iron molecules can can help regulate coding.

289
00:38:58,397 --> 00:39:06,497
Transcript. So chance with that comes from coding regions these RNA molecules that could be probably transcription

290
00:39:06,497 --> 00:39:16,216
coding or non-coding regions can can affect the can kind of neutralize those coding transcripts.

291
00:39:16,217 --> 00:39:19,427
Ah yeah. Em RNA is coming from coding regions.

292
00:39:20,717 --> 00:39:29,597
Yeah. So.

293
00:39:32,327 --> 00:39:37,627
So you are talking about the folding of the DNA, how important that is,

294
00:39:38,077 --> 00:39:51,817
and just expanding our view of what what is important and how how just the oversimplified view that you have a certain mutation gene.

295
00:39:52,207 --> 00:39:58,507
And that's that's that's the only kind of linear one way of by which you have variation.

296
00:40:00,507 --> 00:40:06,647
And then here is an example of a condition revealed in philosophy.

297
00:40:07,967 --> 00:40:13,337
So this this condition affects one in 10,000, 15,000 people.

298
00:40:13,817 --> 00:40:22,567
It runs in families. So there's a specific region in France by which where this condition is kind of found.

299
00:40:22,577 --> 00:40:30,616
And this is this is where the Mendelian randomization, Mendelian disease example.

300
00:40:30,617 --> 00:40:36,016
So you have the condition coming from a mutation in a specific gene region.

301
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:43,307
So a kind of a one mutation that typically would come from from having.

302
00:40:46,007 --> 00:40:54,617
A few ancestors or founder effect. So you have a few ancestors that one of them might have those might have that mutation and it kind

303
00:40:54,617 --> 00:41:05,657
of got past and aspect affected all the um the pedigree kind of coming down from that ancestor,

304
00:41:06,587 --> 00:41:15,197
the condition kind of manifest with infants refusing to eat vomiting and then affecting the brain function.

305
00:41:16,247 --> 00:41:20,656
So researchers did a linkage analysis.

306
00:41:20,657 --> 00:41:22,247
So we'll talk about this later.

307
00:41:22,247 --> 00:41:31,017
But basically, it's trying to understand how what genetic what genetic region is moving across families and that region,

308
00:41:31,397 --> 00:41:39,407
gene region is related to that condition. So who has that genetic region and who ends up having that condition?

309
00:41:41,057 --> 00:41:46,366
So after linkage analysis with identify that region then sequencing.

310
00:41:46,367 --> 00:41:51,707
So that's looking at every single base and then trying to see which specific

311
00:41:51,707 --> 00:41:58,007
mutation in that region is actually affect is actually making those people sick.

312
00:41:58,427 --> 00:42:07,277
So so that so that sequencing was done to this gene region the SLC 782.

313
00:42:08,297 --> 00:42:12,016
And we know that it's a recessive condition.

314
00:42:12,017 --> 00:42:20,297
So individuals have to inherit the mutation from both parents and it is relevant.

315
00:42:20,297 --> 00:42:23,807
So we know that this gene is expressed in the brain,

316
00:42:24,947 --> 00:42:32,417
but then when we looked at the sequencing of the gene and we found out that the mutation is actually not in the coding region,

317
00:42:32,417 --> 00:42:41,237
so it's not really affecting the actual code that would kind of produce the gene.

318
00:42:43,307 --> 00:42:51,017
But upon further investigation, we find out that it's just a single based change in the line element.

319
00:42:51,377 --> 00:42:57,077
So that's like one of those repeats in the DNA inside a sign element inside of an internal region.

320
00:42:57,437 --> 00:43:04,967
So we're looking at an internal region that is transcribed and somehow this RNA function RNA

321
00:43:04,967 --> 00:43:13,126
molecule affects affect the protein in the cell and and helps keeps the neurons stable.

322
00:43:13,127 --> 00:43:23,927
So this is an example of a bat condition that just it's just a single mutation from from central region and.

323
00:43:26,667 --> 00:43:34,957
I guess this is an example of how sometimes you can have a high number of repeats, big changes, but have no downstream effect.

324
00:43:34,977 --> 00:43:46,647
But then, depending on just the function, a single base can have more dramatic effects on sound and proteins and so on.

325
00:43:49,587 --> 00:43:56,497
The question is, does this automatically lead to death for those infants?

326
00:43:56,517 --> 00:44:01,607
Or are there treatments available? I don't know.

327
00:44:01,617 --> 00:44:07,106
I mean, I'm not sure. I'm not pretty familiar with how those treat what those actually do.

328
00:44:07,107 --> 00:44:14,447
But it sounds like they are born. They are. They're able I don't know.

329
00:44:14,647 --> 00:44:18,307
They're able this kind of it's compatible with life.

330
00:44:18,317 --> 00:44:22,487
But then eventually with the degradation of brain white matter, I'm not sure.

331
00:44:23,027 --> 00:44:27,437
Yeah. Like what, what? What the end station is or if there's treatment.

332
00:44:28,097 --> 00:44:36,497
Yeah. Other questions.

333
00:44:43,717 --> 00:45:04,137
So. So for next week to you can have your first quiz based on the readings and that the record lectures on week two.

334
00:45:04,677 --> 00:45:12,927
There are about three recorded lectures and there's there's an exam not ICSI with not yet.

335
00:45:13,477 --> 00:45:26,247
Here's the quiz again. This quiz is just meant to make sure that you kind of understand the main points of the of the lectures not graded for class.

336
00:45:26,607 --> 00:45:32,547
Next time you start working on our first problems that.

337
00:45:35,257 --> 00:45:45,577
My questions. So will Lerner groups for they'll stay the same for all of the problems that's.

338
00:45:46,017 --> 00:45:49,437
Yeah I prefer that. I think next week, maybe before.

339
00:45:49,497 --> 00:45:56,247
Before I sign the if you like me, just come down here and then let me know your group.

340
00:45:56,247 --> 00:46:04,367
So that's something to think about. And then I'll kind of create the groups on campus because you're doing one submission for the problem sets.

341
00:46:04,407 --> 00:46:09,957
So, so we'll just have one person submit the problems sets.

342
00:46:14,637 --> 00:46:19,437
Seems. Okay.

343
00:46:19,607 --> 00:46:20,747
Well, I guess we can just.
