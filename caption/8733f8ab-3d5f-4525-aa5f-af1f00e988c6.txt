1
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:14,180
Imagine that your boss came to you and asked you to conduct an investigation of the

2
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:19,580
relationship between exposures to contaminated water in Flint and cognition and children.

3
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:27,410
What would you measure? You might want to test the water, but the reality is, is that the exposures have already changed.

4
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:31,790
And if you could have tested, what would you have sampled for anyways?

5
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:37,190
Would you have sampled for lead in the water? Or would you actually rather know what was in the children?

6
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,780
Would you want to sample for blood lead or maybe even blood?

7
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:46,040
And let's think about the cognitive end points. How would you want to define that?

8
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:49,760
Would you use test scores from the schools that already exist?

9
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:55,640
Would you want to collect your own samples by using some sort of IQ test or some other challenge?

10
00:00:56,150 --> 00:01:00,590
What data would you need to answer this question? In this video,

11
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:04,819
we're going to talk through different types of information that we often collect

12
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:10,280
in the epidemiology and think about ways in which inaccuracies can arise.

13
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:20,900
So let's start with the easy stuff. Some information we can collect with really little error, both because there's some sort of concrete answer.

14
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:26,930
For example, are you alive or not? Or because the data itself is very likely to be accurate.

15
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:32,260
So for example, age is usually pretty easy to assess with little error,

16
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:37,460
since the vast majority of people know what their birthday is, or at least their approximate birthday.

17
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,630
Other measures are not necessarily difficult to obtain,

18
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:51,660
but there can be challenges in distinguishing which individuals have disease and require some sort of intervention versus those who are healthy.

19
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:56,220
So one common example of this scenario is with blood pressure.

20
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,060
Blood pressure is a continuous measure of vascular health,

21
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:08,310
yet there's no clear line in the sand for who's going to experience damage to their kidneys or their hearts as a result of hypertension,

22
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,230
meaning elevated blood pressure.

23
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:19,920
Now, one good option if we have the data, is to just use blood pressure as a continuous measure to get a sense as to the severity.

24
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:27,390
However, the reality is, is that while epidemiologists can use continuous data pretty easily,

25
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:37,620
clinicians often need some kind of cutoff to inform when they treat somebody, when they just watch them, and when to assume that there's no problem.

26
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:43,860
For this reason, rules are often created to help clinical decisions.

27
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:51,810
For example, on this slide, I have some cutoffs that are commonly used for deciding whether or not somebody has hypertension.

28
00:02:53,180 --> 00:03:01,010
Once these rules are used, they then become part of a person's medical record as well as their own knowledge of their health,

29
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:06,880
and therefore they're often incorporated into our studies in epidemiology.

30
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:15,950
Even more challenging to get accurately are some diseases or phenotypes that are so complex

31
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:20,390
that there's really no one measure that can be used to quantify the severity of the disease.

32
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:24,140
So, for example, let's think about Alzheimer's disease.

33
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:32,540
Alzheimer's disease is a very common and debilitating condition that's characterized by memory loss, cognitive decline,

34
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:35,480
difficulties functioning and social settings,

35
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:43,520
and really being able to take care of oneself in spite of the huge public health impacts of Alzheimer's disease.

36
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:50,209
Research in this area has many challenges because there's currently no one way to

37
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:55,820
diagnose whether or not a patient truly has Alzheimer's disease with 100% certainty.

38
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,830
While some manifestations of the disease can be found on autopsy,

39
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:04,760
there's actually a growing understanding that what's pathologically present

40
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:09,200
in the brain doesn't always correspond to the severity of symptoms in life.

41
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:15,450
So that raises the question of how do we characterize whether or not somebody has this

42
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:22,740
complex disease with no one single diagnostic that's good for Alzheimer's disease?

43
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:30,660
Epidemiologists and doctors commonly use a series of related measures to help establish the presence or absence of the condition.

44
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:39,990
Most frequently, cognitive testing is conducted to see how well a person's memory, reasoning, language and attention are working.

45
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:47,310
So, for example, we might give a person a list of five words and then ask them 5 minutes later to recall them for us.

46
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:50,310
Sometimes we ask people to count by sevens.

47
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:58,530
Now, doctors can also conduct neurological evaluations of memory, language, visual perception and physical functioning.

48
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:06,750
Or they can even scan people's brains via MRI to look for evidence of brain damage and be patterns of brain activity.

49
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:12,990
Sometimes lab tests are even run to look for physical problems that can affect brain function.

50
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:20,370
Collectively, all of these measures can inform both physicians decisions as well as epidemiologists decision

51
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:25,530
in terms of whether or not somebody should be classified as with disease or without disease.

52
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:32,500
The use of a constellation of measures, however, raises some really interesting issues.

53
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:37,210
What happens if our different indicators give us different answers?

54
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:45,970
For example, what if we find evidence of memory loss and disorientation and cognitive testing along with mobility declines?

55
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,920
But then we see no apparent changes in brain activity on the MRI scan.

56
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:54,130
So now what do you do? You have conflicting information.

57
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:59,170
The truth is that it really depends on the scientific question that you're trying to answer.

58
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:04,480
If your goal is to find predictors of poor quality of life due to dementia, for example,

59
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:09,550
then the first two measures are likely the ones that you want to use in your epidemiological analysis.

60
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:19,630
In contrast, if you're trying to understand the biological underpinnings of some temporal atrophy, then the MRI findings are really what you need.

61
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:23,170
MRI, of course, is a more expensive measure,

62
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:30,160
so it raises the questions of whether or not you can use a less expensive surrogate to get at the question of interest.

63
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,060
Sometimes the answer is yes, and sometimes that answer is no.

64
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:39,520
Here, let's switch our example and talk about exposures to cigaret smoke.

65
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:44,920
Often we just ask people via self-report whether or not you smoke.

66
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,420
It's a yes or no question.

67
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:55,120
However, if you think about it, a yes or no question really doesn't differentiate between a person who smokes once per week,

68
00:06:55,420 --> 00:07:02,170
perhaps on the weekends when they're having a drink with their friends versus a person who is smoking regularly a pack a day.

69
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:12,520
As a result, we might prefer a measure like Pack Year, which is capturing more about how many cigarets people are taking over their life course.

70
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:16,960
Of course, if we keep going along this train of thought,

71
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:23,500
we may think about how the type of cigaret or the brand of cigaret may result in different smoke exposures.

72
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,490
And therefore we may want to ask people about the type of cigarets that they smoke.

73
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:36,790
Then if we keep going, we might imagine that how deep you inhale your Cigarets must impact some internal dose to smoke,

74
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:42,970
which then may make us consider collecting blood to test for coat mean, which is a metabolite of nicotine.

75
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,360
I think that you're starting to get the idea.

76
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:52,419
While it may seem a bit like the children's story of give a mouse a cookie, where a mouse starts asking for one thing,

77
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:56,230
and by the time the story is done, he's already asked for about 15 other things.

78
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:05,260
We really need to decide how much level of detail we need because sometimes collecting 15 measures is just overkill,

79
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:11,559
whereas other times we need that kind of information. So ultimately, when we're planning a study,

80
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:19,470
what we need to do is consider the added value of the detailed information versus the participant burden and the cost to the researcher.

81
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:27,920
Now, another key consideration that I'd like you to think about is how we need to collect data with respect to time,

82
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,370
since many of our exposures are changing over time.

83
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:38,720
Let's take again that smoker who only smoke cigarets on the weekends to assess his exposure.

84
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:43,370
We really need to ask the right questions if we ask them on a Tuesday.

85
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:50,150
Hey, how many cigarets did you smoke today? We're going to get a very different answer than if we asked them on that Tuesday.

86
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:56,660
How many cigarets do you smoke in a week? We'd also get a different answer if we collected blood on Tuesday,

87
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:03,170
because the half life of cotinine or how long it takes for the level to drop by half is less than one day.

88
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:11,360
Now, that was a short term example, but you can imagine that this issue of timing is challenging for many other exposures.

89
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:16,430
So let's take, for example, any exposure that impacts infant growth.

90
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:23,840
You might imagine that the important window of exposure could be before conception if the critical

91
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:29,810
damage that's important to infant health is damage that happens to the sperm or the eggs.

92
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:36,410
In contrast, it might actually be some sort of trimester during a woman's pregnancy that's important,

93
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:41,060
or even a certain week when some key organ is being formed in the fetus.

94
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:45,680
Maybe it's a postpartum exposure that matters most for infant exposure.

95
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:51,620
Similarly, if we think about the other side of life and thinking about dementia and older life,

96
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:58,100
you can imagine that there are some things like an infection or some rapid decline in physical health

97
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:04,460
that might change your cognitive status quickly and make you become demented on a short term scale.

98
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:10,870
However, there's other exposures that likely occurred much earlier on in your life course.

99
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:16,400
Say, for example, during midlife that are going to impact your risk of cardiovascular disease,

100
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:19,850
that then changes your ultimate risk of dementia in later life.

101
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:25,010
So all of this to say is that when you're collecting data,

102
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:33,530
you really need to be considering the timing of the question of interest in order to get the best data that you can to answer your question.

103
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:41,809
So as a summary, I just wanted to wrap up by saying that in conducting our epidemiologic studies,

104
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:47,540
we really must consider what data we need in order to address the question of interests.

105
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:57,410
We also want to think about how we measure our exposure or outcome in covariates and what time is the most important time to capture information.

106
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:05,060
In the next videos, we'll talk about the information bias that can come up due to errors in the data that we collect.
