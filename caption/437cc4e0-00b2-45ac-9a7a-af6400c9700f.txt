00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:10,680
Hello. My name is Anna and I did my research project on clean deficiency and skeletal muscle performance.

2
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:18,569
So within the body, choline is specifically helping to regulate nerve transmitter synthesis,

3
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:25,260
specifically with acetylcholine, which is a primary focus of this research today.

4
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,719
It's also associated with some membrane signaling, such as with phospholipids lipid transport.

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:40,740
Methyl group metabolism has to do with DNA synthesis, such as when it couples with other nutrients, such as folate or vitamin B12.

6
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:52,020
These can help to regulate and affect gene expression within the body and with metabolism, it can help to metabolize fats.

7
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,479
And specifically with the nervous system.

8
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:03,480
It helps basically in its overall form and function by converting neurotransmitters that affect the nerves and play a role in the overall

9
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:13,290
mechanisms and different pathways of the nervous system which help with bodily functions such as breathing heart rate and muscle contraction.

10
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,340
So then the Body Queen and Alpha Gypsy are interrelated.

11
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:24,700
So Alpha G.P.S. is a chemical that's made in the body from choline.

12
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:33,250
It's regulated by different amounts that you can get, either supplemented in like pill form or regulated through the body,

13
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:38,920
or ingested through regular foods such as eggs or meat or dairy products.

14
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:45,459
Alpha G.P.S. is a primary interest of neutropenic and cognitive enhancement purposes.

15
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:53,500
So specifically with treating memory loss issues or with Alzheimer's patients really trying to get that cognitive and that cognitive function back.

16
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:03,430
And there's also evidence with this topic to suggest that Alpha Gypsy can help to increase the synthesis and release of acetylcholine within the body.

17
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:13,660
So I thought it was really interesting to try to see of choline supplementation can have any effect or influence on isometric strength.

18
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:23,830
So within this study, these college age males were supplemented with 600 milligrams of alpha G.P.S. for six days.

19
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:30,850
So not even a full week to six days of exercise that they were participating in.

20
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:37,840
So they were doing six days of isometric strength exercises, both for the lower body and the upper body.

21
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,380
For the lower body they were doing, mid-thigh pulls on a forest plate,

22
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:47,060
and for the upper body they're doing the isometric pushups, so presses using a load cell.

23
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:52,450
So I thought it was interesting that after supplementing with alpha GPC for six days,

24
00:02:52,450 --> 00:03:00,610
the athletes had a significant gain in their lower body strength, while there wasn't as much of a statistical significance in upper body.

25
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:07,660
I thought it was so interesting because six days of supplementation in such a short amount of time really to see any results,

26
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,030
especially when you're looking at overall strength gains.

27
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:19,870
Now it's important to note that these were just isometric exercises, but it's still to have a significant difference is really big, especially for.

28
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:28,380
Athletic individuals having these college meals perform these exercises for only

29
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:34,470
six days and being able to see significant results specifically in lower exercise,

30
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:39,630
even though not as much with upper body exercises. It's still pretty significant, and I thought it was interesting.

31
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:49,260
Although the study had a relatively small sample size, I thought it was important to note in order to have a good foundation for this research,

32
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:57,330
in order to kind of have a jumping off point for future choline supplementation for athletes or athletically trained individuals.

33
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:02,310
Now for this next study, my mind kind of got to thinking, okay,

34
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:08,970
if queen supplementation and alpha gypsy supplementation can have an effect on isometric strength.

35
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:14,610
What about human growth hormone levels and resistance exercises?

36
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:26,460
So I was able to find this study that was looking also at men who were resistance trained for at least two years prior to the study,

37
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:35,320
and they were also taking 600 grams of Alpha G.P.S. And what they were able to do is they took that.

38
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,340
They had two groups, they had a control group in an experimental group.

39
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:47,400
And with the experimental group they took the Alpha GPC supplement about 90 minutes prior to completing these resistance exercises.

40
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:55,589
And so they were doing six sets of ten repetitions on the Smith machine, and they're doing squats at 70% of their one rep max.

41
00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:00,510
So 70% of the total highest weight that they could perform for this exercise.

42
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:06,520
Now, this is interesting because the data concluded that with a 600 milligrams dose of alpha

43
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:12,900
GPC when administered 90 minutes prior to beginning their respective bouts of exercise,

44
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:19,320
they were able to see increases in post-exercise serum growth hormone.

45
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:26,340
So we can see here with these lines on this graph, they were able to run a two ANOVA analysis for these results,

46
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:34,500
but with the experimental group, they were able to see an increase in this serum growth, human growth hormone versus the placebo group.

47
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:41,070
The placebo group. Now, yes, this varies with intensity and duration post-exercise,

48
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:47,310
but this is still a significant increase in what they were able to find between the two groups.

49
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:53,580
Now, it's also important to note that even though they found increased levels of human growth hormone and

50
00:05:53,580 --> 00:06:00,090
other performance variables and factors such as peak power and rate of force of these exercises,

51
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:02,010
they found no statistical difference.

52
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:10,350
So but I think this has a pretty big future implications, especially when you're looking at groups such as bodybuilders or power lifters or,

53
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:16,200
you know, just athletically trained individuals who are looking to maybe increase overall muscle mass.

54
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:27,150
This might be a future necessarily necessary or even recommended or clinically prescribed supplement for these people who maybe are lacking

55
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:35,970
in overall muscle mass or are looking to see the effects of increased human growth hormone for whatever their respective reason may be.

56
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:45,850
Now through my research, I actually found it a little bit lacking in sort of the association between muscle

57
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:51,250
performance or even skeletal muscle association and choline and alpha G.P.S.

58
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,570
So I was able to find this graphic that I thought was really interesting and

59
00:06:55,690 --> 00:07:01,269
just very informational about the biological pathways of choline and muscle.

60
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:08,260
And so obviously we see that metabolism and protein metabolism and these different pathways that are associated specifically.

61
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:14,380
And I was looking at the center one with them toward C one protein synthesis, muscle atrophy.

62
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:22,390
Now we see muscle contractions as well as the cytoplasmic calcium concentrations in muscle atrophy of muscle performance.

63
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:27,550
I was interested a little bit in the lap of Genesis and chronic inflammation and the coin's effects on them.

64
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,280
But unfortunately, again,

65
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:39,820
a little bit of limited research and research papers specifically having to do with overall muscle performance and just athletic potential as a whole.

66
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:50,260
Now, I think it's important to note that with coin and muscle performance, obviously you could argue that a reduction in free cooling,

67
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:57,010
especially during intense physical exercise or even just in general activity in general might

68
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:02,500
reduce acetylcholine release and thereby affecting the overall endurance and performance.

69
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:10,240
Now, with intense exercise, such as with long distance running or cycling or swimming or rowing, no,

70
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:17,920
it's very expensive and it's very exhausting and stressing on the muscles and especially with muscle contractions.

71
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:25,660
That signaling pathway relies on acetylcholine in order to perform that repetitive motion over and over again.

72
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:36,760
So if adequate amounts of choline are not being supplied by the body, then these contractions are not going to occur under overall endurance.

73
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,580
Performance will decrease and go down as well.

74
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:50,830
Now, I thought this was interesting because adequate intake of codeine wasn't even regulated or set in stone until the late 1990s.

75
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:56,229
So this sort of relationship between cooling, human growth hormone,

76
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:06,549
alpha G.P.S. and muscle performance and fatigue resistance is sort of an emerging and newer avenue of research,

77
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:11,350
and I'm very excited to see where it heads in the future because I think there's

78
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:16,120
a lot of different things and routes that can be explored with this topic.

79
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,620
Thank you.
