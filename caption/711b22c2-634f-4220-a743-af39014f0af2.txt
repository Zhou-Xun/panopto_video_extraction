1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,820
So what we'll do is talk through that a bit.

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:09,520
I want to just revisit that a little bit because I know we went through it quickly during our last session,

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:16,149
and I want to give you a few minutes to just have a little bit of a discussion about what we were talking about there.

4
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:21,460
I suppose the discussion points. And I just want to give you a chance to talk among yourselves a little bit about that.

5
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:30,030
So we'll talk a little bit about the practice. Finances that are your grades are all posted on canvas.

6
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:37,500
So you should have everybody's grades are now up to date current events, case presentations and your first assignment all posted.

7
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:40,420
In general, the first assignments are very excellent.

8
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:48,010
I left comments in the rubric that would give you an opportunity to see certain areas that you would expand on or refine.

9
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:54,280
Everybody really did follow the process in the appropriate way.

10
00:00:54,280 --> 00:01:01,329
So thank you for for honoring that. It makes it a lot set up to be able to sort of understand your arguments in your structures.

11
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:09,549
So thank you. Assignment two, as we talked about prior to the fall break will be due November 8th on that assignment.

12
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:12,850
Before I turn to this, anything that anyone has in mind.

13
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:20,120
I know it's been centuries out of another dimension that.

14
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,940
I don't remember the assignment. That's all right. Thank for your honesty.

15
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,290
So this is the assignment where you will be proposing a new program for your

16
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:40,020
organization and using the SWOT analysis that we reviewed in class prior to the break.

17
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:49,470
So the prompt is on canvas, having to be on it during class after class on Slack just by me.

18
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:57,440
Okay. One other point I placed on canvas and I sent it out in the announcement, an anonymous survey.

19
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,000
I just wanted to give one more opportunity for any mid-course feedback here.

20
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:11,820
For those who aren't comfortable speaking in class, I want to just be sensitive to everybody's participation style, so no need to respond to that.

21
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:17,220
If you feel like you've gotten your feedback out through our discussions here in class,

22
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,830
but it will not report you are anything is completely anonymized in canvas.

23
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:30,210
Just another place for you to leave some feedback. If there's something that you feel you would like to be seeing more or less of in our course.

24
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,850
I am still working on that video issue.

25
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:41,580
I went back to look at with the school and Panopto as it appears to be recording and some of them are there and not so we'll do our best.

26
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:46,110
All the slides are posted though on canvas before each class.

27
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:48,900
We should have access to all the, the session slides.

28
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:57,660
Um, and I'm again happy to follow up with you if there's any part of this that you need review on or something that is not clear.

29
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:02,880
Okay. We'll talk about finance and we'll move on to current events.

30
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:06,600
Then I want to talk a bit about managing people.

31
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,740
So kind of human resources, uh, aspects of organizations.

32
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:16,600
We'll take a break and then we'll have our, our case presentation for students.

33
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:26,520
So as I discussed back in our last session, really budgeting and I'm not going to go back and review all the different parts,

34
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:34,020
but I just want to kind of bring us back to what we mean by thinking about budgeting inside of organizations from a managerial perspective.

35
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:43,409
So one of the key points that I was I was highlighting for you is this idea that budgeting is really something that

36
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:51,210
managers are doing to think about who in the organization is going to be informing a decision making process.

37
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:57,840
And from an equity perspective, what we need to keep in mind are the power dynamics that exist.

38
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:05,010
What structural components inside the organization create power structures that may or may not be able

39
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:11,160
to be overcome by different constituencies and different groups of either staff or board members.

40
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:16,770
So we have to think about whether or not the decisions are inclusive of the different stakeholders in the organization.

41
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:24,300
And then we need to also think about the voices of the community that the organization is serving so that the the

42
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:32,819
stakeholders in the organization or maybe the staff were arguing or advocating for a particular set of resources.

43
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,210
Those folks may very well be representing their interests.

44
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:40,139
But we also have to keep in mind what are the interests of the constituents who

45
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:45,660
are served by the organization and how do those budgetary figures contribute?

46
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:53,160
Then revisiting what you did quite a bit of in your first assignment is thinking about the board's representativeness.

47
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:58,680
And can the board adequately make budgetary recommendations.

48
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,210
So picture that you are the CEO of the organization, your CFO.

49
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,870
So your chief financial officer comes in and says here, this is this year's budget.

50
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:14,550
Let's take it before the board to get a vote, which is perhaps in your bylaws, the board needs to vote every year on the annual budget.

51
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:19,020
So if the board is not representative of the diversity of the community,

52
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:24,329
our organization's assuring that there's equity in the budgeting process and

53
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:29,130
that we're honoring everybody's perspective and being as inclusive as we can.

54
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:33,810
Now, I want to be clear, because we're using the term equity here.

55
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,760
I want to make the distinction, though, between this and health equity,

56
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:51,360
whereas health equity being defined for the category of overcoming overcoming systems of oppression and power dynamics that lead to structural racism,

57
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:56,970
oppression and other forms. But I want you to kind of think about how the two could be linked.

58
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:06,300
The power dynamics or systems that have emerged that can create those types of environments can also be a

59
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:12,240
factor in how we think about the budgeting process and what ways the organization makes those decisions.

60
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:22,350
So. Our discussion. I want you to take just a couple of minutes just among yourselves and just talk

61
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:26,010
a little bit about the organization that you're focusing on for workforce.

62
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:31,800
And I want you to just give some thought to some of the budgeting challenges that you think the organization may be facing.

63
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:39,180
Whether that's related to our discussion here real quick about equity or some of the other issues that we talked about two weeks ago.

64
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,730
What types of solutions do you think the organization can introduce to address these challenges?

65
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:49,739
I know that some of you had shared a little bit about the experiences that you had,

66
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:55,800
either working at the organization that you were writing about or insights that you'd gathered from being in contact with the organization.

67
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:59,130
But feel free to just kind of brainstorm a little bit.

68
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:04,799
But think about, you know, what are some of the budgeting challenges specifically with regard to budgeting?

69
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:11,520
So not about their revenue or their expense, but how they actually make those decisions about where to put those resources,

70
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,550
where they're actually assigning those dollars.

71
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:22,049
And in policy terms with the government, we would say that it is actually appropriate that we're talking about that the

72
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:26,640
Congress passes a budget and then we appropriate the dollars to particular programs.

73
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:31,320
But here I want you to just sort of say in organizational terms, the budgeting itself,

74
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:35,700
which is in essence, a very similar process that the organization.

75
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:41,440
Okay. So take a couple of minutes and just kind of talk among yourselves selves maybe

76
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,360
in pairs of two or three or whoever is around you feel free to join up together.

77
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:59,940
So they just rely solely on the one song.

78
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:09,230
So I'm wondering, do you have something in common with such exciting sort of people like you personally,

79
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:17,730
you know, so diverse and why it's so important?

80
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:24,560
Because, you know, I mean, specify what is related to actually.

81
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:42,580
It was just like, yeah, it was interesting to do it once every year like taxes on some years ago I was like, what are you saying?

82
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:58,200
That I think it was almost like Mr. like last year because I think he's not really established the position.

83
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,620
So what does that mean inside the system?

84
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:19,300
So but there's nothing they were like before support and then after they've had a lot of good things.

85
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:30,250
You've got a lot of around the existence of a pretty name like well during the program and things like that.

86
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:37,810
It doesn't go back, but I would try to service the center.

87
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:45,820
I mean, it just happened and I think I said the same thing.

88
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:55,720
It was in places like like and I just said like, yeah,

89
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:26,040
even when I think about how hard it is to just like just kind of work to the task because I don't think that was the reason I did it.

90
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:44,260
Because with artists like thrombosis, what it's like to shake things up like 3%, I got to say yes.

91
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:52,610
I say you're not getting out of it.

92
00:10:53,700 --> 00:11:08,950
That's right. I think all that kind of like, you know, that has happened to your mind.

93
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:22,629
Is it a Google Pixel over the past year now?

94
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:35,900
And there was like I was like it was really people.

95
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:54,380
But actually in terms of actually I'm not doing anything.

96
00:11:54,410 --> 00:12:00,650
I was always all over the world.

97
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,290
All right. Let's come back together. All right.

98
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:26,640
So you are that are carrying a fear with that came up with how about we start with let's start on the rest of

99
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:35,830
our organization that I'm doing is organizations Seattle that does homeless services and I had worked there.

100
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:40,510
Previously, and I think this is based on that experience.

101
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:45,889
My guess is that in terms of budget stuff, something that comes up a lot is just like salaries and wages because they have a lot

102
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:50,420
like they have really frequent turnover and like shelter staff and case management.

103
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,180
Partly because I think salaries are not very high.

104
00:12:53,780 --> 00:13:01,069
Um, and so I'm guessing and a lot of their money goes towards salaries and wages based on their financial documents.

105
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:09,710
But, um, I'm assuming that that's probably a budgetary challenge, like how to retain people, but also not being able to pay them that much.

106
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:13,960
That's a good point in a lot of these organizations, as we've talked about, that's where,

107
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:19,880
as you may have observed in your analysis, that is where a lot of their resources go, are to salaries.

108
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:25,850
And one could ask the question, is that the most effective place to put those dollars,

109
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:31,129
you know, is is hiring more people to work there the most efficient,

110
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:34,280
or are there systems that could be designed where, you know,

111
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:41,600
there could be efficiency or that those hires are a little bit more reflective of of a more efficient process?

112
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:46,579
So that's great for others about I mean, it is kind of similar.

113
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:51,790
But I was thinking, well, I told you, Dr. Ruben,

114
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:58,520
about I emailed the finance director because they he sent me a list of the salary breakdowns and ranges for all positions.

115
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:03,530
And he said that their goal is to get everybody to or above the 50 percentile.

116
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,429
Yeah. So was that so, Katie. Just her background manager.

117
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:12,379
Yeah. So Katie and Katie had been in touch with the CFO from her organization and they had

118
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:16,940
sent a chart that basically showed position by position what their targets were.

119
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,140
So with the 50th percentile that he did he get back to you to tell you like what he was?

120
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:27,350
Yeah. Let me hold on. He was so vague. It was like a brief sentence he said.

121
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:36,710
All that move. Find it. We used pay scale for pay scale for objective data gathering.

122
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:49,060
Okay. So my sense is, is that that is code for he for the organization has a target but that that's not actually what people are making.

123
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:57,040
Yeah. Anyway, yeah. Okay. So I think obviously that's a challenge trying to pay people more, but at the same time they're expanding.

124
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:07,450
So I would imagine it also comes down to how do we pay people more while also needing to hire more staff to provide adequate services.

125
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:13,060
So this is an interesting point and I want to just kind of bring this back to everybody here as we're talking about this.

126
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:18,850
Remember, these organizations pay zero business income tax.

127
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:27,639
They're exempted from that. So they're not paying taxes tied to the federal government or the state on revenue that they generate,

128
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:33,340
which is very much different than any other business or corporate entity.

129
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:39,459
You know, if you're a business, if you're an LLC or partnership, if you're member managed,

130
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:47,080
if you're an escort, whatever it is, you pay a tax, a business tax separate from your personal taxes.

131
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:52,930
So even if you're withholding taxes for your own part of what you're making, the business itself pays.

132
00:15:53,230 --> 00:16:00,850
So all that being said, think about these organizations kind of be in their shoes for a moment in terms of their financial decision making.

133
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:05,410
If our goal is to get folks to a certain threshold of salary,

134
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:14,860
it also means that we are now increasing the salary with the recognition that those dollars could go anywhere else,

135
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:23,320
meaning they're not being absorbed. There's no tax implication for it, so to speak, other than you have to pay more, um,

136
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:28,690
fight attacks, you know, sort of Social Security, Medicare for your employees payroll taxes.

137
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:33,520
But, but just kind of keep in mind that those are dollars that could be spent in any way.

138
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:41,919
So to make the commitment to say we're going to get everybody to a certain threshold of pay in and of itself is a policy as

139
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:48,430
opposed to saying we're going to use those dollars to expand programs or to invest in capital or build another facility,

140
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:55,360
etc. So it's an interesting dynamic which perhaps prior to COVID would be more rare.

141
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:01,420
But coming out of the pandemic and kind of the the trends that we're seeing on labor,

142
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:09,069
we might ask the question whether or not this becomes a policy that more organizations may adopt in order to retain their staff.

143
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:17,110
Because to the point that we were just talking about before, this is something that that organizations have to wrestle with,

144
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:21,250
which is if we lose our workforce, then who's going to do that job?

145
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:24,850
So it's not just something we can find anybody to fill in positions.

146
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:30,700
Okay. That was a very long connection onto those two points, but I thought both of them were very important.

147
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:35,370
Okay. Oh, your points are always important. This group here in the middle.

148
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:40,050
Anything around? Yeah. So I between.

149
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:46,919
But. I don't I wouldn't say that there was like striking challenges, but I was looking at my organization.

150
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:51,790
But that like. So be a lot of work to do scrambling it.

151
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:58,710
And so, like just having a sustainable stream of. Funding for projects they don't have a lot of.

152
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,940
I mean, a lot of it is dependent year by year. So they have a couple of but I don't know how you get that.

153
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:07,750
Right. It's kind of the problem that we're getting to. Right. Yeah.

154
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,560
And then I was talking about a. My organization, which is where I work.

155
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:21,399
I started there in the summer fall of 2017 and that was pretty early into the Trump administration.

156
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:27,790
And there were a lot of presentations and a lot of discussion about how to not just the health care division or whatever,

157
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:34,030
but 90% of their contracts come to the federal government. So there was a concern with the kind of.

158
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:39,900
It's a lot of, you know, euphemisms and things in this environment. There's less of a focus on, you know,

159
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:44,230
our initiatives or our interests and things like that and trying to maybe

160
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:48,639
diversify some of their contracts and things because they were concerned that,

161
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,850
you know, some contractors wouldn't be offered, you know, in the future.

162
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,490
So they were trying to kind of branch out to, you know,

163
00:18:55,090 --> 00:19:02,530
working with payors or kind of other health care institutions that so they weren't so reliant on just kind of one single payer for most of their work.

164
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:11,590
So I hear some themes and I saw this come out of reading all of your papers or your assignments that, you know,

165
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:16,060
there's quite a bit of recognition from each of you for a lot of organizations at least,

166
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:21,100
that there's not a great diversity in where those dollars are coming from.

167
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:28,090
I want you to give some thought to whether or not diversity is possible in that the revenue that can be generated.

168
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:35,860
Meaning does the organization's mission allow for them to try to tap into other sources?

169
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:40,780
Or is the organization's mission broad?

170
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:46,870
But their actual talent and their actual people that are working there really can only deliver in a certain lane.

171
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:51,640
And so therefore being able to tap into something more would require a greater capacity.

172
00:19:52,540 --> 00:20:07,749
Capacity, um, and uh, and also whether or not we would be able to see that the organization, uh, can benefit from that increase.

173
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:12,400
So if they don't have any staff to be able to do what it is that they're getting dollars to do,

174
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:15,940
and that's not going to really serve them in terms of increasing or diversifying.

175
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,280
So think all this together.

176
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:26,080
I just want to kind of keep everyone just kind of thinking about this tension, which is the organization has to make decisions for itself.

177
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:28,180
It has to make decisions for its workforce,

178
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:35,170
and it has to make decisions about the priorities that it's setting and sometimes the budgetary decisions that it makes,

179
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:41,139
even if it's not reflective of perhaps the most inclusive service for its constituents,

180
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:46,300
may reflect who works there and who they have the ability to have working on certain things.

181
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:54,129
Um, and so then it falls back again on the board to be able to say, okay, you know, let's look at the mission and really be clear.

182
00:20:54,130 --> 00:21:00,040
What is it that we're missing? What is it that we should be doing? What's the vision for where we're heading moving forward?

183
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:06,530
So excellent. Okay. I'm going to pause that my next slide.

184
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:10,180
But now we're going to jump to our first point events. Who wants to go first today?

185
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:16,510
Okay. Fair knows that. I don't think the size is that long.

186
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:35,560
And again, reminder, you can sit down from where you are and appear whatever you'd like to be.

187
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:42,820
And that's fine. Alcohol abuse just.

188
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:09,360
Hi everyone. I'm doing my current presentation on the impact of climate change in Africa.

189
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,380
I'm with is this year. Many African countries have experienced natural disasters.

190
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:23,130
Climate change on this month alone in Nigeria experiencing the country has had in decades.

191
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:28,200
In April there was severe flooding and landslide caused by heavy rainfall in South Africa

192
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:32,700
and tropical storms have disrupted the lives of thousands of eastern and southern Africans.

193
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:40,890
And also across the Horn of Africa. At least 36.1 million people have been affected by security problems in 2022.

194
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:49,930
So Africa's contribution to global climate change.

195
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:54,550
Africa is responsible for less than 4% of the global greenhouse gas emission.

196
00:22:55,060 --> 00:23:01,510
However, the richest 10% of the world's population are responsible for all of your carbon emissions.

197
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:05,050
Africa is the most vulnerable region in the world to the change in climate,

198
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:10,330
and five out of the ten countries most impacted by climate change are in Africa.

199
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:18,710
And some of the effects of climate change include weather patterns that are seen in the continent,

200
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:26,250
agricultural and food impacts, water supply and quality impacts on human health, shelter, vulnerable population,

201
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:34,980
national security and ecosystems, and most commonly reported health hazards on the continent and the continent as drought,

202
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:43,410
flash floods, extreme rainstorms and precipitation, and also extreme temperatures, including extreme heat wave.

203
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:54,020
The direct impact on the contract itself is that almost a quarter of a billion Africans will face water scarcity by 2025.

204
00:23:54,440 --> 00:24:01,460
And also tropical storms, like you stated in southern Africa displaced half of a million people in just three months this year alone,

205
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:06,830
if 46 million people don't have access to food or enough food in the Horn of Africa,

206
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:13,760
hundreds of millions swarmed East Africa in 2020, affecting agriculture in the region.

207
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:19,100
And then also 86 million Africans could be forced to leave their homes by 2050.

208
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:24,350
And then one in three deaths from extreme weather happen in Africa, including floods,

209
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:31,610
landslides and drought and specifically wealthy countries commitment to fighting climate change.

210
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:36,419
So wealthy countries in particular, like the United States and Western Europe,

211
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:41,600
nations have admitted the largest share of greenhouse gases that has led to the current climate crisis,

212
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:47,870
which includes 23 developed nations responsible for half of the historical CO2 emissions.

213
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:51,349
However, on these developing nations, however,

214
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:57,319
it's the developing nations that are being hit the hardest by the effects of climate change but are the least ready to respond.

215
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:10,370
And fortunately, in 2009, the United Nations Climate Summit and a bunch of wealthier nations made a collective commitment to raise $100 billion

216
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:18,920
annually from 2020 to 2025 for these developing nations to reduce their emissions and prepare for climate change.

217
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:25,790
However, when 2020 came unfortunately and failed to meet the 2020 target that they had,

218
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:31,310
and they also clearly didn't define what they would pay for, how they would measure the outcomes of success.

219
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:41,670
And that picture just shows the 23 richest nations responsible for half of the manmade carbon emissions on record.

220
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,330
But do you just only equate to 12% of the global population?

221
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:57,920
Which if you look at the ratio, it's kind of crazy. And the nonprofit organization focusing on is the Africa Climate and Environment Foundation.

222
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:03,300
ECF is an international nonprofit that was recently established of 2020.

223
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:09,270
It was established to address issues including poverty, climate change, biodiversity loss,

224
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:13,620
inequality, illiteracy, environmental degradation and healthcare across Africa.

225
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:22,020
So it tries the Times to address the lot of issues that the continent faces, including climate change being some of their most e-mails.

226
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:30,690
Most of their focus is on ongoing. The mission is to engage extensively on a multifaceted climate change action,

227
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:36,509
sustainable environmental protection related activities that would help bridge property gap,

228
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:40,920
mitigate climate change, and protect the environment and conserve natural resources altogether.

229
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:48,510
Typically, the organization is a youth driven organization that has expanded to over 20 countries in Africa

230
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:55,670
within a year and a half that it's been established and also has more than 600 members and volunteers

231
00:26:55,680 --> 00:27:00,569
and then African youths from different professional educational backgrounds voluntarily converge

232
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:06,270
to address these issues relating to climate change under the umbrella of the organization.

233
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:15,900
And if you go to the next slide, some of their efforts and projects that they focus on is climate change mitigation adaptation,

234
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:23,190
which includes that the organization has taken it upon themselves to be a forefront in the fight against climate change in Africa.

235
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:33,150
Although they recognize that climate change could destabilize the local markets and increase food insecurity and also limit economic growth.

236
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:42,090
So what they've focused on in particular was nature based solutions to climate change by planting trees throughout the country.

237
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:46,440
Another project that they have is water, hygiene and sanitation.

238
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:56,820
An organization is committed to providing a lasting solution to water sanitation across across the continent through advocacy in rural communities.

239
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,800
And another project that they're also focusing on is solid waste management.

240
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:11,190
So current waste management practices in Africa are causing economic and social environmental impacts across the continent, unfortunately.

241
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:16,379
And there's an urgent need for these countries to address this current challenge.

242
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:23,790
And what the US has come up with is to improve waste management methods through provision of community waste management facilities.

243
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:29,130
And the organization is committed in constructing controlled dumpsites across Africa.

244
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:34,410
However, the work that this organization is doing is on a smaller scale,

245
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:39,720
whereas they work with certain communities across the continent and is a relatively new one.

246
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:44,100
It has a lot of building and work that it needs to continue to do.

247
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:54,740
However, this is just one organization trying to address a global issue where as like climate change and it's a global impact,

248
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:59,399
so it requires a global effort, which takes me to my discussion.

249
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:05,670
Questions Should wealthier nations who have contributed the most to climate change be required to provide support through

250
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:12,000
resources and funding to countries who are impacted the most by climate change but have contributed to lower rates?

251
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:20,820
And then the second question is how can nonprofit organizations in countries impacted by climate change or the top contributing countries accountable?

252
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:40,370
I can answer the first. I feel like maybe in an ideal world, perhaps this was my answer to everything.

253
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:44,320
But ideally yes. But I don't know.

254
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:49,700
I mean, that wouldn't ever happen. I think may be what wealthier nations should do is like.

255
00:29:52,430 --> 00:30:01,140
I don't know. It creates some sort of. Maybe create allies with some of the countries that they've harmed and help them in a different way.

256
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:07,260
I don't I don't know. But like in terms of providing funding, I just don't think that's something that would happen.

257
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:10,860
Something like maybe they can help them in a different way or something.

258
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,559
Yeah, that's a good point, because when I was looking into it,

259
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:20,340
there's a lot of there's like a handful of organizations in Africa that are like combating

260
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:24,810
climate change and it has to do with like other wealthier nations contributing to the effort.

261
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:31,469
However, like the 2009 summit that happened, these wealthier nations are not doing what they're supposed to be doing,

262
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:35,990
even though they're responsible for half of the change. So it's really unfortunate.

263
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:46,760
But I just one was wondering if there's a way that these countries can be held responsible for accountable for their contributions.

264
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:54,710
You know, it's interesting to your point and your question, especially number two, I think that this is a this is a bit of a.

265
00:30:55,800 --> 00:31:01,990
A challenge for some of the especially the domestic ones. So in your chart, can you show me the facts?

266
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:09,300
Um, so the U.S. makes of what is the 2025 like a quarter of this.

267
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:17,840
But all the organizations that would be advocating for changes in the U.S. are only going to be influencing U.S. change.

268
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:24,680
And so where we've seen lots of these organizations that we talk about where they can directly advocate here,

269
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:32,150
we're contending with trying to advocate in all these other countries where they don't necessarily have much clout or ability to do anything.

270
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:38,509
So it's interesting that you pose this because in a lot of ways, as you asked this question of, you know,

271
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:44,060
how can these organizations and countries serve both the top contributing countries accountable?

272
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:50,140
The U.N. is almost the closest thing. And as we know, there's a lot of challenge there.

273
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:54,610
Yeah, this is very much reflecting on this very provocative question.

274
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,680
Based off that as well.

275
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:07,440
I think the only way that we'll ever get to holding folks to accountable would be for the citizens of these individual nations,

276
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:09,760
creating movements and putting pressure on the government.

277
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:14,970
I think it's unlikely that other countries putting pressure on us will move the needle far enough.

278
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:20,159
And so I think there is a lot of good movements happening and it just like it needs more people.

279
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:23,670
It needs more power to to get this to.

280
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:30,650
I think you're asking the big questions of our time.

281
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:36,649
But I think go to the second question and maybe not so much nonprofit organizations.

282
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:45,559
But, you know, I think at some point the fight against climate change will probably be similar to how we deal with war now,

283
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:53,180
and that if countries don't get on board, we impose sanctions and those sorts of things on those countries until they agree, like, okay,

284
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:58,700
we're going to also take action on this because otherwise I don't think people are going to.

285
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:03,740
I don't think that countries are going to do anything because I think in the United States, at least, that's you know,

286
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:08,149
I feel like a Republican talking point is like, well, if China doesn't do anything,

287
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:11,780
then there's no point anyway, so why should we spend the money, etc., etc.

288
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:19,070
Thank you. Where's China on that? Yeah, I think I was wondering the same thing I was talking about.

289
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:25,460
China was an idea of what I was looking at. I think it's like the 23 recommendations I.

290
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:37,110
When I was, I had the same question. I don't know why I don't get all that research from PDF documents, but I think it's just ones.

291
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:44,980
So there is one more point about, you know, how the developed countries down towards the UN processes, like we say to the developing countries.

292
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:49,540
So then the manufacturing, I mean the authors with the knowledge,

293
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:56,200
the manufacturing countries headache of how the how the process if it is polluting the environment, how they control it.

294
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:04,060
And the second point is also like they could be, you know, some rule out some policy level change that would be needed.

295
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:11,709
Like, like in India plastics are like buying your own gain was when I came to you with the plastics we just didn't grow goods and everything.

296
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:17,350
It all it was I mean it's nice and the thing that the figure is to so far losing everything

297
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:22,060
the ones were needed and in like if you buy a plastic you have to be like for example,

298
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:26,740
you plastic man, you don't get it like free. So and that was done to curb the pollution.

299
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:29,080
So I think these two things are also they.

300
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:39,679
Even when I was looking into how these countries are responding to climate change within themselves, it's never, never a proactive thing.

301
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:45,620
It's always a reactive thing simply because there's other pressing issues that a lot of these African nations are facing.

302
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:50,750
So climate change isn't necessarily like their first worry in a country.

303
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:57,250
I want to just bring us back to the nonprofit organization component of this because I, I,

304
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,819
I think that this speaks to and we'll talk about in a few weeks about advocacy inside of these organizations.

305
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:07,649
I know many of these presentations you've you've highlighted, as many of you highlighted this.

306
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:09,780
And it's important is important important to.

307
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:21,270
The organizations that are advocating typically have to come up with some kind of other of a policy lever or something that they're advocating for.

308
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:26,969
And I wonder what everyone's thoughts are on kind of have we seen a consistent

309
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:31,580
message or a coalition of organizations that have been able to really speak to this,

310
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:40,620
thinking back on kind of what what went down with Build Back Better renamed the Inflation Reduction Act at the last minute.

311
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:52,160
And kind of what you know what what was the mechanism by which that bill had all of the sort of pieces in it or climate related issues?

312
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:57,650
Of course it's not. To the extent of perhaps what it was initially contemplated.

313
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:02,400
But I wonder if if looking at sort of who the key champions were for that,

314
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:09,180
whether or not there had been a consistent strategy to try and get certain cards into the legislation so that it would pass?

315
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:16,260
It's a good question. I mean, this organization is relatively new, so I'd like to see like in a few years time.

316
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:20,090
How they address that. Right. Right.

317
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:27,130
I can I can, like touch on that little just because I worked on the IRA a little bit.

318
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:33,850
And so one of the biggest issues with the climate piece was that a lot of the organizations that were pitching for,

319
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:40,780
you know, like suggesting these really great things that would curb climate change, it was just not realistic.

320
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:50,099
Like it was something that. If we lived in an ideal world that both Democrats and Republicans would say, like, Yeah, let's put our money towards this.

321
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:53,400
But they were like a lot of the orgs had.

322
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:58,690
A lot of really good like research and their findings and stuff to back it up.

323
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:01,929
But it was just like, we're not going to have about it.

324
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:05,569
And it was like, we're not spending our money like that and like the money has to be put somewhere else.

325
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:07,030
So we're just going to say that type of thing.

326
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:17,739
So that's kind of why it got watered down a lot, which is probably we kind of assumed what happened because as great as the bill,

327
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:21,280
Doc Feder Bill was, that was just wasn't going to get passed as it was.

328
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,740
But yeah, that was just kind of. It wasn't realistic.

329
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:28,950
I think it was a big thing. So I want to leave time for our other presenters.

330
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:33,809
But I appreciate this presentation and your thoughtful questions because I think you're helping us to

331
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:39,540
see very clearly where there are emerging issues and where an organization like the one that you are,

332
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:44,310
you're looking at specifically to address issues of climate change on the African continent.

333
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,930
Is is and I assume that's kind of there for focus.

334
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:54,479
So, you know, these organizations is I think is just different than some of the other ones we're talking about,

335
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,130
because in a lot of ways, there is advocacy that has to go on inside.

336
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:06,420
Particular country inside a particular continent, trying to gain consensus for a geopolitical piece.

337
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:12,660
And then I would also just say, as one closing thought on this, it just poses a question for everybody.

338
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:19,410
If the proposals that an organization is bringing forward are destined to be watered down,

339
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:26,730
then what is the organization's leadership sort of doing to counteract that?

340
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:33,600
Perception and come forward with ideas that don't get labeled as, quote, watered down.

341
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,000
So just give that some thought.

342
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:43,950
Because I think that that to the point that you were making or questions or, you know, there is a clear intent of what needs to happen.

343
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:55,950
And then there's the reality of what is actually possible. So this excellent presentation and I'll say that about the next two.

344
00:38:56,100 --> 00:39:02,930
Okay. He wants to go to New York.

345
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:14,020
If I didn't, how did you send us? Like I like a nice to person.

346
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:29,100
I guess you would think.

347
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:39,640
All right. All parties and so everyone representation.

348
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:44,030
I'm going to be talking about the body. I don't know if a lot of you guys know about the body,

349
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:49,850
but it was just celebrated yesterday and it's current event for me and there's like a number of reasons why I pick this topic,

350
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:55,760
but then we do them slowly. So also Diwali is like a highlight for almost every Indian.

351
00:39:56,750 --> 00:40:00,510
For the past few years in Delhi, it's been turning from a festival to a nightmare.

352
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:08,210
I said, You guys, the reasons why? So starting over the crisis, this was an article published in India today, which was on October 23rd,

353
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:13,970
which says that among the ten most polluted cities in Asia are eight are from India.

354
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:18,860
On top of that, I think is Gurugram or Gurukul, which is like a surrounding city to Delhi.

355
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:27,090
It has an AQI of 543 is the air quality index, AQI a 543 as you can see on the meter on the right, it's quality.

356
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:30,290
Beyond that, there's no measure of 4 to 543.

357
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:31,790
It's already beyond hazardous.

358
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:39,770
Delhi surprisingly managed to get up the list, but publishers are certain it won't be long that it gets back on the list after Diwali.

359
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:48,379
So before I jump into the reasons why the pollution is a crisis, I just wanted to talk about the geography so you guys understand it better.

360
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:55,760
So New Delhi, as we all know, is the capital of India. It's also a district in one of the ten districts in Delhi.

361
00:40:56,060 --> 00:41:01,310
And all the places that you see here, they come under the NCR or the national capital region.

362
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,870
So most of the places in the NCR are agriculture based places.

363
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:08,990
So it's like, you know, farming is their main source of income.

364
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:15,950
So at the start of every winter, which is from the body, the body marks the start of winters back in India.

365
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:24,290
So farmers in the states, New Delhi, they burn the residue from rice and other crops to make way for growing beef in 2020.

366
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:32,569
57,000 people died recently in Delhi as a result of exposure to the airport and sourced from 13 million plus vehicular emission waste burning,

367
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:34,700
industrial pollution and firefighters.

368
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:41,270
So the one thing that's pretty common back in the day with the government and the population is easiest way out is blame the poor.

369
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:48,020
Like I said, most of the surrounding states have an agricultural based like easiest way out for the people is blame the farmers like their farm.

370
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:52,670
Stubble burning is the main reason for low AQI, I mean lower quality in India.

371
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:56,149
But then from a study that was funded by the government,

372
00:41:56,150 --> 00:42:05,780
it was proven that farm stubble burning only contributes to 10% of the total pollution that's happening on November 15 of Hanford.

373
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:12,170
Again, another study conducted it was concluded that the bonfire only contributed to 10% of the PM 2.5 particle pollution beam.

374
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:19,700
2.5 is the it's like the concentration of hazardous particles in the air that you can breathe without having any consequences to it.

375
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:25,730
But it was 48% a week earlier, like until eight November.

376
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:32,990
And we also knew that Diwali was celebrated in on 4th of November in 2021.

377
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:40,070
So we can see why there was a certain fall in the particulate matter in the air.

378
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:48,079
So going on to the starts, you can see this was a study conducted by the Central Pollution Control Board,

379
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,810
which is like an environmental regulation authority back in India.

380
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:58,100
And you can see Delhi has consistently maintained the hazardous status for five or six years.

381
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,370
On the right you can see that before and after Diwali.

382
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:08,390
So most of the pollution that happens in the month of November is subjected to five factor usage.

383
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:17,209
So actually the nightmare that comes because of Diwali is actually the firecrackers that people are very much like invested in back in Delhi.

384
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:22,550
So over the last few years, Delhi's has also it was hazardous.

385
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:28,430
The condition became so bad that has good professionals were suggesting and

386
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:32,450
recommending cardiovascular patients to leave the city up there for a month,

387
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:33,829
at least after Diwali,

388
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:42,580
because the air was like a very bad auto sort of contribution from the firecrackers is light pollution the fire because waste is non-biodegradable,

389
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:51,830
so it stays there forever. It also has adverse effects on animals due to noise pollution, especially for animals who have elevated frequency.

390
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:56,750
You can hear elevated frequencies are now based on these things.

391
00:43:56,750 --> 00:44:04,579
There was a ban that was first implemented in 2017 on the five because by the government, but it was never strictly implemented and still illegal.

392
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:07,340
Sale happens in Delhi every year from the neighboring states.

393
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:13,430
So now Sunil Dahiya is one of the analysts for the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air.

394
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:18,349
Now he says that the fight back abandoned seemed to be successful in Delhi, which led to hazardous pollution levels,

395
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:23,480
adding a top of the existing federal sources, which I spoke about, the vehicular emission and the industrial emission.

396
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:31,420
Moving on to the infamous Daily five packet ban. I only call it infamous because it was implemented, like I said, five years ago.

397
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:37,989
But still, at this point, people I mean, I still saw stories of people posting like a five foot user of firecrackers in the room like yesterday.

398
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:44,020
So. So in 2017, the Supreme Court banned the sale of firecrackers for the first time in Delhi.

399
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:49,569
It was openly disregarded by the population because, like I said, people are really invested in firecrackers.

400
00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:55,510
I don't know why, but. So in 2018, the government decided to find like a totally out.

401
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:59,889
What they did was they came up with the concept of green crackers, which is like which are still I mean,

402
00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:04,370
they impact the environment, but not as much as the traditional firecrackers would are.

403
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:07,209
So they came up with the concept of green crackers in 2018,

404
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:12,700
which wasn't very much appreciated by the people see them happening in 2019, but then they started to make an improvement.

405
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:17,640
They decided to cut down the window of boasting the green crackers from 8 to 10 p.m. only.

406
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:21,110
That didn't seem to work out as well.

407
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:28,090
So in 2020 they decided to completely ban the firecrackers, which was openly flouted by the public in 2020 and 21.

408
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:32,360
And in 21 we saw the air quality index in Delhi was really hazardous.

409
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:39,820
So in 2022, like this year, they are there's a complete ban on firecrackers, you know, supply or, you know, sales back in Delhi.

410
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:44,410
But like I said again, so people are like boosting firecrackers. So I don't know how strong this is.

411
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,740
And I think there's like one reason that contributes to people not giving up five

412
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:54,040
because is they haven't they haven't made any strict regulations around it.

413
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:58,899
Like even if you're caught using firecrackers, there's like usually be a fine of ₹200,

414
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:05,229
which should be like $3 in the US and you will be face like of like imprisonment

415
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:08,800
for six months only if you haven't got any government sources or anything.

416
00:46:11,050 --> 00:46:16,000
So based on this, based on the current scenario in Delhi, there's like a dire need of organizations to,

417
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,270
you know, get into the pollution zone and, you know, kind of like improve the conditions.

418
00:46:21,310 --> 00:46:25,820
So while I was looking at this topic, I came across this organization called Switch Up.

419
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:34,510
It's actually a nonprofit which is helping Delhi breathe. So we chose one of the six stories on CNN, which was.

420
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:37,989
So CNN has had this event called Be the Change and Switch.

421
00:46:37,990 --> 00:46:43,180
US activities were reported on CNN every week for one year in 2000, 8009.

422
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:49,510
And that's how, you know, they it was found out that they are being transparent in their you know, in their work.

423
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:54,230
And there's like many other organizations I'm working diligently sometimes and

424
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:59,589
me like good money that are working to improve the Delhi's unspoken crisis.

425
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:01,780
But I think switch is the one that's taking the lead for now.

426
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:08,360
So I don't know what to tell you that it was started in 2000 with the V for Yamuna campaign,

427
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:14,950
where they tried to raise awareness of, you know, among people towards going apathy towards those who were coming up.

428
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:16,709
The map that you see on the right,

429
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:23,900
the red line is the state that Yamuna River flows from at this point because of the crisis that's happening in Delhi,

430
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:27,290
which is aimed at planting 5000 to 7000 trees every year.

431
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:33,170
One of the oldest organizations working to increase the green color in Delhi, NCR and Delhi.

432
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:36,200
At this point they have planted 30,000 trees.

433
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:43,550
The key focus areas that that they are trying to implement or actually have implemented are environment, education and enterprises.

434
00:47:44,210 --> 00:47:48,650
They've also managed to link successfully collaborated with various international organizations like European Commission,

435
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:55,300
American Embassy on topics such as climate change and waste management. Uh, I think, I suppose,

436
00:47:55,310 --> 00:47:59,480
which I strongly believe in the path and combination of people and peoples potential

437
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:02,960
and energy mixed with the knowledge and wisdom on issues of sustainable development.

438
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:06,380
So I think that's the way are trying to make progress in Delhi.

439
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:12,440
Next. Yeah. So. So it's contribution.

440
00:48:14,370 --> 00:48:20,670
So each has contributions. So then are try to expand the green cover entirely by implementing must be plantations.

441
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:25,610
They have a campaign called the Monsoon Body Campaign, which in which they invite people,

442
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:29,880
mostly youngsters, to unite, encourage them to plant trees in the open areas.

443
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:36,270
So one of the campaigns was the face lifting of the Asiad Park in West Delhi,

444
00:48:36,270 --> 00:48:42,390
which was abandoned in, I think 2011, and then for a period of ten years.

445
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:48,600
They worked on the park and then they were able to increase the gold leaf cover from 5% to 90%.

446
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:54,610
The picture on the top that you see is before and after of the Monsoon Wedding Project.

447
00:48:54,630 --> 00:49:00,060
So that was the reason. I think it's a fair choice. They started calling it The Little Eden because of the way it looks at this point.

448
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:08,969
They also conduct campaigns such as Town in collaboration with other non-profits, such as Let me be let me tell you this, another organization,

449
00:49:08,970 --> 00:49:14,100
which is also an online community, which invites people to share their experiences and bios,

450
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:17,250
experiences about how pollution has impacted them and their families.

451
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:24,750
They've also been conducting frequent workshops on environmental conservation and waste management, targeting the youth in the city specifically.

452
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:34,530
This was a statement that kind of touched me. It's a statement by a 32 year old migrant worker in Delhi who says that we're trying to slow down,

453
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:40,940
but we can't think of going anywhere else because our work is here. This gets me to the discussion question.

454
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:46,530
First, for most Indians, five package views is a substantial portion of the celebration.

455
00:49:46,770 --> 00:49:51,090
Given this leading fightback would seem to be a better alternative to an absolute ban.

456
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:57,870
Or should five Pakistan be the last focus area after deforestation, industrial and vehicular pollution and based on any order?

457
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:10,870
I have a clarifying question. When you say firecracker, you mean is that is that synonymous with in sort of July 4th year, fireworks up in the air?

458
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:18,330
I mean, what what kind of when you say you saw pictures of people shooting up like one at a time or do they do like pyro?

459
00:50:18,370 --> 00:50:23,029
No, it's like it's actually while I mean, if you look at it, you might not want to see it.

460
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:27,700
It's like that. But I don't know how people enjoy it. I mean, I used to enjoy it back then, but like what?

461
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:33,340
It's like it's done on a mass level. Like they would probably post like 10,000 crackers at a time.

462
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:37,000
They would just like to just stand by and just go up in the air.

463
00:50:37,630 --> 00:50:40,600
Yeah, in the air. As well as the one on on the road.

464
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:47,590
I mean, I'm pretty common ones out here that people go on the roads, but I'll get it's mostly Indian, but back in India, it's like all this sort of.

465
00:50:47,770 --> 00:50:54,680
Wow. Yeah. I have a question that we thought you can or can't buy them.

466
00:50:54,890 --> 00:50:58,970
Is is it like is there a ban on buying it? Like do do stores sell it?

467
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:06,350
Yes, there's a ban. So there's a ban on any sort of contact with vodka because you can't, like, sell it.

468
00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:13,549
You can't produce it and you can't use it. So then how do they get it? So that's the that's like because it's implemented in Delhi specifically.

469
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:17,310
And like I showed you the map links surrounding places. Yes.

470
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:23,800
So now imagine the hunger and people like how they're invested, that they're actually online, like ordering goods online.

471
00:51:23,810 --> 00:51:29,730
So. Yeah. So it's you say it reminds you just to connect the two presentations.

472
00:51:29,730 --> 00:51:34,800
FERDOWSI That you were talking about and of, you know, organizations advocating it to other countries.

473
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:45,060
It's similar here. I mean, if an organization can't in fact, the other problem is the provinces or districts or districts districts.

474
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:50,850
The other districts, it doesn't I mean, how how can you really stop the stop solution?

475
00:51:56,330 --> 00:52:03,409
Yeah. I'd like a policy standpoint, I guess like there are still a bunch of demand for the firecrackers.

476
00:52:03,410 --> 00:52:07,010
Like, as you said, it's part of the Diwali celebration.

477
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:13,940
So I feel like just leaving that the land there and then introducing a ban is the problem to me,

478
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:20,450
cause you're basically creating that alternative market where people are bringing it from the other surrounding areas.

479
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,340
So I think like they have to.

480
00:52:23,610 --> 00:52:32,420
Or we should try to like introduce a better alternative than the Green Packers, like something that has a better impact on the environment.

481
00:52:32,430 --> 00:52:40,020
Like, I don't know. I think the ban without a good alternative already in place was a problem with like implementation wise.

482
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:43,780
That's a fair point. So it gives me thinking a little bit.

483
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:45,910
This is adding this into the discussion here.

484
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:52,870
It gets me thinking a little bit about many of the behaviors that we've asked people to change in the last decade, say,

485
00:52:52,870 --> 00:52:59,290
in response to some of these challenges that the nonprofit organizations are specifically working to try and advance.

486
00:52:59,290 --> 00:53:07,809
So masking during COVID, I think of another example vehicle purchase.

487
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:13,480
So you know, non combustible engine vehicles, electric vehicles, etc., etc.

488
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:21,640
But it's interesting because if the tradition or the social kind of construction is around using it.

489
00:53:22,090 --> 00:53:28,299
To your point, Christiana, if if the if the tradition is to let off fireworks and then you just say, you know,

490
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:35,230
that's it, you can't have them anymore, then it begs the question, it's the same thing with with respiratory illnesses.

491
00:53:35,590 --> 00:53:39,639
You know, if everybody's accustomed to going in and out when they're ill or not.

492
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:42,880
Well, you know, and then you tell people now you can't.

493
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:47,379
It's just there's a social component to it beyond just the policy.

494
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:51,910
So I, I think about these organizations and the management of them.

495
00:53:52,330 --> 00:54:00,820
I think how are they even supposed to advocate for anything if the actual societal pressure is is not going to be something you can address?

496
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:05,590
That was a very long musing. But honey, go ahead. Yeah. And also there is one more thing.

497
00:54:05,590 --> 00:54:10,450
So when the body starts, you will see all these campaigns and media coming very close to you.

498
00:54:10,450 --> 00:54:14,020
Must people everybody wins the valley without fire goes without it.

499
00:54:14,590 --> 00:54:19,220
But then what also happens is that people like for you to get it,

500
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:23,350
because then you're allowed to go in coffins during weddings, you're allowed to burn crackers during you.

501
00:54:23,350 --> 00:54:28,389
You survive only divinely, ban it completely if you want to do like ban and given daily.

502
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:36,730
Daily always has had this pollution issue. That's why the chief minister of Delhi came with this even odd rule also to curb the pollution.

503
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:41,320
So Delhi and eventually is is prone to pollution and burning firecrackers don't.

504
00:54:41,470 --> 00:54:44,230
But I also agree that we shouldn't burn firecrackers.

505
00:54:44,230 --> 00:54:51,190
But there is this element also which and you should especially see Twitter during the binding because everybody will come out and say,

506
00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:56,049
you know, there's divided on both characters. Then the person would start getting trolled because that person would have

507
00:54:56,050 --> 00:54:59,980
posted firecrackers or something during New Year or something or they'll post,

508
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:06,220
you know, these videos from Australia coming in or other countries during your celebration and so much of firecrackers getting blown.

509
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:12,120
So some that they feel downgraded that ban it completely by Diwali is being targeted on these.

510
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:15,600
All right. Thank you. Thank you for sharing that idea.

511
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:22,990
And I appreciate you sharing that perspective because I I think that it's there are multiple aspects to it.

512
00:55:22,990 --> 00:55:30,100
I'm more we're talking about this. I'm reminded and reminded a bit of kind of what non-profits roles were during the

513
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:36,010
change in smoking behavior in the United States or even globally that matter.

514
00:55:36,370 --> 00:55:40,480
And despite policy attempts and all kinds of other things,

515
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:46,749
it was really the social norms that had to change before you could really have any of this policy take effect.

516
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:53,559
So it's interesting to think that while an organization could spend a ton of its resources trying to advocate for a policy change,

517
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:58,220
here we see an example of the policy change happen and nobody complies with the policy.

518
00:55:59,770 --> 00:56:00,580
It's fascinating.

519
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:06,780
That's a fair point that I just made because I feel like, honestly, five, because like I said, it's a highlight for people in the neighborhood.

520
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:10,929
So it happens like every like in all the places, like even in the villages they can New Orleans.

521
00:56:10,930 --> 00:56:20,290
But like the fact that it's a problem in itself shows that in that it's done like on a huge scale, like people get like cars full of firecrackers.

522
00:56:20,290 --> 00:56:25,629
I don't know what for, but like, actually, I'm not talking about like just regular, like compact cars,

523
00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:31,240
like the big SUVs and fill the crackers and then come back and it's just like waste of money.

524
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:39,639
They but like at this point, like, they're getting rid of, like, you know, supplied from different states, like in that quantity in bulk.

525
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:42,860
So it's like. It's kind of fun.

526
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:48,150
Yeah. Christiana that last point and will conclude for this production.

527
00:56:48,630 --> 00:56:51,240
Yeah, I can kind of touch on the second part a little bit. Yeah.

528
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:58,680
I was just wondering if there was a need for a nonprofit type partner with some sort of organization

529
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:05,079
that could make that alternative to the fireworks or could get like two hour fireworks.

530
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:07,020
So you have to think about what environment like,

531
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:14,069
do they like export them or should they import them or like partner with an organization that's like green?

532
00:57:14,070 --> 00:57:20,220
I wouldn't know how to make that better alternative. Think that to be a potential nonprofit impact?

533
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:25,570
No, it's a great point. I don't mean to interrupt you. My interpretation of those of you,

534
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:31,780
how do you it sounds like you also have some background in this and not if you don't don't I don't mean to imply that this

535
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:39,870
is the is the issue the actual one that they're using or is it just that there's so many like that the volume is so large,

536
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:48,690
the volume is not in any specific versus the volumes. Interesting because I imagine we we like that many here over the July 4th season it.

537
00:57:50,610 --> 00:57:54,210
But I feel like I'm just thinking, like, for for the delay. I think it's spread out, too.

538
00:57:54,240 --> 00:58:01,469
Like, I've never or only, like, sometimes I'll see two fireworks relatively in, like a few mile radius.

539
00:58:01,470 --> 00:58:07,920
So, like, I feel like it's you can go in to different places and but they're not all in one spot.

540
00:58:07,950 --> 00:58:12,000
You know, I'm not I don't see like consistently in the sky somewhere I'm not everyone's doing it.

541
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:16,440
So yeah it's like so I'm push on that then which is that that's a social norm.

542
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:19,139
I would, I would suggest that we could consider,

543
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:26,459
which is the tradition here in the United States is that you go to your municipal show or your city show where

544
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:34,200
your county show is not that everyone makes their own show because I could have done that in the United States.

545
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:37,259
I you could picture a very similar kind of situation.

546
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:41,669
You know, no one's allowed the fireworks anymore and it's July 4th and people are going, wait a minute.

547
00:58:41,670 --> 00:58:46,110
I thought I what do you mean? All right, that's outrageous.

548
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:50,700
That's a good look at the pictures on my phone. It's like kind of beautiful.

549
00:58:52,370 --> 00:58:57,479
It's like a really horrible I mean, just to touch on that, like if you saw this one.

550
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:00,530
So this is a picture from this Diwali. So this is. Are you.

551
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:03,870
Yeah. Which which side are you on? Oh, yeah, exactly.

552
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:07,870
I mean. Oh, no, that's the last one.

553
00:59:07,950 --> 00:59:16,000
Like the first one. Yeah.

554
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:19,710
So this is a picture from this DVD like it was. This happened like maybe two days ago.

555
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:24,420
I guess I'm biased. So this is like, yeah, it's like you said, it's pretty sad.

556
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:29,430
This is a reason for lighting the most number of days.

557
00:59:29,430 --> 00:59:34,940
And I mean, I think it looks like really pretty. I mean I. Oh yeah. Has emotional thing was it the birthplace of Lord.

558
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:38,510
Yeah and that's related. That's the reason.

559
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:44,990
I mean the reason something is but it's the birthplace of Lord Drummond. The Valley celebrated because of the victory of Lord Rommel.

560
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:51,780
And so that's the reason I used Yahoo! So you can even.

561
00:59:54,050 --> 01:00:00,730
I have a really off topic question. I like I was just thinking about like the nonprofit and how they use.

562
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:03,930
Do you know what that's like through the effective way to reduce pollution?

563
01:00:04,770 --> 01:00:08,099
I was able to do this podcast that long ago that was talking about organizations to

564
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:12,239
plant trees and about how like they like plant them and then like don't do any care.

565
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:19,170
So a lot of them die anyways. And just like at, like this level of pollution, is that like really effective?

566
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:27,630
So it's like, I think some studies show that one like fully grown tree can supply oxygen both of.

567
01:00:28,890 --> 01:00:34,470
Three people for a lifetime or something like that. And the thing with Switch, I is like, that's a fair point.

568
01:00:34,510 --> 01:00:40,470
Like, sometimes you might find a tree and not look after it and it might just go as much as Twitter has, like a conversion rate of 95%.

569
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:44,490
So yeah, so they also like look after the thing.

570
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:52,169
So like, like the, the photograph that you see for the little item that was for the better of ten years and where they completely like face different

571
01:00:52,170 --> 01:00:58,260
the place and at this point they have like a detox bar or something like that in that which was like about ten years ago.

572
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:03,010
So that's a good reason. Okay.

573
01:01:03,650 --> 01:01:07,680
You want to go to your house later? Oh. Okay.

574
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:18,679
So this. That's my dog. He was I put this picture specifically here because he was the main reason why I stopped posting backpackers.

575
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:23,050
Because. Because it used to be like if you dominated for him and used to it used to be painful for me to look at.

576
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:26,479
He just passed away a few days ago, like four or five years ago,

577
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:34,370
which was I'm trying to look on the bright side so I can say that it's fine because at least you didn't have to be the almost with the lobby, so.

578
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:37,790
Oh, I'm sorry for your loss.

579
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:42,210
That's a good. It's challenging. Bruce is not.

580
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:47,720
Part of who I am. Well, thank you for sharing that.

581
01:01:47,930 --> 01:01:53,650
Thank you for sharing your presentation. All right.

582
01:01:54,640 --> 01:02:02,530
I want to get through our last one and then we'll take a little break. So we.

583
01:02:04,290 --> 01:02:18,530
And that is what you said. It was clearly not given to people like you guys.

584
01:02:19,190 --> 01:02:24,150
Like it was really like.

585
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:31,250
She seemed just like I was like, okay, we're back.

586
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:38,500
So she. Yeah, I think so.

587
01:02:38,530 --> 01:02:44,950
Hey, guys. I decided to do my project on media and news literacy and misinformation.

588
01:02:47,770 --> 01:02:56,140
So the impact is 26% of us adults surveyed could correctly classify all factual statements presented to them.

589
01:02:56,440 --> 01:03:01,900
35% of us adults surveyed could correctly classify all five opinion statements presented to them,

590
01:03:02,350 --> 01:03:09,910
and 96% of U.S. high school students surveyed fail to challenge the credibility of an unreliable source.

591
01:03:10,330 --> 01:03:12,130
So the first two,

592
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:19,450
basically the survey was like people were given like ten questions and had to state which of them were facts and which of them were opinions.

593
01:03:19,450 --> 01:03:26,990
And those were the percentage of people that could. I'm right. So my whole presentation is on a newsletter,

594
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:31,850
and newsletter sees a foundational approach to media literacy identified by a

595
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:35,840
pedagogy that seems to teach learners how to think about their news information,

596
01:03:35,870 --> 01:03:43,189
not what to think about any particular source, and an emphasis on developing a healthy skepticism, but not a cynicism,

597
01:03:43,190 --> 01:03:51,410
a music of information, a dedication to the First Amendment, and a nonpartizan focus on specific, clear learning standards.

598
01:03:54,310 --> 01:03:57,879
And then just kind of going over the difference between misinformation and disinformation.

599
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:01,990
You guys might, you know, but misinformation is spread without the intent to mislead.

600
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:12,040
But disinformation is false information that is spread with the intent to mislead and deceive, manipulate or generate a revenue stream.

601
01:04:15,070 --> 01:04:20,620
And so the reason why I chose this topic was because I saw this article and I thought, hey,

602
01:04:20,650 --> 01:04:25,660
the midterm elections are coming up and thought, you know, like people, especially like young adults,

603
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:31,960
are becoming more and more vulnerable to social media and the vast array of misinformation that is easily spread,

604
01:04:32,290 --> 01:04:37,180
especially with the click of a button which could ultimately affect who they vote for.

605
01:04:38,020 --> 01:04:44,580
And in addition, a third of adults say that social media does more harm than good to their overall mental health and well-being.

606
01:04:44,590 --> 01:04:49,390
So I kind of piece those two together. I was like, okay, this is something that I want to talk about.

607
01:04:52,530 --> 01:04:57,389
So especially for the midterm elections, the there's Facebook, Twitter,

608
01:04:57,390 --> 01:05:04,650
TikTok and YouTube all announced saying that they would promise to combat disinformation ahead of the 2022 midterms,

609
01:05:05,010 --> 01:05:07,559
saying that they're committed to protecting the election process.

610
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:12,450
But a recent report said those measures were ineffective, strictly enforced or simply too limited.

611
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:19,420
And so the nonprofit that I bring to you guys today is the News Literacy Project.

612
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:22,750
And basically the mission of the News Literacy Project.

613
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:25,780
A nonpartisan educational nonprofit founded in 2008,

614
01:05:25,780 --> 01:05:30,880
is to build a national movement to advance the practice of news literacy throughout American society,

615
01:05:31,540 --> 01:05:38,770
and by creating better informed, more engaged and more empowered individuals and ultimately a stronger democracy.

616
01:05:44,430 --> 01:05:51,959
And one way that they do that is they have a whole bunch of resources on their websites and they

617
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:57,360
also have like actual webinars around this time during the election season that they contribute.

618
01:05:57,360 --> 01:06:03,660
And not only do they have that, that they have a podcast, they have graphics, they have like public service announcements,

619
01:06:03,990 --> 01:06:16,590
and they have a whole guide on when and where to go vote and provide these resources to students specifically like in schools as well.

620
01:06:22,670 --> 01:06:32,400
Okay. So this is something that we saw. There's a reason why I get this, but basically, I don't know if you guys saw this, but there is like.

621
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:42,180
A whole doctored video or a photo of Dr. Oz used to seeing his star.

622
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:48,870
But then somehow someone took it and they kind of like tried twisting the story and like,

623
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:55,000
put Donald Trump started instead and it went viral and everyone was like, Oh my God, I can't believe he's doing that.

624
01:06:55,210 --> 01:07:00,970
You know, this is why you should vote Democrat, all this different stuff and it spread.

625
01:07:00,970 --> 01:07:03,129
And like there was a bunch of retweets and everything.

626
01:07:03,130 --> 01:07:08,800
There's a whole news article and there are articles out that were like to debunk whatever was going on.

627
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:14,410
But yeah, by the time that happened, it's like, you know, a lot of damage has already been done.

628
01:07:16,270 --> 01:07:19,899
But there is not figure. So the website itself like it's super cool.

629
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:28,000
They have like this app where you can kind of rank like fact or opinion and that's the kind of app that they give to the school,

630
01:07:28,390 --> 01:07:32,650
to the children, that they kind of teach their news literacy program to in school.

631
01:07:32,650 --> 01:07:35,680
And they download this app and like this is on their actual website.

632
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:44,310
It's called, you know, this full on Rumor, Rumor Garden, Rumor Guide.

633
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:49,570
And so it says right there, they have examples and it shows that's manipulated content.

634
01:07:49,870 --> 01:07:54,879
And then it says, no, this is not a genuine photo crap and say, yes, this is a doctor image.

635
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:59,590
And then there's like a whole take away about it and say like fact checkers from the AP Fact Check,

636
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:08,890
Reuters and the Associated Press investigated this photo using reverse image search and discovered that it was actually doctored.

637
01:08:09,010 --> 01:08:13,049
But. So the news literacy project themselves.

638
01:08:13,050 --> 01:08:23,400
Like a large project? Yes. A large part of their impact has to do with implementing a news literacy program into schools.

639
01:08:23,610 --> 01:08:27,990
And how they've done that is by using technology, which is the app that I was talking about.

640
01:08:28,530 --> 01:08:38,490
I looked at it, it was like different levels and stuff and they had said which ones fact which was opinion, which ones ad which it's not.

641
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:42,660
So yeah, they increased their users on that.

642
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:52,680
And the amount of educators that they've actually engaged to help take this program and implement it has increased a lot as well from 2018 to 2022.

643
01:08:53,070 --> 01:08:57,690
And then the Newsletter Nation members is just a bunch of members of educators that kind of

644
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:02,520
like help exchange like best practices on how to engage students and teach them these literacy.

645
01:09:09,180 --> 01:09:15,900
And these are my discussion questions How does misinformation and disinformation influence elections in the American political system?

646
01:09:16,260 --> 01:09:22,140
Can the government do anything about this? To what extent may the government be involved in the spreading of misinformation or disinformation?

647
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:26,090
And then what can be done to stop misinformation and disinformation spreading?

648
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:29,880
Who is responsible for doing so? What further roles do you see non-profits playing in this?

649
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:36,820
Can I share an example? So thanks for your presentation.

650
01:09:36,820 --> 01:09:46,209
But I was just thinking about I was just talking to someone about this actually an article and picture

651
01:09:46,210 --> 01:09:53,650
that's been circulating among different media sites of funnel being put in like toys and candy,

652
01:09:53,650 --> 01:10:02,080
which is like horrific. Right. But the way it was, it's like one stock photo that's being provided and then it's being.

653
01:10:03,010 --> 01:10:07,360
Politicized as like, Oh, see, this is why we need more Border Patrol.

654
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:11,050
But like, there's so many aspects that are not being acknowledged,

655
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:21,090
such as like primarily drugs are actually caught in the US with fentanyl and then how like it

656
01:10:21,270 --> 01:10:27,370
just like portraying this notion that drug cartels are like trying to kill all our children,

657
01:10:27,370 --> 01:10:33,040
but like the majority, that's like not their motive, you know, like their motive is to make money.

658
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:38,229
And I just I've just like, seen it be so politicized.

659
01:10:38,230 --> 01:10:46,510
And so I think the government, the way like the government could do something about like that specific example is just to give a more well-rounded

660
01:10:47,590 --> 01:10:55,510
picture of what's actually happening and what could be done differently rather than like skewing it to.

661
01:10:57,090 --> 01:11:01,730
Blame other countries or blame certain populations and scare people, you know?

662
01:11:02,430 --> 01:11:08,800
So that's kind of what I was thinking of. What comes to mind is like like how would they do that?

663
01:11:08,950 --> 01:11:13,600
You know, like that. I feel like it's something that's not really well established.

664
01:11:13,910 --> 01:11:17,670
Yeah, I have a lot to say on this. There's one book.

665
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:22,299
I'm going to keep it like this for a long time. It's called Battling the Big Lie, a really good book.

666
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:25,290
It talks specifically how Trump uses a lot,

667
01:11:25,330 --> 01:11:31,870
how he won his election based on disinformation and all of the lies by like the right wing propaganda and stuff.

668
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:37,810
So really good book for what Dan Pfeiffer, who worked was the communications director for Obama.

669
01:11:37,810 --> 01:11:43,870
What he was talking about was when you look at like the right wing has a lot more dangerous.

670
01:11:44,170 --> 01:11:50,889
They have a very strategic propaganda machine that they were able to effectively suppress black voters and

671
01:11:50,890 --> 01:11:56,500
they were also able to swing the Latino voters so that it would work in a way that Trump was elected.

672
01:11:56,500 --> 01:12:01,209
And so, like, that's how they like for the first part of the first question.

673
01:12:01,210 --> 01:12:08,050
But like genuinely, I feel like how the government can do anything is just like making sure that we amp up the strategy on the

674
01:12:08,050 --> 01:12:13,660
Democratic side so that because the thing is they've been playing this like this game for a really long time.

675
01:12:13,660 --> 01:12:19,570
And if we just sit back and don't also play not dirty, but like we just have to be strategic,

676
01:12:20,020 --> 01:12:25,569
then like the Republicans will continue to, to, you know, cause harm to democracy and stuff.

677
01:12:25,570 --> 01:12:31,660
So. But anyway, if anyone's really interested in misinformation, disinformation, I've definitely read that book.

678
01:12:31,660 --> 01:12:38,440
It's really, really good. It gets like kind of any gritty details, but it's really good and I'll stop talking about it.

679
01:12:39,670 --> 01:12:46,959
And I'm so I recently just watched a documentary about this doctor, Dr. Mercola, and never heard of him,

680
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:54,910
but he's basically this doctor who doesn't practice medicine but has this huge business and just like sells and a bunch of random stuff and posts,

681
01:12:54,910 --> 01:12:58,090
all these random articles, stuff that doesn't even make sense.

682
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:07,480
And it's funny. And to answer both of your questions, really, he had this whole YouTube channel on YouTube basically like censored him.

683
01:13:07,630 --> 01:13:13,420
And then he came out saying like the second I questioned the government, they censored me and told me I can't say it.

684
01:13:13,420 --> 01:13:18,100
So it's kind of a sticky situation of how to like stop spreading misinformation because there is the First Amendment,

685
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:21,129
but like, obviously, like you want the stuff out there.

686
01:13:21,130 --> 01:13:22,870
That's right and correct.

687
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:32,620
But I really think what your nonprofit is doing is really helpful because like the Internet is so new that people were like 40 plus,

688
01:13:32,620 --> 01:13:36,429
maybe like don't really know how to read the Internet correctly, I don't know, like whatever.

689
01:13:36,430 --> 01:13:40,809
But like even students like it. So that going to schools is great.

690
01:13:40,810 --> 01:13:47,860
And I think even just like going to like workplaces and like teaching them about literacy online and just like fact checking

691
01:13:47,860 --> 01:13:54,549
I think is super important to be done because people believe and want to believe things if something's going wrong,

692
01:13:54,550 --> 01:13:59,020
especially in health care, to fix something. So yeah.

693
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:03,360
At 41. How sorry.

694
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:16,410
Look, how can you show the statistics again on the, like 26% of the first statistic patients?

695
01:14:22,950 --> 01:14:31,490
So the 96% was the high school students. Yeah, I think for young people they are the most vulnerable.

696
01:14:32,490 --> 01:14:38,580
So, okay, interesting point. And I want to bring it back also we're talking about in the last two presentations.

697
01:14:38,590 --> 01:14:44,450
So the last two we were talking about this challenge of addressing the problem is not at all but in the

698
01:14:44,470 --> 01:14:51,450
policy and no one follows it where we can't advocate necessarily for places you don't have control over.

699
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:58,840
Here. You're talking about an organization that's looking to try and get traction inside of schools.

700
01:14:59,500 --> 01:14:59,860
Now,

701
01:14:59,860 --> 01:15:12,519
one of the strategies in the last year or so has been a kind of a hyper localized strategy around changing school board board members and other very,

702
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:20,980
very specifically niche local positions of authority, you know, clerks, supervisors, all of that.

703
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:30,190
So an organization like this that has this tool, if it wants to proliferate across the schools, say their strategy is,

704
01:15:30,190 --> 01:15:36,160
yeah, let's go into the schools, let's have the schools adopt this, and then that will help us combat this.

705
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:43,480
But what if the school board says no? Because the members of the school board know have been kind of.

706
01:15:45,060 --> 01:15:57,810
Absorbed by this information. That's actually why these click this model specifically works with states that have a link in their education policy.

707
01:15:57,810 --> 01:16:03,030
They they say like the kids have to be trained on a specific amount of like news literacy.

708
01:16:03,030 --> 01:16:05,370
And those are the states that they primarily work with.

709
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:11,790
So interesting you say that, because then I imagine that that list of states is likely the states where.

710
01:16:13,410 --> 01:16:18,770
This would be a more popular concept. Is that is that accurate or.

711
01:16:18,780 --> 01:16:24,569
I don't I'm not. So I'm stepping through because I think it's a great it's a really great

712
01:16:24,570 --> 01:16:29,879
presentation because I want you to see what Thursday's laid out for us is truly

713
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:35,970
a grassroots strategy that's very practical and very much on point with what we're going to what you're going to be doing for your second assignment,

714
01:16:36,420 --> 01:16:41,010
which is, okay, we've a great tool, little problem that we've identified.

715
01:16:41,250 --> 01:16:45,210
We have a way to address it now. We've got to get it implemented and disseminated.

716
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:48,000
So now we have to figure out where does it need to go.

717
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:54,090
So if it needs to go to places where there's going to be a wall up blocking us from being able to get in.

718
01:16:55,350 --> 01:17:02,670
Is it good? Okay, maybe we start in places where there's some reception, but then does it just become the same dichotomous kind of world?

719
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:09,270
Those states use that, but we have our own, which is essentially what is starting to emerge is social media.

720
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:15,310
Twitter is reserved for one group and now, you know, truth, social networks of truth,

721
01:17:15,330 --> 01:17:22,830
social is reserved for others, you know, so, you know, we've got two platforms going that are completely different.

722
01:17:23,170 --> 01:17:28,770
So it's very fascinating because I think you bring up a really great point I'm putting on the title, which states.

723
01:17:28,770 --> 01:17:33,659
But I think what you're highlighting is really this question, which is a big problem.

724
01:17:33,660 --> 01:17:36,870
And here's a nonprofit that's actually looking to do something about it.

725
01:17:36,990 --> 01:17:41,790
And could the government do this? Maybe, but the government may very well be the problem.

726
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:48,210
I'll be sharing. Yes. Sure.

727
01:17:48,620 --> 01:17:52,330
Central. I also just.

728
01:17:52,370 --> 01:17:54,650
You just need to figure out things like I.

729
01:17:55,280 --> 01:18:01,680
I see on Facebook like people I have some parts of Facebook and like, like when they get that, like a little,

730
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:05,690
like, banner that says like, you know, like that triggers stuff that this might not be accurate.

731
01:18:05,690 --> 01:18:08,120
Like, it's almost like a pride that you're like, Oh yeah.

732
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:11,930
And I got that check, you know, because, like, they don't trust, like, Facebook as an organization,

733
01:18:12,260 --> 01:18:16,819
I would have to be honest, when I go out, they still just are like your point people's posts. Like, I don't know.

734
01:18:16,820 --> 01:18:18,920
I think that that's a problem too. Like if there's,

735
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:25,460
there's no like trusted authority of like what is true that you guys are sure what it is that I don't know how to issue that can be solved.

736
01:18:25,870 --> 01:18:34,440
That's very true. I guess it really does depend on how you fact check as well, like which sources are credible to like.

737
01:18:34,490 --> 01:18:41,200
That's also one thing that I was like thinking of when I was like, it's hard to fact check certain things, right?

738
01:18:41,220 --> 01:18:43,340
Like you don't have access to all of the information.

739
01:18:43,340 --> 01:18:48,530
Like someone could say something ridiculous and it might be true, but it's like, how do you know really?

740
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:52,340
You don't have access to, like, all of that information.

741
01:18:53,120 --> 01:19:01,220
Yeah, I was gonna say like that. There was like a couple issues too with like the fact because, like, I think there's so much unity and, and.

742
01:19:02,770 --> 01:19:09,159
Like people. Yeah. There's so much unity in your party that regardless and I don't know,

743
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:15,430
the right wing has done this so effectively that regardless of whatever they say, even if it's debunked, they're still going to believe it.

744
01:19:15,430 --> 01:19:18,399
So there's like no trust. So that's why it's like, okay, we can debunk it.

745
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:25,209
And like Obama did when Trump was saying like he's not, he was even born in the US and whatever and he like showed that he was.

746
01:19:25,210 --> 01:19:28,240
But even still, people like to this day say, Oh, he wasn't even born here.

747
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:32,350
He's not even like our president and stuff. So it's like even if we have the tools to debunk,

748
01:19:32,350 --> 01:19:42,460
I feel like we have to focus on trying to I don't even know how to attack the right wing just because, like, it's crazy over there, bunch.

749
01:19:45,690 --> 01:19:49,720
Some people refuse to believe the facts. It's like having a new building trust.

750
01:19:49,940 --> 01:20:00,049
You know, there's no trust. I think we've identified in this presentation some of the challenge.

751
01:20:00,050 --> 01:20:07,340
And what we'll have to also keep in mind is that as information gets segregated,

752
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:16,520
factionalism can also emerge and it can become difficult to start regulating any information in terms of what what takes place.

753
01:20:16,910 --> 01:20:22,850
And so I would say that this is a great example of a nonprofit that's looking to try and create a solution.

754
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:30,290
And that would need to have to find an answer for how does it disseminate and implement the program that that that it's trying to advocate for.

755
01:20:30,770 --> 01:20:44,080
So it's a great, great presentation. I'm glad to have you all bring such wonderful ideas to share and really help us build prior concepts.

756
01:20:44,090 --> 01:20:47,090
Okay. I think everybody is ready to take a five minute break.

757
01:20:47,090 --> 01:20:53,930
So we're going to take a five minute break. We'll be back here five, 45, 45 minutes.

758
01:20:53,930 --> 01:20:59,878
And we'll take another break before you go, because I was asking what the implications of your commentary.

759
01:21:10,762 --> 01:21:14,852
You look. Just look. That's right.

760
01:21:17,972 --> 01:21:25,022
All right. So I want to take a few minutes just to talk a little bit about managing people is an area that we that we allude to.

761
01:21:26,822 --> 01:21:34,772
For those of you who are not familiar with the term human resource management, what we mean by that is planning of staff specifically.

762
01:21:35,552 --> 01:21:44,432
And the purpose of H.R. or Human Resources is really centered on the idea of improving skills effectiveness,

763
01:21:44,432 --> 01:21:49,322
engagement, promoting and uptake of associates.

764
01:21:50,282 --> 01:21:57,602
So there are several laws that govern the different parts of H.R. that we think about.

765
01:22:00,182 --> 01:22:07,921
Historically, historically, the U.S. employment law system was really governed by what we call at will.

766
01:22:07,922 --> 01:22:16,952
Employment is the idea that you could terminate another party, terminate by meeting, and their employment at any time for no cost.

767
01:22:18,232 --> 01:22:24,352
So in the 1940s, we saw laws that were passed to prohibit discriminatory firings.

768
01:22:24,592 --> 01:22:28,582
The Civil Rights Act in 1964 helped to codify some of this even more.

769
01:22:28,852 --> 01:22:36,112
And then there was another Civil Rights Act passed in 1991, which allowed cases of employees to be brought to a jury trial.

770
01:22:36,112 --> 01:22:41,242
And you've actually seen in the news quite a bit of these types of trials going on in recent years.

771
01:22:41,812 --> 01:22:46,371
So images click through here. Just to give you kind of a quick summary here.

772
01:22:46,372 --> 01:22:53,722
You see different labor legislation, areas that that have gone on for employment and for example,

773
01:22:53,722 --> 01:23:00,022
prohibiting discrimination, Equal Pay Act of 1963 National Labor Relations Act.

774
01:23:00,802 --> 01:23:05,432
There are more OSHA taking effect in 1970.

775
01:23:06,472 --> 01:23:14,662
And then the Workplace Act in 1988, as well as very similar one piece of legislation,

776
01:23:14,662 --> 01:23:19,732
the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Family Medical Leave Act,

777
01:23:20,782 --> 01:23:23,812
all the way up through here, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act,

778
01:23:23,812 --> 01:23:27,592
protecting against discrimination based on your genetic information as an employee.

779
01:23:29,872 --> 01:23:34,312
As we've talked about, legal pieces are only one part.

780
01:23:34,422 --> 01:23:37,822
So passing a policy or creating a policy is one component.

781
01:23:38,242 --> 01:23:42,262
But we have to also think at an organizational level about what our strategy is.

782
01:23:42,742 --> 01:23:49,672
So how do we recruit for the best people? How do we retain those employees that are working for an organization?

783
01:23:50,082 --> 01:23:53,872
How our practices support the composition of the workforce that we need.

784
01:23:54,532 --> 01:23:58,462
And then how do you then manage within the constraints of the different regulatory environments?

785
01:23:58,462 --> 01:24:02,082
We just talked a bit about that today. Throughout your presentations.

786
01:24:03,162 --> 01:24:08,412
So H.R. has several four functions. I've listed them out for you here.

787
01:24:09,462 --> 01:24:13,212
Planning workforce needs, managing compensation and benefits.

788
01:24:13,212 --> 01:24:18,132
Specifically continuous improvement. But I want you to just keep in mind, as you look down this list,

789
01:24:19,032 --> 01:24:27,132
all the different areas that H.R. is involved in leadership development, employee services, compliance,

790
01:24:27,882 --> 01:24:32,322
collective bargaining, review of performance, many, many,

791
01:24:32,322 --> 01:24:39,702
many key issues that feed into the managerial infrastructure of an organization flow through human resources.

792
01:24:40,722 --> 01:24:49,872
So h.r. Professionals then have many roles inside of an organization, from recruitment to compensation to promoting culture, organizational culture.

793
01:24:50,202 --> 01:24:55,092
Sometimes H.R. is tasked with thinking about issues related to diversity, equity and inclusion.

794
01:24:55,662 --> 01:25:00,461
Although, as we think back to some of our earlier discussions about, you know,

795
01:25:00,462 --> 01:25:06,432
where issues of DNI sit within an organization and whether it's appropriate for them to

796
01:25:06,432 --> 01:25:12,612
be in one role or if they should be spread throughout the organization at all levels.

797
01:25:14,072 --> 01:25:23,342
Staffing is a key component. Recruitment, like I said, selecting from a pool of applicants, transferring employees between departments.

798
01:25:23,672 --> 01:25:32,101
So at a small, grassroots, nonprofit organization, very often what you'll find is that there's not a whole lot of H.R. function beyond just the

799
01:25:32,102 --> 01:25:36,212
executive director really working to try to sort through who there's not that many employees.

800
01:25:36,692 --> 01:25:43,952
But as you grow, even five employees, say, in an organization, there is a certain amount of h.r.

801
01:25:43,952 --> 01:25:56,072
That needs to be addressed and ensuring that there are, you know, equitable practices, nondiscriminatory practices and fair compensation, etc.

802
01:25:58,172 --> 01:26:04,712
Larger organizations will often have roles in outsourcing, in offshoring.

803
01:26:06,312 --> 01:26:15,152
And specifically between those two sort of thinking about where else labor is come from, but specifically succession planning.

804
01:26:15,632 --> 01:26:20,602
So having a large group of employees means that everyone is mobile, right?

805
01:26:20,612 --> 01:26:23,972
So you can't expect that someone is just going to be there forever.

806
01:26:23,972 --> 01:26:28,442
They may be moving on to a different position in the organization or outside of the organization.

807
01:26:28,922 --> 01:26:34,412
So HRT is thinking very carefully about how are we going to ensure that the system doesn't just stop.

808
01:26:34,972 --> 01:26:39,092
If we are in the process of having different.

809
01:26:40,852 --> 01:26:44,842
So professionals are responsible for implementing the hiring process.

810
01:26:45,142 --> 01:26:48,201
Here you can see an example of a hiring process if you're thinking of ever

811
01:26:48,202 --> 01:26:52,402
starting an organization or considering sort of what that process looks like.

812
01:26:52,972 --> 01:26:53,182
You know,

813
01:26:53,182 --> 01:27:00,741
there are a lot of different aspects that we need to think about from the application itself to checking references to making a hiring decision.

814
01:27:00,742 --> 01:27:04,702
Negotiating for a salary. Training the individual at START.

815
01:27:05,032 --> 01:27:08,182
And then, of course, keeping track of their performance.

816
01:27:09,652 --> 01:27:17,301
So if certain departments coordinate that process and then back to our discussion about budgeting and sort of that,

817
01:27:17,302 --> 01:27:20,392
if you recall, we were talking about the different types of budgeting.

818
01:27:20,722 --> 01:27:25,072
So unit based budgeting versus more of a top down approach to budgeting.

819
01:27:26,142 --> 01:27:32,082
Departments are usually the ones who are going to make those hiring decisions,

820
01:27:32,352 --> 01:27:37,332
and the H.R. department overall is likely helping to facilitate that process.

821
01:27:37,752 --> 01:27:41,381
So I want to just draw the distinction here that the H.R. department is not the

822
01:27:41,382 --> 01:27:46,242
one who will necessarily decide who gets hired and who is going to get a position.

823
01:27:46,482 --> 01:27:55,902
But rather, they're guiding the process and ensuring that the practices are fair and equitable and to that point, avoiding biases.

824
01:27:56,862 --> 01:28:01,182
So health care organizations have some unique resource challenges related to each other.

825
01:28:01,272 --> 01:28:07,932
For starters, we have a shortage that can sometimes emerge specifically in delivery organizations.

826
01:28:08,262 --> 01:28:13,332
We see issues related to burnout. We see that there is large amounts of turnover.

827
01:28:14,382 --> 01:28:22,202
Training and development becomes key. But we also have to contend with the specific work schedules that will take place.

828
01:28:22,242 --> 01:28:30,792
So in a hospital, for example, work schedules are divided into shifts with different types of practices.

829
01:28:31,122 --> 01:28:36,312
Whether or not your employer imposing these or whether or not they are chosen by your employees.

830
01:28:36,672 --> 01:28:39,882
The key is that we have to think about who's organizing all of that.

831
01:28:40,902 --> 01:28:46,122
Similarly, we have to think about what it means to evaluate and appraise an employee.

832
01:28:46,572 --> 01:28:50,351
So performance appraisal that term.

833
01:28:50,352 --> 01:28:57,642
What that means is setting up a formal system to measure and evaluate an employee's job related activities.

834
01:28:57,912 --> 01:29:03,822
So we have to compare across different standards. So we might compare employees to other employees.

835
01:29:04,182 --> 01:29:10,092
We may take an approach where we cluster the employees around a certain high point on a scale.

836
01:29:10,452 --> 01:29:17,652
So the person who's rating that employee's able to distribute them across the scale, or we'll just look at critical incidents,

837
01:29:17,652 --> 01:29:25,092
meaning, you know, what did the employee do especially well or what were, you know, and what was an area of concern.

838
01:29:26,262 --> 01:29:31,031
Sometimes you'll see a graphic rating scale. Sometimes you'll see behaviorally anchored rating scales.

839
01:29:31,032 --> 01:29:40,242
So I would I would point out and give you the challenge to think about when we think about behaviorally anchored rating scales.

840
01:29:40,542 --> 01:29:50,562
Do these reflect a system that is inclusive of all the different diverse populations that we're looking to assess?

841
01:29:50,922 --> 01:29:56,141
Or are we imposing rating scales that were derived from systems that did not

842
01:29:56,142 --> 01:30:01,002
necessarily reflect the diversity of our population or of our employee workforce?

843
01:30:01,542 --> 01:30:04,872
So we have other types of feedback that can be given. And then, of course,

844
01:30:05,562 --> 01:30:10,182
there's a calibration process that takes place where you have to have multiple managers coming together

845
01:30:10,182 --> 01:30:16,032
to discuss the performance of the employees and then come to an agreement on how the employee performed.

846
01:30:17,732 --> 01:30:23,282
Now talking about H.R., I think can't necessarily ignore labor relations.

847
01:30:23,612 --> 01:30:27,002
So we have to think back to the policies that I was listing out.

848
01:30:27,332 --> 01:30:37,741
So NLRA In 1935, National Labor Relations Act gave collecting collective bargaining a legal basis, and this led to the growth of unionization.

849
01:30:37,742 --> 01:30:42,842
So you may see very much inside of the nonprofits that you're studying that either they have a

850
01:30:42,842 --> 01:30:48,422
union that is present inside of their organization or their employees are looking to unionize.

851
01:30:49,022 --> 01:30:54,212
So. Collective bargaining. The practice of bargaining for better pay.

852
01:30:55,052 --> 01:31:00,302
Looking to advocate for better working conditions at a collective level versus individually.

853
01:31:01,202 --> 01:31:09,692
And here you can see kind of alternatives to, you know, a compelled membership for a union.

854
01:31:10,022 --> 01:31:19,142
So sometimes you'll have an organization where the environment, where the employees work allows but does not compel a worker to join a union.

855
01:31:19,412 --> 01:31:26,372
Other organizations, historically, if you become an employee of the organization, you automatically are then a member of the union.

856
01:31:27,812 --> 01:31:32,252
Inside of collective bargaining. We also see some other terms that I just want you to be familiar with.

857
01:31:32,972 --> 01:31:37,742
Arbitrators who are responsible for negotiating between the union and managers,

858
01:31:38,612 --> 01:31:44,642
as well as different rules that are set up to protect workers in that process.

859
01:31:45,122 --> 01:31:49,722
So what are unions then specifically negotiating for wages?

860
01:31:49,742 --> 01:31:51,481
Very often hours.

861
01:31:51,482 --> 01:32:01,742
So when people are working and then other employment conditions inside of nonprofits, we sometimes see that unions don't emerge as much.

862
01:32:02,132 --> 01:32:11,712
Why? Because there is a lot more transparency built into the environment in which reporting has to take place.

863
01:32:11,732 --> 01:32:15,722
Accountability has to take place. The government mandates that things get disclosed.

864
01:32:16,082 --> 01:32:20,582
So sometimes we see that these types of efforts don't necessarily happen,

865
01:32:20,582 --> 01:32:24,322
although there are many examples of nonprofit organizations that do have a union.

866
01:32:24,332 --> 01:32:28,382
So, for example, has federally qualified health center in southwest Detroit.

867
01:32:28,802 --> 01:32:37,372
Their whole staff is unionized. So they do health care delivery, but they have a full union inside of their staff that has to investigate with.

868
01:32:39,452 --> 01:32:44,222
Now I bring up bias here specifically with regards to healthcare professionals,

869
01:32:44,222 --> 01:32:50,252
because as we consider the nonprofit organizations that are existing in the health services environment,

870
01:32:50,642 --> 01:32:56,492
we need to keep in mind that these types of biases, specifically racial bias and racism,

871
01:32:56,492 --> 01:33:05,582
that that can persist and in many ways characterize the ways in which employees are either hired or let go.

872
01:33:05,642 --> 01:33:08,881
And we have to keep in mind that these hiring practices that h.r.

873
01:33:08,882 --> 01:33:16,142
Departments are putting into place very much are governed by how much either the board or the leadership is

874
01:33:16,142 --> 01:33:24,542
is actively looking to encourage a system in which these biases are removed and and racism is acknowledged.

875
01:33:25,352 --> 01:33:34,082
So just some statistics here that that I wanted to sort of point to with regards to diversity in health care delivery.

876
01:33:34,562 --> 01:33:42,122
Um, these, these statistics specifically point out kind of what different populations have reported

877
01:33:43,202 --> 01:33:49,562
or reflected on in terms of their ability to have a connection with a provider.

878
01:33:49,862 --> 01:33:54,702
But I want you to keep in mind that these statistics are, in fact,

879
01:33:55,922 --> 01:34:05,161
a product of the various systems that are in place that either don't allow for hiring to reflect the population or some

880
01:34:05,162 --> 01:34:14,132
of the systems of power or power structures that prevent the workforce from necessarily reflecting who constituents are.

881
01:34:15,332 --> 01:34:24,302
So organizations are very often looking to make a conscious effort to be representative, to adopt job requirements for family needs.

882
01:34:24,602 --> 01:34:30,362
And as future managers, one of the things that you need to keep in mind is as an organization leader,

883
01:34:30,542 --> 01:34:38,701
you're going to be confronted with questions of wanting to perhaps participate in in changing the way

884
01:34:38,702 --> 01:34:44,192
that the organization is operating to be more inclusive or more reflective of different people's needs,

885
01:34:44,462 --> 01:34:49,292
but also having to balance that with the operational implications of what that entails.

886
01:34:49,602 --> 01:34:54,452
And so that tension is really where H.R. has to sit in the in the center and really try to weigh out.

887
01:34:54,752 --> 01:35:00,182
Okay. So we agree as an organization, our board or our leadership agree that we need to move in this direction.

888
01:35:00,512 --> 01:35:02,702
Now, operationally, how are we going to get there?

889
01:35:02,732 --> 01:35:10,112
So Katie's point about sort of looking at a threshold for where we want to get, you know, employees to be.

890
01:35:10,412 --> 01:35:16,172
And in terms of compensation, it's an aspirational goal, but it's the role of the leadership specifically h.r.

891
01:35:16,262 --> 01:35:22,172
To really think about how do we get there and what is it that we're going to do in order to make that make that happen.

892
01:35:22,802 --> 01:35:31,172
So leadership often then has to think about how to accommodate different attributes, but.

893
01:35:32,342 --> 01:35:42,212
Beyond accommodating our goal with with creating an equitable culture inside of an organization is to say this is not an accommodation,

894
01:35:42,452 --> 01:35:47,672
but rather this is the part of us that this organization reflects all attributes,

895
01:35:47,672 --> 01:35:56,971
all aspects, and and it's no longer something to think about as, as a sort of added service that we're providing,

896
01:35:56,972 --> 01:36:00,992
but rather a reflection of our core values as an organization and as a unit.

897
01:36:02,832 --> 01:36:07,192
So there have been some suggestions that have been developed in the literature among h.r.

898
01:36:07,212 --> 01:36:12,282
Professionals thinking about reducing financial barriers in education, training,

899
01:36:13,272 --> 01:36:19,902
creating partnerships between different educational institutions for pathway programs that students

900
01:36:19,902 --> 01:36:28,032
who are from historically marginalized populations would be are able to secure a higher education.

901
01:36:29,052 --> 01:36:38,232
Thinking about the infrastructures that that prevent advancement and then creating a recruiting pathway specifically

902
01:36:38,232 --> 01:36:46,572
within higher education in academia specifically these are recommendations to create a more diverse faculty,

903
01:36:46,842 --> 01:36:51,282
a more diverse environment for educational pursuit,

904
01:36:51,672 --> 01:36:59,502
so that the workforce begins to represent and reflect the diversity of the constituencies and the organizations that serve.

905
01:37:00,312 --> 01:37:05,112
So with that, I'll take any questions, if you have any, and then we'll take a break.

906
01:37:05,412 --> 01:37:05,855
Questions? Everybody ready to take a break?

907
01:37:11,845 --> 01:37:16,315
Okay. I'll bring it over to our distinguished.

908
01:37:18,425 --> 01:37:25,395
Hello, guys. I started off talking about this case study and chased Morgan's story.

909
01:37:27,085 --> 01:37:33,145
Oh, actually, before I started off as a writer, I've got a ton of balls.

910
01:37:33,235 --> 01:37:37,165
Many times. But you guys get to see a photo of me as a child going to for the first time.

911
01:37:38,935 --> 01:37:41,965
It's my dad, my sister and I.

912
01:37:42,295 --> 01:37:53,845
And I'm obviously the one supporting, obviously, Grace and her sisters posts swimming and corals and beautiful photos of my father.

913
01:37:54,265 --> 01:38:01,045
He's representing the Hampshire governor who is represented by the stalker.

914
01:38:01,495 --> 01:38:04,905
So that was the thing. I've been there, but I realize I don't take pictures of the world.

915
01:38:06,355 --> 01:38:15,384
I mean, my grandparents from the North So to call that Falls is located in the U.P.

916
01:38:15,385 --> 01:38:23,125
For those who don't know, it's part of the state park that's like 46,000 acres as actually two different balls, which I'm aware of.

917
01:38:23,335 --> 01:38:27,235
But there's upper and lower falls. They're like a little bit farther down the river.

918
01:38:27,415 --> 01:38:29,575
And then the falls drain into Lake Superior.

919
01:38:30,475 --> 01:38:37,375
It's the largest waterfall in Michigan, and it's the second most volume waterfall east of the Mississippi.

920
01:38:37,635 --> 01:38:41,875
And so that's I mean, Niagara Falls is the first and it's insignificantly.

921
01:38:43,075 --> 01:38:46,075
But and then one thing that's kind of interesting to note,

922
01:38:46,075 --> 01:38:51,175
you'll see in the top photo two like especially how browned the water looks, it's due to tannins,

923
01:38:51,175 --> 01:39:00,285
which is I can come from the plants, but that's specifically here leached from Cedar Swamp that drains down into the waterfall and that's,

924
01:39:00,295 --> 01:39:04,995
it's nicknamed up there rip your falls on that path.

925
01:39:05,635 --> 01:39:10,705
All okay, so now on to the actual case. We are actually not looking non profit.

926
01:39:10,705 --> 01:39:14,665
You've read the case so you're aware of that, but we're looking to the IGP.

927
01:39:15,055 --> 01:39:19,255
I'm, I call it JP AMC for short but they're investment banking company.

928
01:39:19,465 --> 01:39:25,105
They first started in 1799. So that's one of the original pictures.

929
01:39:25,495 --> 01:39:29,065
That's the original building, not your original building.

930
01:39:30,355 --> 01:39:34,225
It's the fifth largest bank in the world and it's the first largest bank in the US.

931
01:39:34,585 --> 01:39:37,645
So it employs around 250,000 people worldwide.

932
01:39:38,395 --> 01:39:47,695
It has in 2020 had 3 trillion in total assets, 119 million in revenue and had like a total stock market worth of 4 billion.

933
01:39:48,145 --> 01:39:53,185
It's a very huge company and has too much money and has my personal opinion.

934
01:39:55,495 --> 01:39:58,885
So the case study is about JPMorgan's new path passport.

935
01:39:58,895 --> 01:40:05,935
So this is their $30 billion five year initiative to advance racial equity, specifically in the US financial system.

936
01:40:06,725 --> 01:40:12,355
And so up until this initiative during the 20 tens, we'll talk about this a little bit more later.

937
01:40:12,355 --> 01:40:20,035
But during the 20 tens they've done a couple other projects and activities to try and spurred D and I work.

938
01:40:20,035 --> 01:40:29,365
But really after the pandemic and the George Floyd murder, they just kind of like the call to action, like the rest of the world.

939
01:40:30,265 --> 01:40:36,824
And so they hired right shortly after that, they hired Brian LAMB to head the global global head of D,

940
01:40:36,825 --> 01:40:41,065
E and AI and created new business line for these initiatives.

941
01:40:41,725 --> 01:40:46,795
And they had stated that they're trying to change the inside of the bank, which will change what comes out of the bank.

942
01:40:48,815 --> 01:40:53,855
So I won't go too much into detail here if you guys need or want to look more in exhibit three.

943
01:40:54,185 --> 01:40:59,225
But these are their four main lines of business. There's multiple lines of business under these,

944
01:40:59,765 --> 01:41:05,555
but the main ones that are related to the different initiatives are the consumer and community banking.

945
01:41:05,705 --> 01:41:11,915
So the first one and then the third one, the commercial banking. So most initiatives kind of fall under those business lines.

946
01:41:14,335 --> 01:41:17,485
And then here's just a brief view of some of the key players.

947
01:41:18,085 --> 01:41:23,455
So like I already mentioned, Brian LAMB is heading this initiative. I'll just go briefly to the other ones.

948
01:41:23,815 --> 01:41:27,575
Alex Rodriguez in the top left. She's the head of the community impact.

949
01:41:27,595 --> 01:41:34,675
So she's kind of ensuring that the other CEOs of the different lines of business are considering the needs of black and Latino communities.

950
01:41:35,605 --> 01:41:39,325
Below her. Lawrence Bailey in his position as head of community banking.

951
01:41:39,715 --> 01:41:45,145
He's working a lot on financial health initiatives. So the education around financial help.

952
01:41:46,355 --> 01:41:49,535
Below him. Syreeta Battle's head of affordable lending.

953
01:41:49,835 --> 01:41:54,575
She's in charge of executing the strategies to help address the barriers to homeownership

954
01:41:55,085 --> 01:42:00,275
historically taking place and then alongside the barriers to homeownership.

955
01:42:00,305 --> 01:42:04,655
Alice Carr I actually don't think is in the position anymore, but in this case study,

956
01:42:04,655 --> 01:42:13,925
she is the head of Community Community Development Banking and she's working on trying to provide and expand capital to affordable housing.

957
01:42:14,975 --> 01:42:26,735
And then left too. So Karl is in charge of the minority business ventures because small businesses and expanding and growing those.

958
01:42:27,125 --> 01:42:32,435
And then lastly, David Salary. He's the chief financial officer of corporate responsibility.

959
01:42:33,035 --> 01:42:37,775
And his role is really looking and measuring the impact and performance of these measures.

960
01:42:40,295 --> 01:42:44,285
So I'll touch on just briefly. The case did a lot a lot of background.

961
01:42:44,825 --> 01:42:46,234
So we're just going to go over it quickly.

962
01:42:46,235 --> 01:42:55,205
But they had five different equity efforts that they tried to prove that they did somewhat successfully between 2010 and 2020.

963
01:42:56,045 --> 01:43:02,765
So the first one was trying to revitalize Detroit after Detroit filed for bankruptcy bankruptcy in 2013.

964
01:43:03,425 --> 01:43:13,385
So they created something called the Detroit Service Core, and they lended their expertize and manpower, they said, to try and help the community.

965
01:43:13,655 --> 01:43:21,455
And the three ways that they tried to help community with with money and support in community development, workforce development and small businesses.

966
01:43:23,315 --> 01:43:25,655
The second initiative, Advancing Black Leaders,

967
01:43:26,855 --> 01:43:33,785
is mainly about creating a pipeline from black communities into working for JPMorgan and other kind of financial systems.

968
01:43:34,355 --> 01:43:40,265
So they're trying to give black boys better opportunities for advancement, skill development and promotion.

969
01:43:42,125 --> 01:43:43,805
That's our mission. Sorry.

970
01:43:44,495 --> 01:43:51,394
I know there is a there's a lot in this case, but the third one is just trying to take Detroit's model and applying it to four new cities.

971
01:43:51,395 --> 01:43:54,515
So they did it in Chicago, D.C. and San Francisco, Paris.

972
01:43:55,955 --> 01:44:04,415
So this initiative is just making more capital in the form of loans and grants available for community development through something called CDI.

973
01:44:04,445 --> 01:44:09,575
So there are specific financial institutions that are working in low and moderate income communities.

974
01:44:12,365 --> 01:44:18,305
Second to last Business Roundtable Diamond, the president of Jp morgan.

975
01:44:18,635 --> 01:44:27,395
He became the hair of head of this round, the head of this roundtable organization.

976
01:44:27,725 --> 01:44:34,295
And he made a change kind of into the operation of this organization to distinguish

977
01:44:34,295 --> 01:44:38,195
that the purpose of corporations should not be to make shareholders money,

978
01:44:38,435 --> 01:44:43,745
but rather to make everyone kind of on this equal plane customers, employers, suppliers,

979
01:44:44,585 --> 01:44:48,245
and that the corporation was operating for all of them, not to shareholders.

980
01:44:49,245 --> 01:44:52,745
Those were a lot of fancy words, but that's something he did. And then last but not least,

981
01:44:52,745 --> 01:45:00,695
is the advisory panel in which they brought a lot of different organizations together to try and create more economic opportunities.

982
01:45:01,025 --> 01:45:05,575
So this is all that was happening prior to the commitment. Now, Grayson will tell you about commitment.

983
01:45:06,565 --> 01:45:09,725
Yes. Yeah. You're listening more to what is actually more about.

984
01:45:10,115 --> 01:45:19,195
These are the main goals of their commitment to promoting equity and addressing historic discrimination, interior and exterior to PMC.

985
01:45:19,865 --> 01:45:27,694
I think it's really notable that all of these are a part of the organization and their work as Rodriguez to educate is to have this quote

986
01:45:27,695 --> 01:45:33,455
in the case where said that we didn't want to create a separate organization that was focused solely on the work of the community.

987
01:45:33,665 --> 01:45:37,384
We need every leader in this company to be thinking about this. It is a separate organization.

988
01:45:37,385 --> 01:45:42,935
It can be forgotten, marginalized, chipped away. If it's built into our business, it will inherently change our business as usual.

989
01:45:43,805 --> 01:45:46,775
And so I think that that's really notable, an important, important aspect of this case.

990
01:45:47,345 --> 01:45:53,165
You can see that a lot of their goals are addressing a lot of different issues that you will kind of get into a bit more.

991
01:45:53,645 --> 01:46:00,875
But first, on the next slide, we wanted to just kind of contextualize the commitment and the situation that we identified,

992
01:46:01,775 --> 01:46:05,465
which was a problem, particularly relating to their work in Chicago.

993
01:46:06,155 --> 01:46:14,615
So PMC made specific commitments to Chicago that would kind of have added a little bit, and that included 14,000 employees,

994
01:46:14,975 --> 01:46:23,855
4.5 million retail banking customers, 500,000 business customers, and creating relationships with local government businesses and nonprofits.

995
01:46:25,475 --> 01:46:28,865
And then so that they've been doing this work, they haven't been in Chicago doing this work.

996
01:46:29,285 --> 01:46:34,684
And then they heard from community members that they were unsatisfied about how it was going because in lower income neighborhoods,

997
01:46:34,685 --> 01:46:41,435
they were enrolling a lot of people in like bank accounts and taking deposits, but they were writing very few mortgages in those areas.

998
01:46:42,365 --> 01:46:48,905
And so the problem that we identified and are going to kind of dove into more as we go is like, how did this happen?

999
01:46:49,835 --> 01:46:55,265
How can they like learn from it and improve so that it doesn't happen again and how can they sustain their commitment long term?

1000
01:46:56,075 --> 01:46:59,885
So next slide, these are the four main parts of their commitment.

1001
01:47:00,305 --> 01:47:06,695
So it's a $30 billion commitment overall to advance racial equity. And so the first part is investing in affordable housing.

1002
01:47:06,965 --> 01:47:09,605
The second is supporting minority owned small businesses.

1003
01:47:09,815 --> 01:47:16,385
The third is increasing financial help among underserved communities and then finally prioritizing DEI initiatives internally.

1004
01:47:17,135 --> 01:47:21,815
So we will go through each of these. Now, the first one is the affordable housing component.

1005
01:47:22,115 --> 01:47:26,645
This is a larger portion of the commitment. It accounts for $26 billion out of the 30 billion.

1006
01:47:26,855 --> 01:47:29,465
And there are two markets that it concerns.

1007
01:47:29,465 --> 01:47:38,225
The first is the consumer lending market, and this includes $8 billion for 40,000 new mortgages and 4 billion for 20,000 refinances.

1008
01:47:39,035 --> 01:47:45,935
It also includes new provisions to help connect with the community that J.P. Morgan has historically not served,

1009
01:47:47,525 --> 01:47:53,584
and building relationships with important influencers in those communities like realtors,

1010
01:47:53,585 --> 01:47:54,845
builders, nonprofits,

1011
01:47:55,175 --> 01:48:04,445
city officials and community groups to try to enable GMC to go trust and confidence among particularly black and Latinx customers in communities.

1012
01:48:05,255 --> 01:48:12,505
So through the battles who also introduced us to have this quote in the case where she was referencing this,

1013
01:48:12,515 --> 01:48:19,835
that's the survey that showed that or the prediction research that showed that between 2018 and 2028,

1014
01:48:21,425 --> 01:48:28,805
77% of all new household formation would be among minorities, with 53% being among black and Latinx Moroccans.

1015
01:48:29,405 --> 01:48:35,195
And so she was talking about this, and she referred to it as a business opportunity, which I just think is a really important component of this.

1016
01:48:35,795 --> 01:48:41,374
And a reminder that JPC is a business not for profit, like this is an opportunity for them to make profit.

1017
01:48:41,375 --> 01:48:48,375
And I think it's really interesting as we go through the commitment to see where that shows up and how they're prioritizing optimism,

1018
01:48:48,995 --> 01:48:52,115
but also editorializing a little bit. So moving on.

1019
01:48:53,345 --> 01:49:02,644
But the second part of the affordable housing one is the commercial lending aspect, which is 14 billion to finance 100,000 affordable housing,

1020
01:49:02,645 --> 01:49:07,835
renting rental units across the country in five years as part is the head of this.

1021
01:49:08,615 --> 01:49:11,765
And so they've been working with developers and community develop.

1022
01:49:12,495 --> 01:49:20,865
Financial institutions such as EDF as disparate affordable housing development, and invest additional capital in vital community institutions.

1023
01:49:21,885 --> 01:49:24,155
And we talked a little bit about capital access.

1024
01:49:24,165 --> 01:49:31,304
And so they really highlighted how it's not just about like financing these, but also like involving stakeholders and,

1025
01:49:31,305 --> 01:49:36,255
you know, like dealing with the regulations to make sure they are complying with that, which they're also prioritizing.

1026
01:49:36,675 --> 01:49:41,955
So then I think the next slide is an example of how PMC is thinking about this affordable housing work.

1027
01:49:42,225 --> 01:49:47,915
This is from Houston. And so you can see that they are thinking about the demographics of Houston,

1028
01:49:47,925 --> 01:49:52,125
the housing supply and demand, the access that households have to financing,

1029
01:49:53,835 --> 01:49:58,064
and then like the like the racial ethnic breakdowns of households in Houston and in some of the

1030
01:49:58,065 --> 01:50:02,115
areas where they're identifying complexities and honing in and they're really effort with like,

1031
01:50:02,445 --> 01:50:06,075
you know, policy formulation and couple funding partnerships.

1032
01:50:09,215 --> 01:50:13,085
I'm going to talk a little bit about the minority small business, which is the second part of the commitment.

1033
01:50:13,385 --> 01:50:16,295
And the whole goal is to empower these small businesses.

1034
01:50:16,865 --> 01:50:22,834
So JPMorgan invested 2 billion in these efforts and they're trying to create genuine connections

1035
01:50:22,835 --> 01:50:27,695
that help to general connections with small businesses that are reflective of the community.

1036
01:50:28,055 --> 01:50:36,145
So that is their hope and goal. And so specifically through 15,000 loans for small businesses.

1037
01:50:36,155 --> 01:50:44,825
So that is their kind of network. And on top of that, they're doing a little bit of other work, too, related to their own suppliers.

1038
01:50:45,095 --> 01:50:54,185
So they're trying to diversify the suppliers that they work with, and then they're expanding the Entrepreneurs of Color Fund.

1039
01:50:54,575 --> 01:50:59,285
And they're doing 42.5 million to just increase the number of loans that are available

1040
01:50:59,285 --> 01:51:03,875
across the board for small businesses to start off or improve their programs.

1041
01:51:04,715 --> 01:51:08,045
And then something that was interesting in this online business,

1042
01:51:08,285 --> 01:51:15,844
they're talking about a new product that they created that was kind of invest equity in these companies that were just starting out,

1043
01:51:15,845 --> 01:51:17,795
some newly developing small businesses.

1044
01:51:18,365 --> 01:51:25,895
They were going to help them, teach them how to diversify their company and work with them to support their initiatives.

1045
01:51:28,445 --> 01:51:34,474
Okay. So moving on to the third part of the commitment is the financial health servicing genocide.

1046
01:51:34,475 --> 01:51:40,895
It's talking about how they have a goal of helping 1 million people open your checking your savings account for the first time.

1047
01:51:41,375 --> 01:51:49,685
And this is again focused on Chicago specifically. And then the goal is to build 100 new branches in communities that were historically underserved.

1048
01:51:49,895 --> 01:51:54,025
And then you can kind of see, you know, they have these four kind of breakdowns within this.

1049
01:51:54,065 --> 01:51:59,605
There's community centers, digital services, improving compensation and increasing community lending.

1050
01:52:00,455 --> 01:52:01,774
So just kind of like zooming out,

1051
01:52:01,775 --> 01:52:09,125
they had an example where within the case where there was a 436,000 unbanked people just in the South Side of Chicago,

1052
01:52:09,605 --> 01:52:13,265
and they had estimated and JPMorgan estimated they'd reached about 20,000.

1053
01:52:13,475 --> 01:52:19,755
These people are about 5%. So their hope was great. So that was pointing out kind of seeing an opportunity, a business opportunity where, you know,

1054
01:52:19,775 --> 01:52:23,845
historically underserved communities, they could reach out and, you know, create new lines of business with.

1055
01:52:24,545 --> 01:52:28,895
And then just kind of going off these themes of financial health.

1056
01:52:29,425 --> 01:52:35,255
JPM, CEO was kind of noticing in the past, you know, they had employees who were working at certain branches in low income neighborhoods and

1057
01:52:35,855 --> 01:52:39,305
what often happened was like land and moving to different branches to make more money.

1058
01:52:40,505 --> 01:52:45,275
The way that, you know, the internal structures of JP and Z were organized and now they kind of reorganize these award

1059
01:52:45,285 --> 01:52:48,934
systems so that you can make the same amount of money no matter what branch you're coming from,

1060
01:52:48,935 --> 01:52:55,115
to kind of incentivize employees to stay and, you know, different, more diverse types of communities.

1061
01:52:55,685 --> 01:53:00,555
And, you know, Abby and Grace and fashion is a little bit other slides, but, you know, there was increased investment.

1062
01:53:00,585 --> 01:53:03,755
So for example, you can kind of see the number four point here.

1063
01:53:04,265 --> 01:53:12,904
You know, PMC was investing 75 million and minority deposit in institutions was MDI and then community development, financial institutions,

1064
01:53:12,905 --> 01:53:20,885
CDF, ISE and then kind of overall goal with those investments was to generate as much as $750 million in community funding.

1065
01:53:23,455 --> 01:53:27,475
And then moving on to the fourth part of the commitment.

1066
01:53:28,195 --> 01:53:33,504
So just kind of zooming out before we get to the details of the commitment. This is about, you know, diversity, equity, inclusion.

1067
01:53:33,505 --> 01:53:39,175
So that is they were run into the commitment but then kind of had similar initiatives in the past before this latest,

1068
01:53:40,375 --> 01:53:47,605
you know, explicit commitment as they were terming it. So they had the Advancing Black Leaders program, which was implemented in 2016,

1069
01:53:48,175 --> 01:53:52,914
and that was kind of focused on improving the sourcing and recruiting pipeline for black

1070
01:53:52,915 --> 01:53:56,935
communities and giving further opportunities for advancement and skill development and promotions,

1071
01:53:56,935 --> 01:54:05,935
you know, kind of things like that. And then there was also it in 2019 had instituted the Advancing Black Pathways program,

1072
01:54:06,895 --> 01:54:11,125
and that was established as a separate group from an existing DEI group.

1073
01:54:11,575 --> 01:54:18,865
And kind of the goal was to focus on career readiness and, you know, series of educational materials for young black employees entering the workforce.

1074
01:54:18,865 --> 01:54:25,765
And kind of the separate component was pushing, pushing clients to add black leaders to their boards of directors.

1075
01:54:26,365 --> 01:54:29,724
And something we kind of noticed throughout this is that these were kind of pretty broad,

1076
01:54:29,725 --> 01:54:34,015
overarching goals that at least within the case, did not have a lot of specific metrics tied to them.

1077
01:54:34,015 --> 01:54:40,945
They were more kind of, you know, as a single overarching mission statements rather than, you know, hard numbers to head tangible goals.

1078
01:54:44,615 --> 01:54:51,145
So moving on to the next slide. So this is kind of the new part of the D and I commitment the GMC had been making

1079
01:54:52,075 --> 01:54:55,224
and this was kind of compared to the other the first three components was more of an

1080
01:54:55,225 --> 01:55:01,945
inward focus on their internal procedures and policies that would focus on accountability

1081
01:55:01,945 --> 01:55:05,425
for managers and creating kind of a culture shift of more inclusion throughout.

1082
01:55:05,995 --> 01:55:09,165
So we're talking then moving down the list here.

1083
01:55:09,175 --> 01:55:15,865
The purpose was to, you know, improve an employee diversity at all levels and build a more inclusive culture for employees of color.

1084
01:55:15,895 --> 01:55:19,375
And this was led by Brian LAMB, the global head of GMC.

1085
01:55:19,855 --> 01:55:26,574
I saw Abby issues earlier and then, you know, they had hiring and career advancement commitments.

1086
01:55:26,575 --> 01:55:31,314
So they had a goal to hire 300 Black Eye Next Wealth Management securities advisors

1087
01:55:31,315 --> 01:55:37,815
and on board 3000 black clients to work with these types of officers then,

1088
01:55:38,135 --> 01:55:40,225
you know, is kind of related to goal number three,

1089
01:55:40,225 --> 01:55:47,665
financial commitments that provide funding to improve the pipeline of black and Latinx talent recruitment within GMC.

1090
01:55:48,085 --> 01:55:52,404
So kind of these initiatives are really stressing, kind of pushing internally,

1091
01:55:52,405 --> 01:55:58,845
pushing managers to adhere to certain DEI standards and standards being implemented into, you know,

1092
01:55:58,855 --> 01:56:00,894
management reviews, you know,

1093
01:56:00,895 --> 01:56:07,105
managers working with employees and really putting in a holding manager at specific targets and making sure they're trying to hit,

1094
01:56:08,335 --> 01:56:12,955
you know, stated goals. And Brian LAMB, you know, the head of this kind of initiative,

1095
01:56:12,955 --> 01:56:17,814
said that these targets are just important as traditional business metrics in terms of evaluating employees.

1096
01:56:17,815 --> 01:56:18,955
So they really want to take, you know,

1097
01:56:19,375 --> 01:56:25,404
create a culture where this truly was an important aspect of performance reviews and know going along with that,

1098
01:56:25,405 --> 01:56:29,365
managers were going to be evaluated on carrots to these stated goals.

1099
01:56:31,065 --> 01:56:35,545
And yeah, just one. Yeah. Yeah.

1100
01:56:35,655 --> 01:56:40,605
So $750 million as part of this was priorities for black and Latin ex-offenders.

1101
01:56:41,745 --> 01:56:46,125
So Gypsy was kind of moving forward from a strategy where they used to kind

1102
01:56:46,125 --> 01:56:48,644
of just look for the most efficient allocation of their money to work with.

1103
01:56:48,645 --> 01:56:55,665
Vendors were now they were kind of what you tried to focus on working with certain black and Latinx vendors to you know,

1104
01:56:56,425 --> 01:57:01,215
they used the term suppliers that kind of just means like anyone GMC is contracting with for various,

1105
01:57:01,215 --> 01:57:07,605
you know, office supplies, things like janitorial services, like I did it, you know, and numerous other things that a business of that size, you know.

1106
01:57:08,535 --> 01:57:12,765
Contracts with. Yeah. Moving on.

1107
01:57:13,245 --> 01:57:17,265
So kind of one of the problems that JP,

1108
01:57:17,295 --> 01:57:23,204
IMC had identified themselves with work with in this case where they kind of said they've been focusing

1109
01:57:23,205 --> 01:57:27,495
intensely on the Chicago market for a number of years through this Advancing Cities initiative.

1110
01:57:28,125 --> 01:57:34,295
And this is kind of their internal assessment where they're saying it seems like we're really making good progress on these metrics.

1111
01:57:34,305 --> 01:57:40,365
And then they started hearing from people in the community who weren't really satisfied with what was getting done.

1112
01:57:40,485 --> 01:57:44,585
And it turns out, you know, in these lower income neighborhoods, they were seeing a lot of people signing.

1113
01:57:44,985 --> 01:57:50,295
They're seeing a lot of customers sign up for bank accounts and taking deposits, but not they weren't really writing a lot of mortgages.

1114
01:57:50,895 --> 01:57:54,975
And these neighborhoods, which was one of their goals, to not only get people to sign up for bank accounts, but then,

1115
01:57:55,545 --> 01:57:59,925
you know, increase homeownership in these areas that traditionally didn't have high rates of homeownership.

1116
01:58:00,765 --> 01:58:03,155
That's then GMC was saying that's the kind of insight, you know,

1117
01:58:03,195 --> 01:58:07,815
we need to be able to identify in our own without the community telling us that we have this problem.

1118
01:58:08,385 --> 01:58:12,535
So then these kind of questions I sit up here are just explicitly pulled from the case.

1119
01:58:12,555 --> 01:58:19,435
This is what Alex Rodriguez, who was kind of leading the project, was, you know, these are just pulled straight up because this is what you do.

1120
01:58:19,695 --> 01:58:25,665
He was asking, you know, how can we ensure that the rest of the bank took to heart whatever they could learn?

1121
01:58:25,695 --> 01:58:27,525
Chicago and, you know, their early commitment.

1122
01:58:28,505 --> 01:58:35,465
In other markets, you kind of get what happened if success on the climate that leads to change on the ground in Chicago.

1123
01:58:36,335 --> 01:58:39,355
When enthusiasm waned, as time went on with progress.

1124
01:58:39,995 --> 01:58:42,335
And finally, how might the bank influence other majors,

1125
01:58:42,515 --> 01:58:49,025
other major business organizations to invest strategic energy in support for our discussion section?

1126
01:58:49,525 --> 01:58:54,215
You know, some of these questions are kind of governing thoughts or opinions.

1127
01:58:56,135 --> 01:58:58,175
These are the questions that AMC was asking themselves.

1128
01:58:59,235 --> 01:59:05,265
And then moving on the next slide, these are kind of the questions that we were thinking through as we were analyzing the case.

1129
01:59:06,765 --> 01:59:10,365
So the first thing being, you know, how is success being defined?

1130
01:59:10,375 --> 01:59:17,144
So we were going through kind of as a group. We were talking about how we weren't seeing a lot of clear articulation of our

1131
01:59:17,145 --> 01:59:21,775
goals of what success for a successful or desirable outcome would be for him.

1132
01:59:21,825 --> 01:59:24,435
See through this commitment, you know, it was kind of just sort of, oh,

1133
01:59:24,435 --> 01:59:29,475
we'll invest in these communities and get X number of dollars to these programs. But what what do you really want at the end of the day?

1134
01:59:30,045 --> 01:59:33,224
And there were kind of some vague language, oh, yeah, increasing mortgage rates and things like that,

1135
01:59:33,225 --> 01:59:38,625
but then not like a super clear sort of mission statement in terms of what the end

1136
01:59:38,625 --> 01:59:43,545
goal and what you know when you declare that this has been a worthy investment or,

1137
01:59:43,545 --> 01:59:46,725
you know, mission accomplished, for lack of a better term, there wasn't a lot of that.

1138
01:59:48,255 --> 01:59:53,625
Then with the second question and we're talking about the legitimacy of adequate community input and trust.

1139
01:59:54,135 --> 01:59:57,675
So that was, you know, to address the previous slide, something that had been identified as a problem.

1140
01:59:58,605 --> 02:00:01,965
So we talked about how there's some community involvement by largely kind of

1141
02:00:01,965 --> 02:00:04,754
deciding where the money gets invested rather than asking community members,

1142
02:00:04,755 --> 02:00:09,645
which, you know, as we've seen in this case, in many other situations, that's where problems can arise.

1143
02:00:11,185 --> 02:00:18,545
And then kind of moving on the third question. And related to the first one a little bit, you know what metrics is JP using to evaluate performance?

1144
02:00:18,555 --> 02:00:23,715
So, you know, there's not a lot of publicly available information about the details of how these financial

1145
02:00:24,375 --> 02:00:28,125
resources get allocated or the metrics they're using to kind of really measure their success.

1146
02:00:28,665 --> 02:00:34,455
So that's kind of another question we had about, you know, maybe there's kind of more internal metrics being used,

1147
02:00:34,455 --> 02:00:38,925
especially in these manager reviews and stuff like that, or for the external stuff with the investment communities.

1148
02:00:39,475 --> 02:00:43,305
That is not particularly clear to us when reading through the case.

1149
02:00:44,235 --> 02:00:49,365
And then finally, how is money going? How is earmarked money from the commitment actually getting?

1150
02:00:49,365 --> 02:00:54,155
SPENCE Right. Like in the case, if you're saying, oh, we're spending $50 million in this initiative and,

1151
02:00:54,165 --> 02:00:56,054
you know, 100 million for this affordable housing initiative.

1152
02:00:56,055 --> 02:01:00,735
But, you know, that's kind of just what's getting written down as more of a mission statement rather than,

1153
02:01:01,185 --> 02:01:06,285
you know, kind of getting it to the nuts and bolts of the details of how the money is really getting spent.

1154
02:01:07,065 --> 02:01:13,825
So we're just kind of thinking. You know what the details of that part of the logistics and just kind of another thought worth thinking

1155
02:01:13,825 --> 02:01:18,355
of for like how much of these efforts in Chicago were the result of this kind of more recent commitment,

1156
02:01:18,355 --> 02:01:23,305
as opposed to earlier programs like the Advancing Cities program that we had been discussing before?

1157
02:01:26,285 --> 02:01:33,295
And yeah, so kind of moving on to hypothesis. So we were kind of thinking this kind of thought bubble, you're right.

1158
02:01:33,295 --> 02:01:40,375
So equity moves at the pace of trust. So that was a big issue identified, that kind of lack of trust for the communities that JBS is working with.

1159
02:01:41,125 --> 02:01:44,545
So we're kind of thinking about JP and he doesn't earn the trust of these communities. And, you know,

1160
02:01:44,545 --> 02:01:48,654
it's going to be hard to meet these internal and external goals that address the

1161
02:01:48,655 --> 02:01:51,835
needs of the community in the short term if there's not buy in from the community.

1162
02:01:52,405 --> 02:01:58,345
So we're just kind of thinking the trust kind of takes time and you're not going to see the results necessarily super quick and.

1163
02:01:59,875 --> 02:02:02,274
You know, that's an issue that they're going to have to grapple with.

1164
02:02:02,275 --> 02:02:06,025
And maybe that's why they're not seeing the results in Chicago that they were anticipating.

1165
02:02:07,205 --> 02:02:10,974
Yes. So we we came to this hypothesis through a lot of thought.

1166
02:02:10,975 --> 02:02:12,955
And we think that there are a lot of opinions that point to this.

1167
02:02:13,615 --> 02:02:19,695
The first is just like the historic new systemic racism by the making and lending industry, specifically towards kids of color.

1168
02:02:20,845 --> 02:02:25,105
I think the case did a pretty good job of laying out tons of examples of how this has shown up,

1169
02:02:25,825 --> 02:02:31,134
like, for example, how things were created to target black Americans.

1170
02:02:31,135 --> 02:02:33,955
And a lot of them closed down and a lot of money was lost.

1171
02:02:35,155 --> 02:02:39,625
Use of color, particularly the black communities, have turned down by banks when seeking financing.

1172
02:02:39,895 --> 02:02:47,905
The G.I. Bill had negative impacts like FHA underwriting that like discouraged integration practices like redlining.

1173
02:02:48,835 --> 02:02:55,285
All of these things just contributed to this mistrust because of mismanagement and malpractise in the banking industry.

1174
02:02:56,155 --> 02:03:02,665
And, you know, this isn't like a historic thing only. Obviously, this continues today and this distrust still continues today.

1175
02:03:04,135 --> 02:03:11,935
You know, you talked about this report that was released in 2020 that reported that black homeowners paid

1176
02:03:11,935 --> 02:03:17,994
approximately $67,000 more than white customers with buying a home due to differences in mortgage rates,

1177
02:03:17,995 --> 02:03:20,065
property taxes and insurance premiums.

1178
02:03:21,115 --> 02:03:27,835
And in thinking about making specifically like 20 14% of black households are unbanked and 12% of Latinos have to terminate.

1179
02:03:28,725 --> 02:03:32,155
And so just like that, like there's there's just all of this, like, really,

1180
02:03:32,155 --> 02:03:36,085
really intense and, like, tragic history that has contributed to the situation.

1181
02:03:37,155 --> 02:03:40,165
Like, you can't just, like, overnight and can't just fix.

1182
02:03:41,725 --> 02:03:47,815
The second thing that we talked about with this was just Gypsy's own role in this history.

1183
02:03:48,085 --> 02:03:52,525
And they said in that case that their history dates back to 1799,

1184
02:03:52,525 --> 02:03:59,515
but they never talked about like their own role in the lending industry and how like they discriminated against communities of color.

1185
02:04:01,225 --> 02:04:06,115
And I wish I had had a quote in the case that said, We can't change the past, but we will change the future.

1186
02:04:06,415 --> 02:04:08,355
And like, that's great. Like, she's right.

1187
02:04:08,365 --> 02:04:12,775
They can't change the past, but, like, they can talk about it and they can be transparent about what their own role in all of this.

1188
02:04:13,465 --> 02:04:20,185
And we think that in order to even try to build back trust, they have to acknowledge their role in these practices and work to rectify it.

1189
02:04:21,685 --> 02:04:26,025
And then the final thing that we thought about with this was just Chase's own image in the community.

1190
02:04:26,035 --> 02:04:30,685
They talked about how there's this misunderstanding that like Chase charges high fees.

1191
02:04:31,525 --> 02:04:38,065
And so I think that's indicative of how people view Chase as an untrustworthy and risky bank to work with.

1192
02:04:39,085 --> 02:04:43,165
And so, like, they they want to try to, like, go back trust to kind of overcome these things, know,

1193
02:04:43,225 --> 02:04:52,345
like they need to market themselves better as a trustworthy organization and as an, as a bank that's not going to, like, exploit people.

1194
02:04:54,375 --> 02:04:57,135
We did talk about different alternatives. On the next slide,

1195
02:04:58,455 --> 02:05:05,654
Mark highlighted their metrics and we really just kind of came at this again and again because we would talk about how effective the programs were,

1196
02:05:05,655 --> 02:05:11,025
but they just never really report on it. And when they like see problems, they just kind of like throw more money at it.

1197
02:05:11,025 --> 02:05:18,135
And they never really show any measurements of like if it's been successful, like where the Germans are.

1198
02:05:18,795 --> 02:05:23,234
I think this is evidenced by the Chicago situation where they said that their metrics were indicating that things were going well,

1199
02:05:23,235 --> 02:05:24,495
but obviously there were problems.

1200
02:05:25,335 --> 02:05:31,035
So maybe one alternative is that they think they need better measurement to really identify where the shortcomings are.

1201
02:05:31,845 --> 02:05:37,365
And we also think that all this all of these alternatives, it's not necessarily that these aren't the case.

1202
02:05:37,365 --> 02:05:42,344
It's not like completely new to exquisite. But I think we have agreed that a lot of these things kind of feed into it.

1203
02:05:42,345 --> 02:05:44,835
But the trust is just like the biggest issue that we identified.

1204
02:05:45,885 --> 02:05:49,865
Like things not being the only problem, which is like second alternative is probably part of it as well.

1205
02:05:49,885 --> 02:05:52,965
Like this is a systemic issue that is more than just banks.

1206
02:05:53,685 --> 02:05:59,775
And so maybe they are doing meaningful work, but there's only so much that they can fix if they can't be fully effective on their own.

1207
02:06:01,645 --> 02:06:02,565
And you know, first,

1208
02:06:02,565 --> 02:06:07,875
because they're anything throwing out they can just because of that long history of discrimination and the lasting effects that it still has.

1209
02:06:09,135 --> 02:06:16,875
We also talked about the barriers that communities of color have to exiting the rental market, even if they have mortgages available to them.

1210
02:06:16,875 --> 02:06:20,355
And even though like favorable mortgages, if home values are really high,

1211
02:06:20,505 --> 02:06:25,595
it would still have to be like taking out a lot of debt to get a mortgage, to buy a home.

1212
02:06:25,605 --> 02:06:27,855
And so it just might not be ideal for that.

1213
02:06:28,515 --> 02:06:34,515
And there's other other factors that kind of play into like being a homeowner that just if you can't get a mortgage,

1214
02:06:37,275 --> 02:06:40,155
the first one is if they are investing in the right initiatives,

1215
02:06:40,455 --> 02:06:43,905
maybe their money could be spent better on different programs to address these issues.

1216
02:06:44,265 --> 02:06:50,054
Um, I would say there the programs are pretty comprehensive, but they do target a lot of different things.

1217
02:06:50,055 --> 02:06:55,095
So we just hoping that this is like the main problem that's going on, but it's very possible that there are other things that could be better.

1218
02:06:56,205 --> 02:07:00,705
And then finally, there's this idea that, you know, Gypsy is a for profit organization.

1219
02:07:01,445 --> 02:07:05,295
Like, is it their responsibility to decide these issues?

1220
02:07:06,045 --> 02:07:11,925
Are they like they're not really like incentivized to do so and so maybe like we shouldn't expect them to watch.

1221
02:07:12,435 --> 02:07:17,535
Yeah, we can agree or disagree with, but yeah, those are our alternatives.

1222
02:07:18,165 --> 02:07:21,285
And then the next slide is our discussion questions.

1223
02:07:22,335 --> 02:07:25,765
I think, okay, we got like 10 minutes. Okay.

1224
02:07:26,715 --> 02:07:29,895
So I'll start with this.

1225
02:07:31,035 --> 02:07:37,274
I think through them all right now and then see if anyone feels partially answering specific

1226
02:07:37,275 --> 02:07:39,884
ones because we were originally thinking of having you guys break out into groups.

1227
02:07:39,885 --> 02:07:45,255
But given the time, I think you just kind of talk us through if you want to take the time to do some.

1228
02:07:46,875 --> 02:07:50,865
Q Did you prepare that? I mean, we do. We've prepared your ideas.

1229
02:07:51,915 --> 02:07:57,245
So many people were to the question, but also I think I think we had three questions that we would like to forward and others.

1230
02:07:57,285 --> 02:08:00,485
So I think it's okay. I think it's one of them. Yeah. Yeah.

1231
02:08:00,495 --> 02:08:07,455
So I'll just kind of recap now I guess our first question is, can institutions like PMC do meaningful work and influence social issues?

1232
02:08:07,455 --> 02:08:14,864
And if so, should they? Should we expect them to? They have this claim in the case when they're talking about that we're going to trade agreements,

1233
02:08:14,865 --> 02:08:19,335
and I think they're the only and see who can do this. Basically, they're filling in gaps that no one else can.

1234
02:08:19,575 --> 02:08:26,415
Do you agree with that? And then if so, what, like industry specific and systemic impact?

1235
02:08:26,415 --> 02:08:32,955
Can you see how that organizations can't or no one else can? And then there's this theme about like their for profit.

1236
02:08:33,945 --> 02:08:37,275
Like, how are they profiting from this? Are they, like, paying any costs?

1237
02:08:37,605 --> 02:08:42,615
And does the fact that they're profiting from it minimize the value of the work that they're doing?

1238
02:08:43,425 --> 02:08:46,575
And do you think they'd still be doing it if they if it wasn't as profitable?

1239
02:08:47,415 --> 02:08:51,015
And then the fourth is like, can we be sure? And if so, how?

1240
02:08:51,015 --> 02:08:54,495
That this isn't contributing to gentrification of these community communities.

1241
02:08:54,795 --> 02:08:59,955
And then finally, Gypsy, obviously most of it is external reforms,

1242
02:09:00,615 --> 02:09:05,295
but do you think internal ones are just as important and should one be prioritized over the other?

1243
02:09:06,715 --> 02:09:11,445
Tell. Do with that. What you will? Yeah.

1244
02:09:12,285 --> 02:09:23,845
Any specific question? Stand out to anyone. I think with number three, this is like something that you see with a lot of producers.

1245
02:09:23,855 --> 02:09:26,855
If they're involved in their communities or they're doing good stuff,

1246
02:09:27,275 --> 02:09:36,215
maybe that's a way for them to get more people to invest in their business like or consumers to buy more products or use their business.

1247
02:09:36,225 --> 02:09:42,365
And so even though they're they're using some money to, like, help the community, maybe for them it's like,

1248
02:09:42,995 --> 02:09:46,675
okay, we look good or people are going to use our products or we're making more money.

1249
02:09:46,685 --> 02:09:51,905
So at the end of the day, it's just another way for them to. Make more profit.

1250
02:09:52,115 --> 02:09:58,385
That's how it is. So do you think that like like that being said, that like whatever meaningful work they can do?

1251
02:09:58,415 --> 02:10:01,435
Do you think it is less valuable because of that?

1252
02:10:04,875 --> 02:10:10,335
I don't know, because maybe like the people that they have that are that are doing that meaningful work.

1253
02:10:11,565 --> 02:10:14,625
I'd like to believe that there are people that want to be doing.

1254
02:10:14,665 --> 02:10:17,865
And so that's what makes it, you know, like.

1255
02:10:22,325 --> 02:10:26,525
Like real? I don't know. Yeah. Derek, she wants out.

1256
02:10:26,525 --> 02:10:29,855
What you were saying either because I was at UnitedHealthcare.

1257
02:10:29,975 --> 02:10:35,675
I'm not going to work there, but i know that you don't have health care the other day, and there was one of the directors,

1258
02:10:35,675 --> 02:10:40,654
the a director of health equity, and she used to work at CMI, which is like a drastic change.

1259
02:10:40,655 --> 02:10:42,095
So I just asked her, I was like,

1260
02:10:42,245 --> 02:10:51,484
I sense that you feel like you sacrifice a lot going from government to another like a profit job where your your work,

1261
02:10:51,485 --> 02:10:54,785
like you can only do equity in a way that you guys are still making money.

1262
02:10:55,565 --> 02:11:02,545
And to her, she was saying, like, she is still able to like she placed a lot of value in her work because she cares about it a lot.

1263
02:11:02,555 --> 02:11:06,875
So like she's so able to do some work, although a lot of her suggestions would get rejected.

1264
02:11:07,495 --> 02:11:12,755
Um, so I guess I was like, I struggle with that too, because it's like, I mean, you're doing something good.

1265
02:11:12,755 --> 02:11:17,375
Obviously, it's limited because you have to make sure you're making money for your company or else you can't do it.

1266
02:11:17,645 --> 02:11:24,185
So it's like, I dunno, I think it's that's a hard question to answer, but I wanted to tack on a question to Christina.

1267
02:11:24,185 --> 02:11:28,535
I see your interest and tack on one other question to just have folks think about,

1268
02:11:28,895 --> 02:11:36,875
which is where do the non-profits who benefit from all of this let the giving and all of JPMorgan's or JV campuses presence.

1269
02:11:37,385 --> 02:11:39,065
Where do they end up in all of this?

1270
02:11:39,395 --> 02:11:47,435
Sort of what is the what is the implication for them, whether or not they get to have access to these resources or or not?

1271
02:11:47,825 --> 02:11:52,195
Christiana, go ahead. I was going to say that question.

1272
02:11:52,515 --> 02:11:57,605
You know, that's another tangential thought.

1273
02:11:57,935 --> 02:12:05,565
Okay. Yeah, I was just going to say that like this is like corporate social responsibility or corporate social impact, which is like the whole field.

1274
02:12:05,585 --> 02:12:13,445
Look at itself. I think the idea that like, oh, the relationship benefits both sides.

1275
02:12:13,445 --> 02:12:21,485
Like you get like a better like I guess view or perception of your brand or company, but also like totally important things of the community.

1276
02:12:21,935 --> 02:12:30,065
I think honestly to me it may be worth it just because like these corporations have so much money and like they need to give it to like,

1277
02:12:30,455 --> 02:12:33,965
you know, local nonprofits or like stuff like that to make.

1278
02:12:34,765 --> 02:12:42,055
The impact that only those organizations can make. Like if JP and C started doing stuff in local community, it'd be kind of weird,

1279
02:12:42,295 --> 02:12:47,045
but like giving money to people who can't do that and not make it weird and it can be effective.

1280
02:12:47,335 --> 02:12:55,885
I think it's important and I think like not necessarily a completely bad thing if they get like a better brand perception out of it.

1281
02:12:56,095 --> 02:13:01,675
But I think it's important to like what you're saying about like acknowledging the role that they played in the history of it all.

1282
02:13:02,545 --> 02:13:07,935
How much impact do you suppose they can have, though? And I don't mean that just to you, Christiane.

1283
02:13:08,055 --> 02:13:12,135
Anybody can answer. But I mean, do we think that they have.

1284
02:13:13,175 --> 02:13:17,075
The reason I think you are getting on this and your questions,

1285
02:13:17,735 --> 02:13:24,185
the reason this case I think is relevant to our discussion is because I want you to kind of picture yourself on the side of the funder,

1286
02:13:24,365 --> 02:13:31,835
on the side of the corporation. Corporation. So the organizations have the ability to access resources from this.

1287
02:13:32,315 --> 02:13:36,995
And you have they come in to give money, but how much are they actually able to do?

1288
02:13:38,785 --> 02:13:44,385
You know, who's winning? Is it a ton of resources now that the organizations say, yeah, we can do a lot?

1289
02:13:44,415 --> 02:13:50,345
You all talked about today and three of your current events, presentations, all kinds of interesting ideas,

1290
02:13:50,345 --> 02:13:55,385
but how much money is GMAC actually giving relative to what their goals are?

1291
02:13:55,915 --> 02:14:00,215
You know, is it the equivalent of like a tiny government grant that you could get?

1292
02:14:00,605 --> 02:14:06,905
But because it comes at the weight of a big label and sort of a brand, everyone goes, Oh, wow, that's fantastic.

1293
02:14:08,745 --> 02:14:14,265
Once again, as I always say, not right or wrong. I just want to kind of just think about the angles of it.

1294
02:14:14,955 --> 02:14:18,164
You said who's right? I've talked about this in Jelinek before.

1295
02:14:18,165 --> 02:14:26,475
About like when you said like who? It just made me think as this book called Winners Take It All The Elite Short of Changing the world.

1296
02:14:27,375 --> 02:14:31,394
Exactly. About this, like the like sort of philanthropy business.

1297
02:14:31,395 --> 02:14:38,895
And the argument in the book is essentially that, like, none of this will ever do any good until companies are willing to sacrifice their bottom line.

1298
02:14:39,975 --> 02:14:41,015
And I would agree with that.

1299
02:14:41,025 --> 02:14:50,535
I think I got so long as we have these sort of capitalist structures in which the main goal is to increase shareholder like, you know, profits.

1300
02:14:50,685 --> 02:14:56,085
We're never going to solve these problems. That's very good.

1301
02:14:57,045 --> 02:15:01,364
We'll take that dove and change that rule for the this organization.

1302
02:15:01,365 --> 02:15:04,995
That is a it's technically a nonprofit. It's like the 50 top companies.

1303
02:15:05,445 --> 02:15:08,684
Which I thought was interesting. Not necessarily like that.

1304
02:15:08,685 --> 02:15:13,725
Impactful, but interesting. Like I read that in the case and I was like, okay, what does that mean?

1305
02:15:13,795 --> 02:15:20,114
So then you're saying you're changing the rule, but still probably the shareholders are still probably going to want increased profits.

1306
02:15:20,115 --> 02:15:22,424
I'm going to say that, too. That's kind of a take away we had.

1307
02:15:22,425 --> 02:15:27,675
There were a lot of kind of quotes from Jamie Dimon, the CEO, scattered throughout that, yeah, you seem nice.

1308
02:15:27,675 --> 02:15:30,645
But there was you know, they were awards.

1309
02:15:31,035 --> 02:15:38,895
So as we know, there's a difference between having a good corporate mission statement and putting those statements into action.

1310
02:15:39,105 --> 02:15:43,064
So I would push back then and say, you know, if the government is funding.

1311
02:15:43,065 --> 02:15:47,535
So remember, we started our course at the beginning talking about this transition that kind of took

1312
02:15:47,535 --> 02:15:52,545
place in the early 1980s where all of a sudden the government stepped out of a lot of this.

1313
02:15:52,935 --> 02:15:58,895
So if the government is funding a lot of this, does JPM even have a role to play now?

1314
02:15:58,995 --> 02:15:59,925
Why are they there?

1315
02:16:00,085 --> 02:16:08,385
What's what is it that they're objectively what is their metric that they're getting out of it and that the community is getting out of it versus,

1316
02:16:08,775 --> 02:16:14,715
you know, some of the corporate social responsibility points? Yeah, this isn't quite as that question.

1317
02:16:14,715 --> 02:16:22,334
But I was I was thinking about a lot of what we were talking about really gets back to what you guys like said.

1318
02:16:22,335 --> 02:16:27,045
The problem is like the mistrust and the fact that they can only do so much good if they're not going

1319
02:16:27,045 --> 02:16:33,045
to be accepted into the community and actually trust by those that are on the ground doing the work.

1320
02:16:33,045 --> 02:16:37,905
And maybe like that's where, you know, the integration with other nonprofits comes in.

1321
02:16:38,175 --> 02:16:46,965
But as you said, it's only like so much they can do to just put a drop in the bucket for them and like actually donate to those organizations.

1322
02:16:47,355 --> 02:16:52,754
But I feel like that's one of the only way that it can really actually have an impact is using like the existing

1323
02:16:52,755 --> 02:16:58,125
structures and people in the community who are invested in already know what the issues are on the ground.

1324
02:16:58,575 --> 02:17:05,325
And just to add to that, I think that was one of our really big problems with the too was like not having those details of like or giving this much

1325
02:17:05,325 --> 02:17:10,724
money to small businesses was like which small businesses like how did you decide which small businesses to give money to?

1326
02:17:10,725 --> 02:17:17,265
Like, you know, in their Detroit example, they said that they talked to the community members like Mayor Duggan.

1327
02:17:17,265 --> 02:17:23,295
You know, like I was like I kind of only heard one name given, but it's this blanket statement that, oh, we involved the community.

1328
02:17:23,295 --> 02:17:25,965
Well, do you like the language in the case?

1329
02:17:25,965 --> 02:17:30,535
It was interesting, too, because they always say, like earmarks as much money or like we committed this much money.

1330
02:17:30,545 --> 02:17:34,664
It's like, did you actually give it like and then like especially the metrics issue too,

1331
02:17:34,665 --> 02:17:38,445
like just not having any data that's actually showing what you're doing and how effective it is.

1332
02:17:38,565 --> 02:17:42,255
It's really learning a non less common than I don't get to read.

1333
02:17:42,885 --> 02:17:45,145
So that's probably a bad last comment.

1334
02:17:46,815 --> 02:17:54,765
I was just going to say like I yeah, this is also like because you brought up a point like are they actually impactful?

1335
02:17:54,975 --> 02:18:02,955
And no, because like that's not their goal. Like their goal isn't to help out communities and be like their goal is to make money.

1336
02:18:03,015 --> 02:18:06,074
So and then like just to make sure that they don't look bad.

1337
02:18:06,075 --> 02:18:13,095
They have these, like small side things like to do the community, but like, of course, whatever they do, I always like,

1338
02:18:13,095 --> 02:18:17,955
I sound like a Republican or, you know, I'm not, I swear, I'm just like cause I try to contextualize everything.

1339
02:18:17,955 --> 02:18:24,104
Like, my expectations for Jp morgan Chase is going to be very low because like their goal is this.

1340
02:18:24,105 --> 02:18:29,865
So I don't know. I was just I was going to say I was like, yeah, they're not going to be impactful because their goal isn't to be impactful.

1341
02:18:29,865 --> 02:18:33,644
Their goal is to make money. So I appreciate your comment.

1342
02:18:33,645 --> 02:18:40,215
And I want to close at this point because I actually I think you're helping your all of this to elevate this discussion point,

1343
02:18:40,725 --> 02:18:45,735
which is Christiana starts off by talking a little bit about CSR, corporate social responsibility.

1344
02:18:46,935 --> 02:18:50,715
We have to in some ways I think this case helps us to see decouple.

1345
02:18:51,465 --> 02:18:55,215
So it's it's the different interests for different stakeholders.

1346
02:18:55,725 --> 02:19:01,485
They have a set of interests that they're looking to achieve the nonprofits episode of interests that they're looking to achieve.

1347
02:19:01,515 --> 02:19:08,055
It's okay if some overlap right and said there may be some overlap but what sometimes have.

1348
02:19:08,245 --> 02:19:14,935
The reason I brought this case into our community here is because we were talking about philanthropy and kind of coalition building,

1349
02:19:14,935 --> 02:19:23,515
etc. There is a sense of sometimes among managers that if we simply just get partners like this involved and all will start to flow.

1350
02:19:24,025 --> 02:19:31,285
And I think that there's as leaders in an organization, again, it's not the label someone is having nefarious intentions.

1351
02:19:31,305 --> 02:19:34,975
It's to be real about what is it that their motivation is?

1352
02:19:35,455 --> 02:19:38,875
What is their objective? What are they trying to accomplish, what are they trying to do?

1353
02:19:39,145 --> 02:19:42,655
And then be real about what you can expect to have out of that.

1354
02:19:43,225 --> 02:19:48,085
So, you know, yes, we could say they should have a bigger staff, they should have more people,

1355
02:19:48,085 --> 02:19:54,265
they should have this, they should be listening to the media, etc. But is that part of their objective or is it to say as an organization,

1356
02:19:54,535 --> 02:20:00,745
if we see that opportunities are coming from a funder like this and the community, is that a resource that we go after?

1357
02:20:01,075 --> 02:20:04,855
Or do we keep our focus on things that we think are a little bit more aligned with our mission?

1358
02:20:05,455 --> 02:20:10,315
So I think that what you are brought to the forefront is an excellent presentation, very thorough,

1359
02:20:10,765 --> 02:20:14,515
and I know that the days are getting shorter, so it's like it's really dark in here now.

1360
02:20:14,525 --> 02:20:18,595
It might be nice and bright to work on getting lights going,

1361
02:20:19,405 --> 02:20:30,475
but what you all did a great job of highlighting for us is in your excellent presentation is is that that interest group mentality and what,

1362
02:20:30,745 --> 02:20:34,075
what they're looking to accomplish and what sort of the outcome of that is.

1363
02:20:34,255 --> 02:20:39,055
And I think that that's that's that's really a great learning point for us to keep in mind

1364
02:20:39,205 --> 02:20:45,125
is what are the interests and what what is the objective in terms of that stakeholder?

1365
02:20:46,425 --> 02:20:54,465
So with that, we're back. We have five, five more sessions, I think, and then we'll be to the finish line.

1366
02:20:54,855 --> 02:21:01,754
So let's keep our energy on the up. I know today was everyone is feeling a little bit kind of like, okay, we're back to this,

1367
02:21:01,755 --> 02:21:05,775
but we'll be back next week and then we're going to have any more breaks.

1368
02:21:05,775 --> 02:21:10,905
So let's try to keep some good momentum going to get us to that conclusion of the course.

1369
02:21:11,205 --> 02:21:16,695
I'm looking forward to hearing more of your current events and more outstanding case presentations that no joke.

1370
02:21:16,875 --> 02:21:21,734
Everything you are bringing in here is really just such a privilege to listen to all

1371
02:21:21,735 --> 02:21:25,785
of your thoughts and what you're sharing and learning that we're able to do together.

1372
02:21:25,845 --> 02:21:37,415
So thank you all and we'll see you all. It's like on the bottom of the screen.

1373
02:21:37,435 --> 02:21:41,975
Like it shows like kind of interesting stuff.
