00:00:05,431 --> 00:00:07,774
Hi, I'm Carrie Karvonen-Gutierrez, and

2
00:00:07,774 --> 00:00:11,950
I'm a faculty member here in
the Department of Epidemiology.

3
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:14,600
Today, we're going to
talk about inflammation.

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,200
As a public health practitioner, you may
have heard a lot about inflammation,

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,710
because it is known as the culprit
underlying many of our age related

6
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:25,750
diseases, which are of major
importance to public health.

7
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:30,430
Often, inflammation is considered in
a negative way in respect to our health.

8
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:34,810
But it is actually a necessary part
of our body's defense against injury,

9
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:38,080
pathogens, and other invaders.

10
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,300
In this module, we will get
a introduction to the ways in which

11
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:46,520
inflammation keeps us healthy and learn
the cardinal science of inflammation.

12
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,180
In later modules, we will learn
the differences between acute and

13
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,960
chronic inflammation.

14
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,680
Inflammation is the body's local vascular
and cellular response to injury.

15
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,330
The word inflammation comes from the Latin
word inflammare, which means to ignite.

16
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:07,780
Keep this in mind as we think of
the cardinal signs of inflammation.

17
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:12,860
Inflammation is an adaptive response
to restore homeostasis in the body.

18
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:18,910
When our body's homeostasis is disrupted
by injury, pathogens, or other invaders,

19
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:23,190
inflammation is the body's way to
signal the immune system to heal and

20
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:28,640
repair damaged tissue and
mount a defense against those invaders.

21
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,640
Inflammation can be present
throughout our body and

22
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,820
is part of the normal response
following injury or infection.

23
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,010
It is a normal response.

24
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:42,390
For example, if you have a sty or
an infection in one of the glands on your

25
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:46,890
eyelid, as shown in this picture,
it will become red and painful.

26
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,280
This is due to inflammation.

27
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,420
Or perhaps you injured part of the gum
in your mouth by eating something rough

28
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,660
or sharp.

29
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,885
Your gum line will feel swollen and
painful.

30
00:01:57,885 --> 00:02:01,160
This, too, is due to inflammation.

31
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:05,920
Four of the cardinal signs of inflammation
were first described in the first century

32
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,000
by a Roman medical writer.

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,300
And because of this,
they've been named using Latin words,

34
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:15,940
including calor, rubor, dolor and tumor.

35
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:21,180
These words mean heat,
redness, pain and swelling.

36
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:26,080
These cardinal signs of information are
due to the pathophysiologic response of

37
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:33,290
our body in response to injury or invaders
as part of the inflammatory response.

38
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:37,780
As we learn about inflammation, think back
to these cardinal signs to understand how

39
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:44,680
they occur, what physically happens
in our body to lead to these signs.

40
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,340
In the 19th century,

41
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:51,200
a fifth cardinal sign of inflammation
was added, the loss of function.

42
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,770
This loss of function results as
a consequence of the other four signs,

43
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:59,150
particularly pain and swelling,
which limit movement, and

44
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:02,500
thus inhibit our normal function.

45
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,770
Our body has many lines of
defense to keep us healthy.

46
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:08,640
Some of these defenses are nonspecific.

47
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,700
That means that they are mounted and
respond to any injury or nay invader.

48
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:18,810
Our first and second lines of
defense in our body are nonspecific.

49
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:23,310
Other defenses are specific, which means
that they have a tailored response,

50
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:27,390
which are initiated when challenged
with a specific pathogen.

51
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:30,110
More information about
these specific responses

52
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:34,020
are included in the module on immunity.

53
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:38,560
Let's start by taking a look
at the first line of defense.

54
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,150
You can imagine how our body is challenged
with all sorts of potential invaders and

55
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,190
injuries all of the time.

56
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:48,070
We come in contact with
many different surfaces.

57
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:52,760
We inhale air with microparticles and
pathogens, and even when we walk,

58
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,230
we bump into something
which may cause us injury.

59
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,780
Most of these encounters, in fact,
however, do not make us ill.

60
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:03,360
We encounter these exposures all
the time but remain healthy.

61
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,250
Why is that?

62
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:09,790
Well, our body has a robust first line
of defense which continually works to

63
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:13,250
protect us from the outside environment.

64
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:17,440
This first line of defense includes
our skin, mucus membranes,

65
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,020
secretions, and hair.

66
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:23,900
Let's think of an example of how
this first line of defense works.

67
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,540
Think of a windy day when small
particles including dust and

68
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,120
dirt are being blown all around.

69
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:35,640
These dust and dirt particles might get in
our eyes and cause damage or an infection.

70
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:40,110
However, our body works to keep those
out of our eye and keep us healthy.

71
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:45,050
Our eyes' blink reflexes work to
keep dust and dirt out of our body.

72
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:49,670
And even if they do get near our eye,
our eyelashes work to trap the dust and

73
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:53,030
dirt before they get into our eye.

74
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:57,460
If they do get in, we do have a tear
response then that can work to cleanse

75
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:03,440
the area and remove the invader,
in this case, dust or dirt from our body.

76
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,540
All of this is part of
the first line of defense.

77
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:11,907
Like the first line, the second line
of defense is also nonspecific,

78
00:05:11,907 --> 00:05:16,030
meaning that it responds to any injury or
invader.

79
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:20,240
Unlike the first line of defense, however,
which largely works to keep invaders

80
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,710
out of our body, the second line of
defense is the way our body responds

81
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:30,480
once we have already become injured or
once an invader has entered our body.

82
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,830
The inflammatory response is included
in the second line of defense.

83
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:40,700
And it works to identify, engulf and
destroy unwanted invaders to our body and

84
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:45,340
to signal and repair other
systems to aid in tissue repair.

85
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:49,230
We will learn more about this process,
and how it is both beneficial and

86
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:53,060
detrimental for our health,
throughout this module.

87
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:57,420
In addition to initiating tissue healing
and repair and destroying invaders,

88
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:00,900
the inflammatory response plays
a major role in signaling for

89
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:05,930
the third line of defense in our body,
the specific immune response.

90
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:09,380
Inflammation is the body's way
of signalling the immune system,

91
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,460
which can further help
with tissue healing and

92
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:16,380
repair, but can also mount
a tailored attack against invaders.

93
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:20,780
More information about the ways in which
the immune system works to keep us healthy

94
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:27,720
in both specific and nonspecific ways
is included in the module on immunity.

95
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:32,190
In this module, we learned that
inflammation is part of our body's normal,

96
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:36,950
automatic, and non-specific
response to injury or an invader,

97
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:41,840
and that the five cardinal signs of
inflammation include heat, redness,

98
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,010
pain, swelling, and loss of function.

99
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:50,070
Inflammation is part of the underlying
physiology of nearly all injuries and

100
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,260
diseases.

101
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:55,260
I encourage you to think about your own
work and your own areas of interest to see

102
00:06:55,260 --> 00:07:00,453
how the inflammatory process is
relevant for those health conditions.
