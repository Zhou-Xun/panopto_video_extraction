1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,490
And despite the fact that you can take courses on measurement and multilevel models

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,350
and mediation and categorical normative models or generalize on your model,

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,940
there's still just a small portion of the types of analysis that we might include.

4
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:20,250
I actually think there are a few that we've borrowed from places like epidemiology and

5
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:27,480
public policy and education that can be readily applied to public health types of problems.

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,579
And so I asked Alice to come in and talk about one example survival analysis,

7
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:38,190
which I think is going to be relevant to some of the folks who are working, especially in health care spaces.

8
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,840
But I think you can use in a variety of interesting ways in social sciences, too.

9
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:48,510
So the good news is we'll still have time or this week to cover some structural question on stuff.

10
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,610
I did post a video lecture and some other materials for folks to take a peek at this week.

11
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:59,460
But we'll go through an example on Thursday as well and give you a little bit time to play around with it.

12
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:05,110
And then that particular subject, that's two courses, folks.

13
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:12,450
You want to become an expert researcher, presumably you're probably taking at least a course, of course, in a half hour because it is so encompassing.

14
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:17,759
But the big theme from what we'll spend Thursday doing is that it's really just combining some

15
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:23,010
of the same sort of ideas that we've been using all semester long the measurement pieces,

16
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,290
the structural pieces, the regression pieces,

17
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:31,560
it's all just going to come together in this pretty elegant framework to allow us to do a lot of stuff at the same exact time.

18
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,819
But then again, your toolkit will continue to expand.

19
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:42,060
And I want folks to know that just because I didn't touch on it this semester and maybe I'll pull up a slide of some other common,

20
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:46,650
commonly used techniques that I didn't have a chance to cover.

21
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:55,410
This would be like advanced advanced quantitative methods around things like survival analysis or lean class analysis or,

22
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:02,040
I don't know, time series or all sorts of other Bayesian analysis,

23
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:08,790
all sorts of different things that even if you just have a basic foundation, you might be able to apply and use a little bit of that in the field.

24
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:15,510
Or more importantly, you can be conversant when we're engaging with people who are sharing those sorts of results and analysis.

25
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,870
So this is a good one to cover and delighted that these can be here.

26
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,370
Thank you. One more time for joining us this semester, and I'm looking forward to hearing what you get.

27
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:28,919
And just something really humble. I'm like one who goofed and put the date wrong on my calendar.

28
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:36,660
So I showed up to it. I was like, Oh, and just is like, Oh, you're here. So thank you for letting me present, even though this is not planned.

29
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:42,570
So as I just mentioned, we're going to talk a little about survival analysis today.

30
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,240
And you know what? We're just going to jump right in with asking you all, what do you think survival analysis is?

31
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,010
That's me. Oh, this is like the way we interact in the class.

32
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:59,069
Did you did you start recording? I did, yes. Six guesses are and I apologize.

33
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:02,640
I didn't put the slide I normally have in there about like classroom norms.

34
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,830
I was doing this thing on the fly last night after a kind of a crazy conference week last week.

35
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,660
So I but the norms, of course, are that we talk about classroom are like, you know, being gentle with ourselves.

36
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:19,740
And if we have critiques critiquing ideas, not people, and then yeah, just being courageous and guessing if we need to.

37
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:30,890
I don't think I have that. Something that comes to mind is like kaplan-meier curves are spot on.

38
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:34,610
Yes, we're going to be talking about half of markers really soon. Fantastic.

39
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:41,190
Hello. Welcome. You know, you're great.

40
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,600
What? Like, what do we think that the purpose of the survival analysis is?

41
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:49,170
Any guesses? Any content on this? Any knowledge?

42
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:55,960
Even from the like what is it called in terms of survival analysis?

43
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:13,440
Hedging guesses is highly encourage. I mean, that's exactly what it says.

44
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:19,680
But at the rate of survival just from population stuff.

45
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:25,680
Great. Yeah. So you're matching rates, which would imply some sort of fraction.

46
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:32,550
And the idea that we're looking at a certain number of outcomes relative to time.

47
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:40,319
Yes. Awesome. So those are all really important things of general description or the general definition

48
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,850
would be studies examining the timing of certain events relative to a starting time.

49
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
So you guys were spot on on the right.

50
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:55,170
The right hand side is the kaplan-meier curves. So we mentioned that on the left hand side is a visualization of what these things sometimes

51
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:58,950
look like and how we would portray these things and as as we think through these concepts.

52
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:09,450
So continuing to hedge some guesses what types of questions we want to answer using survival analysis.

53
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:32,780
And again, it's rates of an outcome relative to time. Yep.

54
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:42,020
Great American achievement, contrasting treatments and understanding the amount of time, for example, to actually survive.

55
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:53,220
Perfect. But if you use it to look bad.

56
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:03,140
So I love that you're thinking about like comparison of medication to placebo.

57
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:12,430
The term efficacy is kind of a really big one. I think you could use a survival analysis to bolster the argument for efficacy, but I don't know.

58
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:18,460
And Justin, maybe you can chime in. I don't know that you could make an entire claim about efficacy based on just a survival analysis.

59
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:36,910
But I don't know. If one of your if one of your covariates was a program and you're looking at differential rates by program,

60
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:42,070
and that would be as a as a quasi experimental design as what it is.

61
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:46,800
All right. So yes. And I don't know, I'm always thirsty like this.

62
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:51,580
I guess the next one, I that's a good question.

63
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,760
So I also want to we've noticed some things relative to disease and survival,

64
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:04,240
as you guys correctly identified, was originally formulated to measure outcomes relative to death.

65
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:12,550
But we can also think of survival, like moving away from the actual definition of the survival term to think about just outcomes of any sort.

66
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:23,190
So time to give an outcome. So an example could be like time to taking a given course within a college, right?

67
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:29,590
Time to, you know, relative to the years of of being in college or semesters being in college.

68
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:42,310
Time to getting a driver's license relative to years and then looking at covariates, including socioeconomic status, state morality, things like that.

69
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:51,450
Right. And we can think about those types of things as outcomes and other outcomes that may not be death that you all are interested in.

70
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:55,240
And then you're given contents areas.

71
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:07,650
Justin Grant program, implementation program in Plantation.

72
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:27,730
Right. Yeah. Others. What are some of the things you guys are interested in terms of outcomes, health outcomes?

73
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:43,180
Smoking cessation. Okay, so time to a cessation in that population.

74
00:08:43,420 --> 00:09:05,680
Yeah. What else are y'all interested in?

75
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:32,080
Injury prevention. Okay. Yes.

76
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:37,089
A-plus in the cause. All right.

77
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:46,239
So we could think of like if we are looking at a like a yoga community or a sample of high risk, like a high risk community.

78
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:52,000
Right. In terms of exposure to gun violence, looking at the age of first exposure to weapon.

79
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,380
Right. Or age of first exposure to the gun violence, outcome of interest.

80
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:01,770
That could be an example where it's not death, but it is a negative and health risk.

81
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:09,190
Right. So the major concepts in survival analysis are time events and this thing called sensory.

82
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:19,620
And I will let you guys participate some more. So we're going to use the poll because people are being a little shy today.

83
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:27,570
So please log in. You can either text or you can buy a computer, log in and let us know what is time.

84
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:58,940
I want to we're going to have. I have like multiple sclerosis and she's like three people.

85
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:06,110
Oh, interesting. MINKOFF Question is, how much time do have this place?

86
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:18,510
Uh huh. All right, now, how about now? I guess I like this idea of pool everywhere, but I don't know that I actually like the functionality.

87
00:11:55,930 --> 00:12:00,000
I think. Okay.

88
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:10,750
A lot of people are thinking about it being a measure. Definitely feeling that all the time.

89
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:20,950
Yeah. So it's this construct of, you know, some sort of measurement of temporality, which is of course,

90
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:24,050
like, you know, using the definition in the definition is the word definition.

91
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:28,630
You know, a number of moments in a given span. Hi.

92
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:36,610
So. Within survival analysis.

93
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:44,200
Time is our outcome. It's the dependent variable. And we want to know, you know, as we've kind of been getting out.

94
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:49,110
At what point does our study population generally start to experience a human event?

95
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:55,900
And it's really useful. You know, these personalities are very useful for understanding the longitudinal relationship

96
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,140
between link time and outcomes and in terms of like the health outcome.

97
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:02,980
But in our actual models, time is our dependent variable.

98
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:06,850
So there are two types of time.

99
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:11,000
There is calendar time, which is also known as secular time.

100
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:19,870
That's the kind of time we are most generally familiar with in terms of it is 10:00 or it's right now it's 8:50 a.m. on December six,

101
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:27,490
2022 or in 3 hours, you know, it'll be 11:50 a.m.

102
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:32,379
But then there's clinical course time. Clinical, of course.

103
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:40,920
Time is not calendar time. It's not secular and it's entirely dependent upon our start value and it's measured relative to the start value.

104
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:47,259
So for example, we could say our zero and our three hour nine,

105
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:51,159
those would all be clinical time point because you have a starting value of zero and then

106
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:55,330
you have the subsequent time periods that aren't dependent upon a clinical calendar.

107
00:13:55,780 --> 00:14:03,220
It could be a year, it could be six months, but again, it's not dependent upon the actual day or time, it's dependent upon that start value.

108
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:13,030
And that's really critical in our survival analysis as we go through and in our in our lives, we're talking about survival analysis.

109
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:18,190
Time is going to be numeric. It's going to include time zero, and then it's going to be to the end of the study.

110
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,879
And again, it's not clinical. It's not like, you know, from January 1st.

111
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:28,060
It's not when we put an RB application. We're going to start from January 1st, 2020 or through January 1st, 2024.

112
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:36,160
No, that's not what it means. It means we're going to do the study from time zero up through two years and collect data at three month intervals.

113
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:41,380
That's clinical time. Questions about clinical versus calendar.

114
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:57,080
Okay. So looking at this display, how much time do you think is in this display?

115
00:14:57,090 --> 00:15:00,540
And I'm going to again open up. Oops.

116
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:12,750
So I think. So your options are three, four and five, and I'm going go back to the slide so you can see this.

117
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,479
I suppose the fact that you think. Well, I'm sat here. Let me in the place.

118
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,410
Sure. Yes. Or at least if I can put these like side by side, I can.

119
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:28,430
You see that? You know. It's like text.

120
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:31,910
It is 20912, two, two, three, three, three, three.

121
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:36,620
Know it's like really tiny or something bigger and.

122
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:42,610
Oh, it's covered up. Oh, [INAUDIBLE].

123
00:15:42,670 --> 00:16:10,390
Sorry to. So we're kind of having a split between three and four.

124
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,860
Again, we don't have a label for the time.

125
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:21,580
Like that's the kind of back to the clinical and the labels relatively irrelevant and.

126
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:28,850
At this moment in terms of interpretation becomes very relevant. But for right now, it's kind of irrelevant.

127
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:39,810
Okay. So in this.

128
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:47,850
Oops. Yeah. And it's just like we can see that the time ranges from 0 to 4.

129
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,520
And the answer, honestly, it's a bit tricky.

130
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:58,230
It's kind of a trick question because it could be four, but it also depends on whether you're going to include your baseline.

131
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:01,980
So can some people have the event at baseline?

132
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,680
Generally, when we're doing recruitment,

133
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:11,970
we would want to have inclusion or exclusion criteria that would deal with whether or not people have the event already at baseline.

134
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:18,000
And it's not super helpful to include someone in a study where they have even a baseline because then it's like,

135
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,420
okay, well they already have the event that's done, but that would give us a prevalence at baseline.

136
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:25,860
And if you were looking at relative to a clinical diagnosis or something, that could be helpful, I'll be like,

137
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:33,450
well, a clinical diagnosis or sorry, not diagnosed, but got clinical intake of this population.

138
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:41,940
X percent had already the outcome of interest. And then, you know, six months later, you know, it was this proportion that would be kind of helpful.

139
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,850
But generally when you're doing survival analysis in this time analysis,

140
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:50,880
you're going to be having your you're not going to include people who already have the diagnosis generally.

141
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,200
It just depends on your site design.

142
00:17:52,230 --> 00:18:00,570
So I would have said for probably as well, but again, it's kind of a tricky question and it'll depend on your inclusion and exclusion criteria.

143
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:08,600
Okay. So the event is the outcome of interest.

144
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:16,250
This could be the person gets the disease. For my work, it's like someone reports perpetrating dating violence of some sort.

145
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:27,310
Generally speaking, when we do a survival analysis, once an event occurs, that person, we don't need to really collect more data about them.

146
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:30,920
The events happened. We have the timing of the event.

147
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:34,970
That's all we're looking to find out when we're doing this survival analysis.

148
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,500
However, it's not the only thing that might stop someone to contribute.

149
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:44,840
Stop someone's time. Okay, so this is where we're going to start going into censoring.

150
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:51,500
So here we can see we have a number of events. And on the left hand side is the subject's we have seven subjects in this example.

151
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:57,559
And we have time from 0 to 4. No one has the event at time zero.

152
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:04,520
So in this study, either the exclusion criteria was they couldn't have the amount yet or they just had a population or no one's had it.

153
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:11,150
And we can see, like as we check out, we can see kind of like the following across time.

154
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:21,049
So. For example, observation one this person or this person or view of the place,

155
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:26,390
whatever it is that as our subject had the occurrence right before time one,

156
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:33,920
you see that and then for example, three has it at time three, four as onset time two,

157
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:38,450
etc. This would reflect if we actually have a call of real exposure.

158
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,790
This doesn't necessarily reflect one. We're going to collect that data. Okay.

159
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:51,370
Instead. This is when the events would be recorded, right? These would be at the times of clinical or ad evaluation rate.

160
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:54,520
So you have time point four, three, two and one has a zero.

161
00:19:54,820 --> 00:20:00,810
And you can see like we collected the occurrence here, here,

162
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:06,460
even though the first happened back here and then at 10.4, for example, does that make sense?

163
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,820
And I think three and four like the yellow and blue are unfortunately overlapping on that one.

164
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:15,070
Sorry about that. That's kind of poor representation.

165
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,800
Questions about this as of right now. We're going to talk a bit more about it.

166
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:28,599
But any questions you have now? Yes. Your survival analysis doesn't have to be like the one discrete event.

167
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:32,960
Or could there potentially be like a multiple like multiple occurring events that occur?

168
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:42,160
So generally for survival analysis, for the actual analysis, you can have one event in a study design if you're going be collecting data anyways,

169
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:46,690
it's probably helpful to collect for multiple many correlating events.

170
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:51,849
It just depends on the study question and the purpose of the study as well as resources in the amount of time and survey fatigue.

171
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:56,889
All those pieces are kind of balancing out, but generally you have like this one event.

172
00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:01,719
Now if you want to say like there's a cumulative event that you're like, well, they have to have one, two and three.

173
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,260
And once they have one, two and three, that's when we're going to time the event.

174
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:10,000
That could be a criteria, but the actual timing, it's a one shot timing.

175
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:17,290
They're going to you're going to collect the amount of time up until your defined event, which, again, event is just a term.

176
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:24,700
It could be anything, you know, it could be a series of events that you're checking along or it could be a diagnosis of a singular occurrence.

177
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:34,860
Great question. So these different like ten points is just like, okay, this is what I'm collecting my three month data.

178
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:39,390
So I'm going to ask them, how do you experience this in the last three months about your event?

179
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:49,020
Yeah, potentially. Right. So we can have actual, for example, like a like collection of self-reported events.

180
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:56,340
We could also potentially do something like through our electronic health record and just look at what time points people are having.

181
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:05,700
The time does need to be. If you're using an E, R, which is more observational,

182
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:12,180
there is a bit of potential confounding in that when people come in might be kind

183
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:16,130
of relative to like it might not be exactly the point of X of their timing.

184
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:21,810
Again, like the blue is like the true like if we were all knowing it, right, that would be the true timing.

185
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:26,740
But the yellow is when it's like identified within our study. So that could be based on that.

186
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:32,880
Each are based on like we sample people every three months and if they report at that three month period that that's when we'd say,

187
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:36,060
Oh, they've had the event. Two good questions.

188
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:45,930
You can also think about this not just person, but you could think about this at a more macro level.

189
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:54,459
So if you're interested, for example, I do some cannabis work, right we can look at by year and states who are legalizing medicinal marijuana as

190
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:59,110
compared to recreational marijuana and time to event right time like by year,

191
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:06,430
for example. So you could look at that at the state level and then your subjects would just be each state, you know, 5050 generally, right?

192
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:10,389
Most years there's other things to think about what include you see versus what regards to like that.

193
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:13,810
But yeah, generally, yes, not Puerto Rico at all.

194
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:24,790
The other questions feel free to resentence into for confused.

195
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:37,780
So what do you guys think about two and six? Not the exposure.

196
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:52,080
They haven't had the exposure. So just experience the event.

197
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:56,820
Perfect. How much time do you think that would quantify the man's?

198
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:09,610
Great. So our real you are observed that I think the real experience is greater than for our time.

199
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:14,790
A study ends at four. So we would we would give them you.

200
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:20,620
They wouldn't have experienced the events at time for and you're exactly right, they'd have for periods of time or they hadn't experienced the event.

201
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:24,760
We don't know if they're going experience it in the future, so we can't account for that, of course.

202
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:37,120
So this is where we get into censoring. So censoring happens to an individual that never reports an event.

203
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,660
And this could be due to two reasons, right?

204
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:46,150
One is that they truly never experienced the event during, say, during the study.

205
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:57,100
The second is that the second is that, you know, when we collect data, are we always have missing data problems, right?

206
00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:04,560
And so you have two options for doing that. You could say we're only going to include people who have no missing data, which might really, you know,

207
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:10,870
kind of skew your findings or bias your results, or you say, okay, we're going to handle our missing data by using censoring.

208
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:15,310
So there's two forms of sensing right and left.

209
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:22,900
And the purpose of censoring is so that you can count the time periods that you have of that individual, even if you don't know their outcome status.

210
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:29,780
So these are the two observations you talked about. Two and six are called.

211
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:30,950
They're called, right, censored.

212
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:38,220
That means that we don't know their outcomes after a certain period, but that they have time up until our cutoff point.

213
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:47,730
So we sent we kind of like censor their data in that we never have an event, but we have information about them throughout the entire period.

214
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:59,460
So I'm going to hop back to this guy.

215
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:13,380
I know he kind of already got at it, but let's just do a quick comprehension check of how much time is contributed by two schools.

216
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:26,260
So observation to how much time would be contributed in our study.

217
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:33,879
I think it has been minus the one. The last question. Oh, shoot.

218
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:38,670
I'm sorry. Let's go. So I guess.

219
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:51,570
Four. Great. This is actually no funny.

220
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:57,090
I could.

221
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:15,090
So in this study we have four clinical timepoints points because again, we don't have people who are experiencing time zero and counting time zero.

222
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:27,060
So we can account for up to four time chunks. So people so individuals two and six would contribute for chunks of time having no event.

223
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,220
Okay. Now to get let me ask for we less than ten questions about rates.

224
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:52,830
I'm sorry. We're about to get a little bit more confusing for adolescents when they say just if they don't want the event after that.

225
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:57,560
Well, they might have the event. We don't we don't know what happens to them.

226
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:03,410
Right. So this is like the blues, like all knowing. Right. But the, you know, yellow was before what actually happened.

227
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:08,090
So they might have the amendment right right after the end of the study. We just don't know because we're no longer collecting data.

228
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:11,960
We're looking for following them. So this is all unknown.

229
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:19,490
It could be that they keep on forever and never have that. But because we don't collect data on it, we can't we can't predict that.

230
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:23,690
I mean, we could estimate a prediction, but we don't have that within our model.

231
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:30,360
So this great sense, you mean you just have to see.

232
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:34,520
But you didn't have an event during your study? Mm hmm. Exactly.

233
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:38,570
And there are some studies that will only include people who have the event.

234
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:42,590
So they wouldn't do right. Sensory, they would just remove those observations.

235
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:46,519
But if we're doing more kind of observational or trying to get population level estimates,

236
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:50,000
we'd want to include people who never had the event because that's our real world.

237
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,110
The only event that you know, the only true event that, you know,

238
00:28:55,160 --> 00:29:01,850
people would always have at some point is death, but it might not be due to whatever, whatever the causes.

239
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:05,630
So if you were to follow people throughout their entire lives and were able to collect full data on everyone,

240
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:12,410
which again is really hard to do, you'd have an outcome for everything, but most of the outcomes don't.

241
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:16,490
Not everyone experiences, right? Very few experience.

242
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:20,930
Very few events are universal. Separate death and virtually.

243
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:34,090
Questions or questions about this. Okay.

244
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,380
So let's talk about licensing and make it a little more complicated.

245
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:46,480
So again, this is like could include like the screening out of individuals who already had exposure at baseline.

246
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:51,100
And again, we want to ask the question of like in my study kind of subjects, time to that be zero.

247
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:59,670
It's not super useful to have people who have the time at like at the time these zero in your your survival analysis.

248
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:04,660
It's not going to give you much information, but it could give you the prevalence of the event at a given start point,

249
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:07,510
which would be helpful potentially, depending what your question is.

250
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:15,070
So let's answer is like the event has already happened before, the subject is included in the study, but it's not known what it occurred.

251
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:20,110
So it began prior to the time, the starting time and again,

252
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:25,540
we're not talking about time in the secular sense of talking about time in the clinical sense or start time.

253
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:34,750
Licensing affects the way that time is calculated as well, because insights about less censoring time can equals zero.

254
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,270
But in studies that have less and less, censoring time cannot equal zero.

255
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:51,550
Let me go back. So questions about that left censoring versus right censoring.

256
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:58,090
And I'm sorry, what's up here? The part where it cannot be told.

257
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:03,820
Right. So in it, it cannot equal zero.

258
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:08,590
If the study has left, censoring means you're removing everyone.

259
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:15,770
Yeah. Yeah. I wasn't sure if you'd like. Okay.

260
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:21,390
But if you don't have left something, your time can equal zero.

261
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:27,310
The first get the applicable zero part versus nine.

262
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:32,500
It's confusing. Yeah.

263
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:40,450
Oh, yeah, that's okay. So if your time can equal zero, I'm in.

264
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:47,350
Make sure I do this right. So I'm going to use you. So time can equal zero if you don't have left.

265
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:57,400
Censoring. Left censoring is when you remove anyone who has had the event prior to the start or who has the event at the start.

266
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:05,170
So you'd remove those people and you'd only have people who have not had the event in clinical trials.

267
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:14,480
They always use less than three. They want to know about people who develop something after starting to use a given drug, for example.

268
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:18,010
They do not care about how they already have it. That's just not going to make them money.

269
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:26,110
Yes. After doing that with a clinical trial, do they then have to repeat it and not life sentences or so it's applicable to the real world?

270
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:34,780
I don't actually know the answer to that. And my guess is no. But the FDA, the question.

271
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:40,690
My guess would be no. Okay. Because again, like the it's the regulations that kind of get into that.

272
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:47,620
You know, we're very capitalistic society, very capitalism.

273
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:54,720
Yeah, that's more of a problem question, I would say. Yeah, another question.

274
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:06,440
All right. We have more questions, something we can come back to this.

275
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:16,340
So let's talk about people who are missing. So this is a common issue that we have in any sort of data set.

276
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:25,760
It's very rare to have complete data. It's very, very, very frankly suspect if you have complete data, given the real world implications.

277
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,290
But maybe you're collecting data from an easily engaged population.

278
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:37,250
So in this image, right, we can see that Subject five has some missing data.

279
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:41,360
And missing this, of course, can occur for a variety of reasons. Right.

280
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:45,169
We could have lost a follow up. We could have withdrawal.

281
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:48,980
Now, I should say, like lost of all, up is the most common reason.

282
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:54,350
If you had someone who withdraws from the study and indicates that they want all of their data withdrawn,

283
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:57,620
you'd be removing them entirely so you wouldn't be dealing with their missing data.

284
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:02,270
They would just be removed. But if they decide they want to stop the study, but they're not withdrawing all of their data.

285
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:05,420
Depending on how your IRB is written and your study procedures are written,

286
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:08,990
you might be able to include some of their data, but they would then be lost to follow up.

287
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:13,940
Right. Okay.

288
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:19,970
So let's assume that this person is due to loss of follow up so that we don't have to completely pull out their data.

289
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:27,610
So when we have missing this, we have more censoring.

290
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:37,660
And so within study management subjects, I would be considered lost to follow up at time three because we have data for them at time two,

291
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:44,320
but we lose them at time three because again, this is like the blue lines are the real,

292
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:48,760
you know, the real like if we were able to know everything about the world, right?

293
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:55,120
They participate in time, too. But between time of two and three, there decide if this is no longer for me.

294
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,590
I'm getting too busy. I don't like it.

295
00:34:56,590 --> 00:35:01,570
Whatever, whatever the reason is or they move or and they don't send information, whatever it is, we just lose them.

296
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:07,810
Okay. So we have info for them at times zero one and two, but not at time three.

297
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:15,700
So statistically, subject five contribute time from time zero to time two.

298
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:21,820
Then we don't know what happens to them. So we can we can't assume that they didn't have the event.

299
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:25,990
We can't just be like, Oh, well, they're probably fine. They never have the event. Instead,

300
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:35,200
we can just attribute the two time units that they did contribute without the event while leaving the other two time units as a kind of as an unknown.

301
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:42,220
But we can say like, you know, we know that person two like up through time two they didn't have the event and they can contribute that time.

302
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:47,200
So we can keep them in the study for those, those time period that we have.

303
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:53,049
While like not indicating that whether or not they had event because we don't know but we know

304
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:57,340
that at least four at time one in time to time zero one and two they did not have the event.

305
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:02,350
Does that make sense? Even if we don't know about event by time for they did or didn't?

306
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:12,399
So that feels great because you know after the second you complete.

307
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:17,049
Yeah that's perfect. I was to ask you guys. Yes that's right country great job.

308
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:22,190
Yeah. But you just don't really have you know, it's like okay if I question right.

309
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:31,440
Yeah, that's right. So I'm sorry. Awesome. All right.

310
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:40,490
Dodgy. Still a reality. Okay, so here's another example of, you know,

311
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:50,660
this grid that we're using and another example of kind of like our is what is it called in your all knowing, omnipresent ambition.

312
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:51,630
Yeah. Okay.

313
00:36:52,110 --> 00:37:00,900
So this is like if we are mission versus what we're actually observing within our study so we can see that the, the blue that's filled in is an event.

314
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:04,370
The blue that's not filled in is an unobserved event.

315
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:08,460
Again, like we don't know it happened for whatever reason an X is censoring.

316
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:16,500
So you can see at the start of study we have four subjects. How many of these subjects do we lose to follow up before the end of the study?

317
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:26,570
One. Great. How many events are observed within the study?

318
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:31,850
Two to bottom. How many events are unobserved during the time of the study?

319
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:39,050
One. And then how many of events are unobserved outside the study?

320
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:46,160
One. Awesome. Great. And the censoring would be.

321
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:56,430
Which side? Right or left? Sensory. Right. Do you think that left censoring might have been applied here based on what we're seeing?

322
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,800
Yes. Okay.

323
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:07,210
Okay. Now we're going into the Kaplan-meier curve and the controversial hazards models.

324
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:14,590
So I'm going to go really briefly over this. And then because I know you guys, there's no testing on this, okay?

325
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:17,920
Yeah. Okay. You're like, hey, no way.

326
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:22,840
So I'm not going to go over like this, like the super in-depth, our code or the like, math behind it.

327
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:26,170
You guys have a lot going on, so I just want to show you some examples.

328
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:34,540
But yeah, so like we're going to come back to we talked earlier in the semester about a study that Justin and I both worked on,

329
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:44,120
looking at electronic forms of dating violence. So we did a number of studies using this data as a reminder.

330
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:47,200
We it was a cohort study, so we followed two cohorts.

331
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:49,810
The first cohort was starting in sixth grade.

332
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:55,660
The second cohort was starting in ninth grade and we followed them for four years and collected data annually.

333
00:38:55,840 --> 00:39:08,750
So we had potentially four periods of time that we could have for an event to occur in this kaplan-meier survival curve.

334
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:13,149
This, as you're seeing it with the two cohorts. So we have cohort one and cohort two.

335
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:16,870
Cohort one is the younger cohort. Cohort two is the older cohort.

336
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:23,530
And as we know, based on their previous lecture, but also not expecting you guys to remember that because it was a while ago,

337
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:29,830
but generally what we saw was that the risk of electronic dating violence increases throughout

338
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:35,830
adolescence as they get older with kind of a p almost like a peaking point at around age 16.

339
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,190
And we talked about some of the structural reasons why that might be.

340
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:48,610
And this is different from like from those curves, because, again, once someone's experienced a given outcome, we stop collecting time.

341
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:52,960
They've had the outcome. They they are young. We've I checked the box like, yep, they had it.

342
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:54,850
We don't need to collect more time on them.

343
00:39:55,450 --> 00:40:03,309
So we don't see a curving fashion of like, oh, well at time three which would be the fourth year this the way that our, the way I did our graphs.

344
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:09,460
So we're sorry. But time three is actually time for they are the fourth year of data collection.

345
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:16,900
So at that time, you know, it might be that fewer people are experience are reporting it within that year,

346
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:21,489
but because they've reported it in a prior year, we've already indicated them as having experienced it.

347
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:25,870
So they would be still the survival probability would be lower as a result.

348
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:31,390
Okay. So again, once an event occurs, it doesn't matter if it keeps occurring or not.

349
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:36,130
It's already happened. The survival, they're no longer cohort surviving in our analysis.

350
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:46,390
Okay. And as you can see, like a lot of youth, you know, this is specifically for sexual coercion.

351
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:52,210
This is not for all of the types of dating violence. This is a really it's also called coercive sexting,

352
00:40:52,480 --> 00:41:01,090
but it's the idea of like trying to manipulate someone in order to get them to message or send pictures or videos that are explicit in nature.

353
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:07,989
And we know that this form of coercive sexting is has a lot of negative implications for youth in terms of their mental health,

354
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:13,060
their delinquency, things like that. So this is a really important problem that we're trying to understand a little bit more about.

355
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:34,219
Questions about this. And then we have a COX Proportional hazards models so consequential hazards.

356
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:38,380
Whereas. So whereas KAPLAN-MEIER is just going to give you descriptive statistics about, you know,

357
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:45,470
what proportion of your population experiences an event at a given time and you can look at it by a categorical variable like cohort.

358
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:52,250
The COX Proportional Hazards help us understand the predictors of the timing of events.

359
00:41:52,790 --> 00:42:02,059
So if, for example, we see here that ACES, which are adverse childhood experiences at our first wave of data collection,

360
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:09,470
which would be times zero, the greater a report of those is predictive of less time.

361
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:14,180
So the timing of event is closer to wave one, which is time zero.

362
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:22,520
And again, I'm sorry that the the graph or the graph in the last slide doesn't match up in terms of the timing in that way.

363
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:28,760
We can also see. Mm hmm. Yes.

364
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:40,170
Oh, sorry. So in this model, we'd also included physical forms of violence and terms of perpetration.

365
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,380
So if students reported perpetrating violence against the teacher,

366
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:49,110
that was highly predictive of seeing a report of perpetrating or experiencing sexual coercion.

367
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:53,220
And same with school or school. Me perpetrating violence against the school.

368
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:58,510
Me. Questions about this.

369
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:13,420
Okay. So I put in my slides and resources in case anyone does want to dive into the code.

370
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,959
You're welcome to I'm not going to go over this closely,

371
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:21,420
but if you want some examples of code and like how to produce these things, that resource would be helpful.

372
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:32,400
And then I'll turn it over to you all to get to apply what we've learned. Would you go back to Spencer just like that for when?

373
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,200
The code. Oh, my. Sorry.

374
00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:52,450
So even I mean, even if you haven't seen this package before, are you recognizing that some of the pieces that were probably to right.

375
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:55,680
You probably can infer we have some variables.

376
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:57,990
We have a data set it's going to need. Right.

377
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:05,250
You can start at least she's together and the arguments and the functions that you're going to need if we do have time.

378
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:12,620
And would it be possible just to even briefly talk through what are some of the specific variables that you need in the destruction dataset then?

379
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,310
Yeah, and that's what we're going to have the class work on that. But I'm sorry.

380
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:22,140
That's right. Yeah, sorry. You know, this is a good question. Do you want me can we go back to the code once we have a because I don't know.

381
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:25,140
I mean you're you're the professor. I'm the poser.

382
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:32,250
Okay, so I'm going to have you guys work together or you can do a solo or in small groups sometimes.

383
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:37,220
I was like horrified of professors, but I always think you work in small groups so it's whatever your preferences I'm

384
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:41,969
unless you guys to identify research question that's interesting to you so again think

385
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:45,870
about the types of events you'd be interested in learning more about and what you do

386
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:50,219
to design the data collection and sketch out an example access with observations,

387
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:52,650
events and note right and left censorship.

388
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:57,210
And then we're going to present up to the rest of class and we'll talk, then loop back and talk about the code.

389
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:03,180
And there's a Google doc I have emailed to you, but I don't think it got sent out to the class yet.

390
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:09,240
Is there a way to email that name might be. I'll let you I'll let you go for that.

391
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:14,400
And I have some Google slides that you guys can if you guys want an example.

392
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:18,089
Otherwise you can use the board if someone wanted to.

393
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:22,220
They want to use this for the pen or a piece of paper or anything.

394
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:31,400
Piece of paper. Sorry, but. And we'll take like maybe like 25 minutes to ask you questions right now.

395
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:36,870
Just until 950.

396
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:44,220
Okay. So we'll take like 10 to 12 minutes. In fairness, is this class ever ended in 1950?

397
00:45:44,220 --> 00:46:21,930
But. It's awesome.

398
00:46:23,390 --> 00:46:33,820
So you guys out with this online? You're welcome to use it or create your own however you want to grab one of the slides and go after it.

399
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:40,200
I don't know. Sorry.

400
00:46:40,850 --> 00:46:44,020
No, you're good. That was great. Well, I got a chance to talk to the coach.

401
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:51,980
Something that you put on your mind about, you only slides up.

402
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:58,460
Yeah, absolutely. Which slide would be helpful if you were talking about what you're doing?

403
00:46:58,970 --> 00:47:16,730
Oh, yeah. Oh, sorry. One more thing got carried around for Caroline, and if you have questions, feel free to flag me or slide Justin.

404
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:23,300
I mean, home. Feel free to flag me.

405
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:29,630
Yeah, I enjoy it, sir. You're all still in the semester. It must feel so good.

406
00:47:30,290 --> 00:47:48,050
You know, I think, like I used to do this last year, both in front of me and get more descriptive,

407
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:52,790
since that does are very different than I think in practice.

408
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:56,430
Yeah. And then we can see something. Stuff.

409
00:47:56,990 --> 00:48:03,020
Yeah. I felt like a lot of people end up taking Andy, Greg and Kayla's classes because he does like dated as an art and then a couple others.

410
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:05,150
And it'd be cool to have more of that in the school public health.

411
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:10,729
But it's weird because I know like 20 students already have a lot on their plates as like every other student.

412
00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:18,260
But pulling presents from other departments from school public health into our classes seems to be tricky in most years.

413
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:24,320
And I think the big one is now you're out next semester next year.

414
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,950
Yeah. So be careful.

415
00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:31,240
But yeah, I mean like how many different courses we can potentially politically.

416
00:48:31,350 --> 00:48:35,240
Yeah. Okay. I mean, I think I'll be good using this, right?

417
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:41,230
Yeah. I think the idea of healthy, not expensive. I was going to say,

418
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:51,950
but I'm I'm actually not talking about whether or not there's a space for other supplements or and parallel course that is more out there.

419
00:48:51,950 --> 00:48:58,189
Focus. Sure. Yeah. I would love to teach like an LP course and I don't know where I would like because like I know

420
00:48:58,190 --> 00:49:02,470
that we have like I don't feel like at my level and I feel like the computer science level,

421
00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:06,709
but just thinking through like because a lot of students from engineering and stuff reach out there like,

422
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:11,360
I wanna learn more about this, but I don't know where they're I don't know, I don't know where to take it.

423
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:15,139
So I don't know which department to go to be like, Hey, so this is an important course.

424
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:25,430
We should do it like this is. So there's, there's like one, but they have an entire I think they, I don't know if this one specific MLP,

425
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:30,440
but they definitely have different courses that engage with like all different algorithmic stuff.

426
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:35,810
I'm less excited about like delving into the algorithms because like that math is so far above me.

427
00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:38,120
Like I'm never going to get there. That's not true.

428
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:43,930
I could try it, but I'm more excited about like applications and like like taking kind of the data.

429
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:53,720
Like, how do we even sexualize so much of what the work I've seen coming out of this is like statistically correct, but it has very little.

430
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:54,290
Right.

431
00:49:54,470 --> 00:50:02,690
Like, it's very hard to make make applied decisions based on it because there isn't a theoretical framing or like really applicability that's really,

432
00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:06,799
really thought through. So a paper that really came out that was really cool to see.

433
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,940
But like I was kind of like left wondering.

434
00:50:09,290 --> 00:50:14,629
Someone was looking at narratives on Reddit about birthing stories, particularly birthing stories that were tricky.

435
00:50:14,630 --> 00:50:18,860
And, and I try to figure out what those stories like and they rather computationally do it,

436
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:25,610
but they're like kind of like net takeaways were not super helpful in terms of like, okay, well, what can we change?

437
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:30,379
So then I think it's worth pursuing.

438
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:37,520
I think even it surprised me how students can take this, you know, complex material.

439
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:40,640
And that's something that you don't need to have in front of me.

440
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:45,719
I'm not as well. Yeah, I would imagine the same thing.

441
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:53,670
You might not be super advanced, but in a position one to do something you have to learn a little bit more about it if you're really engaged, right?

442
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:56,720
Yeah. It's kind of like an oxymoron. Dangerous, right?

443
00:50:57,050 --> 00:51:01,940
Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. Well, see, it's called other like HB she's thinking through.

444
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:05,660
Is the entire school rethinking school? Is that a big deal?

445
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:09,200
And then she goes, I sure never lose it here. Oh, cool.

446
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,620
That's amazing. I only see ourselves, like, really well.

447
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:17,150
Or is it still too early? Like, I can remember CTC or else.

448
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:19,730
Yeah, you know, whoever's the keeper here, like. But yeah,

449
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:26,000
but they seem really well positioned to support an initiative like that given all the trainings and the kind of materials they have access to.

450
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:28,760
But professors plainly don't love it.

451
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:36,890
I mean, they're in retail cause they're designing and that's working out and just trying to figure out how to do things with it.

452
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:40,950
Mm hmm. Yeah. Cool.

453
00:51:41,350 --> 00:51:46,270
So you're teaching injury on this course. Do you teach other courses? Are you able to research?

454
00:51:47,110 --> 00:51:51,640
Okay, cool. Yeah, I saw that Libby is going to be teaching.

455
00:51:52,030 --> 00:51:59,040
Yeah. This.

456
00:52:04,310 --> 00:52:17,530
Maybe we should. But I want to be sure that you're going to have people to talk about it.

457
00:52:17,830 --> 00:52:22,450
Yeah. You and your. Yes, sir.

458
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:25,620
Are you one who recommended me for that? By the way, I.

459
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:33,090
I told the department that I was good to see you make it, but I was not doing is.

460
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:36,730
It is a big question but I mean.

461
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:43,000
ALL Yeah, super nice. We were able to work it out with my post-doc, so that was surprising.

462
00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:46,500
I didn't think, Oh, that's great. It's going to be interesting.

463
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:56,290
I'm excited, he said. I'm nervous, but that classes and it's been around for a long time, you can make it pretty easily.

464
00:52:56,530 --> 00:53:00,370
Yeah. So, you know. So yeah, I'm excited.

465
00:53:00,370 --> 00:53:05,990
Like it seems like it's a good course I'll still be project based of like students take that question going about the survey and everything

466
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:12,790
and you know those who really want it are interested can potentially even use it for like a thesis if they wanted to a plan on dissertation.

467
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:21,310
But I don't think I might have a pretty level students that wouldn't be afraid if they're in places like the public schools really like it.

468
00:53:21,970 --> 00:53:26,190
I think they're going through so much their expectations in substantive.

469
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:32,190
Yeah so I think those are very have actually you know like this in practice for hundreds of years.

470
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:37,230
Yeah absolutely. And I'm excited that [INAUDIBLE] be cool to.

471
00:53:37,510 --> 00:53:43,000
Yeah. So twice a week or 3 hours, one day, 3 hours, one day for the long chunk.

472
00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:53,760
Which day. I think Mondays are going to be office on Mondays I will come back here with Johnson coming back to public.

473
00:53:53,800 --> 00:54:01,060
I it is it. Yes. I think that this puts actually really good in that like it's going to be a lot of exposure to other things.

474
00:54:01,270 --> 00:54:05,330
And I think it's also made me a lot clearer about like where I stand in the world with you right now.

475
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:10,160
Yeah, I'm right back to you.

476
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:20,080
Didn't get that. So hey, by the way, not to pressure you, but what if I'm just gaslighting people.

477
00:54:20,770 --> 00:54:25,299
Yes, I saw your is like I apologize.

478
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:34,750
I will look after my. Yes, I'm just trying to get it out just because you know what I'm thinking.

479
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:47,770
Yeah, I just yeah. I still think that if anything, you was, I don't know, did not mention inside.

480
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:55,510
And it makes the agents or the peers yesterday just because my Twitter and I've got like really focus on my time, which is kind of a bummer.

481
00:54:55,750 --> 00:55:03,399
It was in the second housing project because I felt but didn't make mention to you that we're working on an analysis using my data.

482
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:07,980
She's going to leave. I, I'm, I'm doing analysis. She's going to leave the last week.

483
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:14,290
That's great. Yeah. So she's going to try it for the Depression Iceberg Depression conference.

484
00:55:14,290 --> 00:55:18,630
Yeah. We're going to send an abstract to that because she was right.

485
00:55:18,990 --> 00:55:22,059
Yeah. So an easier conference to get to and present out.

486
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:26,680
I think we also do like a day and a half free workshop for us.

487
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:33,370
Workshop as well. I figure I was teaching my agent. I thought it was just it's college student depression in general.

488
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:37,060
Right. Okay. Yeah, right.

489
00:55:37,090 --> 00:55:37,480
Okay.

490
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:45,070
So is there an opportunity to create like a workshop on HMS specifically to try to get the word out there and get more people working with the data?

491
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:55,300
Yes. And Sarah, what Americans, Sarah, are planning to say, I mean,

492
00:55:55,330 --> 00:56:04,260
maybe even though in this case for liberty and savior of USA versus everybody, just say, hey, Sarah, everything.

493
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:09,370
I'm sorry for Saber, for listening to the Depression, see if there's going to be an LP stuff on Reddit.

494
00:56:09,370 --> 00:56:14,450
So I don't think that's as relevant or what they were to we.

495
00:56:14,470 --> 00:56:26,470
Oh, we never did. Yeah, but we never run of the things like that it'd be just tell Sarah and everybody are still here so it's cool.

496
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:30,430
Yeah, I think it's worth it. We can't I think is our I know that Midas is also doing that.

497
00:56:30,910 --> 00:56:38,940
Oh yeah. It's 93 thing space. All right. Like maybe like a 1 to 2 more minutes and then we'll present out those.

498
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:46,120
Someone's right here, right now. Make room to present to help us.

499
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:53,830
I think we're in a flip over, ready as they are ready to let us know what the issues are for their careers.

500
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:59,140
They want to I don't know if it's just an updated or what.

501
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:06,489
So it was only so we were doing it. It's like, oh, I'm sorry, I wish of a bummer now.

502
00:57:06,490 --> 00:57:09,650
Kind of. Yeah, I don't know. I thought I said this is right.

503
00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:17,510
Because it's drive like it always does. And so we were drawing our eyes and we had a great I'm glad you guys took initiative and figured it out.

504
00:57:18,110 --> 00:57:22,459
Oh three. Okay, I'll give you three more minutes. That remarkable.

505
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:25,580
Come in. Here he is.

506
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:30,370
The Ambassador theory. I did.

507
00:57:30,470 --> 00:57:40,250
I did a lot of targeted ads for it, too.

508
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:45,979
Yeah, if you guys want to. If you created it in a Google and you wanted to put in here, it should not be at all.

509
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:53,600
But also totally fine. It's just depending on how you want to share it to yours or you going to share it directly with me if you want also.

510
00:57:53,600 --> 00:58:00,579
And I can put it up. Yeah.

511
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:07,210
I think I guess I could be the place that to go for like each of us if we really wanted to.

512
00:58:08,710 --> 00:58:14,530
Because they do. But what's the aging and retirement say that RCAF is like?

513
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:21,610
Yeah, I think they have a there's definitely a step like a short course on that he wasn't coming out and about that and I think someone has one.

514
00:58:22,990 --> 00:58:27,380
So. It's a nice way to like get laid out. But also instructors, I believe, do get paid.

515
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:32,710
So like if people need to fill in but they have sentiments that are open, that could be an option.

516
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:39,670
Yeah. So yeah. So just to, to up Sarah and Sarah know I'm sure she would be.

517
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:44,590
Is it Sarah's Estelle? Well, no. Oh, okay.

518
00:58:47,050 --> 00:58:57,890
So you might've acted differently if you.

519
00:58:58,210 --> 00:59:05,970
It was the best line here.

520
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:09,880
I'll hide it for now. No, no pressure.

521
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:18,440
No. Okay. I would be horrified also to be live trying to put together a weight zero.

522
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:24,520
Oh, man. So Sarah will be coming then for the Depression.

523
00:59:24,910 --> 00:59:31,299
From Boston? Yeah, it's a because it bookends.

524
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:34,540
The Depression happens. There's usually pretty good attendance. Awesome.

525
00:59:35,470 --> 00:59:40,299
That's great. I mean, we make an effort to train students or trainees.

526
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:44,120
So there are other people that, you know, I think they might be able to identify.

527
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:51,370
And I don't know, I know all of my even doing for one a day.

528
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:56,740
No, no. You know, I did have someone tell me recently of too many first author pubs.

529
00:59:57,260 --> 01:00:01,149
It's not. It's not. Yes, I know.

530
01:00:01,150 --> 01:00:06,219
It's on, you know, who's like pretty senior. But they were like, you're going to burn out, you have to buy more flowers.

531
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:14,410
And I'm like, No, no, that's true. Yeah. I was like, I don't know how to do that, but I just like, I don't know how to do that.

532
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:18,380
How do I like? I don't know. I don't have a good collaborator know.

533
01:00:19,810 --> 01:00:22,690
I just think that I get I get like lost in all the things I'm doing.

534
01:00:22,690 --> 01:00:31,460
And so, like, if it's not like, I don't know, like, I don't know, I think, you know, running or not.

535
01:00:32,230 --> 01:00:36,910
Right. Yeah. Already season results which I'm happy.

536
01:00:36,910 --> 01:00:44,049
I'm always happy. Right. Methods and results go for everything from your work so fast.

537
01:00:44,050 --> 01:00:49,240
But I used to work for know next year and I feel like I've slowed down substantially

538
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:54,879
and like it's hard to get into that and learning all the new methods.

539
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:59,140
It's just been brutal. Like absolutely brutal. I wouldn't recommend people do it this way.

540
01:00:59,140 --> 01:01:03,330
Oh, they went on to ask my opinion about it, which is.

541
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:08,860
Oh yeah, that's fine with that.

542
01:01:08,870 --> 01:01:12,230
Very long. There anything?

543
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:17,850
A lot. Yeah.

544
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:21,560
I to know that.

545
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:36,280
Someone needs to give you a fresh draft.

546
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:41,320
Maybe another minute. And then I'm going.

547
01:01:47,130 --> 01:01:54,150
No. And one in.

548
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:09,150
I think you did everything right. So, you know, the ask is like if there's an offer, do training on H&R BLOCK.

549
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:16,320
So I understand understand that there's a workshop around the Depression conference.

550
01:02:16,740 --> 01:02:28,180
I was talking to the other they the show having conversations and how they're going to do it with everything else.

551
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:35,040
I mean, yeah, I mean, I haven't seen the I haven't seen their agenda yet.

552
01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:44,430
I'm not sure. But, you know, I think you get to this being your mentee just in that goal line and this being your mentee.

553
01:02:44,430 --> 01:02:49,200
And I think it's one that I don't know.

554
01:02:49,780 --> 01:02:55,680
But again. And another one as nice as.

555
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:09,390
Oh. And you just say, all righty.

556
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:16,140
Right. In an effort to not go too much over 950, maybe we can start presenting out.

557
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:21,340
And does the first rule want to go first? Sure. Justin said you really did.

558
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:27,480
So is it one of these ones or slide five?

559
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:31,830
Boom, that one you knew. All righty.

560
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:34,770
Pitch us your idea. Tell us what you guys are going to do.

561
01:03:35,790 --> 01:03:45,360
We're going to look at states that adopted a policy to allow undocumented immigrants their driver's license.

562
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:52,660
And so we have Texas up there.

563
01:03:52,710 --> 01:03:57,930
We're pretending like they're never going to happen again.

564
01:03:58,740 --> 01:04:03,170
We're hoping will be voting on things on this exact or saying that they adopted it later.

565
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:06,210
And we're in California, adopted it way back when.

566
01:04:07,050 --> 01:04:11,400
Okay, cool. So talk to me about your time. What are the what is it like?

567
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:17,610
Is it times? What is time? Zero one, two, three. Is it years that it's legislative sessions?

568
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:21,420
Okay, cool. So, like, roughly every two years.

569
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:26,970
Okay, cool. And then are you going to left censor or are you not censoring?

570
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:30,660
We are going to the left of center. So California's going to drop out?

571
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:34,160
Yes. Because they have already adopted. Okay, cool.

572
01:04:35,010 --> 01:04:39,830
Which. Okay, cool. I like it. And then do you have any censoring?

573
01:04:40,170 --> 01:04:46,260
I mean, even looks less than ten, but you have, right? Censoring as well that we could with Texas.

574
01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:53,780
It's within our time measurement that has not been adopted in our hypothetical world that we could potentially very concerned about.

575
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:57,440
But we don't want to do this about 5050. Well, yes.

576
01:04:57,510 --> 01:05:02,220
Don't have it because I know that's. Yeah.

577
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:06,610
Sample size would be great and not do but you know you might build around a model.

578
01:05:06,660 --> 01:05:09,880
It wouldn't be very accurate. All right. Awesome. Thanks.

579
01:05:10,660 --> 01:05:15,540
All right. Next group. What slide? You want to find one group?

580
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:20,860
Oh, there you go. Nice. Thank you for bringing that.

581
01:05:24,030 --> 01:05:30,090
Okay. So we want to look at timing of first contraceptive use.

582
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:35,820
Okay. So we're looking like a fleet of mercury ages 10 to 20.

583
01:05:35,820 --> 01:05:42,240
So around like teenage years. Well, a little bit beyond that, too.

584
01:05:42,780 --> 01:05:48,480
And we will recruit people in doctor's offices and but some surveys quarterly.

585
01:05:50,310 --> 01:06:00,630
Okay. Because we thought like once a year might be too little and we might lose money that way rather than like sending electronic surveys.

586
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:06,450
Water at the tennis court is in.

587
01:06:09,660 --> 01:06:11,570
We use left and right censoring.

588
01:06:11,580 --> 01:06:19,970
So we don't want to include people that are thinking contraception and we want included in that is going to have to be here.

589
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:26,040
That happened after the city. Cool. Okay. So tell me a little bit more about your event and how you're defining it.

590
01:06:28,620 --> 01:06:33,270
I would say that event is starting some sort of contraception.

591
01:06:34,050 --> 01:06:40,470
Could it be any contraception? And what about like mechanistic slash, behavioral, like pulling out?

592
01:06:40,620 --> 01:06:46,079
Is that a form of albeit a not incredibly efficient form?

593
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:55,880
Say, like, here's what I was thinking is probably any sort of like, oh, or like medical, but like I feel like condoms would count to your opinion.

594
01:06:56,290 --> 01:06:59,550
Okay, so like implant IUD. Yeah.

595
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:04,880
Because otherwise you're really focusing on.

596
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:12,620
I think it might be important to include in that.

597
01:07:13,190 --> 01:07:20,150
Okay. But more so than using them is more clear that.

598
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:26,230
Things like birth control. So that's an interesting aspect of it.

599
01:07:30,270 --> 01:07:34,440
I like it. Okay, cool.

600
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:40,940
I will go to the next group and I'll maybe have a little more chat about this thing.

601
01:07:40,950 --> 01:07:45,480
Okay. But I would just, like, urge you for all presentation three.

602
01:07:47,580 --> 01:07:53,610
Oh, cool. Love this. You have cool technology.

603
01:07:55,900 --> 01:08:07,270
Time to work around. Yeah. So we were thinking about having just like looking and I guess our outcome is death.

604
01:08:07,270 --> 01:08:12,760
But in this case, we have to understand there's two things that are important for your children.

605
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:18,659
So sometimes you have like surgery to try to combination with surgery.

606
01:08:18,660 --> 01:08:24,840
Question The next level, looking to see the outcome of an incident or face survive.

607
01:08:25,710 --> 01:08:31,260
And so if you remember a time and you didn't specify years and or different subjects.

608
01:08:31,670 --> 01:08:48,400
We see the people die. Every time we are here since six P like I guess that's where markers of understanding between persons are I guess.

609
01:08:48,410 --> 01:09:01,760
But okay. So there's one that treated looks to me like maybe two chunks of time before they are either lost, followed or whatever happens.

610
01:09:02,420 --> 01:09:05,820
So they are two years of survival. Awesome.

611
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:12,640
Cool. So I, like you guys, included the subgroups as well.

612
01:09:13,150 --> 01:09:19,720
And thinking about a couple of the other studies proposed today for the reproductive group.

613
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:28,090
You could look at survival by type of reproductive technology, be it condoms.

614
01:09:28,090 --> 01:09:29,350
You know, you do things like that.

615
01:09:29,590 --> 01:09:35,890
And looking at the differences in timing of survival, for example, and survival, of course, being the timing to use.

616
01:09:37,270 --> 01:09:45,910
And then for the first group you guys could think about, either political, there's some kind of more of a structural I'm getting.

617
01:09:45,940 --> 01:09:49,569
I guess the question being this looks like you're looking at structural potential

618
01:09:49,570 --> 01:09:53,260
pieces of as most structural variables that could play into that in terms of,

619
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:57,790
you know, who minority versus majority of a given state.

620
01:09:58,690 --> 01:10:02,139
What's tricky about the some of the survival analysis and just maybe you can turn on this,

621
01:10:02,140 --> 01:10:06,730
I don't think it's possible to have time varying variables as covariates.

622
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:16,930
I think every time invariant for the for the Cox proportional hazards models or for the categorical there's no crossing over.

623
01:10:16,930 --> 01:10:25,930
I don't believe of those. I can't give an example, but I also I'm not sure why you necessarily couldn't.

624
01:10:27,190 --> 01:10:30,570
I will actually look that up because I don't want to be I don't know either.

625
01:10:30,580 --> 01:10:34,920
I've never seen anything like that. And I like the maths.

626
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:40,270
You have me think that in my head right now. So yeah, that would be, I think some things to think about.

627
01:10:40,690 --> 01:10:46,210
The other thing I wanted to throw out there is the number of time points selected.

628
01:10:46,810 --> 01:10:49,950
Then the more time what you have, the more mRNAs potentially you have.

629
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:55,930
And so one thing that's tricky is if, for example, if you had something like 20 time points,

630
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:59,350
you're going to have a good amount of mRNAs probably at different time points.

631
01:10:59,350 --> 01:11:06,010
And so the question is if someone if you miss if someone misses a given time point but then is available for the next time point,

632
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:12,760
are you going to retrospectively try to collect data from the prior time point to understand or are you going to say, well,

633
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:19,870
even though we capture them again at time six, if they have had the event since their last report at time four,

634
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:26,530
are we going to right send to them at time for being like, well, we know that they didn't have the event then, but they since then had the event.

635
01:11:26,530 --> 01:11:31,090
So we're not we're not able to capture that exactly as to when that happened versus the time five versus time six.

636
01:11:32,590 --> 01:11:37,930
If you at time six found that they did not have the event, you would then be able to be like,

637
01:11:37,930 --> 01:11:41,230
well, they still haven't had the event, so we can extrapolate the data back.

638
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:43,450
The only thing is that's going to bias the results a little bit,

639
01:11:43,450 --> 01:11:49,350
because that means that you're systematically not including events that happened versus those that did.

640
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:56,290
So those are things to think about. Even that's technically not completely incorrect in that like the time to event is still accurate.

641
01:11:57,310 --> 01:11:58,870
You know, that's just something to think about,

642
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:07,360
especially if there is like confounding reasons to why individuals who would have an event might miss a data collection point.

643
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:10,630
But if it's missing at random and less of a problem. Yes.

644
01:12:10,930 --> 01:12:14,040
Are you ready for the example? Is there a rule of thumb?

645
01:12:14,050 --> 01:12:19,710
I don't know if there is about how many observations you need to have the company statement, I don't know one, but I.

646
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:25,620
Yeah, that's a good question. So you can try look up like a time series as a 2025 observations like regulation,

647
01:12:25,660 --> 01:12:32,229
weather or per variable or just total this total like more than 25, whatever, like obs.

648
01:12:32,230 --> 01:12:35,680
Yeah. I think it's going to be there's going to be some ratio between the number of observations,

649
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:40,150
the number of time points, but I don't know what the ratio is. And I can I can try to look up and find it.

650
01:12:40,510 --> 01:12:45,300
That's a great question, though. Okay.

651
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:49,290
And quickly getting back to I know we're almost at time, but quickly getting back to that.

652
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:53,310
Oops. Where's the code? The code. Okay. So you guys have kind of talked about this.

653
01:12:53,550 --> 01:12:55,770
You're going to need to have some calculation of time.

654
01:12:56,010 --> 01:13:00,420
This is a headache to calculate sometimes because you are thinking about your inclusion versus exclusion criteria of like,

655
01:13:00,690 --> 01:13:03,329
well, there are missing at this data point, but they were available at this data point.

656
01:13:03,330 --> 01:13:06,550
So what do we interpolate in terms of like, oh, well, maybe they didn't, you know,

657
01:13:06,570 --> 01:13:11,350
they did whatever it is that something else to think about relative to study design.

658
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:15,240
Like what if someone does miss? Do you want to retrospectively try to collect?

659
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:20,220
At what point do they have that exposure? That may be very important for the efficacy of your study.

660
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:24,210
You also so we can see like, oh man.

661
01:13:24,510 --> 01:13:27,710
So the time equals share at a time. That's the time variable.

662
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:30,510
And that is the again, it's going to be a quant.

663
01:13:30,540 --> 01:13:36,480
You're going to quantify that number from a range of zero to whatever the number of time points you have.

664
01:13:36,510 --> 01:13:42,360
This is, again, clinical time, not the type of time on your clock, for example.

665
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:49,799
Right. And that's when you calculate. We didn't get really into the calculations, but it's you can think about like in our examples,

666
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:52,620
we've seen how many who contribute, what amount of time.

667
01:13:53,070 --> 01:13:59,780
You just can't calculate that per person, per observation state, whatever it is, you have the event status.

668
01:13:59,790 --> 01:14:03,790
So that's how this is going to be a binary size, a zero and or a one.

669
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:09,120
That time is going to reflect the amount of time that someone did not have a reported event,

670
01:14:10,050 --> 01:14:13,920
whereas the status is going to be whether or not they had a reported event or not.

671
01:14:14,310 --> 01:14:16,720
So remember how he said if someone goes, you know,

672
01:14:16,770 --> 01:14:23,160
is lost to follow up but they have to time chunks we'd have the time equals to and the event would be an unknown

673
01:14:24,420 --> 01:14:29,250
or say yeah the event would be the event would be no because you have to time points without the event.

674
01:14:32,180 --> 01:14:36,060
I added a cohort variable in here to have the two different that's a categorical

675
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:40,460
variable has two levels of the younger cohort versus the older cohort.

676
01:14:40,470 --> 01:14:44,910
You could again do more than that. It's going to impact the number of observations you're going to need.

677
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:48,150
I don't know the ratio I've taught my head. I can get that back to you guys about that.

678
01:14:49,050 --> 01:14:54,750
And then the data is the dataset there. So the time is a created variable.

679
01:14:55,530 --> 01:14:59,370
It's something, you know, you have to sit through and kind of think through like, okay,

680
01:14:59,370 --> 01:15:06,300
well I'm going to calculate the number of waves the person has data for and then going to look at what way do they first have an event,

681
01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:12,540
especially if it's not a non death event or an event that would preclude someone from contributing more data in the future.

682
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:16,799
And then you're gonna have to think through some of those inclusion versus exclusion of like,

683
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:20,700
okay, well if they missed one data point, but we have another one, what do we do about that?

684
01:15:21,090 --> 01:15:24,960
And those are study procedure questions as well as prior to collecting the data,

685
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:32,310
having clear intentions of like how to handle missing data and then making sure that those replicate into the analysis.

686
01:15:34,710 --> 01:15:38,100
And then of was everyone. All right.

687
01:15:38,850 --> 01:15:42,960
So if you do not. All right.

688
01:15:42,990 --> 01:15:47,090
Thanks, guys. Fairness questions. Feel free to chat.

689
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:52,319
And then Justin will be very nicely sending out a survey to you all to give me feedback on teaching,

690
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:57,410
as I am very much an instructor and feedback is really helpful to understand what's useful,

691
01:15:57,420 --> 01:16:03,239
what's like less useful and is like, you know, negative and constructive feedback is both very, very helpful.

692
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:07,590
So we'll be setting that out if you guys don't mind filling it out to help me prepare for next semester.

693
01:16:07,740 --> 01:16:12,719
So I'll be teaching up a lot of things. All right, everyone, I will see you on Thursday.

694
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:21,600
If you could do me a favor and spend just like 15 minutes, scan through the lecture on the overview, lecture on structure equation.

695
01:16:21,810 --> 01:16:25,680
And it's just to get the lingo, just get the jargon so that we can talk about it.

696
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:30,300
But you already know 65% of what you need to know about structure, equation models.

697
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:34,360
I can teach you the right of the other 35% on Thursday, but thank you all.

698
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:38,730
Take more time to read the great day.
