1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:11,770
With Bill O'Reilly. Hey.

2
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:15,510
Good morning, everybody. I'm ready.

3
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:20,100
Yeah. Hi.

4
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:29,360
How is everybody? A little bit lighter crowd today, about two weeks away from our fall parade.

5
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:38,930
Great. But that always comes at a much needed time. I'm hopeful that I should have the exams released today.

6
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:48,110
I'm thinking you guys did. I mean, every year it's pretty similar, especially even when we used to take it in-person versus had you started it online.

7
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:52,460
The average has always been very much the same year to year.

8
00:00:52,470 --> 00:01:01,190
You guys are about almost a full percentage and a half or even more than that over the average of previous years.

9
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,470
Really, really good. So that's great.

10
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:10,100
I was very happy to see that. I just want to draw your attention.

11
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:18,799
This wasn't intentionally hidden, but I hope you guys have noticed that I do have a little link here for office hours.

12
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,910
If you do need them, I'd like to do a sign up just in case that gets.

13
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,730
I don't know. I want you to have your own dedicated time.

14
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:34,640
So if you click on on the homepage, it'll take you to just a Google sheet and you can sign up here.

15
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,340
If I usually check it the day, I'll have it open.

16
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:50,220
But if you sign up at like 330, just maybe shipping email sometimes, you know, I was like the next day I'll send somebody signed up and I didn't.

17
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:57,930
I don't automatically log on unless I see somebody is signed up. So usually if it's like the day before or that morning, I'll see it.

18
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,259
But if it's later in the afternoon, just. Just let me know.

19
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:05,560
So I don't miss our meeting. Okay.

20
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:17,719
So today. We're going to continue on this incipient process and talk about writing interventions and

21
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,670
how we monitor those interventions that are kind of targeting or addressing our diagnosis.

22
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:35,870
So. This content today I'm less picky about, but I just want you guys to have like kind of an understanding of what we're trying to do here.

23
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:45,979
My main focus for this class in terms of MCP is the diagnosis to make sure that we get that in that correct format using that standardized language

24
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:53,600
and making sure that we're really trying to select the main issue that the biggest problem nutritionally speaking and then diagnosing that.

25
00:02:53,630 --> 00:03:00,680
So this part we will go into today and then we'll practice throughout the semester.

26
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:06,110
But, you know, it's a little bit it's not as clear in my opinion.

27
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:12,919
And then Thursday, I'm we're kind of getting into more of our disease specific sessions,

28
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,950
which I think most students tend to like once we get into this.

29
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:23,180
How I have it set up usually is you'll watch a few recorded lectures on the disease process,

30
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,960
sort of like of the pathophysiology of the conditions we're talking about,

31
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:33,330
and then we'll use that in class time to talk about the MMT approach to those different diseases.

32
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:42,680
Then I try to incorporate NCP. Like, Okay, if we're talking about a patient with dysphagia, what might a diagnosis look like?

33
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:49,730
What might our interventions be? And then how would we monitor them so that we can kind of bring in that nutrition care process as well?

34
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:56,680
So any questions before we get started on the intervention part today?

35
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:05,729
Okay. Okay.

36
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:12,180
So you watched a little bit. Just a short video on this part of our assessment.

37
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:17,350
So this is part of our. Assessment and documentation.

38
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:21,220
This is really taking information from the assessment.

39
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:28,570
Point out the main problem diagnosing that and then how do we specifically address that problem that we diagnosed?

40
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:35,170
So I wish I had better. I wish they had better resources for us.

41
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:38,710
But it's these videos I do want to watch too.

42
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:46,940
I might kind of cut them off if it's a little repetitive, but this will go into a little bit about the the intervention.

43
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:52,880
So you're going to see different terms like nutrition, prescription and then nutrition intervention.

44
00:04:54,260 --> 00:05:01,310
They used to be the same thing interchangeably, but the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics has kind of changed this.

45
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:07,550
So I think this is where it gets a little confusing, and I'm not super picky about the prescription part.

46
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:14,629
We'll talk about it. I'm more looking for like what interventions you write, but we'll get into that.

47
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:20,330
So if it's a little bit confusing at first, I'm confused as well with this process.

48
00:05:20,630 --> 00:14:17,630
I don't love NCB. Their PR statements in this example, both of them were not great.

49
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:27,270
But it's just I'm just trying to get some background on how we link our interventions to, to the diagnosis statement.

50
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:31,360
So what else is before we get started, make sure you open up.

51
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:38,150
These terminology sheets posted on today's session.

52
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:47,059
So we'll start with having the nutrition intervention term sheet open looks kind of similar to our diagnosis term sheet,

53
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:50,330
but it has its own terminology here. So.

54
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:56,680
Have this available when we start kind of going over some examples.

55
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:01,270
And then we'll look at the monitoring and evaluation one a little bit later.

56
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:12,880
Okay. So in that video, they the nutrition prescription is the same as the nutrition intervention.

57
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:21,459
That hasn't changed that. Now we have like a sentence that is like our prescription and then we go into specific intervention.

58
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:27,550
So we'll do some examples to make that hopefully a little bit more clear.

59
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:36,680
But for our nutrition interventions, really the goal is to plan and implement these appropriate interventions that are tailored to the person's needs.

60
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:43,490
So it's going to be very individualized based on the main nutrition problems that you've identified and diagnosed from the assessment.

61
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:51,350
It's a purposely planned action or actions designed with the intent of changing a nutrition related be either behavior,

62
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:59,210
a risk factor, environmental condition or aspect of health status, including access to supportive care and services.

63
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,550
So sometimes we're just really recommending a referral to like an appropriate service.

64
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:11,290
Maybe they need to see social work to get enrolled in the meal assistance program.

65
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:13,630
Maybe that's our main intervention for our patient.

66
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:22,550
So nutrition intervention goals provide the basis for monitoring progress and measuring outcomes with good practice.

67
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:29,960
Also implementing some smart goals for our patients. So there's two components.

68
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:33,730
The planning portion and the intervention portion.

69
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:39,950
So the nutrition intervention is again typically directed at resolving the nutrition diagnosis.

70
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:46,100
Really, whenever possible, we target that etiology.

71
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:53,450
But sometimes we do have medical diagnoses as the ideology of our statement,

72
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,560
and we're not going to be able to resolve a medical diagnosis in most cases.

73
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:01,250
So sometimes then we direct intervention at that.

74
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:05,210
So signs and symptoms, which would be like the evidence in that statement.

75
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:15,280
Okay. So in terms of planning our interventions, we want to prioritize our diagnoses based on problem, severity,

76
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:22,060
safety, patient and client needs and the likelihood that the nutrition intervention will influence the problem.

77
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:26,440
We also want to take into consideration our patients perception of importance.

78
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:32,020
We may see a lot of things nutritionally that need to be addressed,

79
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:39,160
but we have to kind of take the whole picture into context and then also see what the patient's goals are for their care.

80
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:48,490
So usually I like to have one nutrition diagnosis, maybe two,

81
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:55,010
even if there's potential for like ten diagnoses, I would try to really select the main issue.

82
00:17:55,030 --> 00:18:04,480
So for the purposes of this class, unless I say right three diagnoses, I would try to limit your nutrition diagnoses to like two,

83
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:09,440
because I really want to see that you're selecting the most important problems.

84
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:14,110
A lot of our patients have a lot of problems and maybe a lot of nutritional problems,

85
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:20,410
but the whole key is to really prioritize the main issues that we can we can really impact.

86
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:30,170
So of course we're going to collaborate with the patient. Maybe they have caregivers, the interdisciplinary medical team,

87
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:35,210
other health care professionals to identify goals of the intervention for each diagnosis that we have.

88
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:44,720
And then we'll write the prescription based on the client's individual recommended dietary intake of energy needs or select foods.

89
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:52,100
Maybe it's nutrient specific, and that will be based on current reference standards, dietary guidelines and their overall health.

90
00:18:52,340 --> 00:19:00,230
Yeah. Would you say that you would prioritize treating something that is.

91
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:11,220
Like a thinker. This is not well thought out like that solves more problems or something that is more easily solved.

92
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:15,790
Does that make sense? Yes. So I would I would think more.

93
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:25,410
I would actually think smaller, like more acute. And what can we impact right now here in the short term?

94
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:36,330
So, again, this class, although we'll do examples of like outpatient situations, this class is predominantly focused on hospitalized patients.

95
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:44,920
So a patient that comes in, we want to what can we impact during that visit, which is not much sometimes.

96
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:53,050
That's why I don't like something like if we look at our diagnostic term sheet, there is a diagnosis for obesity.

97
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,590
We're not going to resolve obesity in a seven day hospital visit,

98
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:06,880
but maybe they have increased protein needs because they have a wound that they're trying to heal from,

99
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:15,159
that we can address and, you know, offer interventions to improve their wound healing through nutritional aspects.

100
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:25,750
So I would almost think smaller picture as opposed to like trying to solve a whole lot of nutritional issues that may take a long time.

101
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:39,290
Okay. So we're going to select specific intervention strategies that are focused on the etiology about that of the

102
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:45,949
problem and that are known to be effective based on current best current knowledge and evidence based practice.

103
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:52,340
So our intervention should be based on the best evidence available.

104
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:58,670
So this is really where evidence based practice comes in that kind of the whole point of this class medical nutrition therapy,

105
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:02,090
what we'll talk about is based on the best available evidence.

106
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,930
Now we know in nutrition, it's it's kind of a field that is not black and white.

107
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:19,910
There's a lot of gray area. Research is really good, but it's hard to get like cause and effect from different nutritional aspects.

108
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:24,290
That's why it can be sometimes a frustrating.

109
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:33,559
Yeah there's always, you know, we we may find more cause and effect with specific nutrients, but we don't really eat single nutrients, right?

110
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:41,930
We eat foods, we eat a variety of things. So and all of that's kind of intertwined in terms of what we eat and then other aspects of lifestyle.

111
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:45,290
So on best current knowledge,

112
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:52,880
evidence based practice or just kind of like consensus of the scientific community that's really going to drive what directions we do.

113
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:58,969
We will utilize standardized language for describing the interventions.

114
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:05,129
So this part always gets students a little tripped up.

115
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:13,830
So that intervention terminology, we will use standardized language from that sheet just as like the heading for intervention,

116
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:19,260
like what we want to do, and then we're going to have free text in the actual placement.

117
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:26,940
So we'll do some examples. We do want to have some specific, measurable type of language in there.

118
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:32,940
So we want to define time and frequency of care, including intensity, duration of follow up.

119
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:39,090
So how do we do the implementation portion?

120
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:42,570
Well, we're going to collaborate with our patient or client to carry out the plan of care.

121
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:46,340
They kind of have to be on board for the most part.

122
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:50,630
Sometimes it's as simple as we're going to recommend.

123
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:54,290
Certain electrolytes are replaced in that situation.

124
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:59,900
You know, we're not we're going to tell the patient, oh, you know, your potassium was all we're going to supplement that.

125
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:02,450
Usually most people are on board with that.

126
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:12,139
But if it's something else, where it may be involves lifestyle change or something that they really have to commit to or agree with,

127
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:18,090
we want to make sure that they're they're kind of on board. I always like to communicate the plan of care.

128
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:23,880
So again, something as simple, like your potassium levels are low, we are going to supplement that.

129
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:29,910
I tell the people like that's the plan for today, whereas sometimes it's just ordered and you know,

130
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:40,400
the bag is hung and there's no real communication there. So I just like to always communicate the plan if they're never how simple or complex this.

131
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:46,120
Of course, we modified the plant. And yes, we have to do this a lot.

132
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:49,890
We're going to reassess and things are going to change the whole modifier plan.

133
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:54,080
We're going to follow up and verify that the plan is being implemented.

134
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:58,450
We might write a bunch of interventions and maybe some of them are not carried out.

135
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:04,240
So we have to be proactive to make sure that our our medical team is seeing our interventions,

136
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:12,700
and then we'll revise our strategies based on changes in the patient's condition or response to the interventions that we're implementing.

137
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:21,060
Okay. So these are the different components. So we'll have our assessment data in our chart note.

138
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:26,690
We'll have our nutrition diagnosis or diagnoses, and then we'll have our intervention for women.

139
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,100
So we'll prior prioritize the most important nutrition diagnoses.

140
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:40,290
We'll write just to kind of. A blanket nutrition prescription in terms of what we kind of want to do.

141
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:48,960
We'll set some specific goals and then we'll actually write down the specific interventions that are going to target that diagnosis.

142
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,470
In this part down here, the actual intervention. That's what's going to involve the senior.

143
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:03,400
These two things will be in their own words. That doesn't have to include anything from that term.

144
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:15,930
Of course it came. And if you want. So we've we've gone over this quite a bit, but prioritizing the nutrition diagnoses,

145
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:20,770
I'd say usually one or two try and limit it to one or two diagnoses.

146
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:26,520
There may be plenty more. If you really feel strongly like you need more than that, then that's fine, of course.

147
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:30,959
One thing that I think I've touched on,

148
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:40,800
but I want to maybe really hammer home is if the patient needs criteria for malnutrition, that always needs to be a diagnosis.

149
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:48,920
Always that hat you have to diagnose that is that they do need to make progress in their own.

150
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:55,389
Okay. So you might say, yes, they're malnourished. So that will be one of your diagnoses.

151
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:58,960
And then maybe is there something else you want to address? Then you can include that.

152
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:03,670
But that malnutrition diagnosis has to it has to be.

153
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:15,379
Written down if they do meet criteria for that. So we'll try to prioritize diagnoses based on problem severity, safety,

154
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:19,940
patient client needs and the likelihood that our nutrition intervention will influence the problem.

155
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,590
So we're allotted time for acting to resolve malnutrition.

156
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:32,459
But that's okay. We still need to diagnose it. All right.

157
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:41,070
So let's do an example. So let's say your nutrition assessment reveals your patient has inadequate fiber intake.

158
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:45,720
That's the the main issue that you take away from your assessment with this patient we have.

159
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:51,690
We don't know what the background is. And you know that because after you do your assessment,

160
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:56,940
they're only consuming about ten grams of fiber per day and you base that on

161
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:00,230
then telling you that you eat less than a cup of fruits and vegetables a day.

162
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:08,310
So very low fruit and vegetable intake. So we're assuming or we're predicting that they have an adequate fiber intake.

163
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:14,160
So let's say this is our statement, inadequate fiber intake.

164
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:24,630
Remember, this is coming from that standardized language terminology relating to infrequent consumption of fruits and vegetables.

165
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:33,090
That's the etiology, as evidenced by a patient consuming about ten grams of fiber per day or about 40% of recommended intake.

166
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:44,450
So there's our diagnosis. We'll write our nutrition prescription, which I'm not as concerned that you guys write this part.

167
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:48,860
We'll do some practice, but I'm more want to see the smart girls in the interventions.

168
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:53,059
But this is kind of what the academy ordered they want us to do.

169
00:27:53,060 --> 00:28:00,290
So this nutrition prescription is going to concisely state what the patient's individualized recommended

170
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:06,349
dietary intake of energy and or selected foods or nutrients is based on reference standards.

171
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:13,850
So like that fiber recommendation or the fiber, the fact that they're eating less than 40%,

172
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:18,440
that's based on what like the recommended amount for adults is.

173
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:23,720
You know, it might be 25 to 35 depending on the guideline grains per day.

174
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:33,960
Okay. So basically the nutrition prescription based on this diagnosis is we want the patient to eat adequate fiber.

175
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:37,180
You could be as simple as that. You just kind of right that.

176
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:47,730
You can always add a little bit more information like we want to gradually increase daily total by 4 to 25 grams to 25 to 35 grams per day.

177
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:58,250
So just a simple statement in terms of what are you prescribing for this patient based on what you've diagnosed and what your assessments have shown?

178
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:05,830
You can use standardized language, but you don't have to for this little prescription statement.

179
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:11,600
So if we use standardized language from the intervention terminology sheet,

180
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:18,170
we if you look on that sheet, you'll see that there is an option for increased fiber diet.

181
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:22,680
So this is the only part that comes from that standardized language sheet.

182
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:30,350
And then we kind of free text exactly what we want to do. And it's essentially the same that I wrote up here.

183
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:38,290
Okay. So we need to collaborate with the patient to set a smart goal.

184
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:41,200
You guys are familiar with these smart goals and think so.

185
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:49,540
Okay, so these just have to be specific and measurable and whenever possible have like a time component.

186
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:55,870
So, like, we want to be sure that we have that like within the next week or whatever it is.

187
00:29:55,870 --> 00:30:04,800
So a time component as well is important. So you do not have to set an example of a smart goal here.

188
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:14,720
You do not have to include this part here. It's just basically a smart goal that you write based on what you're trying to target for this patient.

189
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:19,920
So already an inpatient identified goal per patient to gradually increase fiber

190
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:24,780
intake over the next two weeks to a daily goal consumption goal of 35 grams per day.

191
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:30,210
So it's pretty specific where we're focusing on total fiber intake.

192
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:36,420
You might get more specific on like what type of fiber, what food sources, but just in general,

193
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:42,690
we want to gradually increase fiber over the next two weeks to a goal of 35 grams per day.

194
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:52,620
You can use intervention terminology, but you don't have to. Sorry, these are kind of out of order.

195
00:30:53,430 --> 00:31:03,300
In addition. So although we may have one diagnosis, we can have multiple goals and interventions to address that one diagnosis.

196
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:10,920
For every nutrition diagnosis we have, we have to have at least one smart poll and at least one intervention.

197
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:16,589
Often we have more, though. Okay, so if you have three separate nutrition diagnoses,

198
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:24,210
you're going to have to have at least three smart goals and at least three interventions that target that each specific diagnosis.

199
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:35,149
Okay. So if we're asking someone to increase their fiber intake, we also may want to make sure that they're taking in enough fluid while they do that.

200
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:45,830
So I have our patient, identifiable per patient, to increase food intake from water to a goal of a minimum of 64 ounces per day.

201
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:54,820
So we want them to drink enough water while they're increasing their fiber and we have a specific amount of 64 ounces per day.

202
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:59,760
Now, you could also include a time component here if you wanted to.

203
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:07,420
Maybe it's over two weeks that they get to that goal as well. Okay.

204
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:11,850
So now we've done our kind of simple nutrition prescription.

205
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:16,060
We want to increase the fiber. We want the patient to quit fiber.

206
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:23,560
We have two goals, basically gradually increasing their fiber intake over the next two weeks to that adequate amount,

207
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:29,110
in addition, increasing their fluid intake from water to a specific goal.

208
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:33,069
Now we're going to give like some actual interventions.

209
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:38,290
So some of this seems a little bit redundant, but this is kind of the process.

210
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:43,180
So pull out your intervention or pull up your intervention sheet.

211
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:51,250
This is where that standardized language will come in. It's really just used to label your intervention.

212
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:57,800
So the intervention terminology is organized into five different domains on that sheet.

213
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,390
Most often what we're going to use in this class is going to be in that first domain.

214
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:08,629
So food and or nutrient delivery because we're more in acute care that so we're

215
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:17,990
going to target specific intake or nutrients that we may need to supplement.

216
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:25,940
Often we'll use nutrition education as well, and we may use coordination of nutrition care by a nutrition professional.

217
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:32,010
Nutrition counseling. We don't really get to do a lot of that in-patient setting.

218
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:37,629
You kind of go up and see the patient. You might spend a decent amount of time with them, but usually it's it's pretty quick.

219
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:44,050
There's a lot going on in the hospital and you only have a certain amount of time, a certain window where you go see your patient,

220
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:48,640
you get your assessment, you ask the questions and then you plan the intervention.

221
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:53,740
So counseling really happens on the outpatient level.

222
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:59,830
So that's not going to be a huge focus in this class. And then population based nutrition action,

223
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:08,440
that's really not we're really focused on the individual in this class, not the population wide kind of care.

224
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,330
Okay. So these are the different domains from that sheet.

225
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:19,890
Again, most people will look under this first one.

226
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:34,400
That label for whatever it is that you want to do. Education and maybe for coordination of care like referrals to other professionals.

227
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:45,509
Okay. All right.

228
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:51,900
So for our fiber goal that we establish, this would be an example of a specific intervention.

229
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:57,900
So we have increased fiber diet that comes from our terminology sheet.

230
00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:03,569
We'll find that together. You don't have to include these numbers.

231
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:05,970
I'm just trying to let you know where I found that.

232
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:14,430
It's a high nutrient delivery bill by increased fiber diet, colon, and this is all three times what we actually want to do.

233
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,220
So these have to be pretty specific.

234
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:26,790
So I recommend the patient add 1 to 2 high fiber foods daily to the diet to gradually increase fiber intake to a goal of 35 grams per day.

235
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:34,540
Yes. It's the increased fiber diet. The first version that was not for both.

236
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:38,650
I mean, it's it could be both. It's kind of redundant.

237
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:46,040
So what I want to see from you guys is the goal, smart goals and the interventions.

238
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:51,410
But prescription you don't have to include because it's it's kind of redundant.

239
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:59,960
I just want to at least present it to in case you go to the internship and they want a prescription, but they're very similar.

240
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:07,549
Yes. I don't understand the difference between a smart goal and an intervention is that is one of them.

241
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:17,270
They increase everyday and then the smart goal, the recommendation. So I know the smart goals will come just in terms of how we chart.

242
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:22,340
You'll have these goals before your intervention.

243
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:28,760
So they're very similar like this, this example, they're they're pretty similar.

244
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:36,260
It's basically working with the patient to determine what the biggest priorities

245
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:44,180
are for them and then providing specific a specific way to achieve that goal.

246
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:52,550
These are pretty similar, though. So so the only difference I'm seeing is this one.

247
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:56,930
The increase over right here is like intake over the next two weeks, 35 grams.

248
00:36:56,930 --> 00:37:00,649
And then on the other side, it's like one due to high fiber foods.

249
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:07,670
So just more specific. Yeah, I would say that intervention will be slightly how are you going to meet that goal?

250
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:15,110
And in some cases, they may be you may have already given like kind of enough detail in your smart goal.

251
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:20,680
So some of that could be trends transfer to your intervention. Yes.

252
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:26,149
I always cooperate with. I would whenever possible.

253
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:31,510
There's going to be situations where maybe your patient is on a ventilator, so you're not really collaborating.

254
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:36,260
But the smartphones should be in a collaboration between you and the patient.

255
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:44,340
So this these are all very similar. We used to just have the diagnosis and the interventions.

256
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:55,020
Now they've been the prescription, the smart calls. I don't really see the value, but we'll just practice again, how to write a smart goal.

257
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:57,440
And then your intervention may be very similar.

258
00:37:57,450 --> 00:38:03,159
Just any way to offer a little bit more specifics on how you're going to achieve getting to that 35 grams.

259
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:11,250
So this is just saying, well, we're going to try and add one or two high fiber foods a day and increase to 35 grams.

260
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:18,210
And then we want to also have an intervention for that fluid.

261
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:22,440
And this is very similar to the smartphone.

262
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:31,410
So increased daily fluid consumption while increase in fiber intake to a goal of a minimum of 64 ounces per day, primarily from water.

263
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:38,020
So now, great.

264
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:46,150
We want our patient, we tell our patients they're going to add 1 to 2 high fiber foods a day, but maybe they don't know what foods contain fiber.

265
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:54,520
So we have to provide an intervention for education, like we're going to educate them on this in order for them to implement it.

266
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:59,830
So the education will also be an intervention. Okay.

267
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:04,440
So this content related nutrition education, this comes from our sheet.

268
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:13,590
And then we'll say we provided patient. Patient was provided with verbal and written instructions regarding the fiber content of

269
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:19,320
foods and was instructed to choose foods with greater than three grams of fiber per serving.

270
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:24,920
So they kind of get some education. On what types of foods contain fiber.

271
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,419
Specifically want to look for foods with greater than three grams.

272
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:36,140
That would be considered more of a high fiber choice. So we have to provide some context to the patient on that.

273
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:40,110
Yeah. The judgment or the.

274
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:55,280
Yeah, you can if it's like. There may be certain conditions where we want to focus on soluble fiber for soluble.

275
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:06,910
What's the. Oh yeah. It would be dependent on your assessment, like if you're addressing constipation, which we don't,

276
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:15,160
just like if you're going to work, for example, and then you would write specific information based on that.

277
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:20,800
I think. Okay.

278
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:31,690
So what I want you guys to be able to do is write your diagnoses that identify the main problem that we're going to address.

279
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:37,000
Write smart goals, at least one per diagnosis.

280
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,340
And then you need also an intervention for each diagnosis and or smartphone.

281
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:47,440
Okay, so if you have one diagnosis, need at least one smart goal and one intervention.

282
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:53,290
Lots of times you'll have more in the smart goal. An intervention may be kind of similar.

283
00:40:53,290 --> 00:41:00,490
Just know that your intervention has to include a standardized language heading and it has to be maybe a little bit more specific.

284
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:04,630
Yes. And for the diagnosis, is that the piece?

285
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:07,810
Yes, the diagnosis is the PTSD.

286
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:16,760
Okay. So let's say we get our our diagnosis.

287
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:19,850
We have our smartphones interventions written down.

288
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:30,440
Now we need to monitor and evaluate if those interventions are actually working okay, if they're being implemented and if they are effective.

289
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:34,120
So let's talk about the monitoring and evaluation.

290
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:38,270
This will be kind of the last piece on our note for our patient.

291
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:46,240
So the monitoring part will assess the effectiveness of our nutrition interventions.

292
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:51,880
And then we want to measure outcomes by collecting data on these nutritional indicators.

293
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:57,480
So we'll do some examples in terms of the monitoring and measuring,

294
00:41:58,410 --> 00:42:02,610
and we want to compare current findings with previous findings and evaluate the

295
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:07,499
impact of the intervention in order to evaluate the impact of the intervention.

296
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:16,300
So maybe. Maybe you had your intervention with to supplement a specific nutrient.

297
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:21,250
Then you're going to compare maybe the value of that nutrient.

298
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:27,399
Maybe it's a biomarker, you know, potassium level before and after your your intervention to see if it's been effective,

299
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:37,549
if it's if it's going in the right direction. Will identify outcomes relevant to the nutrition diagnosis and the intervention goals and determine

300
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:42,350
the amount of progress that has been made and whether the goals or expected outcomes are met.

301
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:54,710
So let's see if our friends who do the video will help us write those monitoring and evaluation sections for the case study that they presented.

302
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,510
Okay. So all you need is.

303
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:19,410
One that is so you're not gonna use usually you don't use this, but you're heading for the monitoring and evaluation, the domain.

304
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:26,400
It's something within that domain. So just one of these you can just do a nutrient intake.

305
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:33,810
I like to be as specific as possible. So if we're like trying to increase calories, I would just use energy intake.

306
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:38,810
I don't know why it's a subset of class words, the same thing. I don't know.

307
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:49,020
So just be as specific as possible with the label you pick from the monitoring and evaluation language.

308
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:55,630
She. Usually.

309
00:47:57,190 --> 00:48:03,310
Our patients that we're seeing have some type of nutritional issue in the hospital.

310
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:07,540
Usually it's undernutrition is why we would be seeing that.

311
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:11,769
Most often they've lost a lot of weight because of their underlying disease condition.

312
00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:19,050
That May is making it either difficult to get adequate energy for whatever reason.

313
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:23,170
So they're usually nutritionally compromised in terms of undernutrition.

314
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:28,090
So I almost always include like a weight change.

315
00:48:29,390 --> 00:48:33,530
As in monitoring and evaluation, because we are always going to monitor our patients.

316
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:41,110
We. Okay. So I would just kind of say usually you should have that is something we're going to monitor because

317
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:49,510
it's a way for it's a sensitive a sensitive measure of the provision of adequate energy consumption.

318
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:53,479
Right. Wait. Even though, you know, if your fluctuated, it's pretty sensitive.

319
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:57,960
Like if a patient is not getting enough total energy, their weight will drop.

320
00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:05,000
So that is something we probably will always include for our patients in terms of something we'll monitor.

321
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:14,800
Is there weight? And that may maybe for other reasons, maybe we're trying to assess how much fluid there they're retaining between dialysis business.

322
00:49:14,830 --> 00:49:23,980
So we want to monitor their weight change. So there's almost always going to be a scenario where you should improve that just as and that's why I.

323
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:36,240
So don't worry about like we'll look at the sheet together and we'll kind of pick out what makes sense.

324
00:51:57,730 --> 00:52:04,510
Does that make sense? So you'll look at your P statement, your diagnosis will use those interchangeably.

325
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:10,960
That part where we say, as evidenced by and we have, you know, whatever our evidence is to support the problem,

326
00:52:11,710 --> 00:52:16,840
those are the things you're going to monitor and evaluate, essentially, whatever.

327
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:20,290
So think about when you're writing your statements,

328
00:52:20,290 --> 00:52:26,410
you want to be as specific as possible in terms of what evidence or signs and symptoms you have to support your diagnosis.

329
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:31,270
And then that will help guide in terms of what you need to monitor for the patient.

330
00:53:09,520 --> 00:54:24,530
All right, that's. Right.

331
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:31,920
That was kind of, you know. So we'll look at the the sheet.

332
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:38,330
I'm not really concerned about like the whole hierarchy. I don't really know what they're talking about.

333
00:54:39,830 --> 00:54:45,319
Okay. So.

334
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:48,410
How so? The intervention.

335
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:55,930
So the diagnosis has its own terminology sheet. The intervention has its own terminology sheet for just kind of the heading.

336
00:54:56,450 --> 00:55:02,330
And then you'll see that this says nutrition assessment and monitoring and evaluation terminology.

337
00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:07,520
So some of these terms we use in our assessment as headings,

338
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:12,469
we don't really do that in this class because we're not writing a full chart and I will practice that.

339
00:55:12,470 --> 00:55:17,180
But you don't just this is used for your monitoring and evaluation here.

340
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:24,740
So what I would suggest is when you're picking a label for what you want to monitor.

341
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:34,970
Just pick one as specific as possible from whatever domain so you're never really have as you're putting like the domain name.

342
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:42,850
Use something more specific. If you're in if you want to just do energy intake, that's fine.

343
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:51,320
You don't have to go more specific than that. But just as whatever label makes the most sense for what you want to monitor and evaluate.

344
00:55:51,770 --> 00:55:54,950
Just know that you're not going to use like these domain headings.

345
00:55:56,460 --> 00:56:02,370
I don't really care if you do, but there's probably something below that that is maybe more applicable to what you're trying to do.

346
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:16,230
Okay. So this is just a snippet from there. A lot of our monitoring and evaluation made.

347
00:56:16,950 --> 00:56:21,659
And while it's going to probably involve some heading under this first domain because

348
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:26,160
it's going to be more directly related to what we talked about in this class.

349
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:35,130
So for instance, with our example, we have fiber intake.

350
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:38,879
Let's say you just want to do fiber or you could get more specific,

351
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:43,980
like you could do total fiber intake, soluble fiber intake and soluble fiber intake.

352
00:56:44,790 --> 00:56:50,250
There is lots of heading. I don't really care what you do.

353
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:55,329
If you had a specific soluble fiber goal and you put it under a fiber intake heading,

354
00:56:55,330 --> 00:57:02,950
that's fine if you want to do soluble fiber intake and then right your goal for how much you want them to have or what you're going to monitor,

355
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:07,249
that's fine as well. Okay.

356
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:10,760
So let's say we do. This is for our previous example.

357
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:19,129
Now what are we going to monitor and evaluate? So we wrote a diagnosis that they had inadequate fiber intake.

358
00:57:19,130 --> 00:57:22,070
We had goals for them to increase their fiber intake.

359
00:57:22,070 --> 00:57:28,430
And we had interventions with in terms of how we were going to get them to increase their fiber intake through education and

360
00:57:28,430 --> 00:57:37,340
specific recommendations to include one or two high fiber foods a day gradually over the next two weeks to get to 35 grams per day.

361
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:44,810
So of course, we're going to need to monitor their fiber intake, right, to see if they get to that 35 grams per day.

362
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:51,920
Okay. So patient to select at least two high fiber foods at all meals and snacks.

363
00:57:53,360 --> 00:58:01,910
Now, this is the monitoring and evaluation part. These seem similar to the interventions, but these have to be measurable.

364
00:58:03,290 --> 00:58:09,560
Okay, so how we're going to do that? So patients who select at least two high fiber foods at all, meals and snacks,

365
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:20,120
patient to track daily dietary intake at least three days per week to assess adequacy of fiber intake to a goal of 35 grams per day.

366
00:58:21,650 --> 00:58:30,740
So if these are monitoring and evaluation goals, when we go and talk to the patient and we gather information to see if they're meeting needs,

367
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:36,320
probably, you know, by talking to them, what did you have?

368
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:43,790
We can then assess if they met the high fiber goal to five hyper foods, high fiber foods per meal.

369
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:49,459
And then a lot of times we use, you know, we have them track their intake.

370
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:55,070
This again, would be more like an outpatient setting. To see if they're getting up to that 35 grams per day.

371
00:58:57,410 --> 00:59:03,470
So fluid in beverage intake. This is from the monitoring and evaluation sheet, so that's just a heading from there.

372
00:59:04,430 --> 00:59:08,870
We want them to drink an additional eight ounces of fluid with each meal and snack,

373
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:13,579
and then we want them to track their fluid intake on a nutrition app.

374
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:18,140
So then they can send that to us and we can look at it together to see if they're meeting that goal.

375
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:25,790
We have to have some way to measure whether the patient is doing what we're asking them to do.

376
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:32,530
Sometimes it's as simple as looking at my eyes, looking at the flow chart to see what kind of nutrition was delivered.

377
00:59:33,830 --> 00:59:41,629
But usually in the outpatient setting, it's going to take more of an intensive interview with the patient setting a diet record,

378
00:59:41,630 --> 00:59:45,980
maybe doing a food diary to really assess if they're there getting to those goals.

379
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:53,570
Okay. So let's do an example where we kind of put this all together.

380
00:59:55,390 --> 01:00:00,190
So our nutrition assessment reveals that our patient has inadequate fiber intake.

381
01:00:00,190 --> 01:00:06,670
They're only consuming ten grams per day. They're eating less than a cup of fruits and vegetables total per day.

382
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:14,590
So our nutrition diagnosis was inadequate fiber intake related to infrequent consumption of fruits and vegetables,

383
01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:22,090
as evidenced by patient consuming ten grams of fiber per day or about 40% of recommended intake.

384
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:29,190
So our nutrition prescription is essentially we want them to eat adequate fiber.

385
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:40,030
Smart people. So we work with the patient and identify that they're gradually going to increase their fiber intake over the next two weeks.

386
01:00:40,030 --> 01:00:45,660
Maybe they said, you know, I need more time till I change my diet.

387
01:00:45,670 --> 01:00:51,579
Like I don't like these foods that are high in fiber. So let's let's take some time or find some foods that might work.

388
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:57,280
So intake over the next two weeks to a daily goal of 35 grams per day.

389
01:00:58,060 --> 01:01:04,630
At the same time, they're going to increase their fluid intake from water to a goal of 64 ounces per day.

390
01:01:07,310 --> 01:01:12,980
So we did our interventions to specifically target these goals and the diagnosis.

391
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:21,979
We're going to have them add 1 to 2 high fiber foods a day to diet and gradually increase total fiber intake to goal of 35 grams,

392
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:30,920
very similar to our smart goal, increase their fluid while increasing their fiber to a goal of at least 64 ounces a day, primarily from water.

393
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:36,650
And we're going to provide them with written and verbal education about the fiber content of foods.

394
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:43,570
And instruct them to choose foods with at least, you know, at least three grams or more of fiber per serving.

395
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:51,080
So monitoring and evaluation, we're going to monitor their fiber intake.

396
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:55,399
So we're going to have them select at least two high fiber, high fiber foods at all meals and snacks.

397
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:59,840
So maybe they're working up to that. Maybe just they start by adding two per day.

398
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:04,940
And then we want to get to the point where they're having to high fiber foods at all meals and snacks.

399
01:02:06,350 --> 01:02:13,280
We'll have them track their daily dietary intake for at least three days to assess the adequacy of their fiber intake.

400
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:17,510
See if they're getting close to that average of 35 grams per day.

401
01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:22,580
And we want them to drink an additional eight ounces of fluid with each meal and snack.

402
01:02:23,150 --> 01:02:27,379
Hopefully, that will help them get to that 64 ounces per day mark.

403
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:32,260
And we'll track have them track their food on the. An app.

404
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:42,490
Okay. So let's do an example. We have an 86 year old patient with dementia,

405
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:48,560
severe hypertension and wandering behavior who resides in a secured unit of the

406
01:02:48,850 --> 01:02:55,990
either the hospital or the long term care facility where they are not spending time.

407
01:02:58,340 --> 01:03:03,469
Sorry. I have some typos here. So he is able to feed himself with setup and verbal cueing.

408
01:03:03,470 --> 01:03:08,720
So need some assistance just on getting things set up and some verbal cues to to eat.

409
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:16,850
He has had frequent falls and has recently been readmitted to the hospital for UTI, which is his third try this year.

410
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:23,310
The patient is 510 and currently weighs £166.

411
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:27,270
His fluid intake averages about 24 ounces per day.

412
01:03:28,890 --> 01:03:36,150
And you calculate his daily fluid needs are closer to like 74 ounces a day or 2200 milliliters a day.

413
01:03:39,870 --> 01:03:45,000
So this is an example of how we would start our chart note for this patient.

414
01:03:45,930 --> 01:03:53,140
So these headings for the assessment portion, the top portion of our note would come from that assessment and monitoring and evaluation sheet.

415
01:03:53,160 --> 01:04:01,600
They share the same terminology. So I always start with the patient's medical select health history, just to give a brief background,

416
01:04:01,650 --> 01:04:05,340
background of what is going on with the patient and essentially why they're here.

417
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:11,940
So the patient is an 86 year old man with a medical history significant for dementia and hypertension,

418
01:04:12,510 --> 01:04:16,830
referred or admitted to the hospital for concern over UTI II and frequent falls.

419
01:04:18,740 --> 01:04:29,000
So just a brief, little brief information on his food and nutrient intake he's able to feed himself with set up and for killing his.

420
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,750
We know that his beverage intake is about 24 ounces per day.

421
01:04:32,750 --> 01:04:37,130
That's probably from the nursing report or the flow sheet to see how much he's consuming.

422
01:04:37,820 --> 01:04:41,960
And then we have a section where we put our anthropometric, so which we will always include,

423
01:04:42,140 --> 01:04:49,310
you know, that's just helpful to have all this information there. Okay.

424
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:53,669
Patients will always have a diet order, so sometimes it's nothing.

425
01:04:53,670 --> 01:04:59,999
It'll be NPL, maybe they can't have anything. But this patient is on a level five diet with thin liquids.

426
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,780
We'll talk more about therapeutic diets on Thursday.

427
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:11,759
We if there's any pertinent plans you want to include in your assessment portion, you can put them under a heading.

428
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:17,490
So is B1 is elevated. So is the sodium level serum sodium level.

429
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:25,950
He's on Lasix, so they may be on a lot of different medications, but this one might be pertinent to our assessment to point out.

430
01:05:27,870 --> 01:05:32,760
And we estimate that his fluid needs are about 2300 milliliters per day.

431
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:41,310
Does anybody know why we might include the B1, the sodium and the Lasix information here in our chart now?

432
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:52,230
But. Right.

433
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:57,390
So we're we're so this patient is coming in frequent UTIs.

434
01:05:57,690 --> 01:06:02,970
We know that the fluid consumption is much lower than what we would estimate the patients need.

435
01:06:03,630 --> 01:06:13,470
So they're probably dehydrated. So that's what we're pulling from the assessment and these types of things would support that assessment.

436
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:21,930
So an elevated V one elevated serum sodium patients on Lasix, so they're not consuming enough water and they're on a diuretic.

437
01:06:22,110 --> 01:06:27,180
And these lab values are kind of pertinent to what we are looking at for the patient.

438
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:33,540
There's going to be a whole lot of other information that we don't need to include in our specific assessment.

439
01:06:38,610 --> 01:06:43,670
Okay. So I want you to write a diagnosis for this patient.

440
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:48,240
So have your nutrition diagnosis terminology sheet.

441
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:55,250
And let's just come up with one diagnosis that we think is is most important to identify here.

442
01:06:55,260 --> 01:06:59,040
So we'll take like 3 minutes or so and do that.

443
01:09:19,730 --> 01:09:25,210
Okay. What did you guys come up with for your diagnosis? Anybody want to share?

444
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:35,900
Does anything stick out on our terminology sheet? That might be the main problem we want to address for this patient.

445
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:40,190
Yeah. Yeah.

446
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:44,240
Did anybody else have an adequate fluid intake? Yes.

447
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:49,950
Anybody have something different? We don't have a whole lot of information.

448
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:55,210
I kind of like cherry picked the information to give you so we would select so inadequate

449
01:09:55,210 --> 01:10:00,310
fluid intake to me makes sense for what we what we know is going on with this patient.

450
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:08,230
Okay. So the problem is this patient is not drinking enough fluid.

451
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:12,030
Now, the etiology may be fearful.

452
01:10:12,220 --> 01:10:15,730
So I just put that in. I want to share what they have for the ideology.

453
01:10:15,730 --> 01:10:25,990
I mean, we don't have a lot of information. So I put increases of collectivity wandering around the unit impaired cognitive ability,

454
01:10:26,740 --> 01:10:32,380
maybe a decreased third sensation, which can happen in old age and also with dementia.

455
01:10:33,860 --> 01:10:41,329
So our ideology, you know, we may be kind of predicting that some of this is happening.

456
01:10:41,330 --> 01:10:45,340
We don't have that directly from the patient. Yes, go ahead.

457
01:10:45,470 --> 01:10:50,850
So with the diuretic also, I wondered that you could put that there, too.

458
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:59,330
So it could be also related to patient currently diuretic therapy that's contributing to the problem.

459
01:10:59,540 --> 01:11:08,809
Definitely, as evidenced by current fluid intake that we need to frequent, utilize laboratory values.

460
01:11:08,810 --> 01:11:13,430
We have evidence of the blood and sodium. And then you can also put patient six as well.

461
01:11:13,550 --> 01:11:21,870
Yes. What about. Patients with love. Well, it could be, you know, maybe there.

462
01:11:22,740 --> 01:11:28,140
That might be a whole other diagnosis. Like if they're not eating well, losing weight.

463
01:11:28,470 --> 01:11:34,920
But the weight loss could contribute because they're on diuretics, therapy, so they're losing more fluid.

464
01:11:35,070 --> 01:11:37,740
So the dehydration that could contribute as well.

465
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:46,390
So I think you could put all of that, you know, any any evidence of the etiology, any evidence you have to support the diagnosis you can put.

466
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:58,840
So how would that look in a statement? Of course, you can have more information and adequate food intake related to increased physical activity,

467
01:11:58,990 --> 01:12:06,160
wandering impaired cognitive ability, slash dementia, potential for decreased thirst sensation.

468
01:12:06,490 --> 01:12:16,750
But also and again, the information that they're on diuretics as evidenced by patients, current fluid intake meeting less than 35% of estimated needs.

469
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:26,140
So whenever you have data to support that, they have an adequate intake, I want you to provide it in a measurable way.

470
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:30,490
So like we know this, patients consuming about 24 ounces day.

471
01:12:30,940 --> 01:12:37,990
They need closer to 74. So I always like to put what percentage there they're actually reading compared to what they.

472
01:12:40,070 --> 01:12:43,670
Elevated B1 in sodium, we can actually put down the levels.

473
01:12:43,670 --> 01:12:46,670
If you want to frequent utilize,

474
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:51,980
you could put the percentage of weight loss that may also be helpful and then you

475
01:12:51,980 --> 01:12:56,360
could put patient on Lasix so there could put a lot of stuff in your diagnosis.

476
01:13:00,940 --> 01:13:05,200
Yes. The current fluidity of not.

477
01:13:08,010 --> 01:13:12,600
Would that be of the ideology or would that be a symptom of.

478
01:13:14,950 --> 01:13:22,150
Because of the lack of wood there is inadequate food intake is because people with inadequate food intake.

479
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:31,240
So yeah, you don't have it right. So something is causing them not to be able to eat the food.

480
01:13:32,710 --> 01:13:41,520
So I feel what you're saying, like inadequate food intake may be related to inadequate food intake because of inadequate fluid intake.

481
01:13:42,070 --> 01:13:48,430
So something and there's an underlying reason why we can't afford to maintain hydration.

482
01:13:49,090 --> 01:13:55,959
So it may be that it's really moving a lot. Um, maybe it's increased their sensation of problems.

483
01:13:55,960 --> 01:14:02,440
It probably has to do just with this mental state that, you know, it's not something that is.

484
01:14:05,870 --> 01:14:09,110
Like a priority. This patient needs verbal cueing.

485
01:14:09,230 --> 01:14:12,440
We'll probably use it as well to drink water.

486
01:14:14,510 --> 01:14:17,270
Older age there is an increased thirst sensation.

487
01:14:17,270 --> 01:14:24,230
So we see a lot of elderly patients that are admitted with your eyes because they're not able to be adequate hydration.

488
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:34,670
Now this patient is also on Lasix, so that be something that hasn't been monitored, but there's something that is causing this.

489
01:14:34,940 --> 01:14:38,750
Beyond just him not drinking, what's causing him not to drink?

490
01:14:39,150 --> 01:14:42,260
Oh, what we give we try to pull that information much as possible.

491
01:14:42,350 --> 01:14:46,340
Okay. Thank you. Because then it would be, like, really redundant.

492
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:52,440
Like, everything is related. Okay.

493
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:58,200
So an example of a nutrition prescription. Again, this is just a general statement of what we want to do for the patient.

494
01:14:58,470 --> 01:15:05,220
You guys do not have to include this. I'm never going to ask for or I probably will not ask for a nutrition prescription.

495
01:15:06,060 --> 01:15:10,470
I just want to see the diagnosis, examples, interventions and the monitoring.

496
01:15:10,620 --> 01:15:14,670
But this is what it may look like below the the diagnosis.

497
01:15:15,450 --> 01:15:21,479
In general, we want a regular diet within liquids to occur and to encourage consumption of water,

498
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:26,640
fluids and water containing foods at and between meals to help maintain hydration.

499
01:15:26,820 --> 01:15:31,620
And we want to encourage at least 2300 meals, oral fluid intake daily.

500
01:15:32,220 --> 01:15:38,220
And then you could have specific information after this by, you know, doing this.

501
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:42,410
And we'll talk about what some of those specific things are.

502
01:15:42,860 --> 01:15:50,630
So smart, cool, patient to achieve adequate hydration via oral intake of fluids and consume between 9 to 10 cups of fluid daily.

503
01:15:51,620 --> 01:15:58,579
So the biggest thing here would be that we have a goal for how much we want him to consume and how we want him to do it.

504
01:15:58,580 --> 01:16:02,090
So if possible, just through oral intake.

505
01:16:02,090 --> 01:16:08,030
So this patient isn't going to rely on supplemental IV fluids because that makes it a little bit more difficult,

506
01:16:08,030 --> 01:16:12,800
especially for our patients with altered mental status if they're always hooked up to different.

507
01:16:15,220 --> 01:16:19,629
So nutrition intervention, just for purposes of time.

508
01:16:19,630 --> 01:16:26,440
We'll go through this together. But if we look at our sheet, let's go to our intervention terminology sheet.

509
01:16:30,740 --> 01:16:34,069
So usually we're going to kind of start under this first domain.

510
01:16:34,070 --> 01:16:39,810
Let's see what makes the most sense. Scroll down.

511
01:16:42,740 --> 01:16:51,800
See these get really, really specific. Kind of look for.

512
01:16:51,810 --> 01:16:55,290
Okay. So we see down here where it's specific to fluids.

513
01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:03,220
I think this increased fluid diet would make the most sense maybe for this patient as our heading,

514
01:17:04,180 --> 01:17:06,430
because we want them to increase their fluid intake.

515
01:17:06,430 --> 01:17:12,790
So we would just use this here, for example, there you may find something else that would work as well.

516
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:18,760
But let's just for for ease. This is pretty simple and straightforward and what we want to do for the patients.

517
01:17:21,090 --> 01:17:26,880
So increased fluid diet is from our terminology sheet and then how are we going to do that?

518
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:32,310
This is where we provide specific ways to get that increased fluid.

519
01:17:32,670 --> 01:17:36,230
And this is going to be not based on any standardized language.

520
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:41,910
This is just really what you, the dietician and nutrition professional is recommending.

521
01:17:42,390 --> 01:17:48,120
So we'll say provide at least two eight ounce beverage preferences with meals.

522
01:17:49,020 --> 01:17:52,200
Sometimes we will ask the patient, what do they like to drink?

523
01:17:53,430 --> 01:18:01,770
These are things that are not just water, but they have a high water content offer eight ounces of fluid with every medication passed.

524
01:18:01,780 --> 01:18:07,200
So whenever a patient needs to take their pills, let's try and get them to drink more than just a couple of sips.

525
01:18:07,230 --> 01:18:10,920
You know, let's talk with the nursing staff. Can you really push that?

526
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:14,430
They drink this whole cup of water with with each medication pass.

527
01:18:15,390 --> 01:18:22,140
Any time the snack is sent up, let's also give a cup of water, even if it's whatever the patient prefers.

528
01:18:22,150 --> 01:18:29,799
You know, maybe this is fruit punch. Offer sips of fluid each time the pieces patient passes the nursing station.

529
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:31,930
Now this patient likes to get up and walk around.

530
01:18:31,940 --> 01:18:41,499
So this you have to get the medical team on board like you see him walking around the unit any time he passes off for, you know, a sip of water.

531
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:45,430
So that might be a little idealistic, but we do these types of things.

532
01:18:45,430 --> 01:18:55,060
We know we have a plan like the patient of having these frequent meetings, like we need to have a way to prevent in an older age,

533
01:18:55,300 --> 01:19:00,750
the frequent UTIs urinary tract infections are most often caused by not taking enough fluid.

534
01:19:03,170 --> 01:19:06,440
So usually the staff will work with us on this.

535
01:19:06,710 --> 01:19:13,520
So he was verbal, prompt to Q patient to drink fluids and offer some positive reinforcement each time he has some beverage.

536
01:19:15,470 --> 01:19:22,700
Any way we can get that goal up to that 2024, 2300 meals a day is what we want to do.

537
01:19:25,660 --> 01:19:34,880
Okay. So food and beverage intake is what I selected from our assessment and monitoring and evaluation sheet.

538
01:19:34,890 --> 01:19:39,990
So if we look down here, you could have chosen something else.

539
01:19:43,490 --> 01:19:53,150
You could do oral fluid estimated intake in 24 hours, oral fluid measured in 24 hours if they're tying down everything.

540
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:57,860
So there's lots of different things you could select in terms of the heading there.

541
01:20:08,260 --> 01:20:17,080
Okay. So we want the patient to meet at least 80% of estimated daily fluid needs for oral intake on average over the course of the hospitalization.

542
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:27,020
So how do you think we monitor this? Himself.

543
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:37,480
Yeah. We would look at the inputs and outputs reported on the flow sheet.

544
01:20:37,490 --> 01:20:43,550
So we call those eyes and know what they're taking in and the output on the flow sheet.

545
01:20:43,940 --> 01:20:48,560
We'll talk with our nursing staff to see how the beverage intake is going.

546
01:20:49,010 --> 01:20:59,719
Assess the hydration status by the monitoring of labs, the need for additional IV fluids, etc. So lots of different ways to monitor and evaluate.

547
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:05,540
But we want to see that they are the patient is getting at least 80% of what we recommended for them.

548
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:10,370
100% is usually unrealistic. You know, there's going to be variability.

549
01:21:10,370 --> 01:21:18,200
So if this patient gets to at least 80% of that 2300 ML goal over the course of hospitalization, I think that's pretty good.

550
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:26,030
Our interventions are working pretty well. So this is just an example.

551
01:21:26,030 --> 01:21:35,390
Does that help kind of tie it in a little bit? Is anyone not feeling great about the efficient care process?

552
01:21:36,260 --> 01:21:43,190
I don't feel good. I mean, I don't we don't use it, but you will use it during the internship and in the inpatient setting.

553
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:47,030
So as to where I want you guys to be able to do is write a diagnosis.

554
01:21:48,260 --> 01:21:51,740
And then when you're in the internship to be like, Oh yeah, I kind of remember that.

555
01:21:51,980 --> 01:21:55,780
And so then you can work with the dietitian and. And get the rest of it.

556
01:21:56,060 --> 01:22:02,160
Yes. Are you?

557
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:16,370
Yes, she was. In the hospital, we would most often use milliliters.

558
01:22:16,700 --> 01:22:19,850
So we'll use that here.

559
01:22:20,390 --> 01:22:24,860
But the patient might say, I drink this many ounces where I drink this many cups.

560
01:22:24,860 --> 01:22:27,110
So I try to give you all different kinds of things.

561
01:22:27,110 --> 01:22:37,310
But in your recommendations it's usually going to be centimeters for height, kg for weight, milliliters for fluid.

562
01:22:37,610 --> 01:22:42,920
That's what we use when we. Okay.

563
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:49,170
So don't stress about NCP. We're going to use it a lot, but not worry about it a lot.

564
01:22:49,650 --> 01:22:51,990
And I will see you guys on Thursday.
