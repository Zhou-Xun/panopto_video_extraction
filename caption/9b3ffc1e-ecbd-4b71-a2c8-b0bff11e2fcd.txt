Hi, I'm Sharon Kardia.

3
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,770
I'm a Professor of Epidemiology,
and I study the risk factors for

4
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:24,000
common chronic diseases,
especially the genetic risk factors.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,460
In this segment, we're gonna talk
about epidemiology, its scope and

6
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,880
its function in improving health for
populations.

7
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,818
In its most basic form,
epidemiology is the study of health and

8
00:00:34,818 --> 00:00:37,580
disease in populations, in communities.

9
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:42,091
More comprehensively, we talk about it in
terms of the study of the distribution and

10
00:00:42,091 --> 00:00:46,097
determinants of disease,
especially estimating disease frequencies,

11
00:00:46,097 --> 00:00:47,700
looking at the risk factors.

12
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:53,161
And how they're related to somebody's risk
of actually developing a disease in their

13
00:00:53,161 --> 00:00:58,500
community, in their population, could be
a national or even global perspective.

14
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,180
How is it different from
other health disciplines?

15
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:05,510
Epidemiology is really the only scientific
discipline that is concerned with looking

16
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:10,010
at disease in populations, and
then how the disease actually changes over

17
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:15,590
time as we try to intervene or prevent it,
from a public health perspective.

18
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:20,960
Epidemiology's real role is to develop and
apply methods for collecting data,

19
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,560
analyzing it, and then assessing those
health outcomes, so the people can

20
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,840
take action and actually move
the information into improving health.

21
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,240
What does epidemiology
look like in action?

22
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,000
First, it starts with identifying
immediate needs for information.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,690
Then designing the studies, the
surveillance systems to collect the actual

24
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:45,790
data that will provide a way of seeing
what are the trends that are happening.

25
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:50,940
Analyzing that data, often mapping it onto
the geographical location, whether or not

26
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:56,530
it's a community that's looking at their
own disease risk, or a state, or a nation.

27
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:01,110
In doing that analysis and mapping it,
making then the inferences as to

28
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:05,900
where the actual disease is emanating
from, for instance in an outbreak.

29
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:09,740
And then communicating that information
to key stakeholders, whether or not it's

30
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:15,677
a city council, a state department
of health, or maybe even Congress.
