1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,600
Like you say, like two or three times a day.

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:16,240
And yeah, so I guess the wave of RSV is pressing on the back of one I undergrads is still in the worst of it, but.

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:22,050
Okay. So one of the things that I'm happy to inform you of is that while we haven't quite got all our agrees on,

4
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:27,330
we do at least have advice this entire class. In fact, on the next policy level,

5
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:34,469
which is the response to our high so all of the desire to get some help thinking through the

6
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:41,790
next policy now and we're going do it in the form of something that is genuinely important,

7
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,730
which is talking through the regulatory process, how it's structured.

8
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,610
And I promise not to throw more than like two or three broad scale things about the evolution of American politics, even though that's what.

9
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:04,350
Okay. Mostly I'm going to go fairly fast here because we have two exercises that I think are valuable to get done in a room.

10
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:14,200
Legislation is what is passed by Congress. Legislation can really only be formally overturned by the courts or by Congress changing its mind later.

11
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:21,350
So legislation is real hard stuff. Do you want to get your preferences entrenched in the American political sense?

12
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:25,560
What you want is legislation. The problem is legislation.

13
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,399
And I'm going to be on political thin ice here.

14
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:38,990
So what I'm saying sounds totally reasonable, but it's like you can't be written ahead of time for every possible thing, right?

15
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:43,230
So for example, let's do a communicable disease regulation.

16
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:47,070
In 1900, we're going to say yellow fever. Are we going to mention COVID 19?

17
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:53,100
No, we are not going to mention COVID 19. Let's do chemical substances control the 1970s.

18
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:59,070
We're going to mention a whole lot of chemicals. Are we going to mention anything using nanotechnology?

19
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:06,360
We are not. Let's set up a scheme for Medicare to figure out how it's going to pay for things.

20
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,970
Is it wise to specify specific medical technologies in the 1980s and assume it'll be relevant now?

21
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:19,129
No, not. So each of these cases is an example of what I was talking about to the courts class,

22
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:23,120
which is that all contracts are necessarily incomplete and those, by the way, are real laws.

23
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,880
We had a communicable disease control framework which specified certain diseases, and it had been written at the turn of the last century.

24
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:37,010
We had something called Tosca, which was the Toxic Substances Control Act, which had been passed in the 1970s and had to be updated.

25
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:43,790
We have the Clean Air Act, which deliberately doesn't say what chemicals, because it says that the science is going to evolve.

26
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,100
We have the Clean Water Act, which likewise says that.

27
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:57,320
So what happens is in the legislation, they create an authority and an obligation for the regulator to fill in the specifics.

28
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:02,330
We create OSHA with a mission to promote occupational safety and health.

29
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:12,290
We don't write ergonomic standards into laws. We create CMS, but we don't write the precise management of Medicare Medicaid into law.

30
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:18,410
We create a regulatory framework for clean air and clean water and control of toxic substances.

31
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:26,090
We don't say that we know forever what the scientific consensus is going to be on the appropriate level of assets in the river.

32
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:36,200
So laws passed by Congress create and give authority to agencies, to the EPA, to CMS, to HHS,

33
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:41,570
to all sorts of different agencies, and they will often directed to address a specific problem.

34
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:45,769
So if you're the EPA, you're supposed to enforce the Clean Air Act,

35
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:50,030
which means identifying unhealthy things in the air and identifying the best

36
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:54,350
available technology which you're then legally obliged to mandate people use.

37
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:00,200
That's the main core of the American regulatory state.

38
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:06,829
Right. There was rigorous laws like the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the Social Security Act,

39
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:10,490
which is, of course, all of Medicare and Medicaid or amendments to the Social Security Act,

40
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,639
giving agencies like SSA and CMS the authority to do things that we care about,

41
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:22,460
like set prices for medical procedures, or decide which medicines can go on to the market in case of the FDA.

42
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,830
Now, there's always some administrative discretion.

43
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:31,500
There's always some administrative discretion that summarizes the entire middle section of this classified.

44
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,979
And given that the federal government has 2.7 million employees,

45
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:42,320
it's very hard to use the traditional managerial models kind of wink and nod and tell somebody what to do with their discretion.

46
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:52,910
So we also have executive orders. Executive orders amounts to I'm the boss and within the zone of permitted activities under legislation.

47
00:04:53,720 --> 00:05:03,640
Here's what you want to do, dear bureaucrats. So within legislation governing how they're going to hand out money either by the administration, say,

48
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:08,270
Dear bureaucrat, I want you to hand out the money with a strong attention to environmental justice.

49
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:13,069
Or within the zone of immigration law by the Trump administration.

50
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:21,560
Say, Dear bureaucrat, I want you to do your best to use existing immigration law to deter people from entering the United States without documents.

51
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,890
It's probably not on the Trump administration. What president?

52
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:35,690
So the key thing about the executive orders is that they operate within the space left open by the law.

53
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:40,490
Right. So they're kind of third on the list. There's the legislation telling you to do something.

54
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:48,870
Then there's the rulemaking procedure which creates something that is authorized by law but is not a law passed by Congress.

55
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:55,629
That's what we call regulations in American lingo. And then there's executive order, which is within the discretion left by those.

56
00:05:55,630 --> 00:06:02,710
This is what the President would like you to do. Scott what confused under the Trump administration because Trump really liked executive orders.

57
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,340
So he do all these executive orders.

58
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:11,770
He's saying things like, I directed HHS to study all possible ways to undermine and render ineffective the Affordable Care Act.

59
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:19,580
Now, what this plays in the political media is Trump has ordered HHS to undermine the Affordable Care Act.

60
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:26,300
But you can't order HHS to undermine the Affordable Care Act because your tool is an executive order.

61
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:31,790
The Affordable Care Act is a law. The only thing that gets rid of a law is either the Supreme Court or Congress.

62
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:40,040
So actually all he had done is had ordered them to study ways to undermine the ACA, which is a very different proposition.

63
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:44,120
Right. You can study things all day and all night, not change the operation of the law.

64
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,260
So Trump really, really liked executive orders.

65
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:53,660
But if you read a lot of them, what they frequently amounted to was they government lawyers got into there and said,

66
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,080
You cannot use the tool of the executive order to do what you want to do.

67
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:01,670
So instead, the executive order shall instruct the agency to study ways in the future,

68
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:10,040
to make the law work differently, to study ways to deter children from entering the United States and seeking asylum.

69
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,520
Study ways to make the Affordable Care Act go away.

70
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:20,030
Which can actually do it because all you have an executive order is the problem with executive orders is the executive changes.

71
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:28,879
So it's like you had an extraordinarily busy first couple of days of executive orders because essentially really during the transition,

72
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,040
if not before, they'd gone through all the Trump executive orders that were effective and figured out how to reverse.

73
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,760
So took Biden about a week to undo all of Trump's executive orders,

74
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:45,320
just like it took Trump couple of weeks into snap back issues in transition to undo most of Obama's executive orders.

75
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:52,940
So an executive order could be a good thing. But crucially, as soon as the party in office changes, say goodbye.

76
00:07:53,660 --> 00:08:00,250
And if it conflicts the law the law way, there's not even a question. The best example of this is what we call Mexico City policies.

77
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:07,600
Can the United States use foreign aid to support organizations that will refer people for an abortion under law?

78
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:13,330
The Hyde Amendment been around since the seventies. You cannot use federal money to perform an abortion abroad.

79
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:20,690
But can you give money to, say, a clinic, which then will refer you to somebody across the street who will do an abortion?

80
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:27,260
Ronald Reagan executive order passed at a family planning conference in Mexico City in 1984 says no.

81
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,360
Now Clinton comes and says yes. George W Bush comes in, says no.

82
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:39,460
Barack Obama comes in and he prizes no prizes for guessing what happens then, right?

83
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,759
And then Trump comes in, says no, but he delegated it to Mike Pence.

84
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:50,730
So it was a much stricter version that was much more focused on making sure nobody got anywhere near the word abortion.

85
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,260
And of course, Biden came in within 24 hours. He'd signed the thing, reversing all of that.

86
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:59,820
That's the problem with an executive order. If you're Planned Parenthood, is this make it easier to budget.

87
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:12,080
So that's executive orders. I mean, you heard a lot about them in the Trump administration and a lot of it was actually wrong because of what I said.

88
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:17,390
You can't use an executive order to defeat a law, but you can use an executive order to signal you don't like the law.

89
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:25,649
Now regulation rulemaking is what we're going to be talking about primarily today,

90
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:29,370
and that's governed by something called the Administrative Procedures Act, which dates to the 1940.

91
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:39,900
And it is the process through which we propose to discuss legitimate public policy, specific public policy decisions in the United States.

92
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:45,180
And it was written precisely there will be one systematic cross-government way things will be done.

93
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:48,810
So you didn't have one agency behaving one way and another agency behaving another.

94
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:53,400
So if it's a federal administrative procedure, basically it goes under the IPA.

95
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:59,700
Now, this last point matters. All of this involves the basic step.

96
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:08,790
Do you accept that Congress could pass legislation which delegates important decisions based on science or something else to an agency?

97
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:20,940
Congress passes the Clean Air Act, which mandates and allows the EPA to decide what is a threat to the environment through the air.

98
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:30,480
This is something conservatives do not like. Right. Because that gives agencies substantial regulatory discretion.

99
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:37,260
Yes, it's governed by the EPA, but it still fundamentally tells the EPA to look after the environment.

100
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:43,920
And under the Clean Air Act gives them a lot of powers to, for example, mandate removing mercury from coal plants, expensive stuff.

101
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:50,100
That's why the Supreme Court has been going after it, right? This is why I was going on about the major questions doctrine.

102
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:54,960
They have a theory called the non delegation doctrine, which is essentially that all of this is illegitimate.

103
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:59,190
So if the Supreme Court continues on its same trajectory.

104
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:04,980
Much of this is going to go away. And I have no answer to you as to how we then operate.

105
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:12,270
American society as it currently exists. I literally don't because the full application of the non delegation doctrine mean the Congress is going to

106
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:17,760
have to legislate Medicare payment rates for everything full operate like literally like here's the drug,

107
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:22,620
here's the risk adjustment, here's the dollars. You think Congress is going to do that?

108
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:31,110
That's what it would look like. Here's Congress mandating exactly how much people schools in which particular kind of water.

109
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:36,700
Here is Congress deciding exactly what the permissible contents are, you know, clean areas.

110
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,430
It's not going to happen. Not in our Congress and not in any legislature, really.

111
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:49,080
So depending on the extent to which the major questions doctrine is applied, you don't just kneecap the federal government in the regulatory sense.

112
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:57,430
You also, which is what pays for the Federalist Society. You also really I don't know how American society functions.

113
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:02,210
If the FDA, for example, loses the delegated power to evaluate medicines.

114
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:08,140
I just have no idea. By the way, exciting times to use the ACA.

115
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:12,440
Three whole slides of it all.

116
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:19,930
Go home and say how glad you are that you moved to sunny Michigan in order to get three entire slides of the Administrative Procedures Act.

117
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:24,640
But this is one of these cases where politics is about the manipulation of rules.

118
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:30,219
So understanding this is going to matter a lot because a lot of what we glorify is advocacy

119
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:35,500
or whatever it is actually things like figuring out how to participate in the IPA.

120
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:43,150
Let's take it away. And if you don't like these slides, there's a bunch of different descriptions out there or something.

121
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:51,110
Complete. Ask a question, I'll try to answer. So first of all, you start with the Federal Register.

122
00:12:52,070 --> 00:13:00,770
Now the Federal Register is the big online now document in which agencies list out all of the proposals for what they're going to do.

123
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:07,300
They began with the unified agenda. They published a regulatory plan of reform.

124
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:13,030
This is what we're going to do over the next 12 months or so. We are going to address climate change.

125
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:17,280
We're going to address environmental justice to pick two things that the Biden administration's very good to.

126
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:26,979
Then they break that down into specifics. So you get the agenda of regulatory or deregulatory actions, which comes out twice a year as kind of like.

127
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:31,870
Right. So the plans in the fall and then in the spring of the first actions fulfilling that plan.

128
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:38,190
I know. Okay. So you can look at the regulatory plan to get a sense of what's coming on to the agenda.

129
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,340
This is useful, for example, for lobbyists to allocate their budget right.

130
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:46,110
If there's something coming onto the agenda that you like or don't like that you kind of put it in

131
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:50,110
your own workplan that we're going to be spending some time on dealing with this regulatory proposal.

132
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:57,120
Regulation Stopgap is basically the website you want, but there's other places that you can find the stuff.

133
00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:02,170
The Federal Register is like the legally important one. The GPO actually, I suppose, still prints it somehow.

134
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:10,259
So that's the broad outline. Now what happens on the level of the individual rule as it goes into the unified agenda that

135
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:13,340
they're going to do something about this and then they say we're going to do a specific thing.

136
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:19,020
They decided issued a rule, first of all, this informal informational gathering.

137
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:23,630
And you could petition. You could organize. Public. You know you can.

138
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:28,560
You can ask the agency to petition. You can say this is a pollutant that needs attention.

139
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:35,370
But also you can lobby the government, right? You can write to the White House and say, I think you really need to do something about this or that.

140
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:41,520
And a lot of what happens in Washington is precisely figuring out who Cabinet secretary

141
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:47,430
agency had and the White House who has the authority and the interest to regulate,

142
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:52,379
to issue a regulation in the area that you care about. Who's the person who cares about it?

143
00:14:52,380 --> 00:15:01,770
Who's got the authority? Right. So this is all back and targeting, right? So the agency then says we are going to we intended to regulate.

144
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:06,650
We we had intended to do some kind of a regulatory or deregulatory action.

145
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,090
I publish in the Federal Register.

146
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:17,860
They begin with the best cause they think is the advance notice of proposed rulemaking that was begun at the formal consultation.

147
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:22,090
That's why they say this is how we're thinking. They don't just say what they plan to do. They say how we're thinking.

148
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:25,280
And we set up an example in Kansas, but we'll be looking at it before then.

149
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:31,950
So the advance notice of proposed rulemaking says in terms this is what we're trying to achieve,

150
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,410
these are the policy objectives we think we're going to use. What do you think, guys?

151
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,000
And there is an honest element of intellectual inquiry to this.

152
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:48,550
They want America to tell them what's going to happen if they do this, both on the level of I work in the sector and this isn't going to work.

153
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:57,670
And also on the level of hi, I am merely the spearhead of a $45 million lobbying campaign that's about to kick off.

154
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:01,260
And you're going to hate it. What kinds of information are information?

155
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:08,480
So regulatory planning agenda containing specific things.

156
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:13,400
Advance notice of proposed rulemaking begins the formal public consultation.

157
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:22,860
Now the President is boss and has something in the White House called the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.

158
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,050
They're going to be kind of throughout this, right, as the informal process of lobbying the agency,

159
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,840
which doesn't stop just because you trigger the EPA.

160
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:37,220
And there's also the fact that this is by his White House and Biden's preferences and his White House's preference are going to be crucial.

161
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:42,690
Now. The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.

162
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:46,049
LRO is one of the most powerful bits of the federal government you've never heard of.

163
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:49,460
Like if anyone ever offers you a job in the federal government and this is on the list.

164
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:56,620
Take that. Because what their job is is to scrutinize everything that gets proposed.

165
00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:04,360
Every single rule has to go through them so I can sit there in HHS and write up my proposed rule and figure it out.

166
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:11,849
It has to go up to Elvira, gets to decide what to do. It was created by Ronald Reagan because like most of America,

167
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:18,379
that was created by Ronald Reagan and Newt Gingrich in order to make sure that you didn't have agencies full

168
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:22,550
of environmentalists running around regulating business in a way that would unbalance the entire economy.

169
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:30,080
But you didn't have agencies full of feminists running around doing things that would unbalance the family values of the Reagan administration.

170
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:35,809
Right. So it was created precisely to create a chokepoint where everybody would have to talk to Ira.

171
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:41,570
And Elvira's preferred language in a wire would combine technical skills with

172
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:45,650
sensitivity to the president's agenda because it works for the president very directly.

173
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:53,520
This means the entire bureaucracy sold Beck's souls backward. Right before it really gets to the public, you have to make these guys happy.

174
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:59,249
And if they're not happy, regulation is going nowhere. And you're going to be known around the agency as the guy who proposed regulation

175
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:06,660
that got teeth back for no reason because you didn't do your homework. All right. So pay a lot of attention to them and they change with the letter.

176
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:11,700
Biden administration era is not like Obama. Obama like economists a lot more.

177
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:18,389
Biden likes them a lot less. Trump's agency was filled with business people who basically thought that the point of information

178
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:22,440
and regulatory affairs was to limit the amount of excessive regulation being closed on business.

179
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:27,800
And so changes of government. Let's say Mara's given it the nod.

180
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:34,760
We get the proposed rule. Right. So we already had on the previous slide proposed rulemaking.

181
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:41,960
We're going to do something about this. Now we get a proposed rule. Then you get 30, 60 days.

182
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:49,920
You can ask for an extension. Time period can be reopened, which is a sign that something's going wrong somehow with the small politics.

183
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:55,090
You can have public hearings and you can also allow the public to reply to comments, right?

184
00:18:55,100 --> 00:19:03,470
So if there's enough of a storm brewing, you can extend people's ability to be heard by letting commenters comment on each other, essentially.

185
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:09,319
But normally what you get is proposed rule comes up, you propose rulemaking.

186
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:15,970
It's on regulations dot gov. It's in the federal register and you have a month or two months to comment.

187
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:23,680
This is kind of the really crucial thing. You've had two stages already to come and formally even informal opportunities.

188
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:28,140
The White House has had informal opportunities to weigh in. But this is, in a sense, the key event.

189
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:32,299
And this is where if you're a serious player, you've definitely put something in.

190
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:40,100
Right? And then the agency has to read them more precisely, the agency that hires consultants to read them.

191
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:47,809
So I know people who, you know, for example, basically spent their twenties as consultants for some company that HHS hired to read responses to

192
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:53,480
consultations and summarize as the agency is required to pay attention to every single comment,

193
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:59,060
even if you're a total goofball. It's not required, however, to do what you ask.

194
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:04,430
This is an informational thing. This is gathering comments. It's not actually making the decision.

195
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:09,049
So you can comment all you want, but it's not necessarily going to give you the result that you want,

196
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:18,500
because ultimately the agency is constrained by kind of politics, the law that it's enforcing, and the president for whom it currently is working.

197
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:24,890
And I can see the final rule. The agency has the discretion to do that within the law.

198
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:30,410
If you think they violated their discretion, then you can sue and see if you can find a federal judge who agrees with you.

199
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:37,070
And of course, once again, President Zelaya get to sign off and have their opinions beginning to head.

200
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:45,320
So the agency has to operate within the law. Please, the president satisfy a wide array on technical as well as political rounds.

201
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:51,830
Follow the APA meeting, put the notices out and solicit comments and read the comments.

202
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,340
Potentially extend the commenting phase in order to get more comments.

203
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:59,960
And then you get the final rule, which typically kicks in a month or so afterwards.

204
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:06,890
There's exceptions, interim final rule, which is where you publish the final rule without a proposal rule.

205
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:13,190
And you can alter that. There's also the direct final rule, which is for very kind of boring, routine stuff.

206
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:16,130
Like you find out stuff like agricultural prices, what's.

207
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:23,560
And then there are the code of federal federal regulations, which is essentially the secondary body of American law.

208
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:29,760
There's American legislation in the big fat law books, and then there's the CFR, which is all the implementing legislation.

209
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:37,420
So you look at legislation for the Clean Air Act or actual standards on mercury pollution from coal plants.

210
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:47,840
You look at the CFR. So that's the Administrative Procedures Act, which binds the federal government to make it predictable.

211
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:51,050
So you don't have rogue agencies running around doing stuff,

212
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:58,370
which makes it a little bit clearer how when an agency is responding to political pressure from above,

213
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:04,790
which standardizes the language into a sort of hybrid of economics and policy analysis and politics,

214
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:11,170
because everybody has to please OIRA and White House and which allows everybody to see it.

215
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:14,479
Some understanding of what the shape of the politics are surrounding the issue,

216
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,660
ranging from the number of comments through to the kinds of comments that we submitted,

217
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:25,730
are powerful people submitting them as nobody's submitting them? What kinds of arguments are they making, etc., etc.

218
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:31,150
If you work in advocacy or public affairs, this is a big part of what you do.

219
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:37,900
Because if I'm a hospital and I hire a lobbyist, I'm probably doing it because I'm interested in, say, payment for something of the other.

220
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:44,080
And so I'm going to watch the Office of Rural Health and I'm going to watch CNN as I'm going

221
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:49,300
to watch the various parts of HHS that are regulating in a way that affects my bottom line.

222
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:54,340
And I, as a lobbyist, have to show the return on investment of hiring me by going back and saying,

223
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:58,149
here's the comments I did where I think I had some influence and doing the

224
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:00,940
following thing that makes me a good investment for another year of your money.

225
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:06,559
So this is where you find a lot of lobbyists because it's the detailed stuff where it's easy to say,

226
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:10,280
Ah, like you say, Hey, I lobbied for the Affordable Care Act.

227
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:13,579
Everyone's like, Well, that's great. Half of America was engaged with the Affordable Care Act.

228
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:20,270
If you say, Here's the payment thing that I helped influence, that looks a lot more like a pitch that your contract should be extended.

229
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:27,480
This, I hope, gets clear when you actually work with it. But any broad questions?

230
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:37,020
It's not for you. Like I said, if you didn't like my version, there's a lot of sort of timeline of the API stuff online.

231
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:45,420
So if you go back in as much as you do understand this, they don't like with slide put together like there's a lot of just kind of nice infographics.

232
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:52,500
Yes. Or any of the initial proposals like specifically vague terms in the attempt to preserve their discretion.

233
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:56,880
Our initial proposals base to preserve discretion, partly, yes.

234
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:02,650
I mean, I shall say primarily, yes. But there's also the we're trying to achieve a goal.

235
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:09,120
Come on, guys, give us some ideas. And that's partly preserving discretion, in part apparently partly honest to God.

236
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:14,980
Let's get some ideas out there formally into the process so it doesn't look like this thing just sprang forward from my head.

237
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:18,150
It's one thing for you to come tell me an idea in a nice, informal meeting.

238
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:24,300
It's another thing for it to be in a comment where you begin to call it backward and say, We got this comment which suggests this good idea.

239
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:34,810
Yes. I just I understand that like how our regulations are enforced.

240
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:42,610
And that's obviously questioned by through some of the processes and how the regulations are enforced.

241
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,150
This takes many forms, as the government does.

242
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:52,810
So, for example, if you say we're going to pay for a given medicine at a given price.

243
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:57,010
Well, I get a sense that's it. I just make sure the contract has the correct price.

244
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:03,880
If it's about how the United States is going to handle people showing up at the border in various legal conditions,

245
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:10,750
then it's going to go to, well, first of all, from like bureaucrats like CBP, who you hope you can control,

246
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:17,110
combined with people called administrative law judges who are the ones who judge cases based entirely on administrative law.

247
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:21,850
And most of the time when you meet them in anything resembling public press discourse,

248
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:30,060
admin law judges are making decisions about individual cases where you're applying something to the gray area and you find them all the time.

249
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:37,060
You also find in things like disability and social supplement or Social Security adjudication, like, are you disabled enough?

250
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:41,110
Are you indigent enough? Are you refugee enough?

251
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:49,810
I did admit law judges are. Now federal judges, they're essentially bureaucrats whose job is to adjudicate cases.

252
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:56,590
Under the CFR, they don't get to adjudicate cases under the Constitution and even really get to read the original legislation.

253
00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:00,250
They're basically operating within the realm of the CFR to make individual determinations.

254
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:08,830
If it's something like the Clean Air Act or the Clean Water Act, well, then it's like any crime, essentially.

255
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:12,750
So what are the odds that they actually find somebody perpetrating a mistake?

256
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:18,549
Times what are the actual penalties for it? And a lot of the time, the way it works, especially with the environmental ones,

257
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:21,820
is that small time polluters get away with it unless it's really egregious.

258
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:28,570
But if you're a big company, it's easier to actually just comply than it is to, you know,

259
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:33,820
than it is to try and come up with some scheme that's not going to get sussed out by over time.

260
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,330
So in other words, this is many different ways to implement this stuff,

261
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:44,589
as there are policy tools within the federal government and main characters that aren't intuitive to you are the administrative law.

262
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:47,950
Judges, schools and health care environment mostly show up.

263
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:51,010
Making determinations about how to apply eligibility for this is that.

264
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:56,960
You know. Is your cancer actually attributable to the chemicals you had in Vietnam?

265
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:01,960
Yes or no? That kind of question. John Yeah.

266
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:06,160
How much is public comment period? Just kind of a perfunctory thing that they do.

267
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,990
How much is public comment kind of perfunctory?

268
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:17,950
That depends because sometimes it's very clear what they want to do and sometimes you honestly think is, here's the thing, right?

269
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:21,639
Sometimes it's like, I know exactly what I want to do and I've got to go through the motions,

270
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:27,460
because otherwise I have my my power because I didn't follow the right procedures and.

271
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,920
Sometimes it's more. And we have an example of that coming up.

272
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:37,379
Let's actually see if we can kind of get our allies to maybe give us some new ideas formally,

273
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:41,940
but also get it on the record in kind of a process of thinking that's visible on the record.

274
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:45,860
And it's part of why you want to submit some.

275
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:52,400
So if the government does something you like, if there's a proposed rule and you're like, this is great, the temptation is to sit back.

276
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,379
But it might be a good idea to put in. Here's another few reasons why this rule is a good idea,

277
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:05,600
and I encourage you to carry on with it or make it stronger because you're putting things on the record and in government and maybe in all of society.

278
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:10,340
Having put it on the record, even if all you're doing is cheering on your allies is a useful thing to do.

279
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:18,930
So let's do some exercise. Start with a call to use regulation.

280
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:29,240
This is the account. This is basically a blog post about how to use rulemaking to reduce hospital acquired infections so popular on the campus.

281
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:39,830
Talk to someone next to you and take 5 minutes to come up with some reason why this article is an effective piece of health policy advocacy.

282
00:28:48,970 --> 00:29:00,300
I read it. I talked to someone next about this recent article.

283
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:27,410
The things that I do know about all of the articles, the action movies like that.

284
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:32,500
I thought of the saying, yeah, to make these changes.

285
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:35,740
The body is saying this changes its place.

286
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:43,150
I think the thing is, the change that was made in a way that changes things that they're saying, which is.

287
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:48,340
You're right. Yeah, exactly.

288
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:55,210
So anyway, is where it's like that's the demand and problem.

289
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:18,550
And I think that's what I us feel like we're going to have to get rid of the conditions.

290
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:30,850
Right. And they just they're not as interesting as all the possibilities.

291
00:30:31,030 --> 00:31:11,320
Oh, my God. It looks like they're actually going to like it because they do not want to have like I don't know why.

292
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:40,150
Why isn't what they want is this that process of searching for answers to these questions?

293
00:31:47,770 --> 00:32:50,590
I don't think of this it about. I think he said like this is how I feel about grandmothers,

294
00:32:50,680 --> 00:33:28,330
that I thought I was like trying to figure out what was really happy about this is what I want to be given.

295
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:43,370
Yeah. Well, you know, I don't like.

296
00:33:43,420 --> 00:34:13,960
I don't like. It has always been part of it to help them get traction around, oh, okay.

297
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:19,450
This is not the end of the three questions,

298
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:26,950
but the reason that we did this little sort of sub exercise is that this is a nice example of what detailed effective policy advocacy can look like,

299
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:31,500
right? This is the kind of thing that you do as part of a coherent strategy.

300
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:34,780
It's also going to look into the histories of the NPA.

301
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:46,410
So the first question is, what are they trying to do? What is the aim of this piece? And I'll start chucking this thing around.

302
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:53,520
So apologies to anybody who's coffee I am. It seems like they're almost directing public commenters.

303
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,520
Like it seems like a level back from a public comment.

304
00:34:56,610 --> 00:35:03,659
They're like, okay, here's some things that need to be done in the rulemaking to fix this program that's already here to reduce these conditions.

305
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:12,780
And these are just exact examples, basically broad sort of things that you can hone in on as a filmmaker or commenter and get those things in.

306
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:19,200
So anyone else, I think you nailed it there.

307
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:26,930
So and you know, this doesn't have like a great narrative as well other than nobody liking the font.

308
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:36,450
It was president. I saw you describe the school like that, but also notice how it doesn't really read like expectation.

309
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:40,230
It's like, yeah, we all think central line infections are bad. Now what?

310
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:43,670
Well, why is we're making the thing we do love?

311
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:51,000
Because your average doctor, I think, thinks that the solution is to tell the doctors what to do in some form for doctors,

312
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,410
and they take a quite different direction. So why will they be the answer?

313
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:12,420
Sorry. I don't know if I can speak to Dr. Perspective, but I guess from a policy perspective,

314
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:16,110
the solution isn't really policy because there already is a policy in place.

315
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:24,120
So what they're doing is trying to define how to measure outcomes, how to enforce that policy,

316
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:31,840
and how to adjust for risk based on community demographics to kind of tell you what to do.

317
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:44,799
The policy that's already there. You also are talking about how like obviously at an individual level,

318
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:52,330
doctors are thinking choices based on their knowledge about cancer using products at a system level,

319
00:36:52,330 --> 00:37:02,680
there needs to be some sort of standards to look to build their case and assess risk and build the data, but not in this way.

320
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:08,260
So, in other words. I'm sorry. Go ahead. No, no, brother.

321
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:20,120
I mean, it's just I would that I think also the aim is to make make more inequitable as penalizing

322
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:30,700
academic cosmos and not more so if they've redefined the rules for accurate measurement.

323
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:36,040
And never underestimate the ability of academic teaching facilities to top their own game

324
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:41,739
in a way that makes it sound like you're probably really good at some of the words here.

325
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:43,180
We have the reasons they're trying to do it right.

326
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:48,580
You want to do it as a public policy at all because relying on individual doctors to change their practice,

327
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,600
they might not listen to you and be there embedded in large organizations.

328
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:56,919
A lot of the time they show up and there's a situation and you have to change the organization

329
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,430
because of like the response to the situation is going to be the same as what we had last time.

330
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:04,400
There is a policy analysis that and Jonathan pointed out,

331
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:12,040
so the ACA provides a legislative framework and in a sense they've got to do something and they're trying to do something.

332
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:15,350
The problem is it's a bad something, which is why this is rulemaking.

333
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:18,620
This is regulatory discretion. You don't need legislation.

334
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:21,970
Nobody in Congress they do. And you can assume very few to.

335
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:28,370
Nobody in Congress is going to care if you show up with your theory of how to deal with citrulline infections.

336
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:35,389
But it's the job of the agency to care about these matters and to try to get their attention, to say,

337
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:40,640
Hey, this this thing that you're doing is not working in terms of how it's affecting different providers.

338
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:46,880
And it's also not really the way to say trust, which is what is mandated to do and probably also is a good idea in terms of sleeping at night.

339
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:54,230
Now, this wasn't exactly a viral tweet, but it's a very effective piece of writing.

340
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:58,010
It's the kind of writing you want to pay attention to as you think about writing, you know,

341
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:01,730
going into these fields that you're going to do where writing is like 90% of what you do.

342
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:07,200
What do they do that makes this a more visible piece? I'll give you a freebie.

343
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:12,510
It's open access. I'll just.

344
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:15,890
It's short. I was just going to say it's nice and short. It's two pages.

345
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:18,950
It's nice and short. What about the level it's written on?

346
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:29,420
600 hours. Every doctor out there is reading this and I think, yeah, or at least some doctors are likely to read it equally.

347
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:38,860
Federal bureaucrats like you to read some. The relevant ones are going to be aware that Jalla is a politically important platform.

348
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:45,700
Right? Stick at the archives. Internal medicine doesn't have quite as much impact because J.Lo is a relevant platform to do this.

349
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:55,060
And don't underestimate making it open access. Even if you do have access and be surprised so many places don't have access like it's a hassle, right?

350
00:39:55,130 --> 00:40:01,860
Paywall And I got to figure out what the outcomes log in and I do feel a little bit lonely at home with all that experience.

351
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:05,560
Trust me, I have learned what happens if I click external link on canvas.

352
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:11,770
I might as well print it out in the drop for shredder. Okay.

353
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:15,520
So open access. Prominent Journal Short.

354
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:20,890
How about the tone of language? Did you feel like it was very clear what its readers want?

355
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,470
Did you feel like its readers feel like the target audience?

356
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,280
I'm seeing all this really ambiguous, tiny gestures. I can't read the body language.

357
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:40,380
Come on, somebody have a view. Who do you think is the target audience?

358
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:54,139
I mean, I think we are kind of his target audience in part is targeting people who care about public health,

359
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:58,670
people who care about academic medical research, people who care about policy role making.

360
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:02,600
So you got to have some skin in the game to care about what this is saying.

361
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:09,439
So the people in this room probably would care somewhat about reducing hospital acquired infections compared to your

362
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:15,470
general public and hands up if you basically could [INAUDIBLE] heads up if you've ever thought about this issue seriously.

363
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:23,760
Pretty elite. It's like six people in the room.

364
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:28,880
Hands up. If you thought it basically made sense from among the people.

365
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:33,890
Okay, so you can read it even if you don't think about central lines of health care card infections,

366
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:36,120
if you're not sure what that five letter acronym is and so forth.

367
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:42,310
So they're writing it for on exactly the level of this is fundamentally detailed information, right?

368
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:47,610
This is on the front line between administrative law and clinical practice and payment systems and incentives.

369
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:52,770
Right. These are technical areas. But notice that you're not technical specialists in it mostly.

370
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:56,540
And you were able to figure out the policy issue, figure out mistakes like a test.

371
00:41:56,550 --> 00:42:01,680
There's touch points with things that are expert is going to know and a non-expert is just going to have to go read a tool,

372
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,830
Randi, and maybe that can come back around and figure out how that works.

373
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:06,450
Okay.

374
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:15,209
So this was good advocacy, even if it's not what a lot of people think is advocacy or policy writing or even necessarily what we do in policy memos.

375
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:21,180
Because notice that it was written for a specialist audience who was published in a specialist location.

376
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:25,710
It was done in a way that's directed to the clear target audience. That's all good targeting.

377
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,480
That's policy, right? Also writing doesn't always mean one thing.

378
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:36,470
Targeting doesn't always mean one thing. And this is a really nice example. I think it was specifically targeted at the rulemaking process.

379
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:43,570
So let's do this. Let's take another one.

380
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:51,690
And this is quite a different way to get out of. This is where I do it online and I do something really stupid and I put it all up on the screen.

381
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:56,840
We all kind of wonder how I managed to get my job. The Mentalist comes with it.

382
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:05,320
So we start with. Start with was on normal using chrome.

383
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:25,350
So first of all, you use Google, which is very helpful.

384
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:30,050
Now let's do climate change. Let's actually let's do environmental justice.

385
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:57,040
So which keywords is the main thing you need to? If you ever have a terrible enemy, give them this key word or phrase.

386
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:05,180
Okay. Let's see that.

387
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:12,249
So we have a tabs up there right now, the one that you most want to pay attention to in order to make sense of this is the dockets,

388
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:21,550
because right now it's sent of all documents and you will observe 60,000 things you can read, which I'll give you two weeks.

389
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:28,510
So instead of the docket is basically like you can imagine a physical folder in Europe,

390
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:36,510
these things are called dossiers, which literally is the French. Go over to the docket and here we see what's going on in environmental protection.

391
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:38,190
This organizes them all together.

392
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:44,940
You still got the same 60,000 things, but now they're organized in a way that allows you to use the filters to make it a lot more sensible.

393
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:51,570
Now, because I happen to know what we're looking for. Let's see what the Council on Environmental Quality is talking about.

394
00:44:54,610 --> 00:45:00,730
If we have it now, we'll make it right. So they're not making a formal rule that's going to have enforceability.

395
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:05,660
But instead, they're going to create something. They're going to create environmental justice for her.

396
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:12,310
So I go over there now. And we brought the documents right.

397
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:16,860
And here's the request for information where they said, hey, tell us stuff.

398
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,410
And this is the earlier one. That's an earlier version of it.

399
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:27,210
So you'll probably go to the later version and there you find, what is it?

400
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:33,150
It extended here. They've extended the notice period since we uploaded the thing.

401
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:39,840
So that over here this is the core of what they extended the notice period, quite possibly because they wanted more time.

402
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:45,329
Next time you go over it, this is actually you notice here's the person he would talk to,

403
00:45:45,330 --> 00:45:51,840
but obviously you don't want to phone up, you know, early unless you actually are rational and have something sensible to say.

404
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:56,790
And, you know, roughly the rules for contacting federal officials without causing trouble.

405
00:45:57,450 --> 00:46:01,350
And then it's going to explain what it does. Okay. And here's the questions they're posing.

406
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:06,020
So here's where they tell you what they're trying to achieve a robust and comprehensive assessment

407
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:09,349
of the federal government's efforts to address current and historic environmental injustice,

408
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:17,550
including injustice, for instance. And then does this vision reflect the needs and priorities of communities that face environmental injustices?

409
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:24,520
So there's the core document, right? This is the RFI where they want to know how to assemble their scorecards.

410
00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:30,360
So let's look at the comments. Super Anonymous.

411
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:35,550
Anonymous is frequently good. I apologize that this turns out to be some like, horrific racism or something.

412
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:46,400
Okay. It doesn't look like it is. Look at this if you think I can write that [INAUDIBLE].

413
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:55,670
But that's Sharmila. Murthy has had hired a consultant who has to read it and summarize it.

414
00:46:55,670 --> 00:47:00,049
It has to be able to explain how you got a response to it. And frankly,

415
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:06,260
it's a good point for people who don't understand the restoration kind require temporary treatments like tree removal to get long term benefits,

416
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:10,219
replanted trees with more diversity and habitat stability would like the scorecard

417
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:13,640
to address what role the public should play in specific design decisions.

418
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:17,959
Okay, this is somebody is feeding something and you say, oh, I can write that.

419
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:22,370
Well, did you and you say, Do they thought about that?

420
00:47:22,370 --> 00:47:26,300
Is the answer as well necessarily? Do they think about it? Do they think about it on the level of decision?

421
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:30,290
We actually do have regular fights about tree planting, right? We think tree planting is great.

422
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:34,440
Managing trees is not that easy. Okay.

423
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:40,340
So this is what it looks like. I also point out this is a big deal potentially.

424
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:45,889
This thing is going to underpin like half the classes in the School of Public Health.

425
00:47:45,890 --> 00:47:48,350
This is going to drive a lot of people's grant proposals.

426
00:47:48,770 --> 00:47:53,810
It's going to drive nonprofit funding decisions, it's going to drive government funding decisions.

427
00:47:54,110 --> 00:48:01,130
It's potentially going to start to turn into something that gets put into administrative law in the legislation as an actual policy objective.

428
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:11,270
And we have 14 comments. So this is your opportunity to be a big fish in a small pond.

429
00:48:13,870 --> 00:48:20,040
Back over. So go find it on your own device.

430
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:35,500
And so these three questions. At the end of which you will see a request to find something to respond to in your second policy memo,

431
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:40,540
and you will have thought about what constitutes an effective use of that assignment.

432
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:47,410
And remember, we want you to write like in real life, like in real life.

433
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:50,080
I'm not teaching at the moment.

434
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:55,930
I also have a class where you write letters to the editor, and my back of the envelope is that about 10 million people were exposed to things.

435
00:48:55,960 --> 00:49:02,860
Recommendation B 685 So yeah, it is amazingly easy to show up and discover you have a role in policy.

436
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:08,530
That's one of the better points for this entire thing. You don't get something in the Supreme Court, but you can be the 50th commenter.

437
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:17,950
Why do I get the feeling that my exhortation to participate more fully in American civic life backfired?

438
00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:23,590
Roaring laughter okay, so go find it.

439
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:26,860
You're roughly what I did typed better than I did,

440
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:48,479
and answer those questions about 10 minutes actually with my research by services agency to go over there.

441
00:49:48,480 --> 00:50:26,540
There's this request from was based on you know yeah I guess I did so yeah so I think that's all it is more of a big problem

442
00:50:29,560 --> 00:51:08,030
as you were thinking about what you were trying to figure out what you think that it was in 2003 when I was younger.

443
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:21,960
And that's what I find the right place because I don't know.

444
00:51:22,390 --> 00:51:30,340
I was I was just standing there.

445
00:51:33,970 --> 00:51:47,410
I was like, oh, this is but I don't have a lot of drama.

446
00:51:47,410 --> 00:52:05,950
And the show was actually some great synopsis, for that matter, out of your soul to start evolving into.

447
00:52:05,950 --> 00:52:07,380
So it's like, okay.

448
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:38,260
So I thought that I had no idea where you are more, I'm more like, you're not going to get to be with this group within the guidelines.

449
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:49,800
It's really not right for you.

450
00:52:51,800 --> 00:53:02,250
And you don't like you're like, but I know how it is.

451
00:53:03,550 --> 00:53:25,390
So you've only got 2 hours now, so it's not like you have to take notes from.

452
00:53:32,540 --> 00:54:31,990
To notice. I used to tell my son, that's not a good choice and it doesn't provide you with all those things you need to find people.

453
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:37,680
That's my business. That's me.

454
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:53,380
Now that's on the other side of the stage.

455
00:54:56,050 --> 00:55:02,830
What makes it more challenging? I was like, Hey, Mom, how? They're going to give me my dad's advice?

456
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:11,980
And she's like, There's like, one of your cousins, but it's uncivilized.

457
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:16,750
I tried to call her. Yeah.

458
00:55:17,650 --> 00:55:26,530
I called her, and I was like, Hey, I'm doing what you said.

459
00:55:27,370 --> 00:55:38,410
Oh, yeah? Well, you can tell me how to do it.

460
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:42,470
I was like, Do I need to get out?

461
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,360
I was like, Oh, I know you do this like this.

462
00:55:50,350 --> 00:56:05,020
This is like, don't complain that there's a see to like I get like, I guess I don't know the public.

463
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:12,520
I'm 13 years old, my dad or 87.

464
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:19,810
I answer yes.

465
00:56:20,650 --> 00:56:32,070
I think like I feel like I'm like I'm like, oh, yeah.

466
00:56:34,870 --> 00:56:47,400
Like I'm not like, you know, this like, but I know you're not so much at all.

467
00:56:47,410 --> 00:57:10,330
And yeah, right now, right now there are all kinds, you know, it's almost like sort of makes it look like I am going to make you guys,

468
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:24,190
I'm going to give them some really bad stuff while I'm thinking because I just started off like, okay, that's good.

469
00:57:25,330 --> 00:57:56,410
So I think I you about, you know, it's just so strong and he's just like, I don't want any reason person is going to be mine.

470
00:57:56,850 --> 00:58:15,370
That was interesting to me. Don't you know, like, they just don't it?

471
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:25,420
Thank you for coming in public.

472
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:50,150
People are getting in touch with us right now.

473
00:58:51,790 --> 00:59:12,450
I have no idea how to talk about all of this.

474
00:59:13,070 --> 00:59:18,380
I like the ones that have the question, is this association world?

475
00:59:19,370 --> 00:59:32,510
Is there anything that you would like to know?

476
00:59:34,910 --> 01:00:10,130
But I do agree that this is this is one of the big issues.

477
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:15,790
Okay. Yeah.

478
01:00:15,950 --> 01:00:21,500
That's what I was like. You know, I didn't look at it differently.

479
01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:22,730
I was grabbing it.

480
01:00:22,790 --> 01:01:20,180
Rather did not realize that that's all I got was like, I realized, well, I really couldn't look everybody every question, 6 minutes go.

481
01:01:22,910 --> 01:01:28,520
What's the point? What are we trying to do here? This is the Biden administration trying to do here.

482
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:43,540
I was dumbfounded. I totally intended to bounce it between the two.

483
01:01:43,550 --> 01:01:59,930
Not only everyday looks like the ones that are federal actions that seek to supplant injustice falls by doing less and giving a score.

484
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:06,540
Anybody want to jump in on this one? Why? This would be how you would achieve environmental justice.

485
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:16,360
Can you trust the last word to you keeping it away?

486
01:02:16,430 --> 01:02:21,639
I think we're going to have a fun game. Basically,

487
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:26,860
you're identifying the score in order to identify areas that need improvement in areas

488
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:33,730
that are affecting communities that have been affected by environmental concerns.

489
01:02:34,270 --> 01:02:37,270
So let's measure just what's managed. Where are we going to direct our attention?

490
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:43,330
And we're going to try and focus it toward people who have historically not been well represented in this decision making process.

491
01:02:43,990 --> 01:02:49,330
So some of you really like comments. Anybody see a comment where you're like, This is really useful?

492
01:02:50,620 --> 01:02:55,390
I'm looking provocatively over at the side of the room. Yeah. Okay. So let's go ahead.

493
01:02:55,450 --> 01:03:03,040
So we found one that was from the early deployment task force, climate task force.

494
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:14,920
And so they had a really thorough response where they kind of broke down different aspects of the of the proposed scorecard that they liked,

495
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:19,089
because what they were saying is that they were they really needed to specify,

496
01:03:19,090 --> 01:03:22,659
like, who would be the individuals that they would be collaborating with.

497
01:03:22,660 --> 01:03:26,180
And that's one of the things that they suggested doing.

498
01:03:26,230 --> 01:03:32,030
The scorecard was they were saying that there needs to be some sort of way to make sure that there are being represented,

499
01:03:32,050 --> 01:03:41,020
that they have expertize that would be helpful in this scoring. And then they broke it down and that the vision, the framework of engagement,

500
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:49,530
they were really saying that they wanted to have young children and pregnant people and other people that are more at risk represented.

501
01:03:49,540 --> 01:03:54,070
And so that was something that they really wanted to do and they wanted to emphasize.

502
01:03:54,090 --> 01:03:58,390
And then, yeah, that was kind of their big thing, especially since in their early childhood,

503
01:04:00,070 --> 01:04:03,350
I notice a lot of this is unintuitive because I want to pick up some of them later.

504
01:04:03,550 --> 01:04:14,380
This the Columbus had to contribute. I don't want to speak of like, okay, the dentist.

505
01:04:14,390 --> 01:04:29,110
Yes. The dentistry, the better than the plumbers. Yes. So I actually thought that might be pretty informative is the target audience.

506
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:38,170
And then there's a type of building materials that mercury is actually 50% mercury,

507
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:45,400
and it's predominantly used in low socioeconomic populations and communities of color.

508
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:52,120
And a lot of people don't even know that the mercury in their home and the federal government is like the largest purpose of it,

509
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:56,230
and they don't regulate it. So it's purely up to the discretion of the business.

510
01:04:56,590 --> 01:05:00,459
So they talk about how they should be included within that scorecard,

511
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:06,120
because it would be kind of like the disparity impact it has on black communities.

512
01:05:07,210 --> 01:05:13,270
So those we have two things going on here, right? One is a sort of broad how should you structure this process to represent my constituents?

513
01:05:13,780 --> 01:05:16,810
And here is a we have a problem. This is the problem.

514
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:21,760
This is a relevant opportunity for parliament. And we are going to comment about the problem that motivates us.

515
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:25,679
And again, you know, this is the stuff slower than anybody else.

516
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:33,010
Someone like if you want to discriminate against the side of the fence, we can talk about one that was not well written.

517
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:38,470
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

518
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:48,250
We're looking at the comment by Stephen Smith and he basically says that this and other efforts regarding

519
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:52,629
environmental justice are kind of productive because it has enforcement in environmental justice.

520
01:05:52,630 --> 01:05:58,090
Communities can deter businesses for wanting to do business there, which is not a valid point at all.

521
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:01,870
But he kind of just said, well, don't do this. And it's really oppressive.

522
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:06,550
It doesn't talk about like if they're going to do a scorecard, how to make sure that doesn't happen.

523
01:06:06,910 --> 01:06:13,570
As the idea is that and if you're a bureaucrat faced with this, like, what do you do?

524
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:18,579
You say, oh, well, you noticed we are aware of the incentives that you discuss and will attempt to come up with the scorecard.

525
01:06:18,580 --> 01:06:25,719
What's going to be termed as the single handedly. So what I want you to take away, first of all, is you've now successfully all navigated.

526
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:27,850
So you have no excuses that you didn't know what was happening.

527
01:06:28,170 --> 01:06:33,400
To see if your fancy The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, you know exactly what happens if you don't pay attention to consultations.

528
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:45,239
It was highly recommended in its time and you have examples of some really nice ones don't just like

01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:50,250
immediately take the unions or the coalfield alliance and transform them into your policy memo.

530
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:53,520
But now you've looked at it and something that you're not writing on.

531
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:59,550
Probably it's like now you have a much better sense of what constitutes a good response to an RFI in this case.

532
01:06:59,790 --> 01:07:06,870
Okay, so there's a bunch of competent models here and it's like, don't be the anonymous commentator who just talked about trees, right?

533
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:11,400
Look like one of the ones where clearly they paid a probe. And there's one other point to take away.

534
01:07:12,390 --> 01:07:15,240
Smart people put a lot of effort into this. They didn't do it by accident.

535
01:07:16,020 --> 01:07:19,140
So it's part of the answer as to whether it matters and whether your input matters.

536
01:07:20,070 --> 01:07:24,240
The lobbyists, the lawyers don't come to you because. Okay.

537
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:42,590
Have fun shaping public policy for each country, not just as a talk show.
