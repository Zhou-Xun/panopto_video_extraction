1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:06,510
Like children and teenagers and stuff like that.

2
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:13,330
So they. It's like that?

3
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:20,160
Yeah. Why are we here?

4
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,330
I don't know, but. Oh, he's about to leave us early for, like.

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:31,600
Sorry. I mean, like, it was like a different time.

6
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,590
You were like, oh, right.

7
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:46,870
I do something like he was going to make friends or something.

8
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,260
Yeah, well, I should say class.

9
00:00:53,460 --> 00:01:10,160
It was pretty good. All of the noise. I don't see any way around because I think it was really great to see him.

10
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:14,250
Yeah, it's like.

11
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,060
I think it makes sense, you know what I mean?

12
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:28,790
That's no excuse for.

13
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:37,160
Yeah, something like that.

14
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:41,970
And I'm just keeping. But I'm not supposed to do.

15
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:50,489
A clue where there was a church somewhere.

16
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,380
I was. I just wasn't even there.

17
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:09,300
And like I said, to sit down, you know, we're not started.

18
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,179
The winters are upon us now.

19
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:20,260
So you all know at this point it's a lot more cloudy days.

20
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,750
And so for George the other day, like today, if we can get out.

21
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:26,349
Today.

22
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:35,710
I'm going to pick up where I started, where I stopped, and then we're going to talk about the quiz quiz number nine that you all have taken earlier.

23
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:42,610
So when we last stopped, we were talking about drugs used to treat hypertension.

24
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:51,090
A diuretic might be prescribed, and this drug pretty much takes care of the blood volume issue.

25
00:02:51,090 --> 00:03:01,350
In other words, if you're excreting more sodium in water, that's what this does, is that it lowers volume, lowering peripheral vascular resistance.

26
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:06,510
It can also affect cardiac output as well through other mechanisms.

27
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:16,560
So if you have a lower blood volume, lower your blood pressure and or different types of diuretics that might be used.

28
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:32,460
I uploaded this paper that says, yes, I read actually patients with hypertension.

29
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,730
In case you're are interested in what's really taking a deep dive.

30
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:47,409
So this particular figure shows you where all the different types of diuretics work, which types of pumps are affected by different types of.

31
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:52,830
But you have the inside stuff, the diabetics and so on.

32
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,540
We talk about hypertension and your medical nutrition therapy course yet.

33
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,960
So you have to have. So you seen some of this.

34
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:13,020
Okay, that's fine. Yeah. So after that, you have the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.

35
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:19,600
These are the drugs that prevent this enzyme from converting and angiotensin, again, cancer attempts.

36
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:28,680
And and then this is a drugs that will have certain side effects that will not allow certain people to take it.

37
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:37,110
Even it causes a dry cough. Um, there are the newer drugs, these are the angiotensin two receptor blockers.

38
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:43,530
And these, um, I believe are the ones that are more prescribed nowadays.

39
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:53,100
There are calcium channel blockers that can be used. There are better adrenergic receptor blockers that can be used.

40
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:59,670
And many people who are being treated for hypertension,

41
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:04,710
it's not unusual for them to have a combination of different drugs to treat their hypertension,

42
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:08,610
depending on how well they respond to different types of medication.

43
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:16,330
Yeah. The calcium channel. So this just target like cardiac output or.

44
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:21,460
Yeah. So what that's going to do, it's going to affect the force of contractility in the heart.

45
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:27,430
So that's going to affect cardiac output through that mechanism.

46
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:31,750
I just wasn't sure if that had to do also with renal function.

47
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:43,989
So it's that it's the greatest effect is going to be in the heart in terms of having having peripheral effects in the kidney.

48
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,420
I can't remember. Okay.

49
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:57,579
So just remember that you use the different drugs that are used to treat and targets and in terms of other complications that might arise,

50
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:06,970
in terms of nutritional modification, it might be with the diuretics, depending on whether you're taking a potassium sparing drug or not.

51
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:17,880
So to summarize, hypertension is a highly prevalent condition with several risk factors, including obesity.

52
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:26,670
Several mechanisms can which exist that it possibly can affect hypertension.

53
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,300
And I walk through a number of these,

54
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:42,330
and one of the first things that you try to do before you prescribe somebody a drug for hypertension is to have them try a lifestyle modification.

55
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:48,300
But this is kind of the foundation to all treatments for hypertension.

56
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:55,410
There's lifestyle modification and pharmacotherapy that are used to lower people's blood pressure chronically.

57
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:04,530
So any questions before we move on and talk about the quiz of what we talked about in terms of hypertension?

58
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:12,180
So if you've had hypertension in your medical nutrition therapy course, this is hopefully a review for most of you.

59
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:24,870
So moving on to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease or apple.

60
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:32,580
Let's talk about the quiz first. So the quiz is on diabetes, hypertension.

61
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:41,460
I have two diabetes questions and one is hypertension. And the first question is in regard to this individual, Michael.

62
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,900
He has a blood glucose level. This is a fast and blood glucose of one of five.

63
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,760
Based on this assessment assessment, which is the following statements listed below is true.

64
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:59,760
And the correct answer was he has prediabetes. Most of you have got all of these questions correct, including this one.

65
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:14,010
I'm not here to. Increased serum free fatty acids can contribute to insulin resistance and muscle to which of the following pathways listed below.

66
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:23,080
So the correct answer was the first one shown here to an accumulation of potassium glycerol.

67
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:29,950
Remember, this was the tablet that interrupts its on receptor signaling.

68
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:33,760
And as a consequence of this interruption,

69
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:42,520
you have decreased the amount of four that can translocate through the cell membrane and mediate glucose uptake.

70
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:48,910
And all of the others have something, some part of the answer wrong with them.

71
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:56,410
So for this one, it leads to an accumulation of dinosaur cholesterol, which is true, and disrupts insulin receptor signaling,

72
00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:01,690
which is true and impairs glycogen centers, but it promotes glucose output from the muscle.

73
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:07,630
No, that's that's important. That went wrong. It leads to the accumulation of intramuscular subsides.

74
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:11,620
That's true. And promotes autophagy, increased glucose output.

75
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:17,740
That's not true for muscle autophagy. It's an issue it related to the pancreas.

76
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:30,130
And then finally, three fatty acids activate the receptor for advanced glycation products that promote intravascular damage and insulin resistance.

77
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:42,460
This mechanism pertains to the, um, the rage receptor, the receptor for advanced glycation products, which has to do with location and hyperglycemia.

78
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:53,790
And then finally, the question is about hypertension secrets.

79
00:09:54,080 --> 00:10:01,010
Serum levels from boxes were found to be significantly elevated in subjects with obesity relative to lean individuals.

80
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:11,560
How would this affect blood pressure? The correct answer here is that it would increase blood pressure, and that's because on Boxing Day.

81
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:19,760
So constrictor and it's going to increase peripheral vascular resistance, which is going to increase blood pressure.

82
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,670
Okay. Does anybody have any questions about the quiz questions?

83
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:40,040
So for learning objectives today, I want you to be able to understand, describe the prevalence,

84
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:44,930
the spectrum of the disease, how it's diagnosed, and what are the risk factors.

85
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:53,010
So in order to understand this underlying mechanisms, understanding this is really important.

86
00:10:53,010 --> 00:11:05,719
So I want you to be able to identify mechanisms related to metabolic syndrome that promote hepatic lipid accumulation and describe

87
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:15,620
the path physiology associated with the disease progression from simple the intestines to cirrhosis to passing the carcinoma,

88
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:22,470
and then your objective to describe treatment and management.

89
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:37,590
So earlier we talked about your bathtub as an analogy of your ability to safely store excess triglycerides in your body in the adipose tissue.

90
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:50,550
If you overload your tissues and the analogy here is seeing a bathtub filling up with water overflowing, causing a soggy bathroom mat.

91
00:11:51,720 --> 00:12:05,910
So in this example, you have increased energy intake and decreased energy expenditure or inadequate energy expenditure to keep the level of water low.

92
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:14,850
The rim of the bathtub. You're exceeding the capacity of the bathtub to have to store those sort of water.

93
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,649
In the case of adipose tissue,

94
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:24,030
it's the inability to safely store triglycerides and preventing them from leaking over to other tissues, including the liver.

95
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:36,270
So in this analogy, the liver would fill up with naturally a I should say would accumulate excess triglycerides causing snaffled.

96
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:48,670
Now, if you have an issue where you have your bathtub, your capacity to buffer lipids, small things can happen as well.

97
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:55,890
So you don't have to have obesity. You have now you might have an impairment in the ability to store these triglycerides safely.

98
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:03,720
And besides. So what's snaffled?

99
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:07,140
What is? It's actually a spectrum.

100
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:17,760
So nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is a term and it's used to describe a number of different types of disorders that are related.

101
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:23,220
The first of which is paddock's ketosis.

102
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:37,310
And here's a normal liver down here, and it's this rich, brownish reddish color as lipids accumulate in the liver may turn a Chandler yellow color.

103
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:44,580
And that's because of the deposition of lipid vacuoles within the liver.

104
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:54,569
So this particular condition can be harmless or it can affect liver function.

105
00:13:54,570 --> 00:14:02,580
And it progressed to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis or Nash shown here.

106
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:16,830
And you see a picture of a yellowish liver and then you see this connective tissue which is collagen forming within the liver.

107
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:24,480
And this represents the development of scar tissue and the process of fibrosis that occurs

108
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:32,190
as a consequence of this simple steatosis and a pro-inflammatory response that can occur.

109
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:45,840
This can progress to cirrhosis, where you get a significant star in the liver, you get a reduced liver function as a consequence of this.

110
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:57,330
And the cirrhosis can progress to a of cellular carcinoma when you have here liver cancer arising from this preexisting condition.

111
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:06,120
I'm going to walk you through a number of images so you can see how this what this looks like.

112
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:19,590
So, first of all, let's talk about the prevalence. So it's natural is the most common liver disorder in the U.S. that affects this function.

113
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:27,450
And I recently updated this source about it affects about 25% of the adult population globally.

114
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:34,620
And it's been estimated that about 80 million Americans in the United States have snaffled.

115
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:40,050
And if you have access to positive, you have a higher BMI.

116
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:49,140
It is likely that you have Netflix of 75% of the population with a BMI greater than 35 have an apple.

117
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:59,610
90 to 95% of the population you have this class three obesity or a BMI of 40 and over, you are likely to have this condition.

118
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:04,560
Again, you don't have to have access to positive.

119
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:11,680
This condition also occurs in children.

120
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:16,680
So two and a half percent of all children have natural.

121
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:24,020
And the risk of this increases in children who have obesity, not 23 to 53%.

122
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:31,180
Children with obesity have an adult, usually in the form of simple steatosis.

123
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:39,089
So let's go through it tells us how is this diagnosis made, what does it look like?

124
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:47,430
And so on. So we're talking about the paddock's triglyceride levels that exceeds the 95th percentile in healthy individuals,

125
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:53,520
or it's most often most accurately diagnosed by a liver biopsy.

126
00:16:53,520 --> 00:17:04,920
And this is only done if there's significant complications associated with suspected liver disease.

127
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:13,530
So they take a liver biopsy and they look at the amount of triglycerides within a sample.

128
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:22,320
So if there's more than 55 milligrams per gram of liver that's taken out by this biopsy,

129
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:31,650
or if they have 5% of the hepatocytes that show lipid droplets, we get a diagnosis for hepatic ptosis.

130
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:37,790
At this stage, the disease is fully reversible.

131
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,640
It might not have any symptoms associated. You might have normal liver function.

132
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:50,230
So this is not the case with this the first part of this disease or that,

133
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:56,900
but it can progress to a more serious condition where it affects function in terms of NASH.

134
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:06,210
So there are other ways to quantify triglyceride content, but they're not as good.

135
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:10,220
The gold standard is the biopsy. The biopsy is invasive.

136
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:13,820
There are complications associated with the biopsy.

137
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:26,570
So a number of new noninvasive diagnostic tests have been proposed for use, and the reading discussed a few of them.

138
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:41,930
So the noninvasive tests essentially are the density of the liver and they are using different techniques to assess that noninvasively.

139
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:54,980
So if you have a condition in which it never seems to be progressing, affecting somebody's hepatic function, then it might do a biopsy.

140
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:06,770
Another way to non-invasively test liver function is to just look for this enzyme in the blood alanine aminotransferase and our amino transferase.

141
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:15,349
If they're elevated, it could indicate that you have hepatic statuses you could use to explain the second bullet point.

142
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:18,830
I'm a little confused by this. Yeah.

143
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:27,920
So if you take a biopsy of the liver, one gram biopsy, let's say you have one gram of tissue,

144
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:34,520
it is that tissue and list right there exceeds 55 milligrams.

145
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,850
That indicates process.

146
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:51,830
Or if you take that step biopsy and you prepare a logical section, you look for the level of ballooning or these lipid inclusions within that biopsy.

147
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:55,580
And more than 5% of hepatocytes have this appearance.

148
00:19:55,970 --> 00:20:06,110
You also have a diagnosis for that condition that came from the children on the last slide that we were talking about.

149
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:10,310
How come it's like a lower percentage of children with obesity is there?

150
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:14,839
Because it looks like it could be more than half of them would not have obesity.

151
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:25,129
So I was just wondering why that might be. So why would it lower percentage in like 75% or at least compared to adults?

152
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:28,250
Seems like more a higher price is more correlated.

153
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:35,329
So with children you have lower levels of other types of co-morbidities associated with the condition.

154
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:43,580
So children with obesity do get type two diabetes, but the percentage is much smaller and perhaps that would explain.

155
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:46,010
So there are other things that can contribute to the condition.

156
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:52,670
The other thing could be time, the time at which they've achieved a certain level of that excess adiposity.

157
00:20:53,570 --> 00:21:04,550
So and then other factors associated with that. But the limiting factor here is the diagnostic procedure.

158
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:10,340
Doing an invasive biopsy in an adult is complicated enough to have a child.

159
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:16,960
Unless they had significant impairments or an elevation in their liver enzymes, then you would tend to.

160
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:29,170
So in the paper it gave you some examples of noninvasive tests.

161
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:38,160
And here you have on the very top, you have this image that's false colored.

162
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:45,480
In other words, you're taking in this case, it's a protein proton density fraction of that fraction.

163
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:59,280
And here is a PDF for proton density fat fraction of about 10% in the liver of this individual who has a very high BMI of 44.

164
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:06,540
And then this individual that are undergoing an intervention to reduce their BMI,

165
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:16,590
and they're following this one individual through this course, and they're able to find less proton density, fat fraction.

166
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:27,000
So this individual is improving in terms of reducing the amount of lipid in their liver as a consequence of this reduction in their body.

167
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:35,130
So that's one case, the proton density, that fraction. There are some other tests that are done.

168
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:44,940
Here's a sheer weight. A last stop. The last holography is essentially putting a soundwave in someone's through someone's liver.

169
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:50,940
And they're looking at the speed at which the soundwave deflects off of the tissues.

170
00:22:53,390 --> 00:23:02,390
Magnetic resonance. Less stock stock wifi can also be used to assess the different densities within the liver,

171
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:15,980
and these are different types of what are used to assess the structural characteristics of the letter without actually taking a biopsy.

172
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:26,570
There are strengths and weaknesses in all of these. They aren't as good as the gold standard, which would be the biopsy.

173
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:33,740
But if you have a large number of people who may have elevations in their liver

174
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:38,810
enzymes and they might have signs and symptoms of declining liver function,

175
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:53,840
these types of tests might be done. So as the disease process progresses, you can develop this nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis or Nash.

176
00:23:54,770 --> 00:24:00,380
And again, we start to see some college and deposition, some fibrosis occurring here.

177
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:07,430
And it's the injury of the hepatocytes that distinguishes it from simple steatosis.

178
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,450
So the cells might have this appearance.

179
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:19,730
I've got a picture of that later on in the estimates that looks like.

180
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:32,450
So there's more lipid accumulating in the parasite causing injury associated with that learning you have an increase in.

181
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:39,680
Mentioned collagen deposition, perhaps inflammatory cells associated with that.

182
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:48,769
And it's unknown whether or not your ptosis always progresses to Nash and why that happens.

183
00:24:48,770 --> 00:25:00,860
It's not clear and it can progress to a more serious condition where you get a significant impairment in liver function,

184
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:06,530
perhaps leading to the need for a liver transplant in the form of cirrhosis.

185
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:18,060
So only 10 to 29% of people who have Nash go on to develop cirrhosis within a ten year period of time.

186
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:22,530
And there are some hypotheses as to why that occurs.

187
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:27,440
But exactly what is the uncertainty?

188
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:40,070
The next step in the progression is hepatic cirrhosis and you have a significant

189
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:45,050
replacement of functional hepatocytes with scar tissue and type one collagen.

190
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:50,809
And it's the initial stem cells within the liver,

191
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:58,400
the stem cells that instead of becoming new hepatocytes in response to injury, they become fiberglass.

192
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:07,280
Fiberglass produced collagen. And collagen does it because it have this the functions of the hepatocyte and

193
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:14,030
this is thought to be the process in which the disease progression occurs.

194
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:22,549
So collagen is produced by the stem cells to activate cellular injury and the

195
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:27,080
cell in cells would normally regenerate and the injured tissue in the liver.

196
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:32,960
But in this case, it's the sites are being replaced with nonfunctional tissue.

197
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:42,290
And this condition can ultimately regress to cancer that had a cellular carcinoma.

198
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:52,790
And about 4 to 20% of individuals with NASH induced cirrhosis develop a parasite of carcinoma of scar tissue.

199
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:58,280
It happens with Nash also. Nash, you had some scar tissue formed.

200
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,820
It's more severe into cirrhosis.

201
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:06,580
It's more, more pronounced. And I'll show you what it looks like here in a moment.

202
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:11,030
Nash, can we go back to feelings about the liver?

203
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:21,830
I don't know if you can actually completely restore liver tissue appearance back to a simple bar

204
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:27,770
of a simple steatosis because once the college in is deposited within liver tissues in general,

205
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:31,970
that has a tendency to be preserved over long time.

206
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:41,990
Yeah. Yeah. And I think like your diagram from slide four has like a conversion between the two.

207
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:47,719
So. Oh, I see what you're saying. It also said that there was possible.

208
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:51,370
It was possible. Yeah. Yeah. Yes.

209
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:57,590
But in terms of the the degree of scarring, I'm not sure if that's that's going to.

210
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:02,540
In other words, you can have so that it's the stem cells that dictate the health of the liver.

211
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:11,389
So if you have the, like cells now instead of becoming fibroblasts, you're going to maintain that level of scarring.

212
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:16,070
But instead of forming new fiberglass, you forming healthy parasites.

213
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:19,760
And in that sense, yeah, it can, it can be reversible.

214
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:29,720
But the level of college and deposition, I don't know if that ever goes back to a baseline level from that just it appears that like if you have,

215
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:33,440
like if you have a low level, it might, you might be a little bit,

216
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:40,610
but then once it advances past a certain stage, that's going to depend on the level of inflammation.

217
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:45,919
A key step and progressing is the inflammatory pathways.

218
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:51,110
If they're activated, it's likely to shift more to a Nash type of a progression.

219
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:09,230
Yeah, it's caused by hepatitis. So you could have a viral hepatitis?

220
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:17,120
Yes. And that can cause liver disease. But this is in the absence of of viral hepatitis or alcoholic hepatitis.

221
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:24,740
This is nonalcoholic. No, we call it let's call it the kind is what you'll see.

222
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:30,890
So that's a viral infection that affects the liver. This is something that is right.

223
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:41,390
Okay. Thank you. So this is the histologic appearance, so of a normal liver and then you go all the way down to cirrhosis.

224
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:51,800
So here is the appearance of histological section from a biopsy, from a normal liver.

225
00:29:53,060 --> 00:30:02,690
And it's stained giving this this false color. And you see the port triad and the central vein here as kind of landmarks to where we are in the liver.

226
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:10,700
And that's like stained red. And there are some spaces in here, but these are lipid droplets.

227
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:19,280
When you have an increase in triglyceride content and liver delivered section has an appearance of looks like this.

228
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:31,220
So instead of having mostly hepatocytes here you have this ballooning of hepatocytes and these are the living inclusions in the liver section.

229
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:43,610
So it's that these are formed as a consequence of having elevated triglyceride levels in the blood and free fatty acids.

230
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:48,110
And this is where they can end up in the liver. All right.

231
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:51,800
So this is simple steatosis and this can completely resolve.

232
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:56,420
But if it progresses, here's the case for Nash.

233
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:59,780
The timing here is sustained for collagen.

234
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:09,350
And at this stage, you start to see some, but not all of the areas within the liver affected by this collagen deposition.

235
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:18,560
You see that the lining of the hepatocytes here and you see fewer of the cells standing red in this particular section.

236
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:26,120
When you get the cirrhosis, you have lots of collagen here.

237
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:31,080
Here's a lipid increase in here. You don't see as much cleavage.

238
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:37,360
Got a lot more fibrosis occurring. This particular stage of the disease progression.

239
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:47,020
So. Why does this occur?

240
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:58,300
Why do you get steatosis? Well, it's simply an imbalance of lipids getting into the liver and being removed from the liver.

241
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:02,470
So there's a net increase in triglyceride acquisition.

242
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:10,930
The triglycerides that can accumulate liver can come from three different sources.

243
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:17,470
And at baseline conditions in anyone, one healthy individual.

244
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:28,260
Most of the triglycerides are coming from acquisition that occurs within the liver from

245
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:38,140
substrates and glycerol can accumulate in the liver in response to what's in your diet.

246
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:53,280
So this is a diagram that shows you the different sources of lipids that can be acquired and accumulate in the liver so that, again,

247
00:32:53,280 --> 00:33:03,840
in baseline conditions or in a healthy individual, most of the lipid is going to come from fruit fatty acids released by the adipocytes.

248
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:12,690
Here you have adipose triglyceride lipids, which is the enzyme that liberates lipids.

249
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:17,820
And free fatty acids can travel to the liver bound to albumin.

250
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,580
And they once they get liver, they can have different states.

251
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:40,980
So that fatty acid can be oxidized in the mitochondria, so it can be packaged into triglycerides and depending on the status of the liver,

252
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:51,330
at least right now can be removed and leave the liver through the down to very low density lipoproteins.

253
00:33:53,100 --> 00:34:02,400
So it's the accumulation of free fatty acids and triglycerides now that leads to this type of condition.

254
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:10,720
You have other sources of things that can that lead to the build up of free fatty acids within your liver.

255
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:23,410
So if you have higher glucose now, that can through the cycle can be converted to that, it can be converted to lipids,

256
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:31,420
pretty assets that can be stored or secreted, and you can have lipids coming from the diet.

257
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:42,100
So you have lipids that are attached to calling micron particles, contributing to the triglycerides in the liver and from the diet.

258
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:50,260
You have glucose that the presence of glucose and it increases insulin and both insulin and glucose

259
00:34:50,260 --> 00:35:00,400
can activate these response elements that promote the conversion related to free fatty acids.

260
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:06,670
So you have this zero regulatory element binding protein that's upregulated by insulin,

261
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:14,290
and you have a carbohydrate regulatory element binding protein that are upregulated by the presence of dietary glucose,

262
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:19,450
increasing fat free fatty acid levels within the liver.

263
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:27,909
So what can let's go through these individual pathways and see how the regular

264
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:33,700
so insulin and under the influence of insulin this activity in coverage.

265
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:40,810
So let's focus on the free fatty acids now that are entering the liver from this adipose tissue.

266
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:47,440
So if you were too fast, you would get passed and you don't have a whole lot of insulin around.

267
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:53,290
You have an increase in the and you have the liberation of lipids from adipose tissue.

268
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,000
Insulin declines. Glucagon and epinephrine increase.

269
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:10,130
And you have activation of this natal and the free fatty acids are these to transported to liver down to albumin.

270
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:21,000
And that three fatty acid has different liver antioxidants, as I mentioned, reduced triglycerides.

271
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:27,310
Word can leave the liver. It's secreted with a very low density of proteins.

272
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:36,040
Another thing that's not mentioned in this particular diagram is that it can be incorporated into phospholipids and stored in

273
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:47,950
two cell membranes and approximately 20 grams of free fatty acids a day that come into the liver are derived from that tissue.

274
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:59,940
The other thing that can increase the activity of adipose tissue,

275
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:11,550
adipose triglyceride lipids is if you have an individual who has high levels of circulating cortisol, Cushing's disease,

276
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:20,700
or if you take dexamethasone or prednisone and you have high levels of these glucocorticoid searching in your blood,

277
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:26,220
this can increase the release of fatty acids from the triglycerides.

278
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:36,870
Through this 82% decrease and de novo synthesis of triglycerides.

279
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:46,080
So dietary carbohydrate can promote de novo synthesis of free fatty acids.

280
00:37:47,040 --> 00:38:01,169
So you're starting with a cynical enzyme, a showing up at the top of the diagram and you have insulin glucose that think these transcription

281
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:09,450
factors are stimulating the transcription factors and they're going to promote a genetic process.

282
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:14,040
Giving you free fatty acids from a cocoa could have come in from glucose.

283
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:24,690
And with steatosis, the proportion of lipids that accumulate in the liver through this process increases they all all the processes increases.

284
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:29,130
You get an increase in lipid accumulation from all of the three that I mentioned.

285
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:39,360
But the one that increases the greatest extent is the noble of a genesis that occurs in the liver in response to the crisis.

286
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:46,410
Okay. So that's the novo synthesis of the triglycerides within the liver.

287
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:50,340
Now let's talk about free fatty acids coming from the diet.

288
00:38:52,650 --> 00:39:01,030
So you have the lipids that are. Yeah, I wanted to add a comment about de novo synthesis from excess capital.

289
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:06,780
It's mainly also fructose in the form of the accumulation.

290
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:12,000
Let's see. Let's see. I have a slide that that discusses this in detail.

291
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,500
Okay. All right.

292
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:27,389
So three fatty acids are coming in from the diet down to the column micron particles, and 80% is delivered to peripheral tissues in a column.

293
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:33,660
Micron, the fat that you might take into your diet, a 20% of that goes to the liver.

294
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:38,790
So the average American diet is about 100 grams per day.

295
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:46,260
Well, 20 grams of that should end up in the liver, 50% of the total triglyceride content.

296
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:51,740
So what about fructose that you mentioned? Well, let's see.

297
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:59,880
So with fructose, it routes these dietary carbohydrates directly to the liver.

298
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:07,650
Right. And you have these biosynthetic pathways now that include de novo lipid genesis.

299
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:14,790
So getting to the question of does high fructose corn sirup contribute to the development?

300
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:19,770
Yes. This is really controversial.

301
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:25,860
And this is something that you'll just see discussed in the popular literature as well as in scientific publications.

302
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:41,430
So how much fructose does it take to induce just ptosis where you see an accumulation and then you see a change in liver enzymes?

303
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,810
How long? It takes an awful lot for this to occur.

304
00:40:47,370 --> 00:41:00,010
So here is a diagram showing you the pathways by which levels high levels of fructose can acutely and chronically increase hepatic genesis.

305
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:12,570
So you have this direct pathway where fructose is metabolized for several steps to a set of clay, like clocks like this.

306
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:21,670
And we get an upregulation of enzymes that are part of this process, giving you ultimately plasticity.

307
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:34,139
So you have some metabolite of fructose that can upregulate these response elements and p part gamma co activator when alpha is thought to play an

308
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:48,570
important role in up regulating these transcription factors so that you get an increase in spirit and hepatic liver storage directly from fructose.

309
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:51,390
But how much how much do you need?

310
00:41:51,630 --> 00:42:06,390
Well, this has been studied extensively in animal models, and the model that's used is you give the animal 60% of its calories from fructose diet,

311
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:14,310
or you can give them 60% of their calories from sucrose to affect this response.

312
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:18,840
And this is in just the animal models of just the intelligence.

313
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:30,300
The animal models are effective in showing you an accumulation of lipid in the liver to simple steatosis.

314
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:38,790
But in animal models, in mouse and rat models, you have to do something else for the animal to get a process to progress to fibrosis.

315
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:47,760
So you can do this in an animal model, give them lots of fructose, but it has to be an awful lot of fructose to have this to occur.

316
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:53,430
What about humans? Well, there have been studies.

317
00:42:53,700 --> 00:43:00,570
They appear to be unethical. If you give a human a three and a half grams per kilogram of body weight,

318
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:15,870
plus 35% more or a total of 250 grams of fructose per day, you can increase hepatic lipid content.

319
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:29,640
Okay. That's an awful lot of fructose. It's possible, but it seems unlikely that someone is going to consume this level of fructose in their diet.

320
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:36,450
There is some studies done. This one appeared in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition,

321
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:47,640
where they followed these college aged men and they consumed 2.2 liters of standard soda for four weeks.

322
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:53,160
So like a two liter bottle of Coca-Cola or something like that for four weeks.

323
00:43:53,670 --> 00:44:08,490
And this level of consumption of high fructose corn sirup through soda was not enough to change hepatic content or to eliminate particular enzymes.

324
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:14,940
So it's possible, but it's unlikely. You had a question.

325
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:23,670
So this is a little bit factual. So the diagram, like I'm 12, has the largest diagram.

326
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:40,200
So if I'm interpreting correctly, like insulin in a healthy liver, I'm so sorry, but insulin in a healthy,

327
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:51,690
healthy liver would have opposing actions via the activation of SRT and and suppression of HDL in adipose tissue.

328
00:44:52,200 --> 00:45:01,470
But. The adipose tissue is insulin resistant and insulin would have insulin would not have that effect.

329
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,980
I think the insulin sensitivity will activate. Sorry.

330
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:10,259
Yes, that's true. So like in a healthy situation, insulin is working in immature actions,

331
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:17,580
but then in obesity or in insulin resistance in general, it would just be either inhibiting that.

332
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:30,850
Yeah. Yeah. It's become.

333
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:40,540
All right. So there there are other genetic causes of Nash.

334
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:48,160
So these are rare genetic, but there's congenital generalized dystrophy.

335
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:54,790
It's an example of a genetic cause of lipid accumulation that can be progressed to Nash.

336
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:56,620
And remember,

337
00:45:56,620 --> 00:46:07,890
these are the individuals who can't form adipose tissue and that lipids are excess calories through whatever source can end up and the liver

338
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:17,950
causing harm to the liver that occurs in these individuals if they're not carefully monitored and they actually as a consequence of this.

339
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:32,630
So you can have genetic mutations that can result in a defect in triglycerides from the liver.

340
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:44,270
You can have detections and HDL or it's cofactor that can affect the liberation of lipids from the adipocytes.

341
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:52,459
You can have defects in the enzymes required for oxidation of free fatty acids within the liver and in the mitochondria.

342
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:56,630
And this can lead to the accumulation of lipid within the liver.

343
00:46:57,570 --> 00:47:06,450
And then you can have mutations in apolipoprotein which is going to inhibit or impair your ability to remove from your liver.

344
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:14,880
All of these things can contribute to the development of the it tells us that can progress to Nash.

345
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:32,040
The paper mentioned these single nucleotide polymorphisms that have been shown to 30 studies to be associated with Napoles and Nash, P and LPL three.

346
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:40,050
This particular one is associated with this progression of simple steatosis to Nash,

347
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:48,120
and this is thought to be associated with polishing, deposition and fibrosis.

348
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:54,010
Some other snippets that were mentioned here is this GM 62, S.F. two.

349
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:57,760
This is also found in people who have dyslipidemia.

350
00:47:58,610 --> 00:48:05,520
And this and this affects hepatic lipid lipid efflux defects.

351
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:09,460
So you're not able to remove the lipid from the liver.

352
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:14,620
With this particular step. And then there's Chantal six.

353
00:48:14,650 --> 00:48:22,110
This polymorphism seems to promote fibrosis, so there's a progression of disease.

354
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:30,760
If an individual has this snip and they develop when they develop that the first it would be the ptosis.

355
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:35,590
They have this polymorphism, they're more likely to go on to develop fibrosis.

356
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:42,310
So what do we know about obesity in Nash?

357
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:47,920
Well, because of the difficulty in diagnosing this condition,

358
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:57,760
you won't see you'll see a lot of estimates in the literature, but you will also see some cohort studies.

359
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:01,090
And this is the famous one. This is the Dallas Heart Study.

360
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:08,230
Within the study, they also had, um, a population of people who have higher prevalence of Nash.

361
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,550
So this is a multiethnic population from people living in Dallas.

362
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:16,660
They have more than 2000 individuals who are in this study.

363
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:23,190
And the prevalence of simple steatosis and lean individuals is about 9%.

364
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:29,460
Those who have this higher level of obesity are Class two obesity.

365
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:33,330
A little more than half of them had this condition.

366
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:49,799
That's just paddock's distances. So with obesity, it seems to be there's an increase in free fatty acids that are circulating.

367
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:57,690
And again, we have an overflow or the ability of the adipose tissue now to safely store triglycerides.

368
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:06,390
Some of the lipids converted to free fatty acids and triglycerides, and they can end up.

369
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:15,300
So in terms of the relative contributions of the three pathways to hepatic steatosis in humans.

370
00:50:17,490 --> 00:50:23,700
About 60% of the panic effect is derived from free fatty acids in circulation.

371
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:35,730
Another 26% from the of the genesis and 15% of the diet coming from the diet.

372
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:48,860
So this is a diagram that shows you the different things that contribute to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

373
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:57,440
Here's the spectrum. You're going from simple. You tell us this a nonalcoholic fatty liver all the way to either carcinoma.

374
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:05,570
So you have this polymorphisms, gender, ethnicity, family history, which we'll get to here in a moment.

375
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:12,320
We have diets that the diet, in fact, high saturated fat, high cholesterol,

376
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:18,170
high fructose, high carbohydrate intake, low plant, saturated fatty acid, low accident.

377
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:28,340
All of these things may contribute. And then if you have these risk factors, this can give you a greater likelihood of developing this condition.

378
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:33,600
Sedentary lifestyle is also a risk factor for that.

379
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:45,080
So in this case, instead of using that lipid energy reform exercise, it's it's going to end up in the liver.

380
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:55,220
The paper discussed epigenetic effects through methylation e methylation.

381
00:51:55,610 --> 00:52:04,219
And then it also discussed some noncoding RNAs that are could affect the

382
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:08,930
development of snaffled and then things associated with the metabolic syndrome,

383
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:15,110
diabetes, obesity, edema, and in this case was mentioned arterial hypertension.

384
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:27,470
So those prevalent risk factors for Nash in terms of who gets it, you have obesity and metabolic syndrome.

385
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:34,910
Again, it's your ability to take up that lipid and stalk safely in the form of triglycerides.

386
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:40,610
And if you exceed that capacity, you have a risk of developing an adult.

387
00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:50,399
So you can have people with equivalent levels of that capacity and other risk factors that some people may

388
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:55,980
be more prone to developing the disease despite the fact they might have the same level of adiposity.

389
00:52:57,540 --> 00:53:05,189
So for example, if you had somebody who had type two diabetes, that is a risk factor for for an apple.

390
00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:11,370
So 42, 80% of people with type two diabetes, they can go on to develop Nash.

391
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:15,960
Again, you have elevated levels of insulin.

392
00:53:16,350 --> 00:53:27,220
You have insulin resistance occurring that can be brought up within themselves and this can lead to de novo tendencies.

393
00:53:28,530 --> 00:53:34,740
Men are significantly more likely than women to develop steatosis.

394
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:47,190
However, when women reached the age of 60, the prevalence of napping increases in women.

395
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:55,320
So there are some change that occurs probably associated then increased the risk probably

396
00:53:55,770 --> 00:54:02,130
associated with the ability to store triglycerides safely in the subcutaneous compartment.

397
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:13,320
And if you had the state mitigated those not having an impact on that, they would have more positive outcomes.

398
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:22,440
Yeah, right. Yeah. That's a thought. A greater capacity to safely store leopards in the subcutaneous receptacles.

399
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:27,750
And so you get more spillover of fatty acids.

400
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,760
Genetic polymorphisms would contribute to that risk as well.

401
00:54:34,330 --> 00:54:43,450
So if you have an impaired storage capacity within your adipose tissue depots and you have

402
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:48,639
a genetic predisposition and you're a man with secretion and you have type two diabetes,

403
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:54,940
all of these things increase your risk of steatosis and then further progressive to Nash.

404
00:54:58,110 --> 00:55:10,679
So in terms of race and ethnicity, in regard to ethnic populations, you have in the Dallas Hart study paddock state test,

405
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:22,440
this was found in 85 to 45% of Hispanic population, 33% of the white European population, and then 24% of the African American population.

406
00:55:23,910 --> 00:55:28,380
Sorry, a question about the slide before. Are you saying less than six years old?

407
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:36,930
Yeah. So the prevalence increases in women who are greater than 60 and in men you see under the age of 60,

408
00:55:36,930 --> 00:55:41,990
both men and women, men are more likely to have anything other than women.

409
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:47,310
But after 60, you see the prevalence increase and.

410
00:55:55,560 --> 00:56:03,510
So more common in Hispanic populations for reasons that are incompletely understood.

411
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:09,240
Yes, there are. You can find a higher prevalence of snips in this population.

412
00:56:09,930 --> 00:56:21,330
You have differences that can be explained by diet that perhaps can contribute to this higher risk of Nash.

413
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:27,210
You have perhaps other differences that are poorly understood.

414
00:56:28,830 --> 00:56:34,980
Sure. You had a question? Yes. Just a little surprised that second place.

415
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:40,380
I thought that got the substance from the reading.

416
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:48,440
Maybe reading only tells about this and where it is as a general population.

417
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:52,600
How many sample? How many? So this is the Dallas Heart Study now.

418
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:58,680
This is a complication of looking at epidemiologic studies with this question.

419
00:56:58,970 --> 00:57:05,220
Now, is that how are you going to assess what diagnosis and diagnostic criteria you use?

420
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:12,930
And that's the limitation of looking at large populations with this particular disorder.

421
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:21,179
So in terms of other populations in China and rural China,

422
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:30,600
it's very low and coastal regions it's a bit higher, 30% in the Asian Pacific area, it's 15 to 30%.

423
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:35,790
But this is rapidly increasing. This is older data mentioned in the paper.

424
00:57:36,270 --> 00:57:44,130
And again, diagnosing nationals is a challenge and in any place.

425
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:51,270
So it's likely that these values are underrepresented in these estimates.

426
00:57:52,960 --> 00:58:03,690
Um, so in the Asia Pacific population, the complications of obesity, including Napoles, occur at a lower BMI in these individuals.

427
00:58:04,590 --> 00:58:11,910
And in Africa, data are scarce. It's about 10 to 20% in terms of the prevalence of Napoles.

428
00:58:15,990 --> 00:58:30,260
So other risk factors, if you're taking prednisone, again, this is milligram quantities of cortical sites, it's going to activate that pathway.

429
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:35,010
There is a hefty dose of this particular medication.

430
00:58:35,430 --> 00:58:47,040
Antidepressants, antipsychotic drugs can also increase your risk of having young people who have just had gastric bypass surgery.

431
00:58:47,550 --> 00:58:54,690
They're experiencing rapid weight loss. The weight loss is coming from the loss of adipose tissue, nose lipids.

432
00:58:55,080 --> 00:59:04,470
Some of that can go into the liver. So initially, you can see some lipid accumulation liver that resolves with further weight loss.

433
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:14,080
High cholesterol levels are a risk factor and this can affect lipid accumulation,

434
00:59:14,170 --> 00:59:23,680
liver and the release of lipids from the liver through that very low density lipoprotein pathway.

435
00:59:24,850 --> 00:59:29,320
High levels of triglycerides are a risk factor. Malnutrition.

436
00:59:30,010 --> 00:59:41,830
So how is malnutrition related? Well, if you're undernourished, your body, it's going to liberate energy from by getting the it's from the adipocytes.

437
00:59:42,430 --> 00:59:51,489
So this pathway is upregulated. And in this case, if you have somebody who is undernourished, this is a source of lipids that can accumulate.

438
00:59:51,490 --> 00:59:57,670
The free fatty acids can accumulate, especially if you have other risk factors.

439
00:59:59,910 --> 01:00:12,420
The exposure to toxins and chemicals. So this is a direct insult to the parasite where the parasites are not able to

440
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:17,280
function normally and you get an accumulation of fatty acids within the liver.

441
01:00:18,330 --> 01:00:28,500
Carbon tetrachloride is a cleaning agent that has been shown to cause various liver diseases, including Apple.

442
01:00:30,030 --> 01:00:38,370
You probably heard of Wilson's disease before. This is an inherited disorder associated with copper accumulation.

443
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:49,920
That's a risk factor. However, it can occur without risk factors and people who don't have obesity and people who don't have diabetes.

444
01:00:53,510 --> 01:00:57,230
So now let's talk about the progression to cirrhosis.

445
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:05,630
So people who have 20 to 30% of them will go on to develop cirrhosis within a ten year period of time.

446
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:10,850
Jimmy, you had a question. I was confused on that. Can you explain the gastric bypass thing again from the last slide?

447
01:01:10,970 --> 01:01:13,790
So when someone undergoes gastric bypass,

448
01:01:13,790 --> 01:01:21,920
they're losing weight very rapidly and they're losing weight through the liberation of lipids from the adipose tissue depot.

449
01:01:22,580 --> 01:01:30,140
So that's converted and stored in the form of free fatty acids in the liver.

450
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:35,740
But as they continue to lose weight, that resolves those.

451
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:40,850
So like it's similar, it would be a similar mechanism for those with malnutrition issues.

452
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:44,180
So with that also result there nutritional status?

453
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:56,700
Yes. Yeah. So in terms of the progression to cirrhosis, where you have this, a lot of the liver,

454
01:01:57,060 --> 01:02:03,570
healthy liver tissue replaced with scar tissue, exactly what the mechanism is, it's uncertain.

455
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:12,840
And a lot of this in terms of our certainty on not understanding this, is that we don't have a good animal model for this.

456
01:02:13,470 --> 01:02:19,770
You can feed a mouse or a rat, a high fat diet or a high fructose diet,

457
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:28,800
and you withdraw that high fat or high fructose and put them on normal chow and the condition completely resolves.

458
01:02:30,210 --> 01:02:34,560
They never go on to develop the fibrotic condition that occurs in humans.

459
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:41,280
So we really don't have a good model for this. So trying to study it and prevent it is a challenge.

460
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:48,569
But there is a role for pro-inflammatory cascades that occur that are thought to

461
01:02:48,570 --> 01:02:57,110
promote this conversion of the stem cells into the stem cell within the liver to the.

462
01:02:58,570 --> 01:03:01,420
I brought a tissue or the fiberglass.

463
01:03:02,890 --> 01:03:12,790
Um, you also have a case for lipids causing endoplasmic reticulum stress within the hepatocyte that causes them to die as a consequence.

464
01:03:13,450 --> 01:03:21,669
And, um, you also have this improper folded protein accumulation with that occurs with endoplasmic reticulum

465
01:03:21,670 --> 01:03:30,250
stress that contributes to this process and then the oxidative stress that occurs from the mitochondria.

466
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:35,320
And, um, so let's look at some symptoms associated with hepatic cirrhosis.

467
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:39,700
Fatigue, easily bleeding and bruising.

468
01:03:40,210 --> 01:03:46,810
Loss of appetite, nausea, swelling in your legs, ankles and feet from edema.

469
01:03:47,830 --> 01:03:51,040
Weight loss that occurs. Itchy skin.

470
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:59,169
A yellow discoloration of the appearance of jaundice with accumulation in the abdomen or societies.

471
01:03:59,170 --> 01:04:05,980
And this can be very pronounced spider like blood vessels in your skin,

472
01:04:07,390 --> 01:04:13,180
redness in your palms and hands or remains the absence or loss of their periods.

473
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:20,560
It's not related to menopause. And for men, loss of sex, drive, breast enlargement and testicular atrophy.

474
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:24,670
And then confusion. Drowsiness. Slurred speech.

475
01:04:25,330 --> 01:04:31,410
Hepatic encephalopathy. All of these are symptoms associated with tax receipts.

476
01:04:32,970 --> 01:04:38,100
So this is coming out again, looking at everything that we've talked about thus far.

477
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:43,140
So we can see a ptosis leading to Nash.

478
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:47,160
So you have the accumulation of fatty acids within the liver.

479
01:04:47,850 --> 01:04:55,710
He's got an increase in Genesis. You've got lipids coming from adipose tissue, from policies.

480
01:04:56,430 --> 01:04:59,900
We have dietary fat coming in balance.

481
01:05:00,390 --> 01:05:05,190
And there's a second hit that contributes to this development of this process.

482
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:16,760
This particular diagram shows you what's going on within the hepatocyte and within the tissue, macrophages, the cells.

483
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:25,980
And here's the cell. So here you have a hepatocyte now that has accumulation of fatty acids.

484
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:30,810
And you have this activation of the def receptor pathway.

485
01:05:31,620 --> 01:05:37,380
So the def receptors can be activated extrinsic or intrinsically.

486
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:47,640
So you have channels like these can contribute to cell death.

487
01:05:48,990 --> 01:05:55,260
So you get an activation of the mitochondria that are producing a lot of reactive oxygen species.

488
01:05:56,370 --> 01:06:03,360
Here you have fatty acids in intracellular that are affecting the injury and the plasma reticulum

489
01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:14,490
activation of caspase pathway that can lead to mitochondrial upregulation of more reactive oxygen species.

490
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:20,340
All of these converge and can lead to a parasite death.

491
01:06:21,630 --> 01:06:27,600
Parasites themselves can provoke greater injury to nearby neighboring cells.

492
01:06:28,470 --> 01:06:34,680
So when the hepatocytes die, they release intracellular products.

493
01:06:34,950 --> 01:06:39,630
They have they are perceived as an inflammatory stimulus.

494
01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:48,300
So the damp would refer to the danger associated molecular patterns that we have as receptors within our cells,

495
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:53,460
the macrophages that live within the liver that respond to this.

496
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:59,520
So here's a cell. Here's the damps fatty acids.

497
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:05,280
And so in this process, the endotoxin can be coming from the gut.

498
01:07:06,030 --> 01:07:15,180
So if you have a leaky gut where you have an increase in circulating levels of the toxin, this can promote this process as well.

499
01:07:16,230 --> 01:07:28,200
So the macrophage becomes activated. There's a pathway in which you have the acids leading to more reactive oxygen species formation of inflammasomes.

500
01:07:29,010 --> 01:07:37,620
These are structures that process cytokines into pro-inflammatory cytokines that promote this inflammatory response.

501
01:07:37,650 --> 01:07:44,070
The macrophages become inflamed. They activate the nearby stem cells.

502
01:07:44,130 --> 01:07:53,730
These are the cells. Now, here, the stem cells within the liver that normally would replace and regenerate site turnover.

503
01:07:54,540 --> 01:08:05,730
In this case, the stem cells are responding to perhaps the toxin, perhaps the danger associated molecular patterns and pro-inflammatory cytokines.

504
01:08:06,450 --> 01:08:18,270
And instead of becoming a parasite, they become a fibrotic cell and that the fibroblasts can secrete collagen that lays down this collision matrix.

505
01:08:22,990 --> 01:08:29,310
So how do you manage this condition? Well, to this day, I checked all the time.

506
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:34,080
There's no specific drug approved to treat this condition.

507
01:08:34,950 --> 01:08:40,290
So the condition is managed to prevent it from getting worse.

508
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:45,920
And the way that it's manage is to treat the underlying cause.

509
01:08:45,970 --> 01:08:54,320
Hepatic lipid acquisition. The Foundation for management is lifestyle modification through exercise,

510
01:08:55,190 --> 01:09:01,010
gradual weight loss, which is hard to achieve in this population as well in a healthy diet.

511
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:10,640
This is kind of the foundation for lifestyle modification for people who have to qualify.

512
01:09:11,420 --> 01:09:16,280
There's a lot of things you need to happen to qualify for this condition.

513
01:09:16,730 --> 01:09:23,809
People have very high payments. 35 and over qualify for bariatric surgery.

514
01:09:23,810 --> 01:09:30,080
And this can improve the condition. You need to control diabetes.

515
01:09:30,620 --> 01:09:41,210
And again, this has to do with insulin sensitivity, lower cholesterol through different types of medications.

516
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:52,660
Protect the liver from oxidative stress. So if somebody has snaffled they're told to consume alcohol into,

517
01:09:52,750 --> 01:09:59,620
they're also evaluated for the types of medications that they need that can provoke these conditions.

518
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:05,760
There are some drugs that have been used off label.

519
01:10:05,770 --> 01:10:14,170
They're not approved for treating, but they have been used in clinical trials.

520
01:10:14,230 --> 01:10:25,900
One of these is Pioglitazone. If you remember, this is the TCT drug that was shown to be effective in people with type two diabetes.

521
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:33,190
It had some beneficial effects. However, due to the negative side effects associated with drugs.

522
01:10:33,470 --> 01:10:36,910
It's not and it's not a treatment.

523
01:10:37,510 --> 01:10:41,260
So some clinical studies have shown some benefit.

524
01:10:42,550 --> 01:10:46,750
The other thing is that it's talked about quite a bit is just high dose vitamin.

525
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:51,700
When I said hi, this is a really high dose 800 international units per day.

526
01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:56,920
And in this particular trial, they had adults in another trial,

527
01:10:56,920 --> 01:11:09,040
they had children that they were treating them with high levels of vitamin D, and it was somewhat effective in the trial.

528
01:11:09,790 --> 01:11:21,820
However, they didn't include patients who were at high risk for other conditions associated with Apple, such as diabetes or people with cirrhosis.

529
01:11:23,170 --> 01:11:29,050
And perhaps there's room for this in people who are at lower risk of having disease progression.

530
01:11:30,270 --> 01:11:38,380
But there are problems with taking high dose vitamin E chronically.

531
01:11:39,250 --> 01:11:48,790
So there have been prospective studies looking at people who take 400 international units daily and found that for four women in particular,

532
01:11:48,850 --> 01:11:51,850
all cause mortality is elevated.

533
01:11:52,030 --> 01:11:56,230
People can take these supplements. There's also a risk of.

534
01:12:00,390 --> 01:12:12,120
It's some individuals in particular who are exposed to cardiovascular disease so early.

535
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:23,769
It's the fat soluble vitamins, so your ability to exceed thresholds of toxicity can be easily achieved with a high dose of this medication.

536
01:12:23,770 --> 01:12:26,550
That 800 international units is really high.

537
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:38,790
And just like with in conjunction with lifestyle changes, probably indicate on a low fat diet that could also increase the toxicity.

538
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:46,020
Possibly. Possibly. So this is this is tricky.

539
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:51,530
You know, you have people who don't have elevated adiposity.

540
01:12:51,540 --> 01:12:54,840
People have a normal BMI. And this is people who have this.

541
01:12:56,490 --> 01:13:06,690
So you can't treat them with having a healthier diet and doing all of these things, improving their physical exercise.

542
01:13:06,690 --> 01:13:11,520
But, you know, preventing disease progression is really tricky and individuals.

543
01:13:13,350 --> 01:13:18,389
So, yeah, I think you're about to see I'm just confused because on the other side,

544
01:13:18,390 --> 01:13:25,770
you said bariatric surgery and weight rather weight loss is a risk factor, but so it's an acute thing.

545
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:36,000
So if you have rapid weight loss for whatever reason about very strict surgery, is that an example of an increase in insulin, lipids?

546
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:43,230
All of that energy is being liberated from the sites so acutely that some of that lipid is going to end up in the liver.

547
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:49,700
But as time goes on, as they continue to the weight that results.

548
01:13:54,320 --> 01:14:01,879
So this is a study that's noted in publications on management of Nash.

549
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:07,910
Here is the correlation between weight loss percentage and improvement in different histologic parameters related to NASH.

550
01:14:08,820 --> 01:14:17,300
2015 is getting all, but remember this is a population to get an accurate diagnosis of this disease.

551
01:14:17,630 --> 01:14:25,520
You need a biopsy and you're not going to get a control population that's going to be willing to give you a liver biopsy for these types of studies.

552
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:34,780
So here is the percentage weight loss. Here's the resolution of still hepatitis.

553
01:14:34,780 --> 01:14:39,010
The population that did not see resolution.

554
01:14:39,130 --> 01:14:42,940
Their average here, the different percent weight loss is here.

555
01:14:42,940 --> 01:14:47,530
And this particular group where you did see resolution of steatosis,

556
01:14:47,530 --> 01:14:57,430
they had they were losing a greater percentage of body fat in terms of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease score.

557
01:14:58,030 --> 01:15:01,750
So with a greater percentage of weight loss, you're seeing a greater improvement.

558
01:15:03,140 --> 01:15:06,460
There's some overlap here with these individual cases.

559
01:15:06,470 --> 01:15:17,850
However, for steatosis improvement, you'll see a better outcome with way more weight loss or low bar inflammation improvement.

560
01:15:17,870 --> 01:15:25,730
And again, this is based on histology. We're seeing great improvement and greater weight loss, a ballooning improvement.

561
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:33,500
And this has to do with the inclusion of lipids within the liver created with weight loss and then the fibrosis status.

562
01:15:33,650 --> 01:15:40,190
Here, they broke it down. It's worsened. It's stabilized and progressed.

563
01:15:40,190 --> 01:15:48,020
And there was a modest improvement in this fibrosis status with greater weight loss.

564
01:15:48,740 --> 01:15:56,420
Getting back to your question about, you know, it's simple, steatosis Nash can improve.

565
01:15:57,140 --> 01:16:05,120
Yes, but the improvement is a little bit of an improvement from that in terms of the fibrosis status.

566
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:14,060
Okay. Long term improvements with hepatic triglyceride levels and bariatric surgery.

567
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:24,160
So if you're talking about a population now of people that qualify for this surgery, having at least a BMI of 35 is okay.

568
01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:27,980
And they have lots of other issues as well.

569
01:16:29,030 --> 01:16:37,160
So in this group, there's a meta analysis done that included 15 different studies.

570
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:44,000
You had 766 of liver biopsies before and bariatric surgery.

571
01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:48,200
For the most part, you're seeing an improvement in ptosis.

572
01:16:49,460 --> 01:16:57,980
You're seeing improvement and hepatitis A 81% based on this study and in 70% complete resolution.

573
01:16:59,670 --> 01:17:15,070
Okay. So. So in regard to people with a very high BMI who have hepatic who have snaffled, this can improve this particular condition.

574
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:22,290
So in summary, it's an umbrella term now for this umbrella term.

575
01:17:22,330 --> 01:17:32,650
We're talking about simple speech. It's often referred to more serious forms of liver, in particular hepatocellular injury.

576
01:17:33,460 --> 01:17:37,960
That's smart lipid accumulation that can lead to this fibrotic condition.

577
01:17:39,430 --> 01:17:44,740
It's caused by triglyceride accumulation to free fatty acid accumulation within the liver.

578
01:17:45,100 --> 01:17:52,150
And there are the three different sources and the risk factors mentioned in the review.

579
01:17:52,780 --> 01:18:02,080
All syndrome snips more common in men, more common in Spanish population, family history, diet,

580
01:18:02,230 --> 01:18:14,290
sedentary lifestyle and the interview intrauterine environment that can cause epigenetic changes and progression to manage to protect steatosis.

581
01:18:14,290 --> 01:18:21,549
It's poorly understood, but the pro-inflammatory mediators that are produced in the liver in response to this lipid

582
01:18:21,550 --> 01:18:28,270
accumulation and oxidative stress are thought to play a critical role in disease progression.

583
01:18:29,890 --> 01:18:41,350
There's no to this day, there's no specific treatment for Napoles, but the objective in managing this condition is to treat the underlying causes.

584
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:49,030
So what I have for you today, have you talked about Napoles yet in your medical nutrition therapy class?

585
01:18:49,030 --> 01:18:57,220
Now, this week, this week, I wrote the 64th Amendment here to press about this question.

586
01:18:58,090 --> 01:19:02,319
And if someone is interested, I can say that because indeed the results are controversial,

587
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:07,240
but those that not associated basically have some weakness in the study.

588
01:19:07,330 --> 01:19:12,250
One example study was an instrument that turns out it's an association.

589
01:19:12,670 --> 01:19:20,530
Then they found that it was done on older adults. But having fructose from fruits, having like a protective effect.

590
01:19:20,740 --> 01:19:24,969
Yeah. So it can happen.

591
01:19:24,970 --> 01:19:25,690
It can happen.

592
01:19:25,690 --> 01:19:39,010
But in our controlled studies, with nothing else wrong within threat model and with humans, it takes an awful lot of time to see that opportunity.

593
01:19:39,190 --> 01:19:44,860
And the problem is that family size gets done a little bit differently.

594
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:52,240
Structure and who would volunteer while you were in the study?

595
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:58,396
Who would volunteer for that? And the college aged guys drinking two liters of water every day.
