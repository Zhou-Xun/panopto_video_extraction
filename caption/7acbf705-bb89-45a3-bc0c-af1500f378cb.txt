1
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:22,230
And then the lecture. Okay.

2
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:27,480
Spiral diagnostics and cheat sheet. Look, okay.

3
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:37,350
So what I'm going to talk about today is a few key principles in how we diagnose viruses in the field and in clinical settings.

4
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:45,810
And then I'm going to end the lecture with a description of each eye how HIV is used to measure antibodies.

5
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:51,000
We use it to measure antibodies against measles, and we use it to measure antibodies against influenza.

6
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,929
And it's kind of a foundational technique that is used.

7
00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:03,239
Stephen is a lot of each year in this free time does so we use that as a technique to fight well.

8
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:08,510
So it was the technique that Dr. Gaston used as the basis for her research that she's going to present.

9
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:15,170
And what I want you to think it's going to give us a chance to think ahead of time about this,

10
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:19,260
the limitations of that, perhaps kind of the benefits, but also the drawbacks.

11
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:30,320
So what we're going to talk about in broad strokes are sort of one is laboratory confirmation of viral infection important?

12
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,469
We're going to talk about a few key principles around specimen collection.

13
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,630
And we're going to talk about how these different assays that you may hear about are constructed.

14
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:43,310
And some of this may maybe review for some of you, but gets us all kind of this image.

15
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:50,120
So so, you know, diagnosing viral infections is essential, essential to patient care.

16
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,940
But what you'll notice if you work in a clinical setting,

17
00:01:53,390 --> 00:02:00,350
that there are far more diagnostics available for viral diseases that are actually used in clinical practice.

18
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:08,900
And there are even more available both in research settings that are available.

19
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:18,440
So you have far more tests available in a research lab than you have against surveillance that you do than you do have available to clinical settings.

20
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,390
And the US clinical settings has very few tests available.

21
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:30,470
When you look at the European landscape compared to our landscape because of the way in which our regulatory system operates.

22
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,810
So we see a lot of testing in hospitalized patients,

23
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:43,159
you see a lot of very protocol driven testing in people that are immunocompromised, particularly people that are pre transplant.

24
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:51,200
And you want to see, well, either in the donor or in the recipient, what viruses they may be caring for,

25
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,700
you know, in the second and third points kind of interact with each other.

26
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:02,530
You know, seeing using testing to monitor the progress of people who have chronic infections.

27
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:10,310
HIV, HCV, HPV, you see testing and maybe viral load testing figure into that with immunocompromised people.

28
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:17,960
You also want to know what types of chronic viruses they may be carrying and may have the potential to reactivate in a transplant setting.

29
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:25,129
And then a lot of testing resources go around infants and looking at congenital

30
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:29,570
infection or the risk of congenital infection during the birth process.

31
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:36,350
Now, when we're looking at field studies,

32
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:43,460
this is more intense than what's going to be happening in the context of a particular patient, in a particular care setting.

33
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:47,950
You know, it is really important. You're getting the specific viral agent.

34
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:54,470
You're not just finding out what category of agents they have, but the specific virus.

35
00:03:54,470 --> 00:04:03,200
And that specific genotype may be important and maybe even the sequence that helps you to understand where it came from.

36
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,190
And you want to be quantifying viral load if you're working in field settings,

37
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:11,240
how much people are being infected with matters to help you figure out how to start,

38
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:14,210
stop transmission and figure out where transmission is coming from.

39
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:22,910
Quantification of viral load, however, is one of those aspects that I've mentioned that from a regulatory perspective,

40
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:28,159
it's been very difficult for most companies to get quantification of virus through the

41
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:36,170
FDA system to have a test that can that is approved from a regulatory perspective.

42
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:41,930
To tell a patient that they have more or less virus is very difficult to get approved.

43
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:48,410
Most tests just give you a yes or no, even though the machine is calculating the cycle threshold and the quantitation of the virus.

44
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:58,410
Um, you also want to be measuring immunity, the virus, which we do much more often in field settings than we do in clinical settings,

45
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:02,989
although you do still sometimes do clinical applications for and you want to be using your testing

46
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:09,020
to establish routes of transmission and to the identifying the characteristics of the virus.

47
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:16,149
So I think this is a side that may go without saying after the last two years.

48
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:21,940
But I think it's important to remember that you have to collect a specimen that allows you to

49
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,929
detect the thing that you're trying to detect when you're looking at behaviors going forward,

50
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:31,389
both through your presentation and for your your written paper at the end.

51
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:36,400
If you're looking at sources where they collected a whole bunch of specimens and a whole bunch of testing,

52
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:42,009
this is kind of a checklist of the types of things you should be thinking about to say.

53
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:48,309
Did they collect specimens that are going to give them the answer? That the ability to give them the answer that they want to talk about, right?

54
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:54,969
If you want to be working on an acute disease in your test, you're collecting specimens a month after hospitalization.

55
00:05:54,970 --> 00:06:00,550
You're not going to find out much or you're only going to find out about those people had highly persistent infection.

56
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:08,590
So to think about the timing of the specimen in comparison to where the case of the onset of the case defining symptoms are,

57
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:15,040
are you collecting the right type of specimen? Just because you can get virus out of some part of the body doesn't mean it's

58
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:20,259
reflecting the amount of virus in where the pathogenesis is actually occurring.

59
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,370
So what does that mean?

60
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:32,770
Well, how is quality of specimens being maintained and things like timing and conditions of transport, you know, and something that, you know,

61
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:41,470
if you you watched it all the the controversies around FDA approving home testing for SARS-CoV-2,

62
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:45,910
it actually came entirely down to timing and conditions of transport to the lab.

63
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:51,399
That was where the whole thing fell apart because the FDA was uncomfortable saying if they sort of

64
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:57,220
said they had to validate a test regardless of the timing and conditions of transport to a lab,

65
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:05,499
if that's what it took a lot of time, if they had to prove that a test would work no matter what a person did to it,

66
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,500
to get it from their home to those standard PCR tests.

67
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,819
That's why to this day,

68
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:16,300
most of the standard PCR tests still have like a nurse saying that you have to get on zoom with while they like what you collected.

69
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:21,400
It's because they're trying to they're trying to tick off this timing and condition requirement from the FDA.

70
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:29,600
So we're this is we're going to get deep into this next week.

71
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:37,430
But then, you know, just because you've detected a virus doesn't mean that you automatically know that that virus causes the disease.

72
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:44,360
So what is the significance of that viral detection? Is the patient's illness caused by the detected virus?

73
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:48,370
So I'm talking from a very kind of operational perspective here.

74
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:53,600
And next week we're going to talk about this for more like theories of causation and how we sort of piece that piece that apart.

75
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:59,330
But you want to think about is the essay you're using, what is the sensitivity?

76
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,370
What is the specificity of your essay?

77
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:09,560
If you're using something that is very, very sensitive, especially for a virus that might persist in the system for some period of time.

78
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:17,450
You can make all sorts of things caused by that virus. So you also want to be thinking about what you know,

79
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:22,370
what is the nature of the host virus interaction and how does that play into what you're picking up in your specimen?

80
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:32,930
And, you know, there's also thinking about what is the strength of evidence in terms of the known and known disease manifestations.

81
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,710
So here are some of the methods of diagnosis we're going to talk about.

82
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:45,170
So the viral culture, microscopy, cytology, cytology, antigen detection, nucleic acid detection and some various serologic assays.

83
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:54,480
So viral culture is the earliest method of the laboratory for arbitrary diagnoses of viral infections.

84
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:58,440
By 1948, viral culture was happening.

85
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:05,700
You looking to look at mumps and viral culture was available for influenza by that point.

86
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:09,840
The first person to successfully culture and isolate those.

87
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:32,090
Dr. Francis Okay. So so for viral culture was the primary method of detecting viruses for over 50 years really until the early 2000.

88
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:41,770
The vast, vast majority of clinical detections were done on the basis of oral culture, and now very few are.

89
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:44,820
And much has changed because of that.

90
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:52,830
You know, a lot of the people that sort of trained into the field at that point were used to viral culture being very slow,

91
00:09:53,580 --> 00:10:00,280
not very sensitive and and not very useful for what they wanted to do in a clinical setting.

92
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:08,790
So this sort of, in my opinion, this sort of attitude developed over many decades that why why do a diagnostic for a virus?

93
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:12,569
We can't do anything about it anyways. And it's going to take forever.

94
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:19,260
It's going to be expensive. So viral culture, you know, it's being largely replaced by other methods.

95
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:26,069
Now, it still is useful for situations when you need a viable virus and in when

96
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:28,860
the interactions with the cell are going to give you meaningful information.

97
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:36,780
And as a definition, culture, culture in essence what you're looking for as you're looking for the virus,

98
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,930
interacting with the cell and modifying the cell.

99
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:44,280
So some cultures we see a lot of culture systems.

100
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:47,549
You can see animals used as a culture system are products of animals.

101
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:52,170
So suckling mice, embryo, native eggs you could use.

102
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:59,700
The more commonly we see cell lines and specific cell line is mentioned by Jessica are used for you kind of pick your cell line that

103
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:05,760
you're going to use for your culture system and then you're inoculated with a clinical sample and then you watch it to observe.

104
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:11,070
There's here's sort of the three main things that you observe out of a culture system.

105
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:19,160
First is a psychopathic effect. So these are the changes that a virus infected cell will over will undergo visually.

106
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:23,520
So the cytoplasmic effect is the visual change to the cells that are infected.

107
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:32,339
The second common thing we see is absorption. So these are when a virus effects infects the cell.

108
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:42,149
For some viruses specifically, it will change the the ability of those traits to bound to the surface of that cell.

109
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:47,580
Specifically, another example would be interference.

110
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:55,020
And this is sort of interesting fact about rubella. So when rubella infects the cell, it actually blocks infection from other viruses.

111
00:11:55,020 --> 00:12:02,400
And so you can use that to make a culture system to look for rubella, infection, confirmation.

112
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:10,799
Once you see these things, you can use you can use antibodies targeting these specific viruses with fluorescent

113
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,130
tags to visually see what's going on in the cell and where the viruses.

114
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:21,240
You can also use electron microscopy to confirm what's going on at a deeper level than what you can see with regular microscopy.

115
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:26,879
So here's a few examples of what the cytoplasmic effect looks like here.

116
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,670
We've got in a you got a herpes simplex virus in primary, right?

117
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:32,730
Kidney cells,

118
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:44,220
there's a is as the uninfected cells person is the infected cells and then D is the uninfected cells about these are the site of the virus.

119
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:51,690
Here is the infected cells. And then you've got cytomegalovirus here compared to these uninfected cells.

120
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:59,850
And then here you've got your uninfected two cells and then the RSV right here.

121
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:03,569
So for RSV now this is big blobs.

122
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:10,020
Remember we talked about I talked about how hours in the lifecycle how RSV forms big since sensor kind of glob.

123
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:15,030
So these are these are like all these cells that have blob together and connected and fuzed to each other.

124
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:18,420
That's this is a picture of this and Fisher right here.

125
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:26,020
So since my. All right.

126
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:31,090
Here's an example of what helmets option looks like so I don't get this right.

127
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:39,340
So in a we've got zero cells that are uninfected here.

128
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:48,129
And then in B, you see what it looks like after 72 hours of measles infection right here.

129
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:51,970
And you see all the clustering of the red blood cells around there.

130
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,240
These are different cell types, all looking at measles virus.

131
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:02,770
But you can see in all of them you have this kind of attraction and clustering of the red blood cells there.

132
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:09,149
All right. Switching to Immunofluorescence.

133
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:20,300
So does Immunofluorescence mean so IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE is this is related to if we had a lizard already in one of our papers, this is related.

134
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:29,959
So the core concept that I come back to when we talk about lateral flow assays, but the core concept is that you start with a viral antigen.

135
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:37,340
So some sort of protein that comes from the virus typically you want to be using well depends on what you're doing,

136
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:42,320
but for diagnostics, typically you want to be using a surface antigen that's presented on the surface of the virus.

137
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:49,940
If you're using this to tag sort of like intracellular processes as part of like more of a research experiment,

138
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:52,640
you might have other sort of viral agents,

139
00:14:53,480 --> 00:15:01,100
but the direct immunofluorescence is that you have a virus specific antibody that was generated to recognize

140
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:07,550
this and then it has a tagged fluorescence indicator that will basically glow when this connection happens.

141
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:15,890
You can also have indirect immunofluorescence where you have your first viral antigen and then you've got a virus specific antibody here.

142
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,380
But the antibody has been produced in mice.

143
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:26,120
So usually this is nice, but a Merian antibody here or there, maybe it means monoclonal antibody.

144
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:32,630
And so you've got this mouse producing about a here and then you have this generic tag antibody here that's basically anti mass.

145
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:38,110
So it doesn't detect the virus directly. It basically detects anything that a mouse the antibody has stuck to.

146
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:42,290
But you've only introduced mouse antibodies specific to your antigen into the system.

147
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:51,770
So the difference between a direct and indirect immunofluorescence. So some examples of what that looks like if you go on and off related cells

148
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:57,709
here and then we've got specific antibodies kind of targeting through here.

149
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:09,200
So different cell infections, we've got adenovirus and influenza being tagged and then in influenza B is being tagged parainfluenza up here.

150
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:15,320
But the two H is our species appearing plus three.

151
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:20,740
So you've got these different patterns taking out of that antibody picture.

152
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:32,340
You also, you don't see this as often as we used to, but in clinical labs, you can also sometimes see cell bile cultures or centrifugation cultures.

153
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:38,309
Mm hmm. So these are cultures where you have sped up the viral entry process by doing a

154
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:44,130
centrifuge stack and drawing the virus physically into a cell with more pressure.

155
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:57,930
So you use a rather shell vial, or you use a 96 wall plate, and this then you use immunofluorescence to detect what is growing in the cells.

156
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,959
You can have these made with mixed cell lines.

157
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:05,970
So you put multiple cell lines in the same culture to allow you to make kind of a broader diagnostic assay.

158
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:15,180
And this happens much quicker than typical culture. It was first used for CMB, but now we use it for a lot of other other viral culture detections.

159
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:19,350
Do they still teach this in, like intro intro microbiology lab?

160
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:25,440
Do they teach you to do so while clusters or. When I was here, they used to learn to discover cultures.

161
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,950
And when I came back, they were like, Will you be teaching several cultures?

162
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,290
And I said, I will not be teaching about their cultures. As a matter of fact, because it's not super common.

163
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:50,020
Here's a picture of how that how that looks. So sometimes in so, you know, I talked about how the cell line matters.

164
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:57,250
We can use that fact to our advantage by modifying cell lines to enhance what we're able to detect from viruses.

165
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:04,090
So here is a picture is one example. There are a lot of examples of this, but a picture of the Ellevest system.

166
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:10,450
It's a registered trademark, Elvis registered trademark, the Elvis registered trademark agent intensity cell system.

167
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:19,870
And what they've done here is they modified the genes of the cell and the genomes of the cell so that during the

168
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:28,840
replication process there is an activation of this promoter that will cause the the transcription of a lack Z gene.

169
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:37,240
The Z gene gets transferred into B galactose it is or beta beta glycosides.

170
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:46,270
And then once you have a cleavage of that product, you basically have a blue that the substrate is is cleaved in.

171
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:52,569
You are the product that comes out of it. And so the whole cell will turn blue once you have infection with HSV.

172
00:18:52,570 --> 00:19:00,040
So what this means is once you have if you had, you have you have your monolayer of these cells, you infect them with HSV.

173
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:08,860
HSV, if the replication is happening, it will cause this this activation of this gene to happen to create the blue product.

174
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:14,080
And you actually see you can see where in was cells and replication is happening.

175
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:22,190
There are many examples of this both through modifying cell systems and also there is, yeah,

176
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:28,180
the cell systems but then in different ways that kind of create specific interactions

177
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:31,570
with the viral replication process depending on what virus you're working on.

178
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:39,190
So everything I showed you is taking advantage of light microscopy.

179
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:47,200
A lot of those things. In order to do this now, most viral particles cannot be visualized with, like, microscopes.

180
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:52,750
But we can visualize the impact that those viral particles are having on cells like with the Elvis system.

181
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:58,300
We can also visualize things what we call inclusion bodies. So masses of virions inside of cells.

182
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,570
When we talk about Epstein-Barr virus,

183
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:09,100
you see a really good example of virions mixing in cells so much you can actually see them with a light microscope or an example.

184
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:14,710
You can also see multi nucleated or sensational cells and big cells kind of flapping together.

185
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:21,969
For an electron microscope, I mean, that's more what's going to be used when you're not so much in a clinical

186
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:25,629
setting and you're looking to see what's happening mechanistically expensive.

187
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:30,670
It's complex, but it gives you you're able to actually see the morphologic structure of the virus.

188
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:32,680
So when a new virus comes out,

189
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:41,860
they get that into electron microscopy very quickly to sort of see if there are morphologic characteristics that create a clue.

190
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,830
So here's a few, few pictures of electron microscope.

191
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:56,220
So you can both see viruses as they're moving through cells, different cellular compartments, and you can see the structure of viruses here.

192
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:07,840
Picture of inclusion bodies on the left and a picture of mobile typically ated instances of cells as body cells that are created.

193
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:25,320
Right. So if you are a pathologist and learning to do use culture this way in lab for especially for clinical diagnostics

194
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:30,630
you're going to learn these different cell morphologies that are unique to infections with specific viruses.

195
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:36,330
So all these like here's a list of some examples, but viruses have characteristics, morphology.

196
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:42,720
So these are not very sensitive ways to diagnose an infection.

197
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:56,129
But what they do do is is kind of very cleanly indicate that the virus has penetrated and is pathologically affecting that part of the body,

198
00:21:56,130 --> 00:22:02,340
like that tissue of the body. So sort of where has the virus to now travel and what is it doing?

199
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:07,890
I'm a good example of that would be the doing like a cervical smear, sir.

200
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:13,590
Smear for HSV eight or a pap smear for HPV here and B.

201
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:20,010
So it's one thing to detect that a person has HPV virus or antibodies against HPV.

202
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:25,569
It's another thing to determine that the HPV is actually causing a cancer,

203
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:30,750
is begun to cause a cellular process that puts somebody at risk of the development of cancer down the road.

204
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:39,420
And so it becomes this difference between detecting that somebody has a virus, yes or no, to detecting the pathology of the virus.

205
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:45,270
And so that's where we see things like cytology come in to come into play.

206
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:53,310
All right. So I'm going to get into rapid clinical assays.

207
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:59,520
So it is your bath based assays services. And I go through this really fast because I'm pretty sure this is going to be a review for most of you.

208
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:05,849
But start me for the questions. So as in detection is going to be rapid,

209
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:14,460
antigen detection is going to be based on the same concepts as we saw with the Immunofluorescence it it can be applied.

210
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:19,230
You can use it when you've got an antigen that is expressed and present in the specimen that you're working with.

211
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:21,990
And then you've got the ingredients to be able to do this,

212
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:30,239
that you have an appropriate antibody and that everything that goes into detection is at play here,

213
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,750
like is the sensitivity and specificity is going to be is it going to be good,

214
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:42,120
but is it going to be good across the broad range of conformations and evolution that the antigen might be undergoing?

215
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:48,690
So you definitely have to be watching for is the virus evolving away from your antigen detection platform?

216
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:54,360
You can have the direct you can have direct fluorescent detection.

217
00:23:54,360 --> 00:24:00,630
You can also have indirect detection, like I mentioned, where you basically get the stacking of two antibodies on top of each other.

218
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:07,020
They've got you have some, you know, the kind of the poor method, if you were to do this in a lab,

219
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:14,070
you can do it on a side, read with fluorescent, read it with a fluorescent microscope.

220
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,079
And you're looking for this color change.

221
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:25,440
This is very similar to what I showed you before, where you've got the antigen and the link to antibodies and you're looking for a color change.

222
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:33,659
But here, the one difference from before what I'm showing you is that you've got this viral antibody here initially bound

223
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:39,660
to a solid surface that is capturing capturing the virus in order for the rest of this process to happen.

224
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:50,849
So here is if you kind of want to walk through the process, I've got this here,

225
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:54,989
although kind of the different rinse and really steps to be able to do this

226
00:24:54,990 --> 00:25:01,440
painting and then you can take that same principle and attach it to a membrane.

227
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:07,530
And this is where these lateral flow tests come from. So these are the cartridge rapid antigen tests.

228
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:15,330
You've got your you've got an observant pad and you've got here and that's drawing the liquid this way.

229
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,870
You've got the sample added here. It picks up the labels.

230
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:28,530
And then if the virus is present, then it will attach to this and then create this color change there.

231
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:31,970
So that's how that's how those rapid those rapid test.

232
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:41,330
All right. So some concerns.

233
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:53,060
You know, the rule of thumb for a long time is prior to COVID is a sensitivity is low compared to our PCR and it's likely a viral quantity effect.

234
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:58,040
So we've seen the sensitivity perform much better if somebody is infected with higher levels of virus.

235
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:03,860
As good epidemiologist, when you've got a assay with questionable sensitivity,

236
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:09,410
you have to remember what that means for low and high disease circulation.

237
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:17,630
Our high and low prevalence scenarios in terms of the impact of false positives and false negatives on your overall population.

238
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:23,149
So your false positives and I think, you know, I don't love this way of stating it.

239
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:25,140
That was in the textbook I did this from.

240
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:34,729
But so if you are at periods of low disease circulation, so the example would be at the beginning or end of respiratory season or something.

241
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:40,790
Or if something is not common and you are deploying an assay that has a high level of false positives,

242
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:44,930
it means that many, many of the positives that you're picking up,

243
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:50,389
if you're testing a lot of people, most of your positives are going to be false positives because your true positives are so rare,

244
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:58,420
but you're deploying a test of very high levels. False negative results.

245
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:04,150
And if you get that something, if you have questions about I can kind of give you some graphics and such a look at how that works.

246
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:10,190
But false negative results are more common kind of based on illness characteristics.

247
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:15,250
So if you were to use tests early or later in the illness, when your viral load is lower, you've got to think about what that means.

248
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:27,070
So the the contrast to rapid antigen tests, when we think about widely deployed population tests, it's going to be nucleic acid detection or PCR.

249
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:31,510
Almost all viruses can now be detected by PCR.

250
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:39,820
When PCR first started becoming more and more popular for detection of viruses, like in the early 2000s,

251
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:45,160
there was this explosion of new viruses we were suddenly aware of that we didn't even know had existed before.

252
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:52,809
And then we were able to detect and we actually didn't really know what the results meant because we were detecting a lot of non-viable viruses.

253
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:56,350
We started detecting a lot of really long shedding viruses.

254
00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:00,580
And because you can have less rigorous sample transport conditions,

255
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:05,520
a lot of people were doing these freezer dives where they're going back decades into their freezer vinegar.

256
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:09,490
I've got these samples and testing for all these viruses and then nobody could figure out what it meant.

257
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,450
I'm going to give you an article to read next week. It's actually a commentary.

258
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:19,360
So I worked on a virus like this for my dissertation, a virus that a lot of people thought caused a lot of different things.

259
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:23,770
And it turned out they were just picking up all this chronic shedding and it actually didn't cause much of anything.

260
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:32,740
It was a really short career in this virus, but nucleic acid detection really opened up,

261
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:38,199
opened up this freezer dove kind of pattern that was happening. So PCR is here.

262
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:48,370
If you're unfamiliar with it, I can, but I want to move along soon and then most PCR is done because you're amplifying your nucleic acid by products.

263
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:56,500
Most PCR is detecting the amplification of the DNA or the irony of the virus through real time PCR.

264
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:01,819
So fluorescent dyes and labels that real time PCR can give you a quantitative readout.

265
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:10,000
But like I mentioned, the FDA does not allow us to use in clinical settings or very rarely, you know, skip over that.

266
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:17,500
One thing we do have to remember is PCR is so sensitive that there is a high risk of contamination if it's not done correctly.

267
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,540
We have actually seen this matter prior to this prior to this pandemic.

268
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:25,960
Results matter during the pandemic, prior to the pandemic as well,

269
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:34,690
with labs that reported finding associations between viruses and diseases that turned out to be laboratory contamination.

270
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:43,240
The do you remember there was the first round of CDC tests that came out for SARS-CoV-2,

271
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:46,870
and then there was the second round that came out, but they were pulled because they were all coming back.

272
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:54,160
Positive was because they were being produced in a lab that had cross-contamination with post amplification products.

273
00:29:55,810 --> 00:30:00,100
You can actually look at a map of the investigation of the lab. You can sort of see exactly how it happened.

274
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:10,720
Like, oh, here's the Hamptons. Here's where they're making tests. So, you know, these are able to be highly multiplexed in many, many ways.

275
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:13,459
This is the latest I'm going to be familiar with firefighters,

276
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:18,200
a respiratory panel that they use in clinical settings where you can detect all of the stuff from one swab.

277
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:23,020
And then, you know, this is a precursor of this conversation we're going to have about, okay,

278
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:28,310
if somebody has symptoms and you run a test with this many things on it and it comes up with five positives,

279
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:36,110
how do you know which virus is causing the illness? So it's created some problems in terms of understanding causality.

280
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:43,220
Skip Microarrays talked a little bit about regulation of commercial platforms.

281
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:49,880
Um, I think that, you know, the message I want you to take away here is that the US,

282
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:53,690
you know, the US both regulates the product itself through the FDA,

283
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:59,900
but also Medicare Center for Medicare Care Services regulates CALEA,

284
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:05,570
which decides who is allowed to do a test and provide a clinical result to a patient.

285
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:08,930
So two levels of regulation that's happening here,

286
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:16,910
and they work together very efficiently to make sure that we don't have access to all the tests that are approved in the European market.

287
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:27,760
Okay. The last thing. So this is where I talk about this a bit is the significance of detection.

288
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:36,280
Particularly if you've got like an asymptomatic scenario. I'm going to skip this part of the lecture because I want to just spend one minute

289
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:40,930
on serology to cue you up for the two papers you're going to read for Wednesday.

290
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:49,660
So serology is focused on detecting antibody or detecting on the host response to infection and trying to detect the

291
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:57,430
presence of antibodies we've already talked about when antibody kinetics look like you have different kinds of antibodies.

292
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,590
So you have to understand whether your assay gets total antibodies or AGM or IGG.

293
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:12,640
And for, you know, so you've got immuno assays and binding assays are a big piece of antibody action that you can use.

294
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:16,120
There's also this category right here of functional assays.

295
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:22,959
So assays that make cells act a different way in a way that you can observe and then use that to understand

296
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:30,010
what's going on with the virus and in agglutination assays kind of fall under that functional assay as well.

297
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:37,120
Here is an example of how hemagglutinin works. So this is a serologic asset that measures antibody levels.

298
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:43,300
If you have red blood cells, then these dark glasses can come from guinea pigs or turkeys or hamsters or humans or ferrets.

299
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:48,940
The right animal system, you have blood cells and you have viruses.

300
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:53,290
The viruses that have a human glutamate in property.

301
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,690
So influenza viruses work like this, measles.

302
00:32:56,110 --> 00:33:04,450
They will make these clumps where they'll suspend the blood cells in the well in a way that makes the well look kind of foggy and clear.

303
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:11,800
However, if antibody is present in the blood from a patient that you've added into the reaction,

304
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:15,390
it blocks that activity and the red blood cells are suspended.

305
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:23,470
They fall to the bottom of the bottom of the well. So what this looks like is this these wells with dots here.

306
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:35,850
These are wells where there's enough antibody that the hemagglutinin activity is not happening in the like to look at the negative control here.

307
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:42,880
But when there's not antibody, the virus that's been added to the reaction is suspending the red blood cells to consistent here.

308
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:49,450
So and that's what they're doing in this plate is they're doing serial dilutions.

309
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:55,419
So as you go to the right of the plate, you have less and less and less antibody because you're using the same patient's specimen,

310
00:33:55,420 --> 00:34:01,320
but you're doing dilutions along the way. So the dilution factor is higher as you go to the right in the plate.

311
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:09,790
And when that basically when you have this transition between the two visual things from the button at the bottom to this cloud at the top,

312
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:15,580
that is how you tell we use that to come up with a number that determines the antibody titer.

313
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:20,410
So when we say all these papers are talking about different antibody titers, this is how we get titers.

314
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:26,590
Now, just a couple parting comments where this is sort of where I wanted to get to today.

315
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,420
When I think about think about the strengths and limitations of this. Right.

316
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:38,319
We are basically doing depending on your assay, you are doing two fold, four fold,

317
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:44,880
five fold solutions to try to figure out entire how much resolution is that giving you from person to person?

318
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:50,230
B It's not giving you a whole lot, right? These are pretty is a pretty broad scale to work or class.

319
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:55,360
Also, you know, think about this is a visual assay, right?

320
00:34:55,870 --> 00:35:02,020
If somebody is going to take this dot right here, okay, is this dye cloudy or does this dye have a button in the middle?

321
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:10,359
What do you do with that information? It's probably probably because the right the right amount is like right here in the scale.

322
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:17,409
But you didn't measure that point on the scale. So the resolution of these solutions is actually it's very difficult to get to that resolution.

323
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:21,100
There's a lot of objectivity. You change the type of red blood cell you're using.

324
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:24,880
If you get it from a turkey instead of from a guinea pig, you're going to get a different answer.

325
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:25,270
Right.

326
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:36,550
So there this, however, is the gold standard number one way of identifying how measles antibodies and how influenza antibodies work in the body.

327
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,950
This is it. This is how we pick vaccines.

328
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:42,880
This is how we evaluate vaccines. This is the gold standard.

329
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:51,400
So I want you to keep that in the back of the mind as we sort of work through like how we're taking these like very lack of precision assays,

330
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:56,980
but then we're doing very precise modeling work on top of them and keep that in the back of your mind as we kind of go into Wednesdays,

331
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Wednesdays lecture. All right.

332
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,130
Thank you very much, everybody.
