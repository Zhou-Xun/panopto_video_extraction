1
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:15,599
which focuses on cumulative sampling in case control studies, which is also referred to as a case-based sampling method.

2
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:25,599
So in Tuesday session, we introduced some of the basic design and analytic concepts involved in case control studies.

3
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,599
We introduced some concepts behind the rare disease assumption,

4
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,599
as well as different sources from which we can sample the controls in case control studies.

5
00:00:34,599 --> 00:00:41,599
And in today's session, we're going to spend a little bit more time focusing on sampling in case control studies.

6
00:00:41,599 --> 00:00:48,599
And I want everyone to think about this with particular respect to the how time elapses

7
00:00:48,599 --> 00:00:55,599
and how we select the controls with respect to time elapsing in a case control study.

8
00:00:55,599 --> 00:01:02,599
And we'll also dig in, in this session, to the rare disease assumption, a little bit more depth.

9
00:01:02,599 --> 00:01:08,599
So in this prerecording, we're going to go over a cumulative sampling in case control studies.

10
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:12,599
And then in the next session, as well as the live zoom session,

11
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:22,599
we'll get into case-cohort sampling incidence density or risk set sampling and case crossover designs.

12
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:27,599
Cumulative sampling occurs when we sample controls from the non cases

13
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:34,599
at the end of follow up, regardless of their exposure status. When I say follow up here,

14
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:44,599
I don't necessarily mean follow-up in the same sense as in a cohort study in which we enroll people into our cohort and then follow them forward.

15
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:54,599
What I mean, rather, by the phrase follow-up, is if we think about a case-control study as representing a hypothetical cohort.

16
00:01:54,599 --> 00:02:04,599
And of course, this means that there is a period of time that has elapsed prior to when we conduct the case control study in which the cases or,

17
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:08,599
you know, individuals who have the disease outcome occur.

18
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:20,599
And so it is this follow-up period that is not part of the study, but would have been had we hypothetically conducted a cohort that I'm referring to.

19
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:27,599
If this doesn't make sense right now, it'll make more sense in the next slide where there's a visual that shows what this looks like.

20
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:36,599
Cumulative sampling was sort of the original case control design and was the most commonly used case control design in previous decades.

21
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:40,599
We've made advances in methodology around case control studies,

22
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:46,599
and I would say that the incidence density in case cohort sampling methods are used more frequently now,

23
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:54,599
because, as you'll see, they have several methodological advances over cumulative sampling and are more likely to be free of forms of bias.

24
00:02:54,599 --> 00:03:01,599
However, a cumulative sampling is still commonly used in outbreak situations.

25
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:06,599
So here is that I mean when talking about this hypothetical follow up time.

26
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:14,599
So it is useful to think about a case control study, a sampling from a hypothetical cohort of people.

27
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:23,599
And this is intuitive when we think about time having elapsed in the period prior to our study, in which the cases occurred.

28
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:33,599
And so in cumulative sampling, we recruit prevalent, which is existing ongoing cases into our case control study.

29
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,599
And we can think about these cases as arising from a hypothetical cohort.

30
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:47,599
So here the diagonal dashed arrows coming out of this top part of the figure indicate cases who did not make it into our study.

31
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:53,599
Either they died or they declined to participate. Whereas the

32
00:03:53,599 --> 00:04:00,599
dashed diagonal lines that end in a dot and then a long black arrow going into the box indicated

33
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:08,599
as cases are those cases that arose over this follow up time from this hypothetical cohort.

34
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:13,599
And then they're enrolled into our study. And so in this example, there's four arrows here.

35
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:19,599
And then the controls ideally also come from the same underlying hypothetical cohort.

36
00:04:19,599 --> 00:04:26,599
They are just the individuals that did not have the outcome of interest at the time at which we conduct our case control study.

37
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:37,599
And that's a really important point here. We know from the previous session that the controls are meant to represent a group of individuals who,

38
00:04:37,599 --> 00:04:44,599
if they had developed the disease outcome of interest would have been included in the case group.

39
00:04:44,599 --> 00:04:49,599
Another way of putting this is that the controls should be a sample of individuals without the outcome

40
00:04:49,599 --> 00:04:56,599
of interest who are selected from the same base population from which the cases were selected.

41
00:04:56,599 --> 00:05:07,599
And that's emphasized here by showing that the cases and controls arise from the same hypothetical cohort.

42
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:11,599
And now I want to review the rare disease assumption again.

43
00:05:11,599 --> 00:05:17,599
Last time we talked about the odds ratio approximating the risk ratio under the rare disease assumption.

44
00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:25,599
And I showed you conceptually how this works. But right now, I want to show very briefly mathematically how this works.

45
00:05:25,599 --> 00:05:29,599
We're going to start with the two by two table again, which you've all seen before.

46
00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:41,599
And now I'm referring to the row totals as N1, representing all exposed individuals, which is the sum of cells A plus B.

47
00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:53,599
And I'm also showing N0 as representing the total of all unexposed individuals in our case control study, which represents cells C plus D.

48
00:05:53,599 --> 00:06:04,599
So if we think about our cumulatively sampled case control study as representing or as having a fraction of

49
00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:13,599
exposed and non exposed individuals from this underlying hypothetical cohort having been selected to be controls,

50
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:19,599
we can represent these control individuals by cells B and D.

51
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:25,599
And here, of course, B equals and N1 minus A and D equals

52
00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:35,599
N0 minus C. Recall from the previous session that the odds ratio equals AD over BC.

53
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:43,599
We can expand this out to illustrate that the odds ratio equals A over N1 minus A,

54
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:54,599
which, again, is the same thing as B; divided by C over N0 minus C, which, again, is the same thing as D.

55
00:06:54,599 --> 00:07:07,599
Also, please recall from earlier on in the course where we learned about and defined the risk ratio as A over A plus B divided by C over C plus D.

56
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:16,599
Recall that A over A plus B is the proportion of exposed individuals who are cases or who have the outcome.

57
00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:27,599
And C over C plus D represents the proportion of unexposed individuals who have who are cases or who have the outcome.

58
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:34,599
And this simplifies to A over N1 divided by C over N0.

59
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:39,599
When A and C are small here, we define this as less than 10 percent.

60
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:46,599
This is an approximate rule of thumb. In Modern Epidemiology. Rothman defines this as less than 20 percent.

61
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:50,599
I like less than 10 percent because it's a little bit more conservative.

62
00:07:50,599 --> 00:08:01,599
But essentially, when A and C are small, the odds ratio simplifies to A over N1 minus A, divided by C over N0 minus C,

63
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:05,599
which we showed previously in the middle part of the slide.

64
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:16,599
And this approximates A over N1 divided by C over N0, which is the risk ratio!

65
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:27,024
That's the end of Part Four. The next is Part Five, in which we will introduce case cohort and density sampling as forms of nested case control designs.
