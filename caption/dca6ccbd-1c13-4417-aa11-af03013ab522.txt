1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:08,820
Okay. Sorry, I'm away. I'm still without electricity, water or internet at my house.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,950
So it's been a it's been a great week. Everything else is going great.

3
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,420
Really get used to the lake baths. Invigorating.

4
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,650
It's. Okay.

5
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:27,890
So just a reminder of where we are here.

6
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:35,570
Evaluation of chemical hazards. Last time we just talked about the course of the syllabus.

7
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:39,800
Sir, we were standing in your way all day. Right. I'll try to move back.

8
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:46,710
I went over the syllabus and. And talked about environmental health generally, just in very general terms.

9
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:49,670
Now we're gonna start to focus more on the exposure science component.

10
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:57,800
Then next week, we'll move on to talking more about chemical hazards specifically and then get more in depth on that exposure.

11
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:03,020
Science, some of the fundamentals of exposure sites that are going to be very important to how we do things,

12
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:11,570
how we look at chemicals throughout the semester and hopefully apply to other courses you're taking in future careers, whatever it might be.

13
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:16,760
So today we're doing the exposure science piece.

14
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:27,180
Any questions before we start from last time? I know there were some issues with the link to the readings.

15
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:31,890
I'm sure you guys all noticed that right away as you're eagerly trying to download it, right?

16
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:35,370
Oh, but I think I got that worked out for for all the readings.

17
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:38,910
Hopefully, if not more please me know.

18
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:46,260
So exposure science some competencies for today understand terms related to exposure exposure

19
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:51,090
sites describe elements of the exposure science model that we introduced very briefly last time,

20
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:55,770
also called maybe a continuum or a paradigm of exposure to disease,

21
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:01,650
and then finally understand different parameters of exposure that we may want to evaluate.

22
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,700
And that can be. Very context specific.

23
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:11,410
So exposure sites in general is very observational in nature.

24
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:18,610
So I make a lot of contrasts today with other fields in this case, particularly toxicology,

25
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:23,049
which tends to be, you know, very lab based, very experimental here.

26
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:29,540
When we're talking about human exposure, we're usually out in the field taking measurements, observing things as they as they happen.

27
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:40,870
Now, there are instances where we might have experimental methods we can use for human exposure, and that can vary.

28
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:46,000
If you go back long enough in the literature, you see there's all kinds of weird stuff these do with exposure chambers,

29
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:54,430
you know, recruit bunch of grad students to put stuff on their skin or three things they don't allow most thing more likely.

30
00:02:55,450 --> 00:03:00,250
So, you know, there are still some experimental, you know, very specific studies you can do.

31
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,730
But typically we are observational out in the field.

32
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:11,170
Then we tend to take that information and either apply it directly to that population or use models and

33
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:19,210
other means to try to generalize or broaden the conclusions or inferences we can make to the population.

34
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:26,260
And ultimately, we want to understand how people are exposed to things that can inform policy, like I said,

35
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:34,360
and policy can be broadly defined here as governments like we might always think of it, but it could also be, you know, clinical policy.

36
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:40,750
You know, what clinicians are advising their patients to do could be communication with the public.

37
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,720
How might you minimize your your exposure to things of concern?

38
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:53,700
So. Basically trying to help implement sound decision making to reduce health risk.

39
00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:06,050
From chemical exposures in our case. Historically, this science hasn't always been exposed to science.

40
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:12,560
Different realms have done it separately. So the occupational setting, like we'll talk on the second part of the semester.

41
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:22,250
Industrial hygiene has its own methods, its own vernacular for going on the field and taking measurements of quantum measurements of exposure.

42
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:28,429
On the flipside, environmental folks would have their own methods and vernacular,

43
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:32,510
but they tend to be somewhat similar, as we'll see as the semester goes on.

44
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:40,620
As far as general technologies and approaches and those focused usually on, you know,

45
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:50,270
very specific thing about what does this thing, this activity or this process result with regards to exposure?

46
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:57,740
How are those variables? A result of exposure would be one application, and then a completely different field would be something like epidemiology,

47
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:01,430
where it's like, how does that exposure influence health effects?

48
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:05,569
What was the prevalence or incidence of disease in relation to it?

49
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:12,110
Exposure vectors and they kind of function very separate more commonly and moving into the future,

50
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:16,309
trying to get much more integrated with how we do this.

51
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:21,320
So it's not working in silos, but it's you know, of course it's like this is some of your other courses.

52
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,740
Hopefully you'll be taking kind of get that perspective,

53
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:32,720
both of the different settings of different fields coming together to take a more holistic view of how we can

54
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:38,960
get to the bottom of how do environmental agents impact human health and how can we help reduce that risk.

55
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:46,340
So this is from the reading on if I spend much time on this, just a little bit more context for you.

56
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:52,850
So again, this is kind of a group of experts while doing get together and trying to formulate

57
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,629
what exposures science means and kind of sell it to the scientific community,

58
00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:02,390
if you will. And what they came up with is these four demands for exposure sites that are kind of big.

59
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,250
So you have the Health and Environmental Science Command.

60
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:14,120
It's kind of like, you know, eggheads like me in our ivory tower think about, you know, exposure and health and how that impacts things.

61
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:20,600
So you have that piece, the people who are, you know, doing this as their as the profession.

62
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,600
And of course, you have the policy and regulatory demands.

63
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:29,030
But like I've been saying, we want to inform the decision makers so we can have policies that protect people.

64
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:36,620
We also have societal demands. You know, what are people, the public, doing in various facets of this?

65
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,040
They probably don't know what they need to be protected against.

66
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:48,590
So that's part of our job as well as to identify and define what the concerns are and how people can can reduce those risks.

67
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,309
Then finally, there's market demands. So, you know, you listen to me talk.

68
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:55,730
It's like after last week, you like let's just ban all chemicals, right?

69
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:03,290
Well, that's not going to fly. Obviously, we need chemicals that do improve our lives in many ways.

70
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,679
So there's market balance and what you can kind of do.

71
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:11,360
Yeah. Is there any reason to push this data? No, it's just trying to be three dimensional.

72
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,459
I think they try to get for different points.

73
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:19,790
I mean, they could have, you know, whatever template you want to use in PowerPoint, you can probably pick could better go on, I suppose.

74
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,220
But you know, like I said, it's a bunch of experts.

75
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:26,240
They're interested in exposure science, trying to make it sound like exposure science is the center of the universe.

76
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:30,650
You know, like hopefully you'll you'll agree with by the time I'm done with you this semester.

77
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,819
Right. But yeah. And there's no this just for points.

78
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:38,840
They try to get around this, this field.

79
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:45,379
So again, that's just a little bit of extra context there. Okay.

80
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:50,060
So back to our diagram now. This is a newer diagram.

81
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:53,790
There's an older version that I kind of like better myself because that's what I learned on.

82
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:57,709
But we can we can go with this one. Basically, they're the same thing.

83
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:01,880
You have a source on the left hand side and a health outcome or disease on the

84
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:06,890
right hand side and all the things that occur in between or even upstream,

85
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:12,320
as you see the green one. So we have our source, our intensity for exposure,

86
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:18,860
potentially leading to dose and or or outcomes in any of the things that can influence this along the way.

87
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:24,420
And that's what we'll be talking about today. And a little more depth.

88
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:31,760
So some definitions. And for all these, again context matters.

89
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:34,840
Different scientific fields might use what is saying about.

90
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:40,390
Same terms, so they might vary even within environmental health.

91
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:48,379
Some of these definitions may may vary or you see a lot of gray area or very loose usage of these terms.

92
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,870
So I'll try to point that out as I go.

93
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:57,219
So the first definition is hazardous of the chemical, biological or physical keyboard causing adverse biological response.

94
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:03,460
And as we talked about last time a little bit, you have thousands and thousands of different possible chemical agents,

95
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:11,950
a lot of biological agents, maybe not as many as chemical, but as we've seen, be extremely serious.

96
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:24,260
Seemingly come out of nowhere. And then our fiscal assets, which tend to be, I daresay, more well-defined, especially when it comes to.

97
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:33,350
Sort of explaining them and assessing them because they do a lot of them do rely on the laws of physics.

98
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,120
So it's sometimes, you know, maybe it looks like more math,

99
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:43,490
but it tends to be a little bit more straightforward at times when it comes to some of this.

100
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:49,850
So let's hazard the next definition source.

101
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:57,290
This is probably intuitive point or area of origin for a toxic agent or hazard, and this can be classified in a number of different ways,

102
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:01,460
depending on how you're talking about something so you can have a point or an area source.

103
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:06,380
So hopefully we'll look ahead. But what's maybe an example of a point source?

104
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:16,760
A spill. Yeah. The spill could be. Anyone else?

105
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,750
Car exhaust, like coming right out of a similar car.

106
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:29,800
Yeah. And, you know, there's. Discharge like a zero.

107
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:38,320
Mm hmm. Yeah. You might see. You know, I drive my in-laws live in the Chicago area.

108
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:42,440
So driving through that Indiana court where they're like Gary to see all those stacks and

109
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:47,150
you just kind of wonder what each of those points is is putting out into the environment.

110
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:52,010
Or if you go toward Detroit, you know, any major metropolitan area in really certain areas.

111
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:59,030
So yeah, that's a lot. There are a lot of point sources in the example of spill. This is an interesting one because if you can put it in perspective.

112
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,690
So if you zoom in far enough, that might actually be an area source.

113
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:07,070
But if you zoom out, it's going to look like a point, right? So let's see what we have here.

114
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:14,420
An incinerator. So an incinerator takes things, it burns waste and something has come out that might be an example of a point source.

115
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,310
What about area? Any thoughts on various sources?

116
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:33,890
Foursquare? Yep, absolutely. So unfortunately becomes a very large area.

117
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,770
A lot of times we talk about, you know, thousands or hundreds of hundreds of thousands of acres.

118
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:42,920
And it's just it's crazy to think that scale. Let's go to the other.

119
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:47,840
A series of factories along the river and take downstream that river.

120
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:55,130
Both flow from the upstream. Yep. Again, a matter of perspective if you think on a larger scale or small enough scale.

121
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:02,760
Yeah, I kind of like thinking about it these days, I hope. I guess I don't get it.

122
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:09,230
Yeah. Yeah. So even if it's a point source, you know, it's not necessarily the source of capital.

123
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:14,749
It's kind of a secondary area source for sure. So here, urban runoff is an example.

124
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:22,400
So, you know, a lot of stuff goes on in the urban environment and then you get a big downpour of rain, all that stuff.

125
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:26,690
You know, you have paved roads, the chemicals with some asphalt roofing,

126
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:32,180
all those sources and anything that's gathered on those between rains, it's got a lot to work with.

127
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:37,509
Those watersheds go. So that's just one way to classify it.

128
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:44,110
There's also stationary versus mobile. This one's pretty easy example for stationary and all of these overlap.

129
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:48,940
So our incinerator, usually those are stationary, right?

130
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:55,370
Example, any other thoughts? Factory.

131
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,060
Yeah, it's. It's a mobile mobile factory.

132
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,750
Usually in one place. Oil refinery.

133
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:07,550
It's mobile. It's a mobile source, much like cars.

134
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:15,110
And cars is kind of the big one. If you're talking about biological hazards, that could be people, right?

135
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,510
Virus or something. But yeah, automobiles is a given.

136
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:28,190
Another way we could classify this is anthropogenic versus non anthropogenic or manmade versus naturally occurring.

137
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:34,700
So anthropogenic. Again, some of the same examples could be used and be favorites out there.

138
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:43,130
Chemicals, synthetic chemicals fill a landfill.

139
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:51,559
You miss a lot, especially the older ones usually aren't lined appropriately, even the ones that are line driven,

140
00:13:51,560 --> 00:14:01,160
they weren't lined up well enough or against certain types of chemicals that could prevent non anthropogenic naturally occurring.

141
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:11,360
Yeah. What's. I'm not sure about this one, but algae blooms.

142
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:20,290
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And some of these, there's going to be some gray area, but, you know, man activity influence here.

143
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,680
But, you know, it's a green as well.

144
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:27,559
And the floods become more of an issue if it floods the hazardous waste site and then all that stuff just gets spread everywhere.

145
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:27,830
Right?

146
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:35,680
So you can have some interaction, that kind of same thing where humans can kind of exacerbate the issue with like a lightning causing a wildfire.

147
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:36,590
Absolutely. Yeah.

148
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:45,590
So there's actually a lot of examples out there of one that I see a lot every time I do research and try to write background section on uh,

149
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:52,000
involving metals like heavy metals, toxic metals. They always without fail mentioned volcanoes.

150
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:57,980
So, you know, it takes a lot of stuff from the center of the earth and, and throws it all over the place when it erupts.

151
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:08,660
Okay. So that's sauce. And a lot of those examples I gave and how a lot of people in the public view exposures

152
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,479
to something like chemicals it's it's like those examples it's the factories,

153
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:17,620
the refineries, the things you can see. So that's kind of outside this box on the outdoor.

154
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:25,180
This is an older figure, but I kind of like it because you have some of the obvious ones like pesticide application industry,

155
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:28,809
toxic waste, automobile exhaust refineries.

156
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:34,900
And that's like what comes to mind for people, I think. But we also have all these ones that they label indoor here.

157
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,020
A lot of people, it's just part of their daily lives and they don't even think about it.

158
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:45,550
You know, luckily this has become less prevalent, but cigaret smoking used to be indoors, used to be just everywhere.

159
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:51,490
It's hard to believe. And that's where I mean, it's gave us tons of great examples for exposure science to work around.

160
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:57,070
But, but it's crazy to think it took so long for that to sort of become less and less common.

161
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:04,630
Just a lot of stuff here. And on your pets, they use kitchen cleaners, a stove or you think a stove is a problem for.

162
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:09,000
Yes, it was. Yeah. Yeah. They put out, you know what? The limit.

163
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:16,490
Beauty could be in the works as well as a big one.

164
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:21,720
And just in particular, in general, if it's, you know cooking something that's also you that.

165
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:28,220
Dry cleaning. Bathroom cleaners, aerosol sprays.

166
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,950
Those are kind of obvious. And anything like kind of smelling chemically, people might think a lot about a hot shower.

167
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:38,870
Which really sounds great to me. Right. But how close to that? One, two days.

168
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:45,890
What do you think that's out there for? Food and what could be direct in the water?

169
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:52,610
What do you think? They say hot things. More specifically from what's heating up the water.

170
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:58,819
Okay. Yeah, potentially where that is located, things in the pipes get like more leaks at that point.

171
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:04,610
It's hot. It could be. Yeah, it could be something in the pipes. And there's another one, I think some global terms.

172
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:11,810
Volatile. Yeah. So there's a whole class of concerning chemicals called disinfection byproducts.

173
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:14,750
So they have a huge public health purpose in them.

174
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:22,100
They help kill microbes in the water that we use, but then they might evaporate and then you breathe and then they might be actually harmful.

175
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:29,450
So there's research in that area as well. Okay.

176
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:37,020
This is a good one exposure. So this is one of those that you'll see just kind of tossed around everywhere and in different contexts.

177
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:43,440
It means different things. For us, it's thought of as an event when a person comes into contact with a hazard or toxic nature.

178
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:52,040
So we'll come back to that. So this is a dynamic process that can vary from person to person, as we'll see.

179
00:17:52,490 --> 00:18:04,350
And from one agent to another. And so we talk about sort of the how much how many of you are in six over two at the toxicology class.

180
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:12,420
So you'll see that's sort of the other other side of it. Focus more on the health outcomes as well as epidemiology.

181
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:20,850
Take the. Um, there's all kinds of historical pictures that are really interesting and maybe disturbing.

182
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,440
So here's a soldier, probably World War Two area or shortly after.

183
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:33,180
There is a service camp and there's a sprint right under this person's skin and it is DDT.

184
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:45,209
So, you know, if you think that so era and timeline also makes a big difference, you know, imagine that occurring today.

185
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:51,710
Hopefully it doesn't still occur. That would probably result in a large exposure.

186
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:55,420
Right. And potentially a large dose. Likely a large dose.

187
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:05,690
So exposures can be pretty simple. So, you know, I swear, every time I go to the dentist, they want me to take more X-rays.

188
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:12,810
I don't know why I always ask them. As early as here six months ago, everything really changed that much.

189
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,590
I'm not complaining about anything going on in my mouth.

190
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:20,090
So I get them everyone. So I get them to post.

191
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,210
They really like to think that the children of Douglas.

192
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:36,330
My suspicions they can go through anyway, seeing a short term known exposure.

193
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:43,260
It's well documented, again, the lost food supply and you really kind of know what you're dealing with.

194
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:48,000
When we get into chemical hazards, a lot of times they're extremely complex.

195
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:52,920
One example is, again, it's urban air pollution can be from a lot of different sources,

196
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:58,050
could be a lot of different agents, can be quite variable depending on a lot of factors.

197
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:08,010
So, you know, again, we're going to see a big difference there, especially because we're focusing on chemical here a lot more.

198
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:16,170
Complexity to it a lot of times. Where do explosions occur?

199
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:23,910
So they can be anywhere. This is just one example of a bit of a life cycle moment, complete life cycle of, say, a chemical.

200
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,910
So you have the manufacturer of something that uses the chemical.

201
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:35,430
You have occupational exposures, emissions, the air and wastewater, and whatever is made gets stored somewhere, is transported somewhere.

202
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:40,170
That's where you can have some spills, things like that. It's used.

203
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:45,920
This is a big focus in use. Thank you.

204
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,110
And that could be a lot of different settings.

205
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:56,510
So we're going to talk, like I mentioned, the second part this semester are going to be really focused in on occupational.

206
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,600
And then third parties are going to be more community level or departmental.

207
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:05,210
So that's a big area. And then disposal,

208
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:15,650
that's a lot of these legacy chemicals remains a problem if you're just disposing massive quantities and maybe not disposing of it properly.

209
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:21,350
Also needs to exposure. So that's just one sort of setting example.

210
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:31,130
So building on that, being an exposure to exposure assessment, this is where we measure or estimate the amount of exposure.

211
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:35,180
And again, school public health refocusing primarily on people.

212
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:42,769
But you could do this use the same principles to look at anything, exposure, you know,

213
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:47,480
and a lot of high tech manufacturers, they look at exposure to the product.

214
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:53,810
So. That's what they're interested in. Contaminate the product, maybe not necessarily a person.

215
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:59,839
Interestingly, animals. There's the literature.

216
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,880
You can find some on livestock,

217
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:07,820
so people trying to protect their livestock from certain exposures might use some of these principles of exposure assessment.

218
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:11,930
I've seen a lot more studies these days with pets.

219
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:21,080
So pets as a sentinel for household exposures, which is really interesting and even potentially epidemiology for types of diseases.

220
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:25,340
So there's some cat studies looking at thyroid disease, for example, and things like that.

221
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:30,050
So so exposure assessment can really do a lot of things we're going to focus primarily here on.

222
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:35,230
Humans. Four key components.

223
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:40,510
So obviously magnitude, how much of the agent are chemicals is there?

224
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:47,200
But then you also want to know the frequency of contact and the duration of contact was very important.

225
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:57,040
And then the bottom one doesn't necessarily go into the equation, but it is important to consider how is it getting to the body?

226
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:06,400
Because that can, as we'll see later, can determine how it sequesters the body, how it gets eliminated, or what might interact with.

227
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:16,310
Important systems are tissues. So our primary equation is exposure is equal to the magnitude times frequency, times duration.

228
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:21,880
So you might want to circle that. Future, future, future use.

229
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:30,200
So we'll talk a little bit more about these components.

230
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:37,550
So question is just basically how much agent is there? And it can vary depending on the type of agent.

231
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:40,940
So it could be a total amount. So that's common.

232
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:50,819
And something like radiation can be in sort of bulk chemical settings and some risk assessment applications.

233
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:54,370
You might see a total amount of used levels.

234
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:59,300
We don't really see levels. Chemical hazards always.

235
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:04,520
This is a prime example that we tend to focus on a lot.

236
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:11,900
I would say primarily is concentration. So that's the amount or mass of the agent of interest in some sort of media.

237
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:17,480
And by media I mean like air, soil, dust, water, things like the food.

238
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:28,610
So we're typically talking about concentration. And that can come in different forms depending on the type of media and the amount and how,

239
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:33,650
you know, what the customary units for a particular setting might be.

240
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:37,610
So here we use micrograms, might be MG, might be nanograms.

241
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:47,720
It could vary depending on the scale we're talking about. And then for the denominator is that unit of media.

242
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:49,430
So an area of volume.

243
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:59,030
A lot of times you might see per liter or three per cubic meter of water per liter of water could be per gallon depending on what country you're in.

244
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:10,760
It's like that per mass of soil or food and biomarkers may be talking about a certain amount volume of blood or urine.

245
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:16,130
So it can vary. And you might also get into some of those detail later in the semester.

246
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:25,070
Instead of a mass per unit volume or mass, you might see it as a parts per million, parts per billion, trillion, etc.

247
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,620
And you can. In some instances you can. Switch back and forth.

248
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:38,719
So in a lot of the water stuff you will see, you know, in the news, they'll talk about parts per million,

249
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,920
parts per billion and that you can easily go back and forth there.

250
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:51,700
It's kind of a matter of preference and sort of customary.

251
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:58,600
What sports? Okay.

252
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:03,249
So we talked about exposure to your assessment of the components of exposure,

253
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:10,510
assessment and then dose and this is where it gets can get a little confusing because sometimes

254
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:14,950
people will say exposure when they mean dose or they'll say dose when they really need exposure.

255
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:19,000
But for our purposes, we cover a lot of those.

256
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:23,920
So the dose is the measure of how much agent actually gets into the human body.

257
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:29,140
So you have your magnitude that might be out there in a media, you know, in the air, in the water.

258
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:36,550
That's not necessarily exposure. Exposure is how much of that is coming into contact with the person in our case.

259
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:39,820
And then doses, how much is actually getting into the person?

260
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:46,880
And to make it even more complicated, there's different types of doses and we'll talk about that.

261
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:57,760
So to have a dose, you have to have an exposure leading up to that dose for two to maybe turn into a dose, but they're not equivalent.

262
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:05,110
So again, a magnitude could exist and never come into contact with people that wouldn't ever turn into an exposure dose.

263
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:10,300
It might result in an exposure, but not a dose may based on some factors.

264
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:17,200
And you know, if it gets all the way into the body, then it does become a dose.

265
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:23,200
Does that make sense? Doesn't that want to keep hammering away at it then?

266
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,750
Oh, wait, maybe I will. Here's, here's a picture. I forgot about this.

267
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:34,749
So here you have, you know, all of these factors we've been talking about and, you know, a bunch of people around it.

268
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:38,920
So these people all live near the factory who they all have the same exposure and dose, do you think?

269
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:50,560
No, probably depends on some things, right? Like how close they are to it and where the effluent from that factory is going within that radius.

270
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:57,260
For you to really impact what the exposure and then potentially the dose would be.

271
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:06,450
All right. So these previous slides back to our figure here, we talked about magnitude, exposure and dose.

272
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,350
That's kind of where they fit on that diagram.

273
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:17,800
And then when we were talking about that exposure and dose difference and how it was one become another,

274
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:23,710
we then talked to talk about a contact boundary, so I guess here would be contact.

275
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:32,750
So our boundary includes the skin, eyes and other openings in the body, like the nose and mouth.

276
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:42,430
So that's where you have a lot of that entry into the body or exposure to dose the boundaries which the agent must cross to be absorbed into the body.

277
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:50,890
Um, include these. So we typically talk about the skin, eyes, the lungs a lot as well as the GI tract for ingestion.

278
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:57,390
So here is this diagram talking about human exposure science and the diagram they make.

279
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:02,340
It's just a blob. I don't know why they couldn't, like, at least put a humanoid figure of some kind.

280
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:08,040
Well, it's a blob, but you have an agent and you have this contact boundary.

281
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:11,490
That exposure is what's present at that contact boundary.

282
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,240
And then what gets through that boundary is it's concert notes.

283
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:25,040
This textbook also gives a couple of examples here with some of just their feet in the water versus somebody fully submerged.

284
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:33,360
That contact boundaries can differ, and thus your estimate of exposure based on something in that water would probably change drastically.

285
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:42,660
But it depends on a lot of factors. Yeah. Yeah. So the word sounds like agents exposures and be like the intake fraction.

286
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:50,969
Intake fraction would be it depends on the intake fraction also has multiple meanings.

287
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:57,480
I think at the human level we're at the population level, I guess like for like a population level, something like telegraph emitted.

288
00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:01,950
Yeah, yeah. Then yeah, at the human level then it would be further down.

289
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:03,280
But yeah the population over Yeah.

290
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:08,819
That region to that exposure and we'll talk about pathways that's what we mean when we talk about pathways of exposure

291
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:16,890
is getting from that agent getting to that how they get to the person that boundary and we'll talk about that later.

292
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:21,560
Next week, I believe. Okay.

293
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,970
So again, I'm and this is this can maybe go quick.

294
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:33,740
So we're again, sort of picking out each of these steps along the way.

295
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,840
So I'll do this briefly because some of it might be getting redundant.

296
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:42,600
But again, just trying to reiterate some of these things. So we're talking about type page and more examples here.

297
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:48,890
And this goes into to that source circle. We talked about some of the ways we can classify them.

298
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:53,040
So here we have again, anthropogenic versus non anthropogenic.

299
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:57,270
More examples. Arsenic in groundwater. It's a big one internationally.

300
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:00,900
Also in southeastern Michigan, there are some pockets of.

301
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:08,070
Of higher arsenic. And if you buy a house around here, you have to have arsenic just in the water first.

302
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:13,620
Another way to designate is community versus occupational.

303
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:19,750
So that setting. Here is the source for her.

304
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:24,290
So next we have time, activity and behavior.

305
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:29,990
So what are some and this is related to upstream human and natural factors.

306
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:34,490
So what are some reasons that individuals exposure to a particular hazard may vary over time?

307
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:42,640
Here? Yeah. Frequency. Duration. I think if you're really occupationally exposed to exercise.

308
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:47,710
Yeah. Now, let's dig into that a little bit. So how might that vary over time?

309
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,230
If you think more specifically.

310
00:31:51,680 --> 00:32:02,020
Like if you're like on the job, you're like, have a longer duration and you're like, if you have to apply frequently for a few years.

311
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:08,180
Yeah, right. Right. So yeah. Again, perspective could be over the course of a lifetime.

312
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:12,500
Could be, you know, a year career could be a year.

313
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:17,440
If you get down to the week level, the day level, it's going to vary what you do when you're at work versus at home probably, right?

314
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:27,090
Things like that. So yeah, that's a good example. Yeah. The seasonality of when the crops are being grown or harvested or when your, you know,

315
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:33,920
work is needed for that exposure and season is, is important for a lot of different types of exposures.

316
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:37,640
Well. And you know, there's over time.

317
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:46,030
Yeah. Like. Absolutely.

318
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:54,880
So, you know, it's a person's life stage. What about some of this legacy stuff.

319
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,660
Picture of somebody being sprayed DDT directly that might very old time right

320
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:06,310
so it's probably much more common between the 1950s than it is in the 2020s.

321
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:11,760
Okay. Those are good examples. We could go on and on, but I think those are good ones.

322
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:18,610
And what the result of that is, again, this time on the x axis here could be we could be talking about a minute.

323
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:22,050
We could be talking about a lifetime of guns and what you're interested in.

324
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:25,780
But it could be a continuous exposure that's pretty steady over time.

325
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:33,880
So that might be, you know, a constant ear level of something that doesn't change that you're breathing throughout the day.

326
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:37,630
Intermittent. What might be an example of something that's intermittent?

327
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:49,060
There's various peaks here. Maybe you work in a radiology lab and you're only allowed to have a certain amount of radiation per month.

328
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:53,740
So you get smarter than you get over your limits the way you other two months before come back in.

329
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:57,759
Or this could be, you know, my two year period.

330
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,120
And every time I go to the dentist, my x ray radiation.

331
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:05,979
Right. Going to work, coming home, commuting to work again.

332
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:12,129
This time frame might change depending on what you're thinking about, but there's tons of exposures that would be thought of as cigaret smoke,

333
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:15,970
somebody having a cigaret every few hours or minutes, whatever it might be.

334
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:24,760
Tons of examples there as well. Cyclic may not be as obvious, but seasonality is something that comes to mind there.

335
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:32,140
But you can have a lot of different examples. This is what I see a lot of random of.

336
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:37,540
You know, you get a we'll talk about different instrumentation and approaches to measuring.

337
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:46,840
It's kind of cool to look at some which provides that random is where a lot of things are, especially things that have a lot of different sources.

338
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:53,200
So if you're talking about, you know, I study phthalates a lot and there are so many different things that exposure.

339
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,240
A lot of times it's going to it's not like that.

340
00:34:56,110 --> 00:35:04,690
And then this last example is what we call concentrated things, and it's like this rapid build up and gradual decline.

341
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:09,159
Anything come to mind there? Drugs. I mean, medications.

342
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:19,450
Yeah. So when we talk about biomarkers, this this more familiar or something that is released into indoor air, for example, that dissipates over time.

343
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:24,580
Will you soon? Like I said, cigaret smoke gave us so many examples.

344
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:27,770
What? So many smoked a cigaret. One cigaret in a room.

345
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:33,400
You're going to have that high concentration, that person. And they don't smoke for a while and it's going to gradually go away.

346
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:39,620
So. Good. Those are some examples of patterns of exposure, temporal variability.

347
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:47,020
Another thing in addition to cigaret smoke that we like to talk about a lot is another one of our public public health events that we talk about.

348
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:54,649
A lot is led in gasoline. So here is over time from the seventies to the 2000, these various locations in California.

349
00:35:54,650 --> 00:36:03,980
Anybody here from California? Yeah. So this is California specific data and I refer to California quite a bit in this class.

350
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:07,610
I'm not from there, but I'm from Santa Barbara County.

351
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:15,590
Okay. Well, you were probably luckily born before the green was or after that.

352
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,649
Green was very, very high there.

353
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:27,380
So they did they have shown that gasoline used to contain that is just result in broad exposures across the population.

354
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:34,969
And you have some various factors on vehicle density and meteorological parameters and things that could influence that.

355
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:41,000
But as we've seen, whether the gasoline across the board has been has been good.

356
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,580
What are some reasons an individual's exposure might vary over space?

357
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:53,350
So think about that last figure, for example, I guess I gave a couple.

358
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:03,830
I don't remember. This is now your dress. Curtis You know, that's a big one.

359
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:13,130
It's air pollution and air quality. You know, there are over space thoughts and different policies between areas.

360
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:22,070
Absolutely. Things are allowed. Certain country or state, you're probably gonna see differences in the amount of exposure.

361
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:29,300
Anything else? Smoke from wildfires burning more or less exposed.

362
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:33,680
Yeah. So that's even, you know, it's climate.

363
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:38,030
So, you know, some places are more obviously more susceptible to that than others.

364
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:42,440
So that's going to vary by by location or space.

365
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:52,530
Yeah. So there's a lot in again perspective I can drill down to very mundane exposures and think about how that space can influence

366
00:37:52,760 --> 00:38:00,920
just fortune's proximity to that source and then factors that are going to impact the pathway of that exposure to the person.

367
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:08,879
Again, we'll talk about that more next week. So you guys mentioned air quality.

368
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:15,510
Good. Here's another California, for example, L.A. area with ozone.

369
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,800
Ground level ozone.

370
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:27,760
And then on the left, you have nationwide, you can see kind of what you might expect around urban areas that air quality is just worse.

371
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:36,140
The prime example is interesting how you don't see dark blue anywhere, right?

372
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:48,420
I don't see it. If they would have killed it. Canada is gorgeous that that benchmark of what is the ideal standard for everything else again.

373
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:51,650
Yeah. Right. So yeah, the scale is a little bit arbitrary.

374
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:53,930
Yeah. I don't know here.

375
00:38:53,930 --> 00:39:02,630
This is from so much up there and yeah, not in Montana and we've been in Glacier National Park and it's, it's, it's all my favorites.

376
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:08,179
It seems pretty clean up there in some of the tourist spots.

377
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:19,140
Again, like Texas has the best area. But again, I don't know what year this is from the bank on being the case but.

378
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:27,790
Yeah. So just an example. I mentioned pathways.

379
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:36,540
So again, kind of picking apart up in the left corner here the the figure so this upstream human and natural factors obviously can impact your source.

380
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:42,910
You know, building that factory, building that incinerator, but can also impact that relationship between your source and your intensity.

381
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:47,379
And that's what we're talking about with Pathways. And we'll come back to this. So I'm not going to spend much time on this.

382
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:55,490
Just a. True. Then you have further down.

383
00:39:55,910 --> 00:40:02,209
Once you get to that exposure, that exposure potential, getting to the person, those exposure routes, again,

384
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:11,000
we're going to talk about this next week, but the main ones are ingestion, inhalation and dermal and dermal can be broken down.

385
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:16,510
Those are the main ones. Can be both into others. Intravenous.

386
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:23,389
Yep. Yeah. And then when you talk about the maternal fetal interface, so there's others.

387
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:27,830
But in general, these are the ones we have we think about.

388
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:41,170
To. And then there's the susceptibility factors that we'll touch on throughout the semester age life stage, which we've touched on that already.

389
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:48,839
Culture and lifestyle, how people go about. Living and things that are customary activities, occupation.

390
00:40:48,840 --> 00:41:00,720
Obviously we talk about your graphic distribution and the socioeconomic status is we see time and again predictor or factor and exposures.

391
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:07,800
So there's tons of examples like this. This is an older one, but looking at, you know, different ways of of scoring an environmental hazard,

392
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:16,170
you can see clear relationships between household income and lower environmental risk scoring or whatever you want to call it,

393
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:20,770
versus those with lower income sources of income status.

394
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:26,970
And it can vary by what particular agent we're concerned with.

395
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:32,070
So this is another figure. So led cadmium. We see that all over the place where.

396
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:40,600
More disadvantaged communities have much higher levels. But it's interesting, you see sort of a trend sometimes with.

397
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:50,230
Why do you think mercury and arsenic lead times tend to be higher among more, highly more high income populations?

398
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:58,530
Until now, we haven't talked about these animal welfare mercury like eating fish and seafood's expensive, right?

399
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:04,980
Yeah. And part of a healthy Mediterranean diet that maybe a lot of people can't afford.

400
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:13,290
So, yeah, it's good. But one of the best phenols, PFOA, one of the fast chemicals tends to be in.

401
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:20,809
Products. New products. Flame retardants that put into newer products might have more of these.

402
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:23,360
They're more stain resistant, more fire resistant.

403
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:30,860
So people are able to afford the fancy new furniture, the fancy homes, the personal care products might get more.

404
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:32,690
However, there's a flipside to that.

405
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:41,780
So once they get banned, that exposure bolus moves probably from the higher income to the lower income as people, you know, replace their furniture.

406
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:47,120
They don't necessarily get rid of it. It goes through the second hand market, whatever.

407
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:54,050
So that shift can happen based on where you are in the legacy of a particular chemical.

408
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:57,410
See the same thing with personal care products.

409
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:03,170
You know why these chemicals have been taken out of the fancier, more expensive ones that you see in the store.

410
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:07,249
But a lot of the cheaper ones of dollars to replace still have tons of these chemicals.

411
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:14,090
And so we're likely to see a shift there. Okay.

412
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:22,640
Back to dose. So we talked about exposure differing from dose, but that there's different specific types of dose.

413
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:27,740
So here they are in figure form. There's a text form of this on the next slide.

414
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:31,280
That's what we're going to look at. So I'll try to do it on this one.

415
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:35,000
So this is just an example of using the skin on the left.

416
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,630
There you have potential dose. So that's kind of like exposure.

417
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:46,370
You know, in some settings that might be equivalent to exposure, but you have a certain amount of this mystery substance on the surface of skin.

418
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:51,190
However, it's just the potential dose. It's not nothing's gone through yet.

419
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:55,220
The applied dose is that blocked.

420
00:43:55,500 --> 00:44:00,290
And so being a three dimensional blob, it's now just what's actually touching the skin.

421
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:06,830
You don't have that depth to the the chemical, you know, maybe because of surface tension or whatever it might be.

422
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:11,570
Not all the chemical in that drop is actually touching the skin. That's where a high dose comes in.

423
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:17,450
And then what's getting through the skin is absorbed dose and that gets into the

424
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:21,770
bloodstream and it might turn into a delivered dose to a target organ of interest,

425
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:26,990
which then may turn into what we call a biologically effective dose at a target.

426
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:34,610
So that's what the amount of the chemical that's actually going to lead to changes in health that you're most concerned about.

427
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:41,089
So in practice, all of this is theoretical on the human side and toxicology,

428
00:44:41,090 --> 00:44:47,270
you can take care of some of these, by the way, you dose whatever animals or cells, whatever.

429
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:56,419
But in our case, we can't think of a theoretically, but if you want to know really what's on the side,

430
00:44:56,420 --> 00:45:00,499
like the epidemiologist side, it'd be great to know what the biologically effective dose is,

431
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:01,640
because if you're way back here,

432
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:07,550
there's a lot that can happen between here and here that might impact how much of the chemicals are actually going to.

433
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:15,060
Interacting. Directly affect your health.

434
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:22,409
So the problem is biologically affected doses very difficult to come up with in practice.

435
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:27,360
Right. So we'll we'll touch on that throughout the semester as well.

436
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:34,160
Where things lie here, it's a lot of times we're at potential dose, maybe even further upstream from that and the exposure, obviously.

437
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:41,709
You might get an implied decision that might be more of a toxicology term, but absorbed dose with biomarkers.

438
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:45,520
A lot of times we can live there. Human studies.

439
00:45:48,890 --> 00:45:55,040
So that's again, this is the text version of the new information on the notes.

440
00:45:55,070 --> 00:46:01,060
I'm not going to read this. Any questions on the doses and all are confused at the potential dose.

441
00:46:01,070 --> 00:46:06,260
You said it was kind of like the exposure, but it's kind of different.

442
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:11,480
Oh, yeah, you're right. Yeah, it's a little more downstream than exposure.

443
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:18,830
And if you look at the how it's written, you're right that you think of like central dose as like the amount of the contaminant and the exposure.

444
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:31,000
So that's magnitude, again, might depend on context, might differ on different situations, but potential dose.

445
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:34,470
So this would be you will get at this in more detail.

446
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:40,180
But, you know, I'm inhaling I have my lung function now as far as I can run six liters or something.

447
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:47,829
I'm like a big full breath. Not all of that is going to contact the surface of my lungs and not all of it's going to be utilized.

448
00:46:47,830 --> 00:46:51,850
So I breathe out, especially in the top part of my airway.

449
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:55,570
It's going to be just kind of dead air as exhale again.

450
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:59,620
So that potential dose doesn't turn into an applied dose because it never really has that.

451
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:07,490
That opportunity. So that's just one example. The skin example I saw before were not all that touched.

452
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:13,580
So those are just some very detailed examples that might be more than we can really pick apart.

453
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:17,809
But it does become important. We talk next week about pathways and routes.

454
00:47:17,810 --> 00:47:22,130
We do get into that a bit. These are good questions, though.

455
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:28,200
Instead of high doses,

456
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:37,260
what is actually at that surface that can be and then what's absorbed is based on something like a bio availability that we'll touch on here.

457
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:41,010
Slides. Any other questions?

458
00:47:48,270 --> 00:47:53,350
Stay hydrated, have access to water. I believe water.

459
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:57,470
And I got a drink. I think it's pretty clean, but I'm not good.

460
00:47:58,530 --> 00:48:04,320
Okay. So this is, again, a little bit different, but, you know, sauce to health effect on the left,

461
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:07,860
you know, kind of how we're thinking of it from the exposure human side.

462
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,260
On the right is more on the toxicology side,

463
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:19,440
how you might think of it once it gets into at that cell or tissue of of concern that's what they we're talking about toxicological and

464
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:27,419
medically here's what we're thinking about exposure and a lot of times we're left with a lot at the top here and maybe a little bit here,

465
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:32,810
kind of what kind of biomarkers and pharmacokinetic modeling we have access to.

466
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:38,790
But again, just kind of for reference to differentiate the disciplines within our discipline.

467
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:48,890
All right. Exposure, industry, integrated exposure. That's the sum of the exposure to an aged B, all relative exposure over a specified time period.

468
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:54,710
So if you remember those profiles, I'll show we've talked about the intermediate, intermittent, continuous random.

469
00:48:55,130 --> 00:48:57,260
If you take the area or that curve of any of those,

470
00:48:57,260 --> 00:49:07,010
that would be your integrated exposure and that would be communicated in units of concentration multiplied by time.

471
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:13,580
So it might be, you know, milligrams per cubic meter at time, year or whatever you're at.

472
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:19,960
But that's not that's more of a risk assessment term. And some of these terms I'll try to fill you in on, you know,

473
00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:28,130
for what setting there they might be used and so integrated exposure in a lot of time you'll be think of that

474
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:36,410
in risk or maybe even epidemiology sometimes or the area of the curves where you're looking at dose rate,

475
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,810
total dose to over time period of dosing,

476
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:47,270
that's probably going to be more relevant to toxicology where you have control over it and you really want to know that that time period.

477
00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:57,590
So you'll see these types of units. So a unit of mass per unit time or a normalized body weight, so no kind of kg day,

478
00:49:57,890 --> 00:50:02,780
that's the type of thing you'll see a lot toxicology and sometimes in risk assessment when you try to.

479
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:12,350
Estimate how much dose a person has in the context of what is known toxicological.

480
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:17,690
That will make sense later. So I'm just. You don't need to remember that.

481
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:19,990
I'm just trying to different because this can be kind of confusing.

482
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:25,840
The reason why there are so many different ways we communicate things is, again, because they probably came about in different.

483
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:33,420
Disciplines and realms that are applied in different ways. Okay.

484
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:39,790
So to try to illustrate some of this, here's an exposure profile that concentration times time might be your trade

485
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:43,810
exposure for that time frame or is your integrated exposure for that time period?

486
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:50,410
But again, that might be used in risk assessment or epidemiology. What we talk to exposure terms.

487
00:50:51,470 --> 00:50:56,380
Like you're seeing, they start talking about EPA or OSHA, an occupational settings.

488
00:50:56,390 --> 00:51:04,490
What we usually talk about is a time weighted average. That's what that T stands for is time weighted average where it's just a concentration.

489
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:12,610
So it's that. Integrated, supposedly divided by that time period to come up with just an average concentration.

490
00:51:12,790 --> 00:51:14,620
And that's how a lot of standards are set.

491
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:21,940
And that's usually how we report things in what we call an integrated exposure sample, attempting to do sampling strategies.

492
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:31,390
So this one is a big one. We see it exposure realm, but again, this dose rate more common in risk assessment and toxicology.

493
00:51:32,410 --> 00:51:35,710
So dose rate is equal to all those over time period of dosing.

494
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:44,440
So we talk about total dose being some sort of mass of agent or chemical, both by the body weight of, say, a rodent or a person to a by time.

495
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:48,370
And that's how you get these these units in milligrams per kg day.

496
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:55,250
For those applications you are able to repeat with GW based on time weighted average.

497
00:51:55,370 --> 00:52:01,639
So as we'll see, an occupational 8 hours is used a lot as an eight hour time weighted average.

498
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:05,210
This very common designation for a standard so.

499
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:10,689
But you can compare it to. Sorry.

500
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:14,770
That's not listed here. Benefit thing.

501
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:19,680
Attention. Classifying exposure based on duration.

502
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:24,630
So the period over which a person exposed we talked about acute versus chronic.

503
00:52:24,990 --> 00:52:35,770
So acute is very short term. So this might be. A hazardous gas that gets put out by something that really impacts you right on the spot.

504
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:40,180
And there's a lot of different examples of that, especially in occupational settings.

505
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:47,470
So it's very short term. The exposure is brief a lot of times, and the effect is quick.

506
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:50,200
On the flip side, that's chronic exposure.

507
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:56,500
So that's something that you might be interested in over the lifetime of a person, for example, works many years through cancer.

508
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:59,290
A lot of times we think of cancer as a chronic disease,

509
00:52:59,290 --> 00:53:06,020
and we also think about it as a chronic user related to exposures that take place over long periods of time as well, although not always.

510
00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:11,110
And then in between, there are a lot of times where I see that I do a lot of reproductive and development work.

511
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:15,820
That's a lot of times considered so prior, you know, weeks, months,

512
00:53:16,270 --> 00:53:22,240
we're talking about pregnancy or a couple of years for different life stages and childhood and things like that.

513
00:53:22,810 --> 00:53:26,230
So it's just some general designations which.

514
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:33,370
Duration of exposure that can be applied to exposure. And then you also hear these terms apply to disease as well.

515
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:40,460
And they're also used in toxicology studies, sometimes refer to acute studies, chronic studies and sometimes.

516
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:48,230
Timing of exposure assessment in relation to exposures.

517
00:53:48,270 --> 00:53:55,040
This is we're going to talk a lot this semester about approaches and tools that we have for measuring exposure.

518
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:59,360
And some of what we can do is limited by where we are in time.

519
00:54:00,110 --> 00:54:03,650
So a lot of times we want to know historically what the exposures or this.

520
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:10,080
For some reason we might find that there are some applications to that.

521
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:15,450
All sorts of audiences are interested in historical exposures epidemiologists.

522
00:54:15,450 --> 00:54:22,500
Epidemiologists, for sure. So that's where we get our actual data, our observational data.

523
00:54:24,310 --> 00:54:29,140
Retrospective study case control, for example. Any other audiences you think of?

524
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:40,810
Attorneys love foreclosures. That's where a lot of legal cases involving chemical exposures.

525
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:45,030
A lot of it's based on historical retrospective exposure.

526
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:50,170
So. And that can lead to compensation claims.

527
00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:56,470
Fields has a lot of different samples. Beryllium is a big one that's been around for a couple of decades.

528
00:54:57,690 --> 00:55:01,800
While this historical retrospective. Current exposure.

529
00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:12,720
This is a great place to be because then we can use all these fancy technologies that we have in real time based on what our interests are,

530
00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:20,670
to actually quantitatively measure exposure. That could be done in the workplace or more broadly, the general population.

531
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:26,110
It can be done for different media. So air, water, soil.

532
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:31,330
So then you have prospective. So this is trying to predict the future.

533
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:40,090
What's the exposure going to be? And this is tricky. This involves a lot of trying to use what we know currently and apply it to whatever situation.

534
00:55:40,930 --> 00:55:46,000
So, you know, you know, proposed ways, etc., they want to put it somewhere where the exposure is going to be.

535
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:57,670
Then they try to predict and act accordingly. And that can be, as you might expect, very messy and can be quite controversial as well.

536
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:06,310
If there are parties that want to minimize the risk and other parties that think it's not being fully accounted for,

537
00:56:06,610 --> 00:56:13,420
you can get a lot of a lot of debate going through city councils, states.

538
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:17,670
And you know what? This then ties them to environmental justice.

539
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:24,280
Another topic that sort of underlies everything we talk about. Okay.

540
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:29,590
And this is just another just brief intro that we're going to get more much more in depth as we go through the semester.

541
00:56:30,490 --> 00:56:35,770
But assessment approaches, we have direct methods usually that's limited to our current.

542
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:40,280
Although if you have archived biological specimens because you get.

543
00:56:41,290 --> 00:56:50,800
Historical biomarkers, and then you have the indirect methods or lot times a combination of multiple approaches is the best way to go,

544
00:56:51,860 --> 00:57:04,440
and we will cover all. Things as we go, but direct methods when available are thought to be the best the best way to go, but not always feasible.

545
00:57:07,510 --> 00:57:11,240
This is that same figure overlaying with song.

546
00:57:11,710 --> 00:57:13,960
This is the Committee of Experts again,

547
00:57:14,350 --> 00:57:21,520
where they're overlaid it with some emerging technologies that can be used to inform various points along the way here.

548
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:24,910
This is not thought to be exhaustive or anything.

549
00:57:24,910 --> 00:57:29,590
It's just as an example of using more remote sensing GIS.

550
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:34,370
G.P.S. Participatory assessment, which you do see a lot more.

551
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:37,840
I mean, I could be participating in my studies with my watch right now.

552
00:57:40,370 --> 00:57:44,990
Can't remember if I know currently. But there there are some other Professor Knights.

553
00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:51,110
That's one example. It's a study that utilizes the Apple products.

554
00:57:51,950 --> 00:57:55,310
This is not an advertisement. It just happened to have.

555
00:57:56,590 --> 00:58:01,690
Okay. So this is just an example of some emerging technologies that could be used to inform various points along there.

556
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:08,290
In general, this is how we think of the exposure that we're able to get.

557
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:14,880
It's not considered equal. Some is considered better than others, and this is in general application there.

558
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:21,040
You could think of a lot of different scenarios where one might actually be better than something more.

559
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:32,500
But in general, this is thought to be a hierarchy where quantified personal measurement would be the best and even better than there would be.

560
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:39,790
You know, you might differentiate between like a personal data sample or a biomarker, but, you know, and we'll talk about that once.

561
00:58:39,790 --> 00:58:45,939
But personal measurement is thought to be the best area measurement, we call it.

562
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:51,250
So, you know, maybe it's something at the home or at the work station that's qualitative.

563
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:57,430
And then we're getting into what we call surrogates. And exposure is something we thought to represent what exposure might be.

564
00:58:58,060 --> 00:59:04,900
But as we go further down this list, you can see how more and more and more areas might be introduced for an individual or a population.

565
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:12,220
With that, you start thinking about estimates of water use where they get the water from distance from a particular site.

566
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:20,680
Distance of a residence to a landfill, for example, duration of employment.

567
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:26,680
So you can see how you mean less specific, but sometimes that's how you can have access to,

568
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:31,990
especially when you talk about retrospective or future prospective assessments.

569
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:40,870
Any questions on this? How do we describe exposures?

570
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:45,550
So here's a distribution and we'll talk more about these as well.

571
00:59:47,530 --> 00:59:53,800
So that's the average. They're measuring the central fancy geometric mean median, whatever it might be.

572
00:59:54,310 --> 01:00:03,490
That's what we tend to focus on for a lot of applications. Risk assessment and toxicology epidemiology standards.

573
01:00:04,650 --> 01:00:07,950
Comparing two standards. But is that always what you want? You might.

574
01:00:08,070 --> 01:00:10,500
There's a lot of cases that we'll talk about you might want to know.

575
01:00:10,890 --> 01:00:18,300
But that top individual is where that top five percentile for them for the application of interest.

576
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:23,129
So that's within the population. Again,

577
01:00:23,130 --> 01:00:29,250
back to some of those parameters we talked about are interest in that that time weighted average exposure for a person or there are things

578
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:37,080
that might be acute hazards that you want to know that peak if it's something that could make you extremely sick within minutes or kill you,

579
01:00:37,890 --> 01:00:46,260
you probably would be more interested in that peak exposure rate. So again, knowing the the situation and what the interest is and again,

580
01:00:46,290 --> 01:00:50,900
maybe a lifetime epidemiology studies more interested in that integrated exposure.

581
01:00:53,400 --> 01:01:03,270
So it's something I always think about. So say we use some of these approaches to measure exposure, then we do that.

582
01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:10,800
A lot of times we might be able to compare that standard and this is where things get confusing and we have future lectures on these as well,

583
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:16,169
but it's going to differs on setting. So in occupational realm,

584
01:01:16,170 --> 01:01:20,790
you have something called the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygiene and

585
01:01:20,790 --> 01:01:25,890
we'll talk about that more detail as well as the Patient Safety and Health Administration.

586
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:30,569
And then I asked the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health all have different

587
01:01:30,570 --> 01:01:37,680
values and things that you compare to that's in the workplace and in a more general environment.

588
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:42,030
You have EPA, FDA here in this country and the World Health Organization.

589
01:01:43,110 --> 01:01:46,860
You get to here, there's there's some differences between these,

590
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:50,880
even within occupational and environmental, whether they're legal, legally enforceable or not.

591
01:01:51,810 --> 01:01:56,550
So just because something's on the books does not necessarily mean you can legally take action.

592
01:01:57,270 --> 01:02:02,460
So so there there are some differences there as well. But we'll talk about these in future.

593
01:02:04,270 --> 01:02:10,480
Okay. Let's try now. So Jane and her son Joe live in Detroit.

594
01:02:10,670 --> 01:02:17,140
The airborne PM 2.5 levels. So it's particulate matter that is less than 2.5 meters in diameter.

595
01:02:18,010 --> 01:02:21,700
And what can really get to discuss that in the future as well?

596
01:02:22,210 --> 01:02:25,600
But those concentrations are 50 micrograms per cubic meter.

597
01:02:26,290 --> 01:02:34,240
People inhale. Despite what we talked about last time, we're going to say one cubic meter of air per hour through their lungs over one day period.

598
01:02:36,010 --> 01:02:41,650
Hey, what is the concentration of PM 2.5 and what would change in Joe's 2.5 dose?

599
01:02:42,370 --> 01:02:47,020
So I'll give you a minute work on this. You can talk to the person, people next to you if you'd like.

600
01:02:48,970 --> 01:02:54,100
Couple of minutes here. Mentioned analysis.

601
01:02:58,050 --> 01:03:02,280
Q. Just.

602
01:03:32,150 --> 01:03:46,630
24. That's.

603
01:03:49,190 --> 01:03:53,330
All right. In the interest of time, all this continue on here.

604
01:03:53,810 --> 01:03:59,530
So what you guys think, what is the concentration on this?

605
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:06,709
Yeah. Trick question. I actually gave it away when I was describing this as trying to get to the nuance of the definitions.

606
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:14,650
But we said levels here and that's sort of like a non scientific term we throw out for example sometimes, but yeah, that's just 15.

607
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:22,520
So that's kind of a trick question here is given what would be their dose, 1200 milligrams a day?

608
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:32,080
And how did you come up with that? So if they're like inhaling 50 micrograms each hour and then the day is just like 24 hours, then 50 times.

609
01:04:33,470 --> 01:04:38,190
Okay. So another shot as well. Okay.

610
01:04:39,810 --> 01:04:44,760
What do we think about her?

611
01:04:46,670 --> 01:04:50,459
Answer. Exposure equals going to frequency.

612
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:56,190
Duration. Yeah. 1200 micrograms is equal to 1.2 milligrams.

613
01:04:58,110 --> 01:05:05,610
Put that into context. How many mosquitoes can fit into 1.2 milligrams and hold that in my hand?

614
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:17,200
How much does a mosquito weigh? It's 12.2 milligrams of the chemical sometimes is thought to be per may be harmful a mosquito

615
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:24,399
if you Google it which I did before class is usually about 2.5 I think they say milligrams.

616
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:28,700
So that's half a mosquito. So we're talking about very small amounts that can be harmful.

617
01:05:29,230 --> 01:05:33,520
We're talking about the lungs. So I have several issues with this problem.

618
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:40,020
What's one, if you may think of why I might have an issue with this, it is to consider groups of people.

619
01:05:40,050 --> 01:05:43,290
Yep, we're using the term dose when it's actually exposure.

620
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:46,930
We all talk about bioavailability or absorption, so. That's exactly right.

621
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:51,650
So that's. Sort of some trickery. What else?

622
01:05:52,070 --> 01:05:55,970
I said, Jane and Joe's premium 2.5.

623
01:05:58,490 --> 01:06:01,690
That's assuming they breathe the same air and are doing the same activities.

624
01:06:01,780 --> 01:06:08,300
There's a lot there that might result in that varying more than we're letting on.

625
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:16,220
Oops. So again, we say dose here, but here in this problem we're actually talking about.

626
01:06:16,910 --> 01:06:26,700
So just make note of that. Another example, an old drinking water supply contains lead at a concentration of 50 micrograms per liter.

627
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:31,620
A 12 year old male weighs 50 and a half kilograms, drinks water from the town supply.

628
01:06:31,650 --> 01:06:36,630
What is his likely average daily dose of lead, assuming the bioavailability is five?

629
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:40,680
So we didn't really talk about DDT. So I'm not going to have you do this one, but just walk through it.

630
01:06:42,450 --> 01:06:46,320
So to do this one, it's a magnitude of absorbed dose.

631
01:06:47,010 --> 01:06:49,860
We need several piece of information, the amount of water ingested.

632
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:56,970
So we talked about last time with that inflation rate, you know how much people you know per day.

633
01:06:57,360 --> 01:07:04,370
They have data like that on water ingestion. We also know the chemical concentration of the water which was given in the problem,

634
01:07:04,380 --> 01:07:08,850
this data problem as well as the bioavailability, just like we talked about in that last problem,

635
01:07:08,850 --> 01:07:16,200
the difference between exposure and dose in an equation like this is some sort of bioavailability or absorption factor to apply to it.

636
01:07:17,030 --> 01:07:23,310
In the case of lead, there's actually evidence that children absorb more less than adults, just as a side note.

637
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:30,729
So the EPA Exposures Handbook is really a useful source of information for things like this.

638
01:07:30,730 --> 01:07:38,010
So it has distributions for drinking, water consumption rates, breast milk, food, breathing rates,

639
01:07:38,310 --> 01:07:44,370
talking about body weights, a whole bunch of different things, and they updated every so often.

640
01:07:45,210 --> 01:07:50,520
So here's a version looking at ingestion of water and you can see they have percentile.

641
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:54,650
So that's, you know, you have a mean and then, you know,

642
01:07:54,660 --> 01:08:00,120
if you're half halfway through the population or greater than half the population less than the other half,

643
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:06,840
that's your median or 15 percentile than the high end of your 95th percentile estimate for different age ranges.

644
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:16,590
So we in this problem, we're talking about a 12 year old, so maybe 600 milliliters or 0.6 liters per day of water consumed.

645
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:20,100
So is that what we want to use?

646
01:08:21,390 --> 01:08:27,960
Maybe depends on what worst scenario in the average estimate or interested in maybe somebody who could be at higher risk.

647
01:08:28,350 --> 01:08:33,419
It's going to depend on the setting and unfortunately, it might depend on who you work for sometimes.

648
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:36,240
Right. So just keep that in mind.

649
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:47,250
So I mentioned 80 days that's your average daily dose is calculated as I type C times B over by BW, which is pretty simple.

650
01:08:47,580 --> 01:08:52,899
So it's your ingestion rate from that table we just looked at in terms of concentration of the chemical

651
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:57,240
in water which was given times your available availability which was also given in this case.

652
01:08:57,240 --> 01:09:01,890
Sometimes you might need to look in the literature or something, but if you see it on an exam and it's not given,

653
01:09:02,820 --> 01:09:06,900
you know, you don't have to use and then divide it by the body weight.

654
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:11,340
So for this one, those are given.

655
01:09:11,340 --> 01:09:17,430
And then again, it's going to depend on what we assume for that integrate. Once we measure it, we can measure it for Joe.

656
01:09:17,430 --> 01:09:21,120
No, this is Joe. This is somebody else. Joe's the last problem.

657
01:09:22,050 --> 01:09:26,220
This doesn't this doesn't give us a name. So unnamed person.

658
01:09:27,510 --> 01:09:34,440
Again, we want we have a measured amount that they consume of water or do we use one tables

659
01:09:34,450 --> 01:09:38,630
and that's what part of that distribution which is select to tease anguished.

660
01:09:39,420 --> 01:09:46,470
So again I just want to state this example is not to necessarily work out but to think about the various components of it.

661
01:09:48,340 --> 01:09:53,110
And the calculation itself is pretty straightforward. You just need to pay attention to the units.

662
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:56,829
Usually the trickiest part. Okay.

663
01:09:56,830 --> 01:10:03,220
So another example of using different approaches to exposure estimation.

664
01:10:03,580 --> 01:10:05,650
I like this example of silica.

665
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:14,080
So silica is in sand and if you break it up into small enough pieces, they can get in the lungs and never come back out and form scar tissue.

666
01:10:14,980 --> 01:10:20,890
So how do you estimate silica? So you can use sampling equipment and measure it in the air.

667
01:10:22,630 --> 01:10:26,180
And this this is an epidemiologist say where they used three different approaches.

668
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:30,910
One was just implement duration to beat back the hierarchy of exposure estimates.

669
01:10:31,900 --> 01:10:35,320
Employee duration is pretty dumbed down and pretty far right.

670
01:10:35,950 --> 01:10:39,320
It might be a decent estimate for something like this.

671
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:42,610
How long did you work in that type of job that could be exposed to silica?

672
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:48,369
The other one is exposure concentrations. So they had some data from some sampling.

673
01:10:48,370 --> 01:10:54,820
But again, that might be just one day or a series of days out of however long that the job was going on.

674
01:10:55,660 --> 01:10:58,870
And that had a different sort of ratio.

675
01:10:59,290 --> 01:11:02,200
So this first employment duration, you don't see much dose response.

676
01:11:02,380 --> 01:11:07,690
I don't know if you've heard epidemiology yet, but for odds ratios we're looking at one is immunity.

677
01:11:08,350 --> 01:11:10,600
Anything greater than one is increased risk.

678
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:18,640
So a dose response we'd like to see like that nice progression above one and we're not really seeing that dose response here.

679
01:11:18,670 --> 01:11:21,970
You do see it for greater than 27. You do see that elevated risk.

680
01:11:22,330 --> 01:11:30,309
But it's not really with years. As you go through those categories, you also see an increase with that exposure,

681
01:11:30,310 --> 01:11:33,610
concentration from those probably limited in measurements that were available.

682
01:11:33,940 --> 01:11:41,380
But they went on to combine those two different sources of information into a cumulative estimate.

683
01:11:41,620 --> 01:11:45,430
You do see this dose response were increased at each category.

684
01:11:45,970 --> 01:11:53,230
So again, trying to utilize all the information you can get access to in a way that makes sense sometimes can be to your best.

685
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:58,490
Exposure assessment depending on the goals of your effort.

686
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:07,400
Okay. So just a couple of minutes here left.

687
01:12:07,410 --> 01:12:13,440
How you go about getting information about these exposures? One is asbestos exposure among shipyard workers.

688
01:12:14,050 --> 01:12:19,320
What kind of stuff you want to know? Again, we don't really talk about this.

689
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:23,250
So this is just me kind of getting to know where you guys where your heads are at.

690
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:28,470
Going back to again. My question, your experience. Yeah.

691
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:33,030
Did you work in a shipyard? Yeah. Might be a good place to start.

692
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:39,030
What else do you guys think? Where in the shipyard do you work or are you just a manager?

693
01:12:39,030 --> 01:12:45,690
Or are you actually using absolute hands? Absolutely. That proximity to the action as best it is.

694
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:52,500
It is like five times in a row anyway. Anything else?

695
01:12:54,970 --> 01:12:59,070
What sort of sick people do you use? Yeah. Yeah, they're wearing a respirator.

696
01:12:59,830 --> 01:13:06,760
That would definitely change the relationship between magnitude to exposure to dose, for sure.

697
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:11,110
If it was effective, it was worn properly. Right. Um.

698
01:13:11,650 --> 01:13:12,550
Okay. Yeah. Good.

699
01:13:12,940 --> 01:13:20,020
And then, of course, you have the technological approaches where you go out and actually use quite a bit of arsenic and the whole water supply.

700
01:13:21,070 --> 01:13:26,050
Types of information might be useful there. Yeah.

701
01:13:26,130 --> 01:13:29,710
It's more the quality tests. Yeah.

702
01:13:29,730 --> 01:13:35,160
Yeah. Lab data again, that might be from a different time or area.

703
01:13:35,670 --> 01:13:44,780
So you want to pay closer attention to how representative that might be. Questionnaires that involve symptoms of exposure to arsenic.

704
01:13:45,260 --> 01:13:51,380
Yeah. On more on the health side. What about just how much water do you drink from your home?

705
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:58,010
And some of our studies I'm finding out how complicated getting some of this information is.

706
01:13:58,310 --> 01:14:05,850
So we ask you about water usage and the mosquitoes super specific, like do it just part of your home.

707
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:11,080
They might say yes, but it might be very sparingly, depending on how they go up with it.

708
01:14:11,090 --> 01:14:15,620
So it can get kind of complicated to drill down to the specifics.

709
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:22,530
Prenatal exposures to let. But.

710
01:14:25,940 --> 01:14:33,200
Okay. Depending on how old somebody's house is, if it's painted to be and direct.

711
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:38,920
Yeah. I think the features I talked about like you. Yep.

712
01:14:39,710 --> 01:14:46,500
Sure. A biomarker and you know you can measure different umbilical cord blood might be,

713
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:51,360
you know, something more difficult or easier to get a different type of biofuel.

714
01:14:53,160 --> 01:15:02,129
Yeah. So again, you could have depending on the scope of or purpose or goal, um, you know, a lot of times we don't have access to people or blood,

715
01:15:02,130 --> 01:15:08,730
so we might be looking at what we know contains blood or might not be happening, so.

716
01:15:08,970 --> 01:15:13,470
Okay, good. We're out of time. So here's some resources if you're interested.

717
01:15:16,330 --> 01:15:21,170
Exposure. Pakistan, what we talk about and I think we'll come back to it, maybe promises of other things.

718
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:25,840
Thank you. Have a good weekend, including the military.
