1
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:30,170
Every path we head down has provided some really important ideas for anti-racist teaching.

2
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,500
The direction we're heading next is a big one. I want to think and learn more about our teaching environments.

3
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,220
Yeah, that's a good one. When I think about this, I categorize it in two ways.

4
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:47,330
First, there's the environment we facilitate for our learners in our shared space, like a classroom or training session.

5
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:52,100
But there's also the broader environment of the institution, or community we're a part of.

6
00:00:52,850 --> 00:01:00,020
When we head down this path, we're going to work on how to create and work towards anti-racist learning environments for our learners.

7
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,500
I remember as a student in my own master's program,

8
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:11,120
a particular incident in which I was made to feel less than. I emphasized my own lived experience to supplement an article. It felt like the

9
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:18,560
professor at the time was more committed to being right versus creating an environment that allowed me and my fellow students the space to share.

10
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:24,469
Obviously, it's something I still think about now that I'm a professor. Yeah, those types of experiences

11
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:25,340
stay with us.

12
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:33,680
We teach now, but we also have a lot of experience being the learner, both as university students and in the workshops or trainings we attend now.

13
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,250
I certainly have experienced a range of learning environments.

14
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,530
I think this unit can help us be reflexive about the environments we create as instructors.

15
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:50,030
We're going to focus on how learning environments can be harmful and how we can reimagine and rebuild them to be anti-racist.

16
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:55,460
By the end of it, we'll hear about collective action and ways towards institutional transformation.

17
00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:02,090
We hope that some of these exercises, readings and videos will help you think more deeply about your own classrooms.

18
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,010
That sounds great. Let's go!
