1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:08,220
She has this effect on people and this is real, and I hope it's going down a little better.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,740
All right, folks, how are we doing today? This last one met.

3
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,480
Congratulations. Hope everybody semester's wrapping up well.

4
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,940
Hope you're looking forward to a little bit of a break here. Anybody graduating this month?

5
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:32,940
They're all going to be all. So today we're going to have we're see how much we can kind of cram in here,

6
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,540
because I know this is a topic of interest to a lot of folks in the structure equation.

7
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,930
Marla. I'm going to ask something and you know, just be honest. It's okay.

8
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,030
I didn't have a lot of time. But did anybody take a look at the video, the kind of the overview?

9
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:56,010
Yes, I know it is. So we'll say this this this recap will give me an idea of kind of how folks how much we've internalized.

10
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:03,570
And then from there, we can either spend more time talking about some of the conceptual pieces or we can go through the work example.

11
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:11,129
Now, the the PowerPoint slides on canvas are overloaded with notes.

12
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:17,310
And the reason why is and I understand we're not going to have a lot of time plus this topic is is really complicated.

13
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:24,929
So the goal was to put more than we could possibly cover today, but that you could read more about it even within the slides.

14
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:30,480
So if you don't want to get into the readings of which there are a myriad, or if you don't want to try to find more information online,

15
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,640
you don't need to understand the 12 different fit indices that are going to be spit out every time we want one of these analyzes.

16
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,590
But they're there for you if you want to understand what they mean and how they're a little bit different.

17
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:46,770
And just reminders for some of the terminology, which I think is helpful is B, it's good to be conversant,

18
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:56,340
but at the same time the I think if you get some of the main ideas, you should be able to one, think about how this could be useful for your work.

19
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,520
But then too, if somebody does come in with their fancy structure for him and you can be,

20
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,400
oh, yeah, you were just talking about that's kind of behavior. All right.

21
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,320
So we'll go through some of the just the basics and then we'll see if we get to some of those examples.

22
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:10,860
That's it. Okay. All right.

23
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:17,070
Well, let's just see about that. Let's just see about that. You got to find a way. Not a lot of time during my time here.

24
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:21,570
It's a nice little softball coming to wrap it up there. Who wants to knock this one out of the park?

25
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,550
Don't make me calling people. Yeah.

26
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:31,800
Excited to see you, too. Half stretch. And you never remember what it was yesterday.

27
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:36,790
So manifest that we actually observed.

28
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:40,570
Yep. Yep. Latent variables are those.

29
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:49,150
Conscience didn't really measure. Mm hmm. And so we do things like factor analysis to find out.

30
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:55,990
Yes, exactly. So observe unobserved or unobservable.

31
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,440
Right. That's the difference. Why? If you use manifest, I don't know.

32
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:08,559
But they do. So we will be. It is the manifest are explicitly measured by accounts or by reports or observations.

33
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:16,780
Or people can tell us that things that are unobserved would be some of those attitudes and values and motivations,

34
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:27,550
things that we can directly pull out. They're not tangible. So thinking back to past models or here, what's the difference between these two?

35
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:31,010
And in fairness, the AB one should be low. Kirby one, Chris.

36
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,530
The first one is more of a world. Mm hmm.

37
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:41,110
Interesting. You are saying that. Exactly.

38
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:47,170
Unlike the regression that we've done earlier this semester and probably the message that you received in interest ads and other courses,

39
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:56,470
social equation models, all about that causal language. We want to say this is the path with which variable A affects variable B and so forth.

40
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:04,140
And in some cases, we're not saying that there is a direct causal connection between the two of them.

41
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:11,290
We just know that they cover it together. But oftentimes we are trying to put most of our variables into a picture or into

42
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:15,580
a model where it's pretty clear that one is causing another or multiple others.

43
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:24,660
Good. Two for two here. Oh, no, not so obvious.

44
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:36,810
Go for it. I think what they know is that you should have the ability to look at more than one word.

45
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,230
Yeah, that's the first thing that jumps right out of me.

46
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:46,350
With structural equation models, what we are doing is estimating, in most cases, simultaneous regression models.

47
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:53,550
All right. So instead of just having one outcome, we are allowed to have multiple outcome or dependent variables in our picture,

48
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,919
and we can estimate them all at the same time.

49
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:03,420
And the reason why that can be really helpful is oftentimes we're interested in outcome variables that are kind of related to each other.

50
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,520
They're not really disparate and independent.

51
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:11,850
And so we can think about outcomes that could be covariates that were predicting with different things in the model.

52
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:16,350
So that's one advantage. You may want to fire another one there.

53
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,930
I think we'll keep one. Yeah.

54
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:25,950
Right, right, right. So and this might begin to take a little bit time to wrap your head around.

55
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:31,080
But any time we seek output from a structural equation model, we are explicitly estimating error.

56
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:40,470
So we are to if the if you think about true score theory, which we covered very, very briefly and it's in all these textbooks back to 1950,

57
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:47,580
your observed score is a combination of your true value, plus the error in our measurement of which there always is error.

58
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:54,600
When we run a typical regression, we are kind of account where which are just trying to reduce some of that error.

59
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:59,310
In that equation, we structure equation models, we're going to give an explicit estimate to it.

60
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:06,480
So we have the parameter estimate where the error estimate and if you take out that error, then the logic goes, all you're left with.

61
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:17,340
Is that true score. And I'll tell I'll talk about this if we get to that example, what is a fintech index and why are we talking about the why part?

62
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:29,189
Anybody remember what if it indexes? Hint.

63
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,080
It's kind of in the name. Mm hmm.

64
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:46,620
So at this point, you said it would have been beneath me, as I have been in this city and I have been in this with EPO and was always open like that.

65
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:50,940
Glad that's recorded for purposes. Yes.

66
00:06:53,040 --> 00:07:04,100
But in that cease. Pull out the things you have an idea how all this stuff is supposed to be related, right?

67
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:09,560
You have a bunch of data or you're collecting some of this information that you're going to estimate as part of model.

68
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:17,000
The question then becomes, does the model that I estimate estimate are the data that have kind of fit the conceptualization that I have.

69
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,480
Do the variables that I think make up some latent score or latent variable?

70
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:25,010
Do they map on to that latent variable that the variables that I think are related in specific ways?

71
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:33,079
Are they actually related in these specific ways? And so the definitive indices asked the same question in sort of different ways.

72
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,100
They ask, in general, do my does my model kind of fit the data?

73
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:42,049
Does my model sort of mis fit the data relative to other models?

74
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:48,410
Does my model fit better when I think about all the things that are in the model?

75
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:54,050
Do we see correlations between them? Slightly different questions that more or less come down to the same thing.

76
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:58,370
We believe that they're all supposed to be relayed in a specific way. This is how we think they are.

77
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:05,010
Now let's try it out with some observe data and see what we get. What happened with.

78
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:25,990
Okay. Okay. Measurement is a measurement model, a tip jar.

79
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:32,790
It looks like the measurement of birth.

80
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:40,250
It's showing the relationship. Yeah.

81
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:47,560
Well, yeah. So what's the what we're talking about here is we're, we're estimating unobserved variables rate.

82
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:56,490
We're estimating two lane variables F1 and F2 that we think are made up of these indicator variables that are measured with a certain amount of air.

83
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:05,760
We are not talking about any sort of relationships between variables with the exception of those that sort of comprise the the indicators here,

84
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:13,140
we're not seeing how F1 relates to F2, we're not including any sort of other kind of structural paths here.

85
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:16,560
This is just telling us that these are allowed to covariate.

86
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:23,970
So this is your kind of standard measurement model, which any time you do have a structure equation model,

87
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:28,440
this is your first step, whether it's one latent variable or 12.

88
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:34,500
The first thing we're going to do before we ever start seeing how they all relate to each other is estimate that measurement model.

89
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:41,640
That's step one. And I think, Axel, you alluded to earlier, this is directly akin to running a factor analysis.

90
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,920
If these are all continuous variables and this is a continuous variable, if they're, you know,

91
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:52,770
dichotomous or some sort of different, you know, combination of variables, this might change.

92
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:56,580
But the principle is still the same. You're still conducting more or less of factor analysis.

93
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:02,110
How many factors are. Somebody said it.

94
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:07,100
Someone showed me behind a computer and it's not there. You go to two factors.

95
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:16,180
What tipped you off? To surface right lane variables, observe variables.

96
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:24,190
This is a convention. This is very I mean, this would be something where it would be a little bit of a gaffe if you do a whole bunch of circles.

97
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:30,040
So make sure that you're indicating lag variables versus observed variables or manifest variables versus error terms.

98
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,820
Error terms are not always depicted this explicitly.

99
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:40,870
But one of the things I like about how are forces you to conduct structural equation models is you have to think about this.

100
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:45,580
And here's a big difference between what we'll do today and what we did earlier in the semester.

101
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,620
We'll get to the exact same output,

102
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:55,150
but look at all the different things that we have to think about rather than saying one factor run for me or two factors.

103
00:10:55,330 --> 00:11:01,090
One for me, we have six items we ready to factor solution. Let's see what happens with structural equation models.

104
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:08,140
It's important to think about all of these different lines and how all of these different things relate to each other.

105
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:14,080
And believe it or not, structural equation models treat these things as part of the model.

106
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,290
These error terms that are allowed to co vary.

107
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:23,890
If we think some of these indicator variables are actually associated with each other, they're related in some way, right?

108
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:32,320
So this gives us a lot more flexibility in thinking kind of specifically about how all this stuff should sort of piece together.

109
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:35,770
That's where your model fit indices come into play.

110
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:42,130
I can try a whole bunch of wonky different things with this to see which one is the most reflective of reality.

111
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:45,550
Maybe these things are allowed to co vary, maybe they're not.

112
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:50,590
Maybe these three load on here, these three lower down here, maybe not.

113
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:55,540
Maybe it's five on here and then just one by itself or something. Those are all different ways that we could use.

114
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:59,350
We could think about these same six variables or test those same six variables.

115
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:06,510
He's busy. Yep. Zara terms.

116
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,980
Everybody see that? E six. You're.

117
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:18,020
Who? Class one.

118
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,040
What are you. What are you looking for? The bi directional arrow.

119
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:25,510
This can always be a curved line by convention is a curved line.

120
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:29,290
These are allowed to covariant. No causal mechanism assumed.

121
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:34,020
But they're associated in some way. We'll estimate that positive or negative.

122
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:49,620
Don't know. But we are assuming that they're associated. Kenny Fortune.

123
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:54,210
Yeah. How'd you do that? The air is coming off.

124
00:12:54,690 --> 00:13:08,440
Yeah. These? Well, I guess these exogenous or endogenous variables and diagnosis informed by something else,

125
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,070
no matter how wonderful, are informed by this exogenous variable.

126
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:16,390
So all these zeros are coming out of this factor into these observed variables,

127
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:22,600
factors that are informed by factor three factor to notice one, two and three are not.

128
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:32,590
But you know what? We could go wild and crazy. Giddy might say, You know what, I bet you x three is either just informed by factor two or maybe both.

129
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:38,770
Maybe both factor one and factor two. Or contribute some information to this this this observed variable.

130
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:42,730
We could be wild and crazy. We could be very conservative.

131
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:50,080
We could follow theory. Hopefully you're starting to see where some of the the strength opportunity here this is mean but I think it's good to know.

132
00:13:54,510 --> 00:14:09,450
And he guesses he got a 50% chance as both. Reflect the unobserved variable.

133
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:19,620
They reflect the factor. These are reflective contrasts that public health evokes in mind.

134
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:25,040
I'll give you one second this one, and then we'll contrast it. This is awesome.

135
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:39,149
That I covered this in the video. All right, then I want to ask you this, but this is Mrs. Gideon over identified model.

136
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:43,110
And this is going to come down to how many pieces of information that we have observed,

137
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:46,770
variables relative to how many things we're trying to estimate.

138
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,970
So all of these lines are things that we're trying to estimate.

139
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:58,170
They're all going to be parameters. The pieces of information that are allow us or there allow us to estimate those are the observed variables.

140
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:06,720
Here is the here's the bomber with structure equation models. Sample size is necessary but not sufficient to run structural equation models.

141
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:11,760
So you need to have enough people, but it's not going to help you with identification questions.

142
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:18,480
Identification. Identification questions are all about how many variables that we have and how many parts we want to estimate.

143
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:22,320
So I said that we could be wild and crazy scientists and start drawing parts all over here.

144
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:29,040
There is a limit and we'll talk about what do you mean, identify or defining under identified and just identified.

145
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:36,310
Yes. So identification is all about whether or not there is a unique solution to this model, whether or not so.

146
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:42,750
We've talked all semester about how we have data. We have a model in our mind and we kind of try different parameters on.

147
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:46,830
So we try a different means to see which one maps onto the data the best.

148
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:57,540
If you're asking it to try to estimate a model where there could be multiple sort of best solutions or there's just there's no way to really kind

149
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:08,070
of narrow down to one your under identified just identified is when you have the exact same number of pieces of information as you do have parts.

150
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:13,469
That's actually what happens in regression. That's great because you can at least estimate the model,

151
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:19,110
but you can't test you can't use those speed indices that we'll talk about over identified models.

152
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:23,730
You can not only test, but then you can also test. You can use those fit indices.

153
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:24,930
Okay.

154
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:34,590
So like when we run regression, we didn't run things late or we didn't get things like a CBC or compare to fit indices or root mean squared errors.

155
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:38,429
Right. So we had our other forms of fit indexes, right?

156
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:44,100
We had our squared and that kind of thing, but not within not the same to the same level of detail, I guess.

157
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,370
What this is, is just a red flag.

158
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:54,600
If you are as if you are trying to estimate something that's super, super complicated and your model doesn't converge, it doesn't spit out an output.

159
00:16:54,930 --> 00:17:00,870
Chances are this is the problem. Okay, so there are limits to what you can do.

160
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:04,829
And particularly if we have like two variables that we're going to think is

161
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:08,040
going to make up like a factor that becomes problematic if you're going to say,

162
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:13,650
all right, well, now I want my factor that only has two variables to predict all sorts of other stuff or get predicted by things.

163
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,550
All right. I'm returning to this one reflective.

164
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:29,940
But I do think for public health folks and medical folks, formative, where your latent variable is formed by observed variables.

165
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:36,330
When I think of like cumulative risk indexes that we use in some of our work, that's a good example.

166
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:43,800
When I think about neighborhood disadvantage or yeah, I guess that is one that we use for census data.

167
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:52,080
That's usually a combination of like percent unoccupied and single parent households or blah,

168
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,070
blah, blah, and those all kind of come together as a or an overarching sort of construct.

169
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:00,540
These are formed by these three manifest indicators.

170
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:10,410
On contrasted to this, where we assume how people are responding is because of their underlying levels of depression, for example.

171
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,300
Does that make sense? No. Right.

172
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:24,780
Right. Let me see how else I can explain this with most of the things that we collect from individuals that are unobservable.

173
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:31,140
Right. We don't say that because you responded to a specific or a particular set of survey items.

174
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:34,650
This is why you're depressed, for example. Right.

175
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:42,480
We believe that you have some under some level of depressive symptomology that we're going to try to capture with our proxy indicators,

176
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,100
the things that we ask. Have you been sad over the last couple of weeks? Do you have thoughts of suicide?

177
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,420
Do you have interest in doing some of the things that you love or have you lost interest?

178
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:56,190
Right. Those are all things that we think represent this underlying thing with inside of us,

179
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:08,010
our depressive symptomology or levels of depression that these indicators reflect what we are, what we're trying to assess that we can't see.

180
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,390
Does that make sense? Okay.

181
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:25,720
In this case. Something like socioeconomic status isn't driving your education, your level of income and your occupation.

182
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:41,830
It's because you have an MPH or an M.D. and you make lots of money and people will say, Oh wow, look at the person with the MPH or the me,

183
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:53,650
that they kind of come together and give you this combined term, this more holistic measure that we call socioeconomic status.

184
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:59,560
It's not something that we can directly pull out. It's a combination of these three pieces of information.

185
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:09,430
We will. And then it's not all that different from calculating a mean, but in structural equation models, we allow this to have mean.

186
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:17,350
With any measurement, we have some level of error. We're going to try to model that explicitly so we do can treat this as a latent variable.

187
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:24,890
Does that make sense? So that's kind of the big difference.

188
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:31,930
It's whether the observed stuff is causing the the variable or the latent variable is causing the observed stuff.

189
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:40,890
You can still have, like, observed rainbows like this one day of the week.

190
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:51,510
Yeah, you got it? Yep. So, you know, in this case, maybe income is related to stress in the in general,

191
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:55,150
but we think it's going to be mediated by socioeconomic status or something.

192
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:58,380
So we have these three variables that create yourself, this economic status,

193
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:03,360
and we're testing an association where X then predicts mental health or stress.

194
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:09,870
There's a potential mediating relationship there. Yeah. So this is best as this example is the form.

195
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:25,930
Yep. And I forgot last year when a student came to me in the school who was doing a model similar to this neighborhood,

196
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:31,630
disadvantaged, I think a variable very much similar to it. And so it does happen in practice I think, for public health folks again.

197
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:40,600
There's often times where we'll take things from the American survey or a community survey or from a for

198
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:44,949
any other kind of exaggerates things that we think might kind of come together and inform whatever it is,

199
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:49,450
could be the reflective model.

200
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:57,060
Could you repeat that example again? So the impacting the yeah.

201
00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:00,760
So rather than saying like I've been sad in the last two weeks,

202
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:08,860
I have no interest in doing things and I have thoughts of suicide making this, causing this.

203
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:13,300
It's because you feel this way that you responded to those items in this way.

204
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:19,960
It's because this because of this latent variable that we see these observed responses.

205
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:27,549
Whereas here it's because you have good education, that you have piracy is it's because you make more money.

206
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:30,700
You have. Yes, it is because you have occupied a high occupational status.

207
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:37,540
You make us. Yes. Or you have asked us or whatever is trying to think of another example.

208
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:55,980
My colleague Xing Fong Shear appears in the record with Oksana, by the way.

209
00:22:56,010 --> 00:23:00,300
Congratulations. Nice piece. Oh, I'm from HBO.

210
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:03,060
She does work Asian-American racism.

211
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:11,610
And so she has kind of a construct that's comprised of kind of microaggressions, microaggressions, microaggressions, some of the structural pieces.

212
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:17,940
They all kind of come together as a observed experiences that relate to this experiences of racism thing that we can't pull out.

213
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:26,890
Or we can just ask that what that is. It's a combination. And that's one of the ways that she models her measures.

214
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:33,660
Right. That's it's not because you've experiences of racism that you have microaggression.

215
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:37,300
It's the microaggressions that are derived driving part of that, that latent verbal.

216
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:48,910
All right, right, right. I don't know what we need to do.

217
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:53,680
Oh, well, I might as well as one more question. Hmm? Hmm.

218
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,500
We got you. Yeah.

219
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:01,430
This is like the this is like the big finale.

220
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:08,630
You let me keep this for such a tester?

221
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:17,680
Well, it's a nice way to start a story version.

222
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:24,739
Both the causal pathways. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

223
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:27,080
That's what it is. That's what this is all about.

224
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:33,649
Everything that we're going to do in the next 60 minutes or whatever is working towards something like this.

225
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:37,430
And I promise you, I promise you, I promise you. You've done this, you got this.

226
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:40,670
I get that. This is feels super complicated, but it's not.

227
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:44,570
There are measurement models and structural models.

228
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,950
When you combine them together, you have a full structural equation model.

229
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:53,270
A measurement model is simply trying to estimate these latent variables.

230
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:57,079
If you can imagine a picture and it would have been smart of me to have a picture that

231
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:02,300
didn't have these lines that are saying this is how all these variables relate together.

232
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:10,940
That is your measurement model. You're trying to figure out whether your observed indicators map on to your latent variables.

233
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:19,730
If you have really variables, you have no, no, repeat that you have no or no variables.

234
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,620
You need no measurement model. Okay.

235
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:30,230
Once we start saying, okay, now that I have this measurement model in place,

236
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:38,030
all these different variables map on to these indicators and all these indicators map all of these variables in ways that I would expect.

237
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,930
And notice this is just me throwing some crap up on the on the board.

238
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:48,110
I mean, I know there's no real data, but I'm saying that of these 15 items, this is how they kind of work.

239
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:55,220
It's not 13, four and two that are supervisory support.

240
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,290
It's 13, 14 or 15. And we've seen poor fitting models.

241
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:03,020
I saw it in your midterms. I saw people pull out one of those kiddos. Those questions?

242
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:07,850
A No, I don't want to wave one to AC three as part of my as part of my model.

243
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:11,060
You're allowed to do that. You're allowed to do that here, too.

244
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:16,100
But your measurement model will still be tested against the data, the observed data that you see.

245
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:24,980
Once you decide, okay, I do have these five latent variables, I'm going to give them names just like we do with Clarissa's example, right?

246
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:28,060
The school and community belonging. That was nothing.

247
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,660
Nothing. She threw a bunch of questions out there and then she added some construct names.

248
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:36,350
That wasn't true until she made it true. And then it is kind of true.

249
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:42,020
Same thing here. Whether we call this workplace norms or something else is all really kind of up to us.

250
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,820
Same principles apply here.

251
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:53,390
That said, we will have five different lead variables, all in indicators that we will test relative to the the data that we've collected.

252
00:26:53,720 --> 00:27:02,060
We can try different conceptualizations where we're moving the variables around for maybe it's just four lane variables instead of five or maybe it's,

253
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:05,860
you know, maybe this one has the nine as part of it.

254
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:09,500
Instead, we could do all that and just test the relative fit of the models.

255
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:14,120
That's all trying to figure out do we have a well-fitting measurement model?

256
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:21,010
Once we are there, then we get to have the fun stuff where we're adding how all of these things relate to each other.

257
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:27,620
Don't forget that after you run your measurement model, you're going to have output that says you have five factors and they fit the data well.

258
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:31,970
But there's nobody telling you this is how these factors should be related to each other.

259
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:38,870
No one's telling you that this is your dependent variable and that these are your exaggerated variables,

260
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:45,360
and that we have this mediating variable of motivation that's all us that we kind of brain, right?

261
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:52,010
And that's kind of our model or conceptual model that we then have to test against the data one more time.

262
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:56,210
Right. How do all these measurement variables relate to one another?

263
00:27:56,510 --> 00:28:00,260
And yes, we could have this be a manifest variable. This could be an observed variable.

264
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,390
It doesn't have to be all leading variables.

265
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:08,810
You can still have a structure equation model that has a combination of late variables and observed variables.

266
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:15,290
It's completely okay, but this is what we're trying to get to. I run the measurement model, test my measurement model.

267
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:22,940
I run a structural model. That's it. That's all the structural equation models are at the end of the day.

268
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:28,880
Now, there are so many different kind of nuances and pieces that you can start to learn and develop over time.

269
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:32,959
But don't be don't shy away from this, because I think this is really interesting.

270
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:39,470
This is not something that we can answer easily with regression. It's possible, but not quite as easily.

271
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,280
Right. And we had to skip a step.

272
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:47,330
The biggest one being that instead of using true latent variables,

273
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:53,030
we're either using factor scores or we're creating some sort of mean value like we usually do.

274
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:59,930
Right? It's not quite the same thing. In theory, the measurement is not as sound.

275
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:08,150
That's what it is. Okay. Where would be the best use of our time over the next 50 minutes?

276
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:13,280
Do you folks want to go through an example? Do we want to try to get through some more of this terminology?

277
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:22,969
What's I kind of I'm happy to do either there's a worked example video on canvas, so if you're not feeling as comfortable with the terminology,

278
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:29,630
but I feel like at least from the review part, I know folks are kind of getting it.

279
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:37,280
What do you want to ask? Questions. I really don't have a great idea of how to spend our next 45 minutes.

280
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:43,010
And I'm sorry. I know this is awkward. I want to go back to five.

281
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:55,070
Was that you talked about the advantages and constraints, the error, and for some reason it wouldn't stick to my brain since.

282
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:07,970
Sure. And I wonder. And also the terms.

283
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:18,780
Who? I think look for a senior executive at some point after that year.

284
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:27,540
All right. Well, I tell you what, why don't we go to the example together and I will get to your question, Oksana, as we're moving forward.

285
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:35,670
So the reason why I'm also comfortable about this is absurd, all of these different job ideas here.

286
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:42,720
So down here, I have little notes for folks.

287
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:49,010
The video stops somewhere and you've so you've done all this, you've done all this.

288
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:54,030
These are pretty straightforward steps and model fit. This is what I just kind of talked about.

289
00:30:55,560 --> 00:31:02,610
But I do have little notes in the in the PowerPoint that you can use.

290
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:07,709
This is around now. I mean, we've done things up for miles in this class.

291
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:11,940
I think folks know this, just making sure that there's anything super, super important.

292
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:16,560
This is a slide on ID, just more from a conceptual purpose.

293
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:20,220
This is one that would be useful to know where.

294
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:30,959
Okay. So this slide is useful to know. I kind of already covered in class, but just what the definitions between under identified.

295
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,920
Just identified. Over identified. This is a regression.

296
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:40,710
This is your kind of standard structure equation models. This is when you try to get too fancy.

297
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:46,290
All right. Too many paths, not enough observed variables.

298
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:50,670
Okay. How do you figure that out?

299
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:57,300
You can actually do the math. So this will be this can be a helpful thing for you to think about as you're drawing your picture.

300
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:02,070
The model will tell you, right. You'll try to run the model and I'll say it's not it's not going to converge.

301
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:05,520
That's the issue. It's usually it's an under ID piece.

302
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:12,180
But you can use this little equation. It's not too bad at all to figure out if I have seven observed variables.

303
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:18,240
How many pieces of information will I have? And then how many parts or how many parameters can I estimate?

304
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:22,270
What are the parameters that I estimate? Errors.

305
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:27,209
The ease loadings. The arrows.

306
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:31,140
The directional arrows. Correlations. The bi directional arrows.

307
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:45,480
You can do this on your own. But this is how we can calculate your ID for the kind of your basic measurement model.

308
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:53,010
Not too bad. Not too bad. It gets I mean, it does get complex, but what I would say is.

309
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,990
I think that's like a what do you like, an animated one or something like that.

310
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:09,430
So you can try to figure it out. If you want to go through it again, I'll tell you.

311
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,600
And then the rest of them really are just kind of a lot more detailed than you probably need, just in the interest of thoroughness.

312
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:24,580
Matrix algebra is I mean that's not going to help your model fit into sees all the gory details about what they

313
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:32,260
are so these are there for your reference and for a complete on this mouth and this is what you really need.

314
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:38,290
This is how you care about you can go through all this now if it slides and figure out which ones you think are the most appropriate,

315
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:45,069
just given what kind of did you have. But this is all right. This is if my model index is this, then I have good fit.

316
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:51,580
If it's not this, I don't have good fit. And I need to think about reshaping my model or or changing some of those areas or pathways.

317
00:33:56,100 --> 00:34:03,530
Where does my due diligence for don't just start with your structure equation, Miles.

318
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:12,480
Just think a little intentionally about what am I putting in there and what's what what should I expect to find and how am I going to assess the fit?

319
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:15,840
All right. Well, let's go through an example. We'll touch on some of those pieces anyways.

320
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:21,360
Social support and depression. Everybody loves this example we've been doing all semester long.

321
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:27,330
This should feel good. We are in your milieu. This is your this is stuff that we've been doing.

322
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:36,900
The lives and package weight and variable analysis package. I think it's.

323
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:46,960
If you're going to do a lot of serious structural equation modeling,

324
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:54,730
it might be who view to learn the program and plus and pluses of software developed by some folks out of UCLA.

325
00:34:55,450 --> 00:35:00,160
It is probably the most popular latent variable modeling software.

326
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:07,630
It's a mix between what I would consider R and status packages and SPSS package.

327
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:12,070
SPSS is package is called Amos and it's pictorial.

328
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:19,840
It's really nice because you just draw the box or you take the box and you draw the pictures together and it spits out the output for you.

329
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:24,310
That's really nice. It's very, very user friendly. I like that.

330
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:30,280
I really do. Except for the kinds of questions that are often really important to us.

331
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:35,800
Need more nuanced than what a sort of a road structural equation model is going to give you.

332
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:45,640
So even Levein's going to have some specific assumptions that it's going to make and some defaults that it's going to spit out for you.

333
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:54,280
The more syntactical you get, the more specific you need about you need to be about modeling all of those

334
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:58,960
different error terms and pathways and covariance issues and stuff like that.

335
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:08,529
So in the interest of getting the best representations of reality, oftentimes we're trimming models.

336
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:14,140
So we're changing pathways and we're doing a lot of very small manipulations, which is,

337
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:20,260
I think are and stay to make you think a lot more about structure and plus a little bit less.

338
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:24,040
I think you're going to be better with a lot more of their just default programing.

339
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,879
And I think with Amos, again, it's nothing against it,

340
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:37,600
but it's so easy to just draw some of these kind of pictures that I think it can sometimes detract away from some of the science topic aspects of it.

341
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:40,120
Right. That's that would be my only caution.

342
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:51,819
But again, in terms of ease of use, SPSS and plus its data and our this is the most prevalent package that I see that I've seen.

343
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:59,469
It doesn't mean there is the only one if you there is actually a textbook that comes I mean it's a very small one guy guy wrote is out of Baylor,

344
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:03,850
I think. And it's nice. I think it's developing more and more functionality.

345
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:09,940
It was, I think maybe three or four years ago that that the program really started to take off.

346
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:17,530
But we basically have to specify three different things main variables, structural variables and variances.

347
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:25,239
That's where essentially is going to be our the the inputs into the model we're going to find we're going to save things.

348
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:30,700
This is the function that's actually going to run the stuff. We'll save it as an object, spit it out as a summary.

349
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:40,840
So very similar to what we've been doing, it's following the same sort of processes or procedures.

350
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:46,720
The biggest difference here is the model specification. We're used to doing outcome variable, tilde, all that other stuff.

351
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:52,720
We just have to be a little more thoughtful about what's all going to go in that, but that's what structural equation model is.

352
00:37:54,100 --> 00:38:02,770
All right. So to run a just your basic lead variable analysis or factor analysis in this case,

353
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:10,000
all we're going to have to do from that model perspective is specify one latent variable, okay?

354
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,940
We get to make up the name, whatever we want to call it.

355
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:22,300
The way that the syntax is going to ask us for a latent variable is it's going to go under this kind of layered variable part.

356
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:27,219
You don't have to do it this way, but I think it's just helpful to kind of keep it straight in my my late variables,

357
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:32,050
my observed variables and errors and residual correlations.

358
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:37,690
This equals tilde is what denotes a latent variable.

359
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:43,060
So we are saying, I want arbitrary name of my latent variable.

360
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:48,010
This is what it specifies, that it is a latent variable, not this, by the way.

361
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:51,940
This is just this is just a great outcome.

362
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:55,480
But this is a lead variable that's going to be comprised of these indicators.

363
00:38:56,260 --> 00:39:04,170
Not bad, huh? Not bad at all. Not bad, right?

364
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:10,380
It is easy peasy. It might be easier to factor analysis one day here.

365
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:17,400
So this is our main variable. The Fed is just the name of the object and we're going to save all this to.

366
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,340
ACM is the actual function that we're going to run.

367
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:28,410
It requires two pieces of information and is my model at the minimum needs to be as we have the model, which is just what we send up here.

368
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:34,110
Note that funky apostrophes or wherever it is, not even apostrophe,

369
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:41,189
it's like the single temporary was our that's the model in the dataset that unlike

370
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:46,259
factor analysis where we are able to just say you make this two factors three factors,

371
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:49,950
four factors, that kind of stuff. We have to specify all that.

372
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:53,280
So this is not a good use to try to figure out your factor structure.

373
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:59,880
This is not what I would use necessarily to to run exploratory analyzes around what my scale is supposed to be.

374
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:06,030
I would do this when I have a good idea that these six items belong to a depression scale.

375
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:11,960
Okay. That said, we can run this summary just like we did with the regression.

376
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:16,710
It's the name of the object, and this is just for some of the output that's going to ask us for.

377
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:22,650
I'm saying true. This is a supplementary command that's going to spit out some output that I just happened to like.

378
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:31,710
And we can ask for again, the model and the big difference here is you can ask for things like confidence intervals and stuff like that.

379
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,880
They're included by default. I just didn't want because of the size of the output.

380
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:41,220
Okay. We have six variables.

381
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:49,740
We believe them to to all help or they're all contributed by a factor called depression.

382
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:56,850
With more time, we would go through this example and figure out whether or not this model's identified.

383
00:40:58,170 --> 00:40:59,460
Spoiler It's identified.

384
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:08,639
It's got to be over identified because the pieces of information that we have six if you plug that into that equation six times seven divided by two,

385
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,600
I think is what it is.

386
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:20,760
That number is going to outweigh the number of direct parts that we estimate the number of error terms that we're going to include.

387
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:31,360
Okay. But the measurement model.

388
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:39,430
So these are things that are things that we want to know. Notice a number of observations is good.

389
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,510
The estimate or this is something that you're probably not going to have to deal with too much.

390
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:54,520
It's well, we're using maximum likelihood here that this is almost always going to be a significant

391
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:58,210
because it's essentially are there are other variables correlated in the model.

392
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:03,190
This is different than the Chi square test that we're going to run and just the segment, the FIT Indices.

393
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:13,630
Any time that you run a structural equation model, it's going to give you a few different estimates of that that kind of factor the factor loadings.

394
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:20,350
The first one is to keep things in their original units. Now, the problem is we're talking about what with depression.

395
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:27,200
Is that a manifest variable or a leading variable? Depression laden variable.

396
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:31,850
What is the scalability variable? What's the scaling of a depression of depression?

397
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:40,540
How does one measure depression? You can't is the short answer.

398
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:45,750
You can't. So you have to index it in some way, shape or form. So you have to pick a scaling variable.

399
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:51,040
Doesn't matter which one is arbitrary. And it's typically conventionally scaled to one, which is why you see it as variable.

400
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:55,630
It's not that it doesn't load on depression, but we have to set it somewhere.

401
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,630
So then we can talk about how all the other variables kind of relate around it.

402
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:06,070
So that's a winded way of saying that observed scores don't help us all that much with lead variables.

403
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,850
I would push you all the way over to this far right column,

404
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:19,510
which is assuming all the variables and the leading variable in the model are standardized, meaning zero narratives in a 1 to 1 count.

405
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:25,250
These folks are federal.

406
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:34,430
No different. No different. Conceptually, we can think about them as what is good.

407
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:42,620
Want. And come back next Tuesday if you're good.

408
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:45,660
Oh, come on. What does it actually tell me?

409
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:46,660
Don't affect or ignore.

410
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:57,990
Tells us that information, not just the consumption, is the fact that you don't do that there and say, hey, this is what a family is.

411
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:04,600
It's like, how well the. Very little fits into that. You never get to correlate with the fact.

412
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:10,030
Yeah. Yeah. How long that represents. They don't know. Any factor this one represents is quite well.

413
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:12,190
This one? Yeah. A little bit on the fence. Is this the one.

414
00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:25,870
So all of these lowed fairly highly on are depressive laden variables and it's none of your question.

415
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:39,880
So when we ran and I wonder if I have it in here. When we ran this model as a factor analysis, you're going to get two values that look like these.

416
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:48,280
Okay. That's actually what's happening under the hood. For a factor analysis, that's what you get from your factor analysis.

417
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:54,310
We also got like eigenvalues and we got like a percentage of variance explained or something like that.

418
00:44:55,060 --> 00:45:03,910
We never got this right. We never got estimates of the the item variances in error terms.

419
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:13,750
That's what's coming here around for a for all of these different indicators which.

420
00:45:19,070 --> 00:45:24,380
The loading sorry, and the indicators themselves. So these are kind of their these are kind of your terms.

421
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:31,070
These are kind of the loadings. Okay. The difference is we have estimates for these.

422
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:39,170
If you believe in that idea that your observed score equals a combination of your true score and your error,

423
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,600
observed score equals true scarce true score plus error.

424
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:49,580
Your actual depression plus our error in measurement is what we see in practice.

425
00:45:50,120 --> 00:46:06,380
Does that make sense to folks? Say how many right on the board there scored x equals true plus e.

426
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:11,760
You have your real value depression. We have some error in measurement.

427
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:17,990
You combine the two, we get what we see in practice. Why is this so important to structure equations?

428
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:21,830
What happens if we have an observed score?

429
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:33,830
We have an error score. We can do it.

430
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:43,130
We can think about these as true scores measured without air because we are pulling them out of the model.

431
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:48,890
We are explicitly estimating this part of it actually in both of these parts of it.

432
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:56,629
Right. Are using these observed variables. We have what we believe are kind of true pieces of information as well as the air all

433
00:46:56,630 --> 00:47:02,930
combine that in the model we can pull out this and that leaves us with logically speaking,

434
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:08,030
just what's left, just the true values of someone's depressive levels or adverse symptomology.

435
00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:11,749
That's what these latent variables, when we combine all these pieces of information,

436
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:18,590
these six pieces of information are supposed to give us, you're supposed to give us a true estimate of depression.

437
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:23,450
The reason why it's true is because we can tease out all of the error that's within the model.

438
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:33,420
That's the best I got for you. That's the purpose of of having her.

439
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:40,180
That's the strength of a structural equation model relative to regression models that don't explicitly estimate these error variances.

440
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:56,110
Fit indices here. This is what's going to allow us to decide whether or not that measure of fit is true or sorry.

441
00:47:56,110 --> 00:48:03,190
The fit is is acceptable depending on the different measures that you want to use there.

442
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:15,820
They don't always agree. I can see from the top here, unfortunately, that measure, that chi square value is the same one that is the same height.

443
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:24,910
So this is the overall chi square. So I apologize. The overall chi square is basically a test of overall fit.

444
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:28,420
The null hypothesis is that the overall fit is good.

445
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:33,280
Well, are we rejecting irritating the null hypothesis here?

446
00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:48,129
We are rejecting our no hypothesis here. So the overall fit of this particular model is not good, at least according to this particular fit.

447
00:48:48,130 --> 00:49:01,570
In AC contrast, add to these to a comparative fit index and if you go with the T stands for both of those just by convention or by design,

448
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:07,780
a score of 0.9 or above is considered to be good fit well for any model.

449
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:11,350
Both of these indicators suggest a pretty good fit in model.

450
00:49:11,770 --> 00:49:15,879
AC and VAC models are for model comparison.

451
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:22,060
They're not going to really help you right here. The root mean square or error of approximation is a measure of this fit.

452
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:29,260
We want to see that value as close to zero as possible. 0.1 is acceptable, 0.05 is great fit.

453
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:37,900
We are kind of close to that acceptable level. So this model generally, I would say is okay, not great.

454
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:45,640
Okay. So as a measure of depression, our model suggests this.

455
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:53,350
We would want to know this about any sort of other latent variables that we're going to estimate,

456
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:59,890
not just by themselves, but together before we start putting this into a structural model.

457
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:08,829
So if I wanted to see how either stuff predicts my latent variable depression or my late variable depression predicts other stuff we'd want to know.

458
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:12,460
First off, that the model, the measurement model is okay.

459
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:18,810
That makes sense. Yeah.

460
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:23,200
So for the protests, you don't want that to be significant.

461
00:50:23,470 --> 00:50:27,070
Mm hmm. It's one of those funky times.

462
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:32,140
It's like with the Durban Watson test. We actually want a non-significant value.

463
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:35,650
Just remember, that's the best I can tell you.

464
00:50:36,310 --> 00:50:42,190
I mean, all the deeds, all the details are you can kind of see a little bit about how it says maps onto each other, but.

465
00:50:44,870 --> 00:50:50,690
I think it's I think it's this chi square test that you do want to have significant.

466
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:56,540
I think that's the one it's a similar to like the I forget the name of it where

467
00:50:56,540 --> 00:51:00,949
you are all the correlation zero in the model which never really happens but

468
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:03,139
you can see I mean look at how many different fitness you I mean this is kind

469
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:07,490
of ridiculous but they're all there and they all have different purposes.

470
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:17,180
A little bit more about them. Oh, this is what I wanted to show you a few slides ago.

471
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,520
Factor analysis, structural equation measure.

472
00:51:24,050 --> 00:51:30,920
When we look at the standardize all, we get the exact same looks.

473
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:36,290
It's the same thing that's happening kind of behind the scenes. All right.

474
00:51:36,770 --> 00:51:45,980
The difference is, the best I could tell you to do was to save these factor scores and create, like, a weighted mean.

475
00:51:47,180 --> 00:52:01,370
Remember, at least here in that. Yes, the difference with this model is I will include that latent variable in my structural model.

476
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:10,970
It will have not only these pieces, these factor loadings, but also these error terms.

477
00:52:12,290 --> 00:52:17,840
It's all going to be part of the model when I start to estimate how it's related to other things.

478
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:24,379
So rather than just these, I mean, this is this, this is a reduction is not completely accurate.

479
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:31,700
But rather than these six pieces of information, I get 13 pieces of information, all of which will be encompassed in the model.

480
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:37,400
If I start to relate this latent variable to other stuff, which is my plan and a few slides.

481
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:48,580
Know. Repetition.

482
00:52:53,560 --> 00:53:09,390
This is a structural model. All right. So we we've run a lot of structural models in the course of this semester without necessarily realizing it.

483
00:53:09,850 --> 00:53:15,700
So all those regression models that we ran are run over the course of the semester, are, in effect, structural models.

484
00:53:15,970 --> 00:53:18,250
They're describing relationships between variables.

485
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:27,430
In this case, if we wanted to run a model like does parental social support and friendship support, predict, predict.

486
00:53:28,930 --> 00:53:34,390
Career, predict, predict, predict.

487
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:43,380
Predict depression. So right now, I'm not treating anything as a leading variable notice.

488
00:53:43,770 --> 00:53:47,170
I have no tilde equals.

489
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:53,099
It's just kind of standard regression syntax that we've used for the semester.

490
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:56,220
Right? Outcome variable regression on my predictor variables.

491
00:53:57,010 --> 00:54:16,140
Okay. In this case, I'm including a couple of labels here that we'll use for mediation, but they don't have any effect on the actual model itself.

492
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:20,550
This is not an interaction term. It kind of looks like one, but it's not.

493
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:30,540
It's basically going to say that instead of getting like a co coefficient called an FC, we're going to also get to have a little B part of it.

494
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:34,380
And that's because I want to use like the ABC pad language in just a second.

495
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:35,040
All right.

496
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:42,930
So it's going to be helpful for us, Brian, if you plan to to estimate indirect effects, which is also a big part of certain equation models.

497
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:50,100
It's good to know that it can happen here. Here is different.

498
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:52,750
This is one piece that's a little bit different for the regression. Right.

499
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:56,970
We are going to still estimate kind of an error or a variance for our outcome variable.

500
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:03,850
Okay. And here's where we start to drift into some more complex space.

501
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:12,270
When you think about the model, this outcome variable, I mean, it's not all that complimentary before it's going to be.

502
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:19,710
But parental social support, friendship, social support to both can be predictive.

503
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:23,280
So some level of depression.

504
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:28,760
But we essentially have something like this happening.

505
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:34,050
Okay. This is just tricky.

506
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:38,700
I mean, you you can make decisions about what this means. You can model this explicitly.

507
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:44,340
I would say by default, planned to include it.

508
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:51,620
This is the error term that you would see at the end of a regression equation. The residual.

509
00:55:53,790 --> 00:55:57,210
Much for that. And just the same.

510
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:02,400
I'll go through this fairly quickly because this is just regression, folks, is the absolute same thing.

511
00:56:03,090 --> 00:56:04,380
The exact same thing is regression.

512
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:12,929
You're on this exact same equation as part of the old model and we'll get the exact same thing because it is because of their all manifest variables.

513
00:56:12,930 --> 00:56:17,580
There's no latent variables. We are not running a structure equation. Well, you do not have fit indices.

514
00:56:17,790 --> 00:56:20,549
This is a just identified model, so don't be afraid.

515
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:27,750
If you don't get our Ramsey and CFI and all that kind of stuff when when you want to or if you ever want to,

516
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:31,920
you can run a structural equation or a regression model within structural equation modeling.

517
00:56:33,630 --> 00:56:44,459
And that's all you got to do. I think in the worked example I talk about how you can get an intercept.

518
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:54,000
It's just adding a stat like one here, one plus, and I'll give you an intercept here.

519
00:56:54,000 --> 00:57:00,770
Again, difference, though, is now we have some explicit understanding of the error that's associated with this month.

520
00:57:02,870 --> 00:57:08,360
Teach you something else.

521
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:20,570
You can estimate indirect effects. So mediation is and is a great package.

522
00:57:20,810 --> 00:57:27,830
And you saw that Andrew Hayes, that all those different formulations of mediation and moderation, stuff like that.

523
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:36,890
I don't necessarily think you have to use CRM to do some of these things, but it is fairly easy with CRM to run mediation models.

524
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:45,300
And the big difference would be all of those Andrew Hayes models, they have one outcome variable with structure equation models.

525
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:48,380
It would be very possible to have.

526
00:57:55,980 --> 00:58:01,470
Right. And you can estimate something like this, or if you wanted to have a mediation thing, you could have.

527
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:11,700
I don't know. Uh. Yes.

528
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:15,510
I'm like this all within the same. That's the big change.

529
00:58:15,810 --> 00:58:18,360
You can add all of these pieces of information in.

530
00:58:18,410 --> 00:58:24,480
You can add a regression equation that has anxiety on friendship support, preferential social support.

531
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:27,460
You can allow one of these to mediate the other. Right?

532
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:33,480
You can put in all these different all these different pathways depending on how you think it all goes together.

533
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:36,900
And I think the challenge just becomes to map it out here.

534
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:40,770
Notice these are the same equations that we round with mediation. Right.

535
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:48,330
This is the c prime path, and we have both. This is where we're just regressing the mediator on the independent variable,

536
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:52,440
the outcome variable on the independent variable in the mediating variable.

537
00:58:55,750 --> 00:58:58,870
Okay. I know I'm going to this quickly.

538
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:13,900
But it is also up on campus. Output looks familiar ish.

539
00:59:15,550 --> 00:59:19,560
We have the two equations, right.

540
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:22,090
We still have estimates of error.

541
00:59:23,290 --> 00:59:29,590
And the key one now is because we've defined this indirect effect and we did that with this little guy, colon equals.

542
00:59:32,650 --> 00:59:37,780
Now we have an estimate of our indirect effect and you can have multiple indirect effects.

543
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:42,430
Again, you could have multiple outcome variables. Again, this is just like the basic formulation.

544
00:59:42,850 --> 00:59:50,050
And if I did this well, yes. St That's my thing.

545
00:59:51,910 --> 00:59:54,720
There is a good theme of today. It's that we've done this.

546
00:59:55,780 --> 01:00:00,700
We're just using a different approach that's going to ultimately be a little bit more flexible.

547
01:00:01,150 --> 01:00:07,960
You can think of maybe if this is helpful, the measurement stuff and the regression stuff that we've done in many cases as being special,

548
01:00:08,710 --> 01:00:17,320
special cases of a broader structure equation model, we can expand on what we've done and.

549
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:27,320
Thoughts? Questions. Is this helpful? Am I going too fast? You're going fast.

550
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:37,040
It is going fast. Mostly trying to focus on letting you know that it's out there, but you're pretty far away.

551
01:00:37,070 --> 01:00:42,770
What questions you have, what's what's the what do you think is going to be the biggest barrier to trying to do this on your own?

552
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:56,220
Maybe setting it up. God got others.

553
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:02,120
I can understand that. Yeah.

554
01:01:02,570 --> 01:01:08,360
You have to put those like Kashmir to specify which part there is.

555
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:11,420
That is true. This is for our. This is my own.

556
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:16,940
So these remember, it is like in, you know, are these are just going to be grayed out comments.

557
01:01:17,630 --> 01:01:22,580
I would recommend that you keep them for just a reason like this.

558
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:28,970
It helps me at least kind of separate or delineate what I think are later variables,

559
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:35,030
what I think are observed variables, and then any sort of like indirect effects that I want to use.

560
01:01:36,050 --> 01:01:40,340
The observed variables are just regression. Yeah.

561
01:01:48,790 --> 01:01:52,210
So folks, this is a combined structure question.

562
01:01:54,850 --> 01:02:04,450
How many variables in my estimate. I smile with confidence.

563
01:02:05,530 --> 01:02:08,860
Three great are three or three Americans.

564
01:02:09,190 --> 01:02:13,600
They are called friendship support, parental support and depression.

565
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:22,250
How many indicators do I have for each of these leaders?

566
01:02:26,140 --> 01:02:30,430
Five, six. One, two, three, four, five. One, two, two, four, five, six.

567
01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:36,580
You've done this. That's where you've done this. Right now, this is our measurement model.

568
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:44,440
This is how we think these pieces fit in these observed pieces of information map on two variables.

569
01:02:46,690 --> 01:02:53,650
This is our structural model. So recall at this point, all we have is.

570
01:03:01,420 --> 01:03:06,170
Why are there circles in the.

571
01:03:09,730 --> 01:03:20,370
As the diamond. All this is all these cop parties saying is that we have these three things right.

572
01:03:20,370 --> 01:03:23,520
And, you know, if you really want to draw, you have all the little different boxes.

573
01:03:23,730 --> 01:03:27,780
Right. With their specific items. With me.

574
01:03:29,130 --> 01:03:33,660
Yeah. You were saying, what are we about to do with this regression part?

575
01:03:35,130 --> 01:03:39,660
What are we going to do? This could be the fun part. We're all I'd say about what we're going to do.

576
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:45,730
Then the areas would go from depression to.

577
01:03:47,340 --> 01:03:51,160
That's a good thing.

578
01:03:51,950 --> 01:03:55,190
Yeah. Isn't that a question? Yeah. Which way these arrows go?

579
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:59,150
But this is the big one, right? Probably something like this.

580
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:04,760
So each one of these are going to have their own indicators, right? In individual specific items.

581
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:14,390
Six or five, five and six. The relationships between the latent variables are described here.

582
01:04:16,250 --> 01:04:21,500
We think that this variable depression is observable.

583
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:31,459
Construct the depression, and we're going to estimate based on the way people responded to six items can be regressed on your future,

584
01:04:31,460 --> 01:04:34,610
our friendship support and your parental support.

585
01:04:37,490 --> 01:04:42,980
Leighton? Leighton Lee We have not been able to do that this semester.

586
01:04:44,030 --> 01:04:48,920
We use this. We use like a mean depression score or we use factor scores.

587
01:04:49,250 --> 01:04:55,370
We have not been able to actually manipulate and play with weight variables to see how they're related to each other.

588
01:04:56,660 --> 01:04:58,760
That's what this model is going to allow us to do.

589
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:10,130
Not only is it going to account for the factor scores and loadings, how these little guys relate to friendship support, but what else?

590
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:13,640
What else does this model and I know it's probably as clear as mud.

591
01:05:14,390 --> 01:05:20,600
But the important thing is you also get these little items.

592
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:26,210
It's all there. It's all there in this big old club.

593
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:35,210
And then we're going to see how they all kind of map on to want to go back to work.

594
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:42,450
So this is like the foreman. And one of these observe variables contribute to the variable.

595
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:48,770
Yes, that's a great question.

596
01:05:49,250 --> 01:05:55,580
It's a combination because these are reflective, right.

597
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:02,270
All this stuff is reflected in these underlying values or sorry, at least for a friendship sport and a prayer of parental support.

598
01:06:02,510 --> 01:06:08,720
But depression is formed by your parental and social support.

599
01:06:11,090 --> 01:06:17,180
No, no, no. Sorry, it is not. They're all reflective. That's not how we're creating this layered variable.

600
01:06:17,210 --> 01:06:21,760
So then if we were doing it, we're doing a formative role that would that.

601
01:06:21,770 --> 01:06:29,340
So this is just like the way that you think about it or yeah, it's it.

602
01:06:29,350 --> 01:06:31,009
And it is more in the way that you think about it,

603
01:06:31,010 --> 01:06:36,110
whether these things are kind of caused by the leading variable or they cause the leader, it's more conception.

604
01:06:36,510 --> 01:06:40,540
Sorry. I mean. Measurement model.

605
01:06:41,170 --> 01:06:44,170
Structural model. Structural equation.

606
01:06:44,650 --> 01:06:54,260
Combined model. Where do you want to come? Right. Uh, so the coding piece.

607
01:06:54,800 --> 01:07:04,670
What is this telling us? Not the the.

608
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:11,330
This is expressing a correlation or a variance or a covariance, actually.

609
01:07:13,830 --> 01:07:17,130
Which one? I'm drawing a line here.

610
01:07:17,140 --> 01:07:22,270
What am I drawn by? Directional between friendship and.

611
01:07:26,730 --> 01:07:36,750
Sure or not. I don't know. I can allow these things to go very to be associated with each other, or I could not get to make a decision about that.

612
01:07:37,230 --> 01:07:42,030
I get to make a decision about the indicators. I get to make decisions about these pathways.

613
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:44,820
I get to make decisions about whether there's an indirect effect.

614
01:07:45,210 --> 01:07:52,390
All of that is manipulable, manipulative, but all of that I can toy around and I can play around with.

615
01:07:52,770 --> 01:07:55,770
I can try to find something that works to map out of the data.

616
01:07:56,700 --> 01:08:01,710
Start with your measurement model. Then you get to play your structure along all this stuff.

617
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:05,370
It's all combined into one big boom.

618
01:08:05,910 --> 01:08:13,410
There it is. Starting with your measurement model, these are your factor loadings for friendship, support, parental support, depression.

619
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:34,750
Yes. General question So when you're moving forward, well, how how much evidence are you providing in all of your code writing?

620
01:08:37,590 --> 01:08:40,640
So like, how much do you have to prove? And then who is that?

621
01:08:40,740 --> 01:08:48,330
Checking your code and checking your output to make sure just, you know, like make it work for you the way you want it to work.

622
01:08:49,670 --> 01:08:54,530
It's a great question. Depends on your audience. Depends on what you're submitting to figure for a grant.

623
01:08:54,800 --> 01:09:09,100
Nothing I buy. I report some of those. And report this just this type of stuff that we'll get to just in a second.

624
01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:10,540
But it's pretty minimal.

625
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:19,690
I think in a paper there's more expectation around reporting the measurement model, reporting the fit indices, reporting the structural pieces.

626
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:24,280
I usually have a picture like a like a conceptual model that has all the different loadings within there.

627
01:09:25,030 --> 01:09:29,920
I think that's helpful for not just the measurement model but the excuse me,

628
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:36,250
the structure model so you can have all the standardized loadings, but that's it.

629
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:47,499
So there is not a ton of oversight and it's pretty easy to use trimming functions and other things that

630
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:53,560
allow the model to get better fit by making what you might consider fairly arbitrary changes to this model.

631
01:09:54,220 --> 01:10:03,100
Oh, well, I'm going to let these two variables query as part of my parental social support construct,

632
01:10:03,490 --> 01:10:09,520
or I'm going to drop an error term or something like that. It is it's easy to do.

633
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:15,820
It's not necessarily best practice unless you have a really good rationale for why I think we should be making this.

634
01:10:16,060 --> 01:10:20,620
I'm going to let this item cross load with parental social support because it improves my life,

635
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:26,260
even though in practice I have no reason to believe that this indicator belongs to a parental social support.

636
01:10:27,430 --> 01:10:33,700
And you'll see it even to me like some of my growth models, which you can run as a structural question model where you have a variable at time.

637
01:10:33,700 --> 01:10:40,419
For that, the model suggests it should be covered with something that happened prior to it or something, you know, doesn't make sense.

638
01:10:40,420 --> 01:10:49,060
And so you have to be, you know, watchful, I suppose, for model fishing, if you will.

639
01:10:51,610 --> 01:10:58,800
Right. Questions about this output. Three layered variables, three sets of loadings.

640
01:11:01,150 --> 01:11:06,970
So if that was if these were like more informative, would you still look at it like that?

641
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:10,320
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Do you remember what was an example of just.

642
01:11:10,330 --> 01:11:11,500
Yes, I would want to know, like.

643
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:19,480
All right, well, education loads really highly idea expert status doesn't seem to work as highly and then an income also loads pretty highly.

644
01:11:20,260 --> 01:11:23,080
Or does one of them not load very well at all like it's point.

645
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:28,299
I mean this is this this is a these are nice learnings we've seen from our examples some that really suck, right?

646
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:31,540
Some of those friendship items that were like .02 or something like that.

647
01:11:32,410 --> 01:11:41,500
So we have to I mean you can be this is a nice example was offering a clean example but is it folks and

648
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:45,880
I know I only have 4 minutes left because and that's okay because this is what I care about the most.

649
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:52,210
Right. The whole day, the whole week, half week is really coming down to this part of it.

650
01:11:53,140 --> 01:11:57,490
We now have depression and not just old depression like we had.

651
01:11:57,490 --> 01:12:05,979
We've used all semester on not just a mean depression score, but a latent value assumed to be measured without error because we were able to take

652
01:12:05,980 --> 01:12:10,840
out that error is regressed on your friendship support and your social support.

653
01:12:11,110 --> 01:12:17,980
And that's the relationship that we find between those three variables way, way there up at the tap and my, my little pointer thing.

654
01:12:18,550 --> 01:12:24,290
Um. The name is friendship support.

655
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:27,590
Positively or negatively associated with depression.

656
01:12:34,610 --> 01:12:39,740
Pardue Yeah. Yeah there's the same big problem is still just regression is still just regression.

657
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:44,810
Yeah. We're going to lose that interpretability because now we're talking about a layered variable unit.

658
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:51,140
So a unit change here is kind of a steering deviation change in or latent variable that doesn't make tons of sense to us,

659
01:12:52,130 --> 01:13:00,080
but or is but the the associations are still the same.

660
01:13:00,860 --> 01:13:04,700
We can still think about how these variables are all kind of mapping on to each other.

661
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:12,230
Parental support, negatively or positively related. Yeah.

662
01:13:18,170 --> 01:13:22,400
This is why this is the scale in national security metrics. There's are standard as well.

663
01:13:23,450 --> 01:13:30,230
That's standard deviation change. And this is what I would report in like a journal article or something like that.

664
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:48,650
I would draw this picture and I would put like .14 here on this pathway and I put minus point to read to here and I put point two, five, five here.

665
01:13:49,310 --> 01:13:56,270
So then people get to see you over how come you're parental social support is positive or negatively related to depression.

666
01:13:56,630 --> 01:14:00,200
Your friendship support is positively related to depression.

667
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:03,950
And yet these two constructs are so positively correlated.

668
01:14:04,370 --> 01:14:09,290
I don't get it. I really don't. I appreciate some folks trying to make sense of that nonsense.

669
01:14:10,850 --> 01:14:20,330
But yeah, that's what we get. We can now we can take a peek at model fit if we wanted to see how well we think we're doing.

670
01:14:20,930 --> 01:14:26,389
I don't have it up here, but we can look at the Chi Square, we can look at the comparative fit indices,

671
01:14:26,390 --> 01:14:33,340
we can look at the Ramsey's, and then even better, the next thing we might do is play around more.

672
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:38,560
What happens is we try to see what you know, if one of these mediates the other,

673
01:14:39,170 --> 01:14:49,400
or what if we add variables to this model, or what if we throw in as anxiety as a second outcome?

674
01:14:49,820 --> 01:14:55,350
And so we have both of these things predicting anxiety and depression, see which of those models fits the data.

675
01:14:55,370 --> 01:15:00,020
That's that's the that's the opportunity that comes with something like structure equations,

676
01:15:00,290 --> 01:15:07,579
because you can really start to go hog wild, honestly, in terms of how you feel.

677
01:15:07,580 --> 01:15:14,299
These things are all related to each other. If your measurement model stinks, you can have, you know, maybe a latent variable here,

678
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:17,690
a lead variable here, and this one becomes just analysis period.

679
01:15:18,410 --> 01:15:23,479
And it's just a couple of amino a couple of the items for parental social support because for whatever reason,

680
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:26,710
this particular lead variable was, was messing up your measurement model.

681
01:15:27,380 --> 01:15:31,790
Those were some of the decision making things that you can do as you're beginning to

682
01:15:31,790 --> 01:15:35,450
develop what you're testing and if you start to hit those hiccups along the road.

683
01:15:36,790 --> 01:15:40,670
But as it works, that's really what social equation models are. Yes.

684
01:15:40,970 --> 01:15:47,630
There's I mean, you can take courses on this stuff, but it's going to get down to more of the nitty gritty around.

685
01:15:47,870 --> 01:15:52,430
All right. Well, how do I, you know, create paths and make decisions about these pathways?

686
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:57,590
What can I do from a measurement perspective? What sort of different error estimation can I use?

687
01:15:57,590 --> 01:16:04,040
And different different model estimation techniques might you use if you have small samples?

688
01:16:04,040 --> 01:16:12,769
Do I use restricted maximum likelihood relative to regular maximum likelihood if I have instead of a bunch of continuous variables?

689
01:16:12,770 --> 01:16:17,420
What happens when one of these is a dichotomous or categorical variable?

690
01:16:17,810 --> 01:16:24,980
Or what happens when I have a combination of continuous and categorical indicators?

691
01:16:25,340 --> 01:16:28,610
How can you combine them into a weight variable?

692
01:16:28,850 --> 01:16:35,330
All of these things are possible and it's all kind of done within this broader set of techniques.

693
01:16:36,020 --> 01:16:41,960
But. This is a good foundation and you can do it because you're doing it all semester long.

694
01:16:43,250 --> 01:16:51,770
Don't be intimidated by all this junk. What we're really looking for is probably stuff like this stuff with us at the top and this stuff too.

695
01:16:58,280 --> 01:16:58,910
Lucky for you,

696
01:17:00,260 --> 01:17:15,200
this is our last day for questions or anything that I can provide to supplement today's super condensed crash course into a very complex topic.

697
01:17:16,220 --> 01:17:20,720
Yeah. Yeah, you can.

698
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:27,390
The way it works is.

699
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:41,200
You have two variables. You have an intercept and a slope.

700
01:17:41,910 --> 01:17:48,280
All right, just bring back some memories. And you have at least three indicator variables.

701
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:51,520
That's like timeline time, two and three.

702
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:04,990
There are some scary decisions that you make.

703
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:09,560
So, for example, for the intercept variable that, you know, you'll send some of these things to zero.

704
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:13,910
I can share an example if you want. I can go back through.

705
01:18:13,910 --> 01:18:19,100
I think I have like double on the bond example. I think I have that as a structure equation.

706
01:18:19,910 --> 01:18:31,790
But yeah, so you can think about the intercept in the slope as weighted variables and you can use your observed time as your predictors.

707
01:18:32,030 --> 01:18:38,600
The nice thing about sorry, I know this is difficult to read, but the nice thing about running structure equation models, our growth models is ACM.

708
01:18:38,990 --> 01:18:46,399
You don't have to do that data recoding to build in the time variable to remember how we had to create that.

709
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:51,780
We've measure that time measure. You do not have to do that with the structure equations.

710
01:18:54,140 --> 01:18:57,510
So that happens. I will I will dig up an example.

711
01:18:57,530 --> 01:19:17,250
Any other questions? All right, folks, you've done regression interactions, factor analysis, reliability analysis, logistic regression,

712
01:19:18,750 --> 01:19:24,720
general linear model, multilevel models, growth models, mediation structure, equation models.

713
01:19:25,620 --> 01:19:30,570
That's going to get you a long, long way, a long, long way in our field.

714
01:19:30,780 --> 01:19:37,290
It's not to say that you know everything, but I think at least you can start to do some of this work in practice and build

715
01:19:37,290 --> 01:19:41,610
on hopefully what you've kind of internalized from some of these examples.

716
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:44,400
Again, you don't have to go out there and do it perfectly.

717
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:50,400
I completed my whole Ph.D. program and I came here and I still had to read a book on structure equation models to do it right.

718
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:54,180
And the first time I submitted the paper got rejected. They said my models were good.

719
01:19:54,840 --> 01:20:04,260
So it's you're going to have some fits and starts. But I think the big one is to be able to recognize both some of what's out there,

720
01:20:04,950 --> 01:20:09,689
but then also trying to make some of your your own decisions about the models that

721
01:20:09,690 --> 01:20:13,050
you're that you'll try to build and the approaches that you're going to try to take.

722
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:16,530
Try to think through some of these things before you collect data,

723
01:20:16,890 --> 01:20:23,760
because it's not going to help you if you collect a whole bunch of data and then you don't have the right tools to, to, to analyze it.

724
01:20:24,270 --> 01:20:33,030
So if be thinking through the scaling decisions and the time decisions and all sorts of stuff that kind of come with these sets of analysis.

725
01:20:33,330 --> 01:20:36,480
All right. I will keep on Lebanon.

726
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:40,960
It's been great to meet you and to work with you this semester. Have a fabulous break.

727
01:20:40,980 --> 01:20:48,389
Good luck with with finals and all that kind of stuff. I still like the tenants and participation, stuff like that.

728
01:20:48,390 --> 01:20:54,629
Thank you. It's been nice to have folks be present and answer questions and contribute.

729
01:20:54,630 --> 01:20:58,350
So I really appreciate your your attention and enthusiasm this semester.

730
01:20:59,370 --> 01:21:03,179
All right. Cool. Yeah, yeah. Definitely.

731
01:21:03,180 --> 01:21:04,320
Get a little girl blue in there.
