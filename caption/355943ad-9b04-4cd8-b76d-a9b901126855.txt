00:00:06,518 --> 00:00:08,701
Early in the 20th century,

3
00:00:08,701 --> 00:00:14,119
infectious disease epidemics continued
to afflict the United States and

4
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:20,130
the world, most notably including
the 1918 pandemic of influenza.

5
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:26,010
Which killed tens of millions
of people worldwide.

6
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,130
The enormity of the death toll
inspired scientists to search for

7
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:35,590
ways to prevent infectious diseases.

8
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:38,290
>> There are a lot of parents
whose children are healthy and

9
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:40,760
happy now, who live in fear.

10
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,130
I know I do.

11
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:44,300
The fear my friends is polio.

12
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,870
>> Perhaps one of the greatest
achievements in addressing

13
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:51,760
the spread of infectious diseases
came in the mid 20th century

14
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,560
with the discovery of the polio
vaccine by Jonas Salk.

15
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:01,490
He initiated a polio vaccine trial
with eight million children.

16
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:07,060
The first modern clinical trial, which led
to the announcement at an international

17
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:14,840
press conference, that the polio
vaccine is safe, effective, and potent.

18
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,765
>> This is Tuesday, April 12th, 1955.

19
00:01:17,765 --> 00:01:21,584
A day which may well mark the most
significant event in all of medical

20
00:01:21,584 --> 00:01:23,040
history.

21
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,469
The world will very soon know whether
the battle against the disease that has

22
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:29,213
twisted hundreds of thousands
of young bodies has been won.

[MUSIC]

24
00:01:35,339 --> 00:01:39,357
>> With greater control over
the spread of infectious diseases,

25
00:01:39,357 --> 00:01:45,190
national attention shifted to an increase
of public access to healthcare.

26
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:50,130
In 1965, President Lyndon B Johnson's
national initiative

27
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:55,060
called the Great Society established
Medicare, healthcare coverage for

28
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,800
every American age 65 and over.

29
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:03,610
And Medicaid, healthcare coverage for
lower income Americans.

30
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:08,480
At the same time, an epidemiologic
revolution was taking place,

31
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,890
with the availability of antibiotics

32
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:15,810
promoting the belief that infectious
disease would be conquered.

33
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:20,320
This led to a new focus on managing
chronic disease, a huge and

34
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,450
growing burden on public
health due to aging and

35
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,480
various changes in health
behaviors in the United States and

36
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,889
around the world.

38
00:02:36,178 --> 00:02:41,295
In the early 1980s another
pubic health pandemic emerged.

39
00:02:41,295 --> 00:02:44,380
HIV/AIDS was on the rise.

40
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:49,090
It's mysterious, it's deadly, and
it's baffling medical science.

41
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:52,000
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,990
AIDS is now spreading
in epidemic proportions

43
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:59,610
to other segments of the population
>> To address this public health crisis,

44
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:04,480
then surgeon general C Everett Koop
communicated to every household in

45
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,950
the United States through a mass
mailing explaining HIV/AIDS,

46
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:13,990
how it was spread, and
how to avoid contracting it.

47
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,630
>> Hi I'm Johnny Depp of 21 Jump Street.

48
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,408
I don't know a whole lot about AIDS, but

49
00:03:18,408 --> 00:03:21,695
I wanna introduce you to
a couple of guys who do.

50
00:03:21,695 --> 00:03:24,670
Dr. Robert Windham
the Assistant Secretary for Health and

51
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,900
the Surgeon General of
the United States Dr. C Everett Cooper.

52
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,990
>> There are a number
of ways to catch AIDS.

53
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:36,470
Casual contact is not one of them,
but sexual contact is.

54
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:41,530
If you're not going to abstain, or not
going to maintain a faithfully monogamous

55
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:46,980
relationship, you can reduce the chance
of contracting AIDS if you use a condom.

56
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:50,410
But remember,
they may not be 100% effective.

57
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:54,770
>> Through a national advocacy movement
involving both public health officials and

58
00:03:54,770 --> 00:04:00,390
private citizens, resources were made
available for research and treatment

59
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:05,580
doing more to control this disease
rapidly than any disease in history.

[MUSIC]

61
00:04:10,397 --> 00:04:11,472
At the same time,

62
00:04:11,472 --> 00:04:17,190
the breast cancer movement changed
the way research was being conducted.

63
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:22,079
>> We're all looking for stories
with happy endings, like Brandon and

Women that have run their own
race against breast cancer.

66
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:31,670
Now they're running with thousands of
others in the race for the cure events,

67
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:35,220
to raise awareness and money for
breast cancer education and research.

mortality rate of women
with breast cancer.

71

one of the most critical public health

79
00:05:31,355 --> 00:05:35,190
challenges has been about
the impact of tobacco.

80
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:39,790
Smoking rose virtually annually
throughout the century until

81
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:44,700
the release of the ground-breaking first
surgeon general's report on smoking and

82
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,230
health in 1964.

83
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:51,430
>> Out of its long and exhaustive
deliberations, the committee has reached

84
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:56,860
the overall judgement that cigarette
smoking is a health hazard of sufficient

85
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:02,840
importance to the United States
to warrant remedial action.

86
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:07,120
>> Ever since then,
smoking has been declining.

87
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,020
Tobacco control is widely considered

88
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:14,500
the premier public health achievement
of the second half of the century.

89
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:19,067
Still today,
about 16% of American adults smoke and

90
00:06:19,067 --> 00:06:24,280
tobacco is responsible for
1 out of every 5 deaths.

91
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:30,140
Tobacco remains the nation's leading cause
of preventable, premature mortality.

[MUSIC]

93
00:06:37,984 --> 00:06:44,210
In 2001, the United States experienced
a new kind of public health crisis.

94
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:48,890
This time brought on by the terrorist
attacks of September 11th.

95
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:52,910
First responders rushing to
the aid of victims of the attack

96
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:57,330
suffered significant health consequences
leading to the establishment of

97
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:01,220
congressional legislation to
address their healthcare needs.

98
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,657
[MUSIC]

99
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:08,568
During this period, other health
crises related to gun violence,

100
00:07:08,568 --> 00:07:11,842
global conflicts, natural disasters, and

101
00:07:11,842 --> 00:07:16,340
health insurance continued to
be the focus of public health.

[MUSIC]

103
00:07:23,895 --> 00:07:28,167
In 1988 the Institute of Medicine
published a paper which included

104
00:07:28,167 --> 00:07:32,560
this statement about the future
of public health in the US.

105
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,180
This nation has lost sight of
its public health goals and

106
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:41,270
has allowed the system of public health
activities to fall into disarray.

107
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:45,390
They attributed this to serious
underfunding, poor organization,

108
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:49,400
management and
lack of political support and influence.

109
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,600
These are pervasive themes throughout
history and continue to this day.

110
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,510
But there've been many public health
achievements that provide hope for

111
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,100
the future.

112
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:03,920
Public health efforts have led to
a dramatic increase in life expectancy.

113
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:08,900
During the last 100 years life expectancy
in the US has increased by two

114
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:13,220
thirds from 47 to 77 years.

115
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:20,350
Life expectancy at age 65 increased
by 66% percent from 12 to 20 years.

116
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:26,600
Infant mortality rates drop 94%
from 100 per 1,000 live births,

117
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,390
to 5.9 per 1,000 live births.

118
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:37,650
If the rate in 1900 had continued,
400,000 infants born in 2013 would have

119
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:43,050
died in their first year,
but only 24,000 did.

120
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:51,010
The maternal mortality rate decreased
99% to 0.1 per 1,000 live births.

121
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:55,730
Heart disease and stroke decreased
in the 2nd half of the 20th century

122
00:08:55,730 --> 00:09:00,400
due to decreased smoking, increased
exercise, and screening and treatment for

123
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,250
high blood pressure and high cholesterol.

124
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:07,220
There are better emergency medical
services, both at the scene and

125
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,920
in the hospital.

126
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,800
And vaccination against crippling and

127
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,140
fatal illnesses has led to such
remarkable accomplishments,

128
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:21,930
as the complete eradication of smallpox,
and the near eradication of polio.

129
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:26,250
Public health is an enormously
important field of endeavor.

130
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:30,250
I hope this brief introduction to our
history will give you a good sense of

131
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:36,951
where we have come from and, perhaps,
some lessons about where we have to go.
