1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:15,260
Person. No, no, it's fine.

2
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:29,829
I'm going to do it on Friday, probably. I mean, I feel like we could achieve anything, but my confusion is like we're the ones who picked everything.

3
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:39,140
So what are we like? That's why I don't get. Are we pretending that we're the physicians for a question?

4
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:54,020
Who are we to go shooting with that? There's something to look out for.

5
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:05,970
This. You know, we just negotiated a base salary so that people are more good for me.

6
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:19,960
Salary? So what?

7
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:28,170
We don't have the funds to do that. So it could be anything?

8
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:35,350
Yeah. Really? Yeah.

9
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:47,350
Recording in progress. It seems very open ended.

10
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:52,960
It doesn't really seem like there's a right or wrong answer. It's like whatever you feel like.

11
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,420
Not this week or next week. I don't really know, honestly.

12
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:28,640
That's good. No assignments for either, right?

13
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:34,400
No reflections to experience something for them or whatever.

14
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,580
Did you do the survey? Why didn't you do it?

15
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:56,930
Oh, shoot. We all filled out. I think I'm want to go and then come back.

16
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:04,780
Because otherwise I'd be just like I'd be sitting here for like three or 4 hours doing nothing.

17
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:10,300
Last it was like, maybe I should start packing. And then I was like, What am I going to do tomorrow?

18
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,940
So I did spend quite a bit of time cleaning yesterday, though.

19
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:25,300
You have to finish. Well, at first I was like, oh, he was just getting everything.

20
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:28,570
So I did finish, though.

21
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:44,250
She took the midterm examinations. She took two to.

22
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:59,010
I know what it is like on paper. She changed.

23
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:04,680
Look, she can't do that, right? Because she was supposed to. Oh, supposed to be next Thursday.

24
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:11,340
She's, like, adding more questions for me, which is one of the great.

25
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:17,220
No, I don't think so because I think.

26
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:30,030
Yeah. Actually we don't have because we don't have teach our the culture and then we should find answer now.

27
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:33,080
No, we didn't know what we could not understand.

28
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:40,640
Okay. Good morning, everyone. And we are.

29
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:47,340
I have some things to finish today. And then you'll be ready for your exam.

30
00:04:50,540 --> 00:05:00,410
Okay. So we were talking about utility last time and we decided so I was going to give you a review of it.

31
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:05,270
We divided decision makers into three categories.

32
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:22,810
One is that reason neutrality being you. Okay.

33
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:29,550
There is no individual has a constant marginal utility.

34
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:45,080
So if you log the function and here are your and zero utility and then the utility of that is that that individual goes as a straight line.

35
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,670
Okay. I don't know the angle with a straight line, but okay.

36
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:57,350
19 straight line. So the same increase in utility for the same increase.

37
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:02,960
In the same increase or decrease in utility for the same increase or decrease in bale.

38
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:11,810
Right. So that's it. The the risk varies decision maker.

39
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:28,670
We'll have. Decreasing margin on utilities.

40
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:35,690
And this is based on the utility.

41
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:42,130
That decision maker will have some sort of concave or.

42
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:51,349
Right. And they the flatter it is, they're less risk averse.

43
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:57,370
Setting aside the limited space in the view of the grace covers, it is less and less and less.

44
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:00,970
The recovery is going to converge to a risk. NOtrillionEADY.

45
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:07,250
Right. There is no true individual just plays with street money.

46
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:16,370
You know, more money imu more utility in the same amount that this money give me less utility in the same proportion.

47
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:22,940
Right. And the risk averse if you see if that person.

48
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,540
If that person.

49
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:43,580
Let's see, that person is here and is getting this utility and they see that we give some money or money to the first person will be here.

50
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:47,540
Right. So the increase in utility for that person will be.

51
00:07:51,440 --> 00:08:02,640
These humble. Right. And they say that these are volunteers that gave the extra utility.

52
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:12,660
And what about if we just subtract the same amount of money for an individual, then that individual will be here.

53
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:24,080
And then this is going to be the result for the utility for that if you want a seat.

54
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:40,200
It turns out that for a reason covers individual D is going to be always greater and e when B and they are the same.

55
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:54,930
That's a reason to throw out. But when be the dissatisfaction, the marginally satisfaction exceeds the the satisfaction, the marginal satisfaction.

56
00:08:54,930 --> 00:09:00,140
But it's the increase of money that means that people increase others.

57
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:07,390
So it gets you know, it gets more off shore.

58
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:17,310
So the infinity is impacted more for the individual when they with what we take money from than we used to get money.

59
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:27,420
Right. So more interesting in a preserve is in avoid big losses.

60
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:35,700
And then the third one the third type of individual is.

61
00:09:53,390 --> 00:10:05,270
It's the third kind of individual will be appealing to the.

62
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:35,070
This is the third one will be at risk in individual shootings.

63
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:57,060
Every seeking individual is a person who exhibits this kind of curve.

64
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:08,470
So this is money and this is utility.

65
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:15,140
So the core for that, this issue will always be a complex crisis.

66
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:26,560
And what it means is that that person, they say that person is here.

67
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:40,300
So you can see that if I give this person an extra amount of money, that would that person here that will be here.

68
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:47,980
Right. So the satisfaction of this person is going to be increasing satisfaction.

69
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,670
Increasing utility is going to be a.

70
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:57,570
But if we subtract on the same amount of money for that individual.

71
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:04,870
So this be so drag the same amount of money for an individual.

72
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:10,100
So that individual will be here. We.

73
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:20,310
The difference between those two is going to be this one.

74
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,860
So we kind of call that.

75
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:42,159
And it so happened that for a risk seeking in individual a course we always great to be here is be always greater than a here a greater number.

76
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:53,770
So the increase in utility will be higher than the decrease in utility because of, you know, subtracting the same amount of money.

77
00:12:55,210 --> 00:13:05,980
So you see this, you can just imagine that this this segment is smaller in these areas.

78
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:12,020
But. That's how we shaped it for.

79
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:25,160
Okay. So that's area. So those are so these are three different utility functions, right?

80
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:35,390
So we if we are race neutral individuals, we always have will have the same reason not proper right.

81
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:42,320
So these double the money to go to satisfaction, you know, have the money have their satisfaction.

82
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:54,150
We will see that we will coincide on the proportionality increase in in in the in the proportionality of the of the utility.

83
00:13:54,680 --> 00:14:03,440
But if you are risk averse, like we most most of us are, then it depends on how risk averse you are.

84
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:07,790
So some people are very reasonable or some people are less risk averse.

85
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:14,570
Right. But we will have different curves, but they are going to be shaped in the same way.

86
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:25,399
This is the quarter for individual B. This is a big curve we see depending on the individual.

87
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:38,140
We have different curves and the same thing for increasing it. So the flatter those those risk averse curves are they, you know,

88
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:52,970
the most reasonable the individual is going to be so so the idea what we want to do is with these curves construct a function they I mean,

89
00:14:53,240 --> 00:15:02,959
this is a function, right? But we can measure or we can translate pay of the utility.

90
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,470
So, for example, we can say that.

91
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:24,650
They create. It is expeditious that he will work an individual that is recent governors, one of those individuals.

92
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:34,340
And then I'm going to get it to you and hear the utility.

93
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:38,000
Right. And then I'm going to have different failed.

94
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:55,340
They threatened to. Let's say that for the utility of $100.

95
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:06,330
You get that? So I'm calling finding utility in this case between zero and one.

96
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:12,360
It's not always the case with coal mining in this case of between zero and one.

97
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:19,890
So $100 give you 2.5. $200.

98
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:28,680
It will give you 1475 utilities.

99
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:51,790
And then $300 will give you coin a utility and $400.

100
00:16:55,670 --> 00:17:06,490
Be. It will give you point 83 UTC.

101
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:18,009
$500. In this case.

102
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:24,410
They say that if you. Point 84 UTC.

103
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:33,410
And then we continue until know people reach one one.

104
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:43,310
So but those are examples of these individual if you give that in the view of $500, you get you get 2.5.

105
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:51,060
This activity, 200 will get point 75 and 300.8 and so on and so forth.

106
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:54,720
Right. So this could be one of those quarters.

107
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:05,400
Now, the question, if I present you with this curve here, with this table,

108
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:12,000
can you tell me whether this person is neutral, risk seeking or risk averse?

109
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:20,160
Just by looking at the numbers. You don't have to plot the curve.

110
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:25,720
But my question is, by looking at the numbers that you just figured out, what kind of individual this is.

111
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:37,060
Just remember. Okay, Greece neutral exhibits constant marginal utility.

112
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:44,140
So race neutral is always constant marginal utility.

113
00:18:46,560 --> 00:19:03,270
The risk averse is always decreasing, you know, utility and their risk seeking is always increasing or, you know, utility.

114
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,660
So you look at the marginal utility.

115
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:13,140
So from that person, jump from 100 to 200.

116
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:17,000
What is the what is the marginal utility, the number?

117
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:24,870
And they sort of might, you know, utility then for some. 125 Right.

118
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:41,700
So it jumped 152. 75 So in the instant online utility or sorry, the marginal utility from going to 200 under 200 is point 25 units of utility.

119
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:53,340
This is the marginal utility. Now, what about from 300 to 200?

120
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:13,900
2.05, 3.8 9.75 and then from 300 to 400.03.

121
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:20,389
And what about from 400 to 500?

122
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:30,050
It is going to be .01. So you see what's happening is that marginal utilities are decreasing.

123
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:36,610
So the more money you get, the less extra satisfaction you get.

124
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:45,940
But if you were to lose $100, then, then, you know, suppose you are here.

125
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:49,140
If you were to lose $100, you lose.

126
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:55,270
.02 in utility. But if you gain $100, you just get the .01.

127
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:02,450
He knew. Do they see the issue here?

128
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:07,940
So if you are here, so is .03 and here are one.

129
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:25,730
So my point is that that you can identify if it is a rethinking of risk that others or a reasonable individual simply by

130
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:34,980
taking a look at the table of utilities that you wait and figured out if that those utilities are increasing with concern,

131
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,069
are you? So that means the same payment,

132
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:49,760
the same extra payment receive the same sort of penalty or not you the same extra payment receive a smaller increase in utility or consistently.

133
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:59,420
Then this is a risk averse individual. But if it is, if it is going up their marginal utility, then this is going to be every single individual.

134
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:14,780
Now, you remember also that we discussed kind of the ways in which we we can find we can derive any utility function for an individual.

135
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:30,140
The first way this is very in we what we do in a decision making problem is we find the utility to be the on zero and one.

136
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:48,380
Right. And then if we have, for example, zero B over zero hundred, 200, 300, 400, 500.

137
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:54,140
600. And so on.

138
00:22:54,370 --> 00:23:04,790
Right. Then what we can do is the to the to the, to the lowest bale.

139
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:11,450
We assign the utility zero and to the highest of we assign the utility one.

140
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:15,170
I suppose that those are the numbers that I have.

141
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:19,960
Two, two, one. And that those are the paid. Those are they pay off that up.

142
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:23,690
And then what, four numbers in between.

143
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:29,900
You say, okay, what is the maximum value of P?

144
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:37,580
So let's say these P here. What is the amount being the maximum value of p?

145
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:44,750
That will me make me in different order either by working out.

146
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:51,290
With $800 for sure. Or.

147
00:23:53,290 --> 00:24:10,300
They play a game of chance in which I have the opportunity to win win the maximum 600 with probability P or lose.

148
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,160
We're. To not lose.

149
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:31,410
So seats under would probably be B or the the lowest value zero with probability one minus p.

150
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:38,440
But so that's what you know, that that's that's what you're looking for.

151
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:46,160
What is the maximum value of the thing that makes it different, makes you different for that?

152
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:58,750
And you say, well, you know, I either work with that hundred dollars or I play that game, right?

153
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:03,729
That I can win either zero or $600.

154
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:16,960
How confident should I be that that that I'm going to, you know, get this $600 and you say, you know, let's say 50%.

155
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:20,950
That's that's what I mean do so $100 is fine.

156
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:25,029
But I have the opportunity to win 600.

157
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:37,839
So if I wear, you know, about a 50 or 60% sure that I get the 600, then I would play the game.

158
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,229
And then you say, okay, it's a 50%.

159
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:51,340
So 50% is, you know, the utility that you assign to that know that that failed.

160
00:25:51,910 --> 00:26:00,170
And then you repeat the same thing for what is the maximum p that will, you know,

161
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:11,380
make me in defense of walking out with do or playing a game of chance in which I have, you know,

162
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:19,270
600 I can win six of them thought of with probability P or a zero with probability one minus

163
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:28,390
B and then you have to be in order to be indifferent between the 200 and I'll play the game,

164
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:40,480
you have to be more confident than before with a $100 that you're going to make, that you are going to play, that you're going to win the 600, right?

165
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:47,260
So in this case, it can take people 2.5.

166
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:56,290
Let's say that you say that you go into your mind and say, I have to be.

167
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:14,040
Confident that that I'm going to win is this $200, but that's going to be more 2.5.

168
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:17,550
Let's say that is point seven for me.

169
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:26,020
The point is to abandon that $200 for sure and play the game.

170
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,280
I need to be about 70% sure that I'm going to win the 600.

171
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:34,800
Right. And then you you are you know, you answer.

172
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:44,370
You keep answering that question and then you feel the that your curve you build your utility from.

173
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:51,010
But and then you use those numbers to translate to point to the payoff table.

174
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:59,140
Take the payoff table. Take the pay of out of all the utilities and do everything that we did before.

175
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:06,810
Is that you instead of the expected monetary value that's going to be this bit that you pay and then you are.

176
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:11,230
But are we making this issue on so forth?

177
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,080
No.

178
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:39,440
Four for this is what we constrain the the utilities to the interval 01i there is another way to derive utilities for reasons of various individual,

179
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:53,460
though most of us are. This is kind of a formula that kind of try to approximate with one single parameter the a utility function for an individual.

180
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,970
And this is called the exponential utility function.

181
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:32,350
And the exponential utility function is going to be the formula is going to be the utility.

182
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:39,040
Of X x is a pair you write.

183
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:57,100
Utility of X is equal to. It is x is equal to one minus the exponential function e to the something writes.

184
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:04,990
All my notes.

185
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:11,200
They pay off. They are divided by art.

186
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:18,130
There are is a constant that determines how we think in how risk averse you are.

187
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,060
That defense on depends on you. So are.

188
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:39,810
Is. Six. Art is the art, the hands of the decision maker.

189
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:49,500
But we don't have to. Now, going to deport every entry on the table.

190
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:24,870
So they are depends on the decision maker. And in order to figure out what are is for each one of you.

191
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:29,830
Then we have these.

192
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:37,960
These are the are. Is the maximum payoff.

193
00:31:50,010 --> 00:32:04,650
For which. You're willing to play that game.

194
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:13,650
Okay. And the game is, you know, we are.

195
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:20,010
The probability p three.

196
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:35,380
The probability 3.5. Or lose are going to lose.

197
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:39,680
Apples are with probability point five.

198
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:52,270
So what is the maximum AR that you will be willing to do that for which we will be willing to do that and say, okay, if you say I, I, I will.

199
00:32:52,270 --> 00:33:05,800
I'm not you know, I would like, for example, to play that game if I have the possibility of winning a $100 with 4.5,

200
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:19,389
even though I may lose $50 with probability point five, I would then you say, but I'm not doing I don't want to do that for any bigger, higher number.

201
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:31,990
That's my limit. I don't want to lose more than $50 for some reason, you know, losing more than four in that case, Your Honor, is equal to.

202
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:48,740
100, right? So depending on how risk averse you are and how much money you have that determines sometimes the risk averse you are, then you know,

203
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:54,670
you have plenty of money and then you don't mind, you know,

204
00:33:54,900 --> 00:34:02,930
losing a little bit of money if you can make it, you have the opportunity to bring people in.

205
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:10,110
So you earn less for others. And then if you are a risk that this risk averse, then you is going to be in the why.

206
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:19,600
So some people have hundreds of people who are also some people are 10,000, right?

207
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:27,020
It depends on the decision made to corporations, you know,

208
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:37,410
to use that to make sometimes decisions and they have to determine what if they are for certain organization, how risk covers their organization.

209
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:41,460
Is it, you know, given different circumstances?

210
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:47,010
So now what what can you tell me about this function?

211
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:56,400
If you look at this function, what is the maximum number that you can get with these functions?

212
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:07,719
And. So you said, well, David, it's one, right?

213
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:22,480
Because if X goes to infinity, if it grows, grows and grows, grows the act over R, if this is E to the minus huge number, right?

214
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:30,549
E to the minus huge number and you know e to the minus.

215
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:36,520
That huge number is, is equal to one divided by E to the huge number.

216
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:50,080
Right. That means that that expression, this expression here close to zero X goes to infinity and then it approaches this one.

217
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:58,450
Right. Is always going to be a positive for X, for X being positive.

218
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:03,640
Then these numbers get, you know, growing and subtracting.

219
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:13,300
You know, this this this number here goes smaller, smaller, smaller, and it goes to zero.

220
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:17,320
And at the limit, you just get one, right.

221
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:25,000
So the maximum utility that you get with the utility function is one.

222
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:41,290
But you can have negative utilities because if you have a negative field, for example, then there is going to be X or, you know, something positive.

223
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:44,320
So divide it by I the positive number.

224
00:36:44,710 --> 00:37:03,310
And if it is a -5000, let's say that you are looking at a -5000 divided times in my notes is positive 5000.

225
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:08,019
So positive 5000 divided by 800 is 50.

226
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:11,640
So is one minus E to the power of 50.

227
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:17,200
Okay. I'm sorry. Yeah.

228
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:30,190
So is, is, is one minus E to the FA of 15th 15th the right and then which is a huge negative number e to the power of 50.

229
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,520
You said be positive number one minus.

230
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:37,840
That big positive number is large data.

231
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:48,870
So they. The exponential utility function is going to be is going to include something like this.

232
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:15,270
So the point is that that for negative payoff you can have a negative utility and for positive pay if you've got a number between zero and three.

233
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:26,710
And this is one. Okay.

234
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:50,720
And now. I am.

235
00:38:53,580 --> 00:39:12,700
I would like to. Who I would like to solve a small problem using the exponential utility function so that you see what I mean by that.

236
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:17,840
We need something like that. That's fine. But I want to.

237
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:25,010
I want to solve another problem. We can make.

238
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:31,740
One of these suppose that we have.

239
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,150
Again, three, this issue is the issue of the word.

240
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:43,570
Decision. Two decisions three.

241
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:52,190
And this is state of nature. One state of nature to.

242
00:39:54,230 --> 00:40:06,990
Fatal nature history. It's a very interesting debate of are we going to be following and this is going to be is south and.

243
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:13,260
I was in. Himself.

244
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:25,770
And they say that this is going to be -5000.

245
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:35,570
In 2000. 20,000.

246
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:47,930
And this is going to be -800.

247
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:56,640
This is going to be 4000. This is going to be.

248
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:07,130
They say. By the.

249
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:18,640
And this gives the probabilities on this assume in this case that the probabilities are.

250
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,150
We? Five.

251
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:36,330
Waiting for your chance to be appointed.

252
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:52,680
And this let's let's say that this person has an AR.

253
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:09,580
Of a substandard, let's say, $3,000.

254
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:21,730
Thus they are. Okay. So the first thing if you didn't know this number is if utilities were not in the mix,

255
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:29,920
you assume that this person needs a to drop drunk and therefore you use this monetary value.

256
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:34,120
So if you have probabilities, always use respect the monetary one.

257
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:39,280
Right. And then you go and you say, okay.

258
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:46,660
Might expect a monetary value in the.

259
00:42:53,640 --> 00:43:03,360
It's better we did some product. Of the probabilities.

260
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:23,710
And the pale. And they get at thousand 50, 730, 50.

261
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:29,680
So they need to here is the best for me.

262
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:36,070
So I will go for it, too, because my respect and monetary value is 57,000.

263
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:41,620
That's that's my decision.

264
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:53,620
Using this, the monetary value if I were a risk averse individual.

265
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:59,600
That means every single individual. Now let's put utilities.

266
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:06,169
Suppose that I know you know, I know that you know that I am a risk averse individual.

267
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:10,280
I might r these coefficient of that give me that.

268
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:14,870
How risk averse I am. It's 3000, right?

269
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:19,370
So I'm going to just copy the structure of this table.

270
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:26,380
Down here. No, I need to do that.

271
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:35,160
And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to name the 30,000 as are.

272
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:42,420
And I don't have to do that, but. So we kind of like these better.

273
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:57,660
Oh, I have a in a row.

274
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:09,870
I'm going to have a column called Art. So I cannot I cannot give that the name are to that.

275
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:21,790
So to avoid confusion, then I'm going just to. So I'm going to refer to that to that to that.

276
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:38,400
To that. Later to that. Same. The.

277
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:49,790
Okay. Right. So now what I'm.

278
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:53,850
What I'm going to do is.

279
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:31,350
So what I'm going to do is apply the exponential utility function, right?

280
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:53,980
And when I say this is equal to one minus the exponential function, he is he open parentheses minus the video divided by R and R is this number here?

281
00:46:54,100 --> 00:47:01,000
30,000, which I'm going to lock. So I use the same power for all day and duration 50.

282
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:07,000
And now I'm going to copy.

283
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:23,370
I have my my values here. And then now I'm going to I'm going to compute exponent, exponential utility.

284
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:30,850
For these entries. This is going to be from.

285
00:47:38,090 --> 00:47:46,480
The probability is that I'm going to lock on the decisions.

286
00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:52,490
I mean, the decision to hit point 28.

287
00:47:55,170 --> 00:47:58,860
-1.69 and point zero.

288
00:47:59,470 --> 00:48:11,010
What's so here? The best is that the best utility, the highest utility corresponds to the C should one.

289
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:40,440
So it tells you that if you were on the street expected monetary value you will be making

290
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:47,620
the decision to because decision to will give you the highest expected of 57,000.

291
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:57,129
But if you are risk averse, like in this case, I am, you know, risk averse to this.

292
00:48:57,130 --> 00:49:01,600
Leave it in front. That is how about my RSA house?

293
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:20,770
And when I apply this to this risk aversion to this payoff, then I get these utilities and the utility of losing four $5,000 is -4.29.

294
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:24,880
So it is a nega negative number and that is a weight.

295
00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:28,360
So they have to avoid these opportunity.

296
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:33,760
This is a possibility that is, you know, a 50% chance of happening.

297
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:38,530
I switch this issue. This is for sure $1,000.

298
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:50,800
Right. So this decision, one of these for sure is $1,000 versus having the probability of the possibility of losing 5000 with a decision to.

299
00:49:51,880 --> 00:50:08,170
So I'm willing to forego, you know, why is no amount of money this station to avoid these this big risk and thus that you know that's the risk.

300
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:15,350
So you if you if you were a decision maker with these are this is the decision that you would

301
00:50:15,370 --> 00:50:24,760
be decision like if you have a bigger R come means that you are less less less risk averse.

302
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:28,870
You will approximate to the aspect of monetary value.

303
00:50:28,870 --> 00:50:39,639
Let's say that you know you are not you the mind about losing the maximum that you that you play that game if it

304
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:52,480
if you lose $20,000 right so that with 50% probability but you you you you will play the game at that point.

305
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,570
So losing that means that you are RS 40,000.

306
00:50:55,950 --> 00:51:00,460
You have the probability of your winning 40,000.

307
00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:07,600
That was by the with 50% probability of 40,000 here.

308
00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:21,880
And so now my biggest utility is this one decision, too, that matches, you know, my respect to monetary value before.

309
00:51:22,210 --> 00:51:34,870
But here is an individual that is less risk donors and they have a higher that number and the less risk averse that individual is.

310
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:45,910
So and therefore, it converges that that individual is going to make decision based on playing the aspect of monetary value.

311
00:51:45,910 --> 00:52:01,810
But it is very risk of others individual that could 3000 for example like me or maybe a hundred I don't want to lose more than 550 it see

312
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:19,300
that that's pretty much the utility of that first one is one that and the others are you know zero this is -73 and this is zero this is -2.6,

313
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:24,480
six times ten to the 21. So that's a huge thing.

314
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:39,640
So it's this is stay with mindset his thousand is the weakening and it this is this is what we you get the difference.

315
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:48,680
Right. Okay.

316
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:51,940
So any questions about the exam?

317
00:52:55,570 --> 00:52:59,650
Anything that you would like to clarify.

318
00:53:02,590 --> 00:53:14,649
So you are going to have about six questions in the exam and you have until so the exam

319
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:23,860
will open either night at midnight or early tomorrow morning with no more than 8:00.

320
00:53:26,230 --> 00:53:37,360
You will have to meet tonight on Thursday, next Thursday to do so.

321
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:45,160
That's how they sound. So I only want Excel files in the summation.

322
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:52,990
You can do one Excel file with different when it's a worksheet.

323
00:53:53,590 --> 00:53:58,000
Sorry, be more heat for each question.

324
00:53:58,330 --> 00:54:04,360
So what I would like is one worksheet here with you.

325
00:54:04,390 --> 00:54:11,890
So put two questions in the same words. So to be able to go to the tabs and see free.

326
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:21,550
And if you have to answer something, text, so make it text box.

327
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:33,670
You go in to insert a textbook and you can write the variable answers here.

328
00:54:35,950 --> 00:54:45,910
So the exam is going to cover up to what we discussed today, which is utility.

329
00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:50,470
What we did today was refresh last night.

330
00:54:51,130 --> 00:55:07,600
But what you will have forecasting and the decision making with using field table in the exam is going to be,

331
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:11,890
you know, a lot of, you know, do it in Excel.

332
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:20,680
But there is going to be some questions that are conceptual that you can, you know,

333
00:55:20,830 --> 00:55:33,880
answer with a textbook or you can do the computations in Excel that you want like calculator and and answer so similar to those that we,

334
00:55:34,150 --> 00:55:37,780
you know, play with same day. So with the quizzes.

335
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:47,020
So, so you have an idea of what type of questions they might be something that to make sure that you

336
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:59,200
understand that they think the exam is open book open notes you can use all the time you want.

337
00:55:59,410 --> 00:56:15,130
But in my experience, if you go so I will make the exam so that you can solve it in about 5 hours max.

338
00:56:15,730 --> 00:56:28,800
Right. But if you feel if you see yourself, you know, Stoke are going over 8 hours and stop is not first rate.

339
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:38,470
So so people, you know, finish in 2 hours or 3 hours and so on people is they because they don't,

340
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:43,390
you know, they are stuck in one point and they think that's the end of the world.

341
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:48,700
Then they keep working, working and they consume more, you know, all the time.

342
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:52,840
And, you know, they say all this, these was too long.

343
00:56:53,010 --> 00:57:01,570
I spend 25 hours and exam and long is just stuck in a question that you keep working.

344
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:06,969
Right. So give yourself a limit.

345
00:57:06,970 --> 00:57:11,050
I would say 8 hours is you shouldn't get there.

346
00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:17,820
You can close. But if you are passing that, then I would say, please cut.

347
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:24,560
Is this not this awards. You have other things to be.

348
00:57:28,450 --> 00:57:34,330
Usually they dates after those.

349
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,790
I will give you the grade of the exam.

350
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:48,970
I will give you the grades and the homework that everybody's doing fine because, you know, you have the chance to work together and ask me questions.

351
00:57:48,970 --> 00:57:52,090
And that's fine. That's what I want for the homework.

352
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:58,900
But you receive your marks for reform or you receive them. For example, they they march for an exam.

353
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:02,350
Don't be writing. Solve anything.

354
00:58:02,530 --> 00:58:07,780
Right? Because it could be that there is exam that I don't have a lot of that.

355
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:11,679
I'm married and I have five points for each question.

356
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:17,040
So then if you miss one question, then you lose five points and you mean to question, you know,

357
00:58:17,050 --> 00:58:30,910
ten points and you get graded like 85 or 75 or 72, which are depending on how they count, this would be a very big rate.

358
00:58:32,290 --> 00:58:39,540
So they sound by itself using grade of exam, but it's, you know,

359
00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:51,640
how you perform relative to the whole of the old course because I tried to get the the mean of the class about a minus.

360
00:58:53,170 --> 00:58:58,090
So that's to be try to get to put that in that rate.

361
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:06,340
And the individuals who are able to manipulate this concept questions and therefore at the operational question,

362
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:12,260
those are going to get, you know, A's and people who you know.

363
00:59:13,830 --> 00:59:25,860
Don't you know why they have the you know that that the central points you know well define

364
00:59:27,210 --> 00:59:32,970
they can't put they can't do the operational question they can you know get into to be close

365
00:59:32,970 --> 00:59:46,290
range I'm sorry they a minus range but you know the point and then they the rest of view that

366
00:59:46,290 --> 00:59:53,820
might have some some issues with it with taking exams or whatever get that be plus right.

367
00:59:54,600 --> 01:00:05,570
What I can tell you is, is they over at all in the class if you do all your homework I you are guarantee it be in the class.

368
01:00:05,590 --> 01:00:12,060
So is going to the exam without any panic that you're not able to grasp it.

369
01:00:12,090 --> 01:00:22,640
What if you do your homework? So this is just to learn and to figure out what you know and ask me.

370
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:26,450
That's it. So you have.

371
01:00:26,930 --> 01:00:31,010
I know they need to. Um.

372
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:34,690
You know, that's what. That's what you know.

373
01:00:35,470 --> 01:00:49,140
For me to help you, I don't. But independent of when you see if they agree at the very end, I rank everybody their final grades.

374
01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:52,809
And then, you know, this is chunk of individual.

375
01:00:52,810 --> 01:00:58,030
I see it being separation between groups and you can see that.

376
01:00:58,870 --> 01:01:04,360
And then these are the A's. These are these are their employers.

377
01:01:04,990 --> 01:01:08,229
And do this so wonderful.

378
01:01:08,230 --> 01:01:16,890
Have a real problem that should be talking to me before the final exam.

379
01:01:16,930 --> 01:01:22,209
But if you're doing your homework and you are responding to your home, where you from?

380
01:01:22,210 --> 01:01:28,840
And talk to me and and I understand that you are trying to do their homework.

381
01:01:29,710 --> 01:01:39,400
You're not copying the homework from older people. Then you get into a B range of that.

382
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:52,090
You're on your own. If you do not leave the exam laws, but you have them, keep them from them some time and so on.

383
01:01:53,740 --> 01:02:09,480
But the safety net, the safety net is there. What I ask in return is that you do their problems independently to not talk to anybody,

384
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:13,960
not your classmates or other people that are outside the class.

385
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:18,160
I see you is open book, open knowledge. That's mine.

386
01:02:18,790 --> 01:02:23,649
But you have to do that by yourself. I want to know what you know what?

387
01:02:23,650 --> 01:02:32,110
Where I can help you. That's very important. And we want to preserve the integrity of the class.

388
01:02:32,110 --> 01:02:42,380
There's not going to be a lot of A's, but there's going to be a chunk of mine and hopefully not a lot of people.

389
01:02:42,670 --> 01:02:52,440
But that's pretty much what ends up be is not going to be an easy A again.

390
01:02:53,260 --> 01:02:58,990
But if you understand what we're doing, you'll get any questions.

391
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:13,430
Okay. Now. But what if we.

392
01:03:19,450 --> 01:03:35,200
Is introduced to introduce a decision tree and we are going to work with decision tree by solving the problem.

393
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:47,710
You're. Said 17 from another.

394
01:03:48,070 --> 01:03:54,969
And then right after this is going to be the last time I think we're going to use handouts from their books.

395
01:03:54,970 --> 01:04:05,020
And we're going to we're going to start working with a textbook that I recommended is required for this class from now on.

396
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:11,140
Oh, so let me show you what we're going to do.

397
01:04:12,250 --> 01:04:18,990
The first thing we want to use should have these icons in your computer.

398
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:32,350
So you if you have a you have a Windows machine, you should have already installed position decision tools, policy decision tools.

399
01:04:33,370 --> 01:04:46,000
You can see where they are pointing to programs and then to the P for Palisade and then probably say this, you shouldn't do this here.

400
01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:51,970
And then you have a lot of programs here that are add ons to excel.

401
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:57,880
And the first one that we're going to be using is the decision tree 8.2.

402
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:07,089
Those of you are, you know, using them that you cannot install these programs in your Mac so that you can use

403
01:05:07,090 --> 01:05:14,800
their rows very to a lab and use your computer as a terminal just to access the to

404
01:05:14,830 --> 01:05:19,690
allow you you're not going to download anything from the grocery store without you

405
01:05:19,690 --> 01:05:28,450
simply going to log on to one of their computers and use that software there.

406
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:34,390
So I am going to activate called Precision Tree.

407
01:05:36,450 --> 01:05:39,680
And then will position three will call.

408
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:55,580
Exhale. And then when you see this binder, they simply just closed that banner.

409
01:05:55,970 --> 01:06:09,990
And then you have an extra menu, an extra tab option in the remote that says, Oh, Lane Precision Tree.

410
01:06:10,890 --> 01:06:13,940
And these are the icons. So.

411
01:06:14,660 --> 01:06:23,060
So you'll see something like that home. And at the end you have precision tree something right click on position tree here.

412
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:31,630
And you know, it's tree is a graphical representation of the problem.

413
01:06:31,810 --> 01:06:42,190
Right. So we are going to, let's say, start very small on the decision tree.

414
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:51,040
And then in order to start the decision tree, click on this start of the tree.

415
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:57,830
And then you'll have you three.

416
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:03,709
This is what? This is what. And this is at the end.

417
01:07:03,710 --> 01:07:09,040
And no, this triangle means that, you know, signifies a terminal.

418
01:07:09,050 --> 01:07:14,750
No, this is where the decision ends. The decision analysis.

419
01:07:14,750 --> 01:07:28,620
And that's the last thing. But then you can add some kinds of different nodes by simply clicking on that terminal.

420
01:07:28,660 --> 01:07:31,800
Now, let's say that you want to add this issue.

421
01:07:31,820 --> 01:07:34,820
This is the point where I want to add it.

422
01:07:34,850 --> 01:07:49,510
This is. And he's being a hard decision, one that he shouldn't do, and so on and so forth.

423
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:54,100
So let me let me go back to the.

424
01:07:59,210 --> 01:08:05,220
To some of the problems that I was doing today.

425
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:50,360
All right, let me. Let me go back to to the model that I had.

426
01:09:05,660 --> 01:09:20,460
To. I'm going to reconstruct very quickly the example that I was working on.

427
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:32,969
I don't think I saved it. So this is going to be a decision, one decision to keep this issue.

428
01:09:32,970 --> 01:09:36,950
3 p.m. This is state of nature.

429
01:09:36,950 --> 01:09:41,610
A one state of nature to.

430
01:09:45,660 --> 01:10:09,940
And instead of three. The probability is 4.5, 0.4, 0.1, and first row was all south of right.

431
01:10:20,070 --> 01:10:23,700
The second row was -5000 here.

432
01:10:25,940 --> 01:10:33,360
Don't. 20,000 here. What was the number in the middle?

433
01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:39,030
This is what we just did. 2000, was it?

434
01:10:39,630 --> 01:10:58,710
So. And the third one that there's a role in making things -500, 400, 4500.

435
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:05,760
So this is what we had at the beginning.

436
01:11:09,410 --> 01:11:38,360
And we know that there's bigoted. Victim monetary value clues to some of the probabilities and the payoffs.

437
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:46,800
And. Right.

438
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:51,510
So we end up with the decision to be their best.

439
01:11:52,740 --> 01:11:59,340
So now anything that you can do with a bay of table, you can do with a decision three.

440
01:11:59,670 --> 01:12:09,360
Decision three. Sometimes the Bay of table is more functional because it is a very compact way to a to

441
01:12:09,750 --> 01:12:15,270
understand this issue problem when the decision when the decision problem is simple.

442
01:12:15,870 --> 01:12:19,800
That means that you have to make a decision now.

443
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:24,000
Then your decisions will affect your payoff in the future.

444
01:12:24,330 --> 01:12:28,220
Nature Percent's Estate. And then you collect your value, right?

445
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:33,380
This is what we call the one step decision problem.

446
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:37,470
So that's for part of the reward.

447
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:52,170
But decision trees can have, you know, can represent more code, can represent anything that a day of the table can represent more complicated problem.

448
01:12:52,740 --> 01:13:04,950
So let's say that I want to. PIN up near the tree and then I'm going to pull that sample from.

449
01:13:11,970 --> 01:13:20,010
Switching. Good.

450
01:13:20,810 --> 01:13:32,890
And then what? What we what we have at the very beginning is that until we build the tree from left to right in chronological order.

451
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:40,220
So what happens first in this problem that you make of this action or that nature presents a state?

452
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:52,100
So the decision analysis is you make a decision right now and then you wait in

453
01:13:52,110 --> 01:13:56,750
the future to see what happened to the date of the public debate about you.

454
01:13:57,150 --> 01:14:01,980
So the first thing you do is you make a decision, right?

455
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:10,469
And there are three possible decision, decision making that state a decision one, two or three.

456
01:14:10,470 --> 01:14:13,860
So to add it right, we're not quote.

457
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:17,790
Okay. So you have three decisions.

458
01:14:17,790 --> 01:14:22,110
So every time you see a square. No, that means that's where you make a decision.

459
01:14:22,650 --> 01:14:26,460
So this is state of nature one.

460
01:14:32,820 --> 01:14:41,450
This is data of to. And this is State of Nature three.

461
01:14:48,390 --> 01:14:55,080
Okay. Now, after you make a decision, suppose you go for a state of nature one.

462
01:14:55,470 --> 01:14:59,700
Then what happens? Nature to state. You know which state?

463
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:03,440
Nature is good. Could be state of nature.

464
01:15:03,450 --> 01:15:09,570
One, two or three. One of them. Okay, so here you need to put a chance.

465
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:12,770
No, that's what we called it. State of nature.

466
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:19,580
Making a decision so that state. And we have every possible state of nature.

467
01:15:19,590 --> 01:15:32,999
Right. And what happens is that they say these are the probabilities of these different branches,

468
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:37,890
this state of nature, where we know that they are state of nature.

469
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:46,470
Difference. What is the state of nature? One. This is state of nature to.

470
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:58,989
And this state of nature. Three. The probabilities are 45.1.

471
01:15:58,990 --> 01:16:02,050
1.4.5 is here.

472
01:16:02,710 --> 01:16:09,760
Point one. You're going to want.

473
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:20,220
10%. Yeah. And 44.

474
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:26,690
44, 44.

475
01:16:29,220 --> 01:16:37,140
Here. 40%.

476
01:16:37,740 --> 01:16:44,820
43. Okay. So 52%, 10% and 42%.

477
01:16:45,930 --> 01:16:59,009
So what I'm going to do now is the same thing will happen if I go to for the state of nature to or state of nature three,

478
01:16:59,010 --> 01:17:06,480
I still have to say I'm sorry. Decision two it's just really badly.

479
01:17:06,630 --> 01:17:36,630
This is this issue of the one. So. So here he is this issue to.

480
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:49,630
It takes more than. Decision.

481
01:17:50,820 --> 01:18:08,000
Decision three. So the decision, one decision to the 3 to 3 instead of richer 1 to 3.

482
01:18:08,470 --> 01:18:18,310
And then I can copy this structure and then appropriate subtree to put that in all these branches based as a tree.

483
01:18:21,180 --> 01:18:31,209
Earn the haste as of three. So that that's your payoff table.

484
01:18:31,210 --> 01:18:34,600
Except that I don't have the right numbers here.

485
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:42,530
It sells themselves on the salesman and. Alison.

486
01:18:45,630 --> 01:18:58,220
An evaluation. You know, and then you go to B -5000.

487
01:19:03,170 --> 01:19:12,440
In 2000. This is going to be 20,000.

488
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:18,020
You can just change the last one.

489
01:19:18,740 --> 01:19:26,930
-504,585.

490
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:38,210
Jonathan and 500.

491
01:19:42,050 --> 01:19:50,910
Then see what you have here is the expected monetary value of each one of those notes.

492
01:19:51,140 --> 01:19:55,610
Right. They they change note the state of nature of notes.

493
01:19:55,610 --> 01:19:59,629
So they respect the monetary value of the session.

494
01:19:59,630 --> 01:20:04,440
One With all this state of nature, it's a thousand base state aspect.

495
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:15,030
The monetary value of this decision, we thought the state of nature is 5700 and is the monetary value of the session.

496
01:20:15,050 --> 01:20:18,580
Three is 350 with the state of nature, right?

497
01:20:18,980 --> 01:20:26,210
So therefore that three looks at which one is the maximum and says, oh, the maximum is disposition.

498
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:32,380
So that that EU 5700 didn't put it at all right.

499
01:20:35,090 --> 01:20:38,629
In the path of of that of that decision.

500
01:20:38,630 --> 01:20:45,700
So the decision to asset true meaning that's the best decision for you and then you're going to be making 57.

501
01:20:46,130 --> 01:20:53,030
This is exactly what we got here with the decision with the value of the table.

502
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:58,540
But in this case, you know, it took a little longer to to build.

503
01:20:58,670 --> 01:21:02,059
All right. So it's more of conscious of doing that with the decision tree.

504
01:21:02,060 --> 01:21:07,040
The decision tree is going to be much more useful when we expand this mission.

505
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:16,910
So what about the like how can we make a decision here and make a decision here and then other states will make it happen and so forth.

506
01:21:17,390 --> 01:21:27,650
But for one step decision analysis stories, it's better to use that value of table because it's more manageable, easier.

507
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:31,490
But you can do the same thing with it. It a decision tree.

508
01:21:31,940 --> 01:21:36,440
Okay this is what we'll we'll continue next Thursday.

509
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:45,680
Tuesday we'll have a class spring and Thursday we'll going to continue talking about decision

510
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:55,190
trees and we're going to start taking solving homework from within this session right this time.

511
01:22:14,990 --> 01:22:29,410
Has to be something very specific.

512
01:22:31,510 --> 01:22:47,170
Yeah, exactly. Usually you don't have to come back and say, is that something in your class that you don't like that happens afterwards?

513
01:22:47,200 --> 01:23:09,940
I'm not thinking, you know, this is stuff I know about my great, great, great, great company.

514
01:23:15,790 --> 01:23:18,880
Yeah. Like, for example.

515
01:23:21,450 --> 01:23:25,719
Yeah, well, I have friends here from all the groups, so.

516
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:33,150
I mean, like, there's, like, a huge chemistry in business.

517
01:23:33,190 --> 01:23:38,140
Yeah, but I wouldn't know. It was like a girlfriend thing, you know?

518
01:23:38,350 --> 01:23:44,070
I mean, it was like she was someone we don't know.

519
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:54,620
For example, I know I'm not gonna get know it.

520
01:23:55,280 --> 01:24:06,590
And I'm like, but it's nice to think you have, like, you know, even if it's like a but yeah.

521
01:24:07,110 --> 01:24:19,090
Yeah. Yeah. The ones that were just like you guys coming down for their lessons.

522
01:24:20,490 --> 01:24:27,610
Yeah. But if those are great things to watch or something.

523
01:24:28,030 --> 01:24:33,549
Yeah. I mean, I, I never would have thought.

524
01:24:33,550 --> 01:24:47,430
How would you feel? That's why I think we could both be a lot of women when she gets to the bench.

525
01:24:47,450 --> 01:24:58,934
Man, I think. I don't know. I just thought, okay, yeah, I think I don't because I just want to know how does it.
