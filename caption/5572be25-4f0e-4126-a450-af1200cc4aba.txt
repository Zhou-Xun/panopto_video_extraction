1
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:18,320
Think I.

2
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:43,420
But the person wants something else.

3
00:00:53,670 --> 00:01:19,500
The. I.

4
00:01:38,630 --> 00:02:16,090
Five. So I'm.

5
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:37,830
Like. And.

6
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:50,980
The time.

7
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:31,220
Not at all. Yeah.

8
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:46,480
They were going to make it.

9
00:03:56,050 --> 00:05:25,390
And. Yeah.

10
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:40,830
I love you.

11
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:52,490
I love you. It's like.

12
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:24,320
Hi. How you doing? All right.

13
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:54,950
So I need to grow it.

14
00:06:55,110 --> 00:07:00,470
Yeah. Hello? Yeah. Oh, hello.

15
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:09,380
Did I? No. No. Good. Is that like, first of all, do not throw these.

16
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:22,050
That be a little loud.

17
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:34,729
If you needed a knife and the owl is on so is being recorded by Panopto.

18
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:37,790
It's an automatic thing. Can we not record it?

19
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:43,730
I can't. Can we unplug it? I don't know.

20
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:50,690
Here's a.

21
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:57,481
Well done that way. Yes.

22
00:07:57,671 --> 00:08:01,171
I think it's just it's just a little better for me. Yeah, I think so.

23
00:08:02,431 --> 00:08:08,431
Yeah. Cause everything that I do that's recorded, we have to send it to FCC in theory.

24
00:08:08,431 --> 00:08:11,591
I mean, it's the class, but, like, that way. Am I right?

25
00:08:12,431 --> 00:08:15,441
Yeah. Well, that's excellent.

26
00:08:28,661 --> 00:08:58,721
I know. So that's how we try to welcome the 20 year old section of our class and open to other interested books.

27
00:08:58,721 --> 00:09:02,201
And welcome to all of you for being with us this morning.

28
00:09:03,071 --> 00:09:10,271
We are so fortunate to be able to hear from one of our agent violence in Syria today, Amir Rubin.

29
00:09:10,781 --> 00:09:19,211
He's an ancient film and Ross School and he's just a really outstanding Guardians of the Galaxy Advisory Board.

30
00:09:20,231 --> 00:09:29,291
And and and and he's just got an unbelievable series of accomplishments that he can share with you.

31
00:09:29,951 --> 00:09:33,591
He's currently the CEO of One Medical First Among.

32
00:09:35,121 --> 00:09:49,321
And her dad was the. An additional CEO at Optum and CEO and CEO of UCLA Health and a number of other things.

33
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:53,941
Amir is here today to talk a little bit about his career experiences.

34
00:09:55,031 --> 00:09:59,981
Some of the skills he's found to be useful opportunities and challenges in health care.

35
00:10:00,321 --> 00:10:03,551
Maybe a little bit of a medical. Let him take the lead on that.

36
00:10:04,631 --> 00:10:11,061
And and hopefully this can be a Q&A and a conversation with a near and often useful drawing.

37
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:16,041
So welcome and thank you so much for being here. Thank you so much for having me.

38
00:10:16,071 --> 00:10:19,731
What a pleasure to be here. Well, good. Well, thanks, everybody.

39
00:10:19,761 --> 00:10:25,171
You can hear me. Okay. I have this microphone. I'm not sure I need it, but. I have it.

40
00:10:25,531 --> 00:10:28,731
Maybe just for starters, I'd love just to go around the room.

41
00:10:28,741 --> 00:10:32,281
Just quickly, just introduce yourself.

42
00:10:32,701 --> 00:10:37,161
What you're you are or a program you're in. And maybe just one.

43
00:10:37,171 --> 00:10:44,431
One thing about you. Most embarrassing moment ever or what you're interested in in terms of health care.

44
00:10:44,431 --> 00:10:51,381
But we'll just be brief. But just so give me a flavor for who we have here or something we just did at a conference I was at.

45
00:10:51,391 --> 00:10:54,951
What's your favorite household appliance? Mm hmm.

46
00:10:54,961 --> 00:10:59,401
Mm hmm. It's called DoorDash, right?

47
00:11:00,631 --> 00:11:04,711
Yes. You want to kick us off? My name is Mariana.

48
00:11:09,741 --> 00:11:12,771
A is my one coffee. Uh huh.

49
00:11:13,371 --> 00:11:18,651
And maybe I'll just say where you where you came from. What were you doing before or where geography you came from?

50
00:11:18,891 --> 00:11:25,111
So I'm from. I was a biology major.

51
00:11:25,381 --> 00:11:29,210
Fantastic. Fantastic. And I'll see.

52
00:11:29,211 --> 00:11:33,771
You could say if you were coming from school. Where'd you come from? Perfect.

53
00:11:33,891 --> 00:11:37,961
Great. All right. Got the pattern. Let's go. My name's Alexis.

54
00:11:37,971 --> 00:11:42,941
I'm a first year interested. And I'm from there in Michigan.

55
00:11:43,301 --> 00:11:46,901
I went through Michigan State for undergrad and physiology there.

56
00:11:47,381 --> 00:11:54,071
And my favorite has to be right here in Nice.

57
00:11:55,661 --> 00:12:01,531
Hey, we're going to do our thing. I was born in the 70. And I give.

58
00:12:04,051 --> 00:12:08,941
I did my best, and I'm honored to be in the kitchen.

59
00:12:09,901 --> 00:12:14,561
I graduated from U.S. University. Pennsylvania.

60
00:12:14,821 --> 00:12:20,171
I have been working with the state council.

61
00:12:22,801 --> 00:12:26,370
I'm all right.

62
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:30,211
Good with my. I'm a second year.

63
00:12:32,421 --> 00:12:35,901
Area, I. Here.

64
00:12:36,371 --> 00:12:40,531
And my most embarrassing thing is I broke my car after a trip.

65
00:12:42,391 --> 00:12:46,151
Oh, that sounds like something I would have done. Nice to meet you, Hannah.

66
00:12:48,251 --> 00:12:53,101
I. And second year. Undergrads.

67
00:12:56,101 --> 00:13:04,261
Epic. We talked about it at the beer garden. Yes, epic. A few weeks ago, I was here at Marks and Spencer and I.

68
00:13:05,421 --> 00:13:10,731
I've never done anything embarrassing, so. I don't know. Maybe today could be the day.

69
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:15,841
This could be a more than me.

70
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:21,161
I'm a. From Los Angeles, California.

71
00:13:23,161 --> 00:13:28,081
Our strategy and. See my favorite household appliances.

72
00:13:30,161 --> 00:13:33,551
Air. Fryer Yeah, I need to. I haven't gotten into Air Fryer yet. I need to do that.

73
00:13:33,551 --> 00:13:37,921
I grew up in Los Angeles as well. So nice to meet you. Please. My name is just me.

74
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:44,891
But I'm also a. And.

75
00:13:51,661 --> 00:13:56,641
And she and I during the pandemic thinking about my parents.

76
00:13:56,641 --> 00:14:20,461
And now I regret it. Oh, great.

77
00:14:21,221 --> 00:14:27,011
To meet you. I would say like it was instant pot and then like.

78
00:14:29,271 --> 00:14:32,901
Yeah. See, now I know I'm dated. I had the snack master.

79
00:14:32,901 --> 00:14:35,990
You don't even know what the snack master is. It made a sandwich.

80
00:14:35,991 --> 00:14:41,121
It was like the press. And I had it here when I was in grad school and then, like, I dropped it one day.

81
00:14:41,211 --> 00:14:44,501
It's like, no. And I'd watch the infomercials about the snack master.

82
00:14:44,511 --> 00:14:48,981
I'm like, You want to make a hot apple pie? Two pieces of white bread, butter, kind of apple pie.

83
00:14:48,981 --> 00:14:52,700
And, like, it was amazing. So I'm behind. Airfryer.

84
00:14:52,701 --> 00:15:11,391
Yes, please. Mm hmm.

85
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:19,241
It was a fish. Fish specific? Yeah.

86
00:15:22,891 --> 00:15:26,401
Yeah. That's good.

87
00:15:26,971 --> 00:15:33,781
That's really good. Yeah. I'm pretty sure it's a student.

88
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:43,141
I did my undergrad in Virginia and I just went straight through and for what I figured.

89
00:15:47,191 --> 00:15:50,271
Wow. Yeah, that's good.

90
00:15:51,411 --> 00:15:55,141
I lived in Houston for a bit. What part of Houston? Yeah.

91
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:59,661
Yeah. When? In Bel Air. I worked in the medical center there at Memorial Hermann.

92
00:16:00,271 --> 00:16:03,411
Yeah. Great. Hi. I'm Sidney.

93
00:16:03,471 --> 00:16:07,321
I said. I was trying to.

94
00:16:09,331 --> 00:16:14,851
Iowa. And my I guess the most embarrassing thing that happened to me or wasn't the most

95
00:16:14,851 --> 00:16:20,431
was that I was trying to take a piece of this really fat squirrel on the dog,

96
00:16:21,001 --> 00:16:24,451
and then the squirrel came over and sat on my suit.

97
00:16:24,661 --> 00:16:29,491
Wow. I don't think so. Oh. Everyone is looking at me and I.

98
00:16:30,101 --> 00:16:34,601
Kind of this world that's really interested in gold.

99
00:16:35,381 --> 00:16:39,971
Wow. Did you swing by student health services to get it? Like, biopsy or whatever?

100
00:16:41,321 --> 00:16:45,101
Nice, too. Nice to see you. I'm Chris.

101
00:16:45,851 --> 00:16:51,731
I'm a first year. I'm a. Originally from Livonia, Michigan, went to Central.

102
00:16:53,721 --> 00:17:00,141
It also worked out a bit for. Great. I guess I'm not a big fan, but my favorite.

103
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:05,361
TV. Yeah, that's good.

104
00:17:05,421 --> 00:17:08,811
That was a. Good adaptation of the product. I like that.

105
00:17:09,771 --> 00:17:14,421
I am worried. I'm my first year. Just a student originally from outside of Philadelphia.

106
00:17:15,441 --> 00:17:25,541
I was recently in school, was apprehensive. I would say my current favorite.

107
00:17:28,721 --> 00:17:33,371
Those who have been over to my old apartment in Kerry town that doesn't have a dishwasher.

108
00:17:34,841 --> 00:17:39,861
Much like those who did. The table top dishwasher.

109
00:17:39,891 --> 00:17:45,101
I have to Google that. And what happens? Isn't that a sink? Is that what it's like?

110
00:17:46,551 --> 00:17:50,751
Oh, wow. Wow. It's like living in an RV.

111
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:54,201
Yeah. All right, that's. That's cool. Awesome.

Thank you. A first year. For this.

124

I was working at Eastern Europe and America. Lennox International Outpatient Clinic.

125
00:19:54,001 --> 00:20:00,701
The last year. My time in. I'll have one for the house.

126
00:20:04,341 --> 00:20:09,081
These are the things you realize, like, why did I only have one fork I can take my hat for?

127
00:20:09,561 --> 00:20:14,151
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Fair enough. Fair enough. Yes.

128

Here. David.

131
00:20:36,141 --> 00:20:44,961
I would say I wanted to. But right now. So yeah, once you get some of that cash flow coming in with your job, then you.

132
00:20:45,351 --> 00:20:48,651
Then you upgrade. Yeah. Yeah. All right.

133
00:20:48,651 --> 00:20:57,831
Where are we? Please. I am. Let's see what it.

134
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:10,441
I would also have to go. Wow.

135
00:21:11,781 --> 00:21:34,481
Fantastic. Hello there. No.

136

I mean, let's say for the surface go area. The meat thermometer.

140
00:22:33,421 --> 00:22:37,051
Wow. Very precise. That's impressive.

141
00:22:37,461 --> 00:22:41,851
I never complained. I'm just. Wow. You always so together.

142

00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:03,591
For years. Great.

145

Nice. Nice to meet you. Oh, my favorite appliance in my career.

My favorite. And the milk frother that's my wife's.

149
00:23:30,161 --> 00:23:33,481
I think she would say the milk frother. Uh.

150
00:23:33,581 --> 00:23:39,441

Kitchen knife. I sorry a lot. I.

152
00:24:02,171 --> 00:24:07,731
My favorite. I'm going to go with.

153
00:24:10,411 --> 00:24:15,601
After Saudi Arabia and other. That's great.

154
00:24:15,991 --> 00:24:19,431
Please. Oh, yeah. Hi, April.

155
00:24:33,081 --> 00:24:44,791
Thanks, April. Nice to see her. I never had one.

156
00:25:18,721 --> 00:25:22,321
And. Hmm.

157
00:25:22,891 --> 00:25:30,061
You're ready. That's good. If we have time, we'll have a we'll have a battle rap over a dishwashing strategy.

158
00:25:30,691 --> 00:25:36,531
Yes. Next row. Yeah. I. And student.

160
00:25:54,561 --> 00:25:59,241
Oh. The heating pad thing. Yeah. Yeah, those are pretty good.

161
00:26:00,111 --> 00:26:04,121
All right, guys. Good morning, everyone.

162
00:26:04,131 --> 00:26:08,721

164
00:26:24,591 --> 00:26:42,081
All right. I. I love this email and my favorite client is probably between my blog because I like to start writing for my Mac.

165
00:26:43,231 --> 00:26:46,330
Wow. You all cook and clean in this group.

166
00:26:46,331 --> 00:26:53,411
It's fascinating. I mean. Yeah. How about over here? I have branded a branded plant in Texas.

167
00:26:55,751 --> 00:26:59,071
Seven five. Teachers and students.

168
00:27:00,061 --> 00:27:04,691
First, first and. Jonathan Katz.

169
00:27:05,581 --> 00:27:11,041
But still an interesting classic. So let's see.

170
00:27:11,571 --> 00:27:15,081
I think my espresso. Oh. Hmm.

171
00:27:17,321 --> 00:27:23,831
Hi. My name is. I went to three university in Annapolis, where I've been a health care insurance technology degree.

172
00:27:23,831 --> 00:27:27,161
And then after that, I was at the same time for a little bit.

173
00:27:29,921 --> 00:27:38,321
Your favorite. To make sure it was like my parents in the 90.

174
00:27:38,881 --> 00:27:47,670
Unfortunately, he ended up with an ex boyfriend, so. Oh, but you got some of his good, you know, some other stuff.

175
00:27:47,671 --> 00:27:51,121
And he got the sandwich maker. Yeah. Yeah.

176
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:54,721
Sounds like he got the better end of the deal, but. Nice to meet you.

177
00:27:55,201 --> 00:28:03,301
I went to Israel from Olympia, Washington. My favorite kitchen.

178
00:28:07,551 --> 00:28:11,211
That's nice. Okay, good. All right. We're wrapping it up.

179
00:28:11,631 --> 00:28:15,261
Professor Crowley, Candy Crowley, originally from northern Ontario.

180
00:28:16,531 --> 00:28:25,081
Graduate of HMV. And my favorite item is my battery powered.

181
00:28:25,561 --> 00:28:29,880
He did the best I can.

182
00:28:29,881 --> 00:28:37,591
We keep our homes cool. Wow. And they just an awesome thing.

183
00:28:38,491 --> 00:28:41,971
Wow. That's probably pretty green. You have to heat the whole house, so you just heat yourself.

184
00:28:43,531 --> 00:28:51,241
That's good. My name is Sam. Here is what?

185
00:28:57,271 --> 00:29:07,731
I take it that you have about a year off for. Avery.

186
00:29:10,661 --> 00:29:15,041
Would be a toaster oven. And also, I think most of your.

187
00:29:16,911 --> 00:29:22,551
I don't know of anybody else playing this music, but for me, I usually have the most.

188
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:26,311
During the. And the overarching theme.

189
00:29:27,091 --> 00:29:33,531
Because it's like if you don't have an on. Yeah, I get that.

190
00:29:33,561 --> 00:29:39,141
How about breaking two strings on your guitar at the high school dance where your band was playing for the first time?

191
00:29:40,821 --> 00:29:43,901
Yeah, and that isn't even the worst embarrassing.

192
00:29:44,131 --> 00:29:49,851
That's, like, middle for me there. I had one on the way for me to say I.

193
00:29:50,181 --> 00:29:53,461
Morning, Michigan. I went to the university in Detroit. Where? Elsewhere.

194
00:29:55,661 --> 00:30:01,241
Okay. Administration and then. Favorite household appliance is probably their favorite.

195
00:30:02,731 --> 00:30:06,551
Guys. Okay. Thanks for. So I to stop.

196
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:19,880
My favorite. Thanks, Christopher.

197
00:30:19,881 --> 00:30:23,361
Nice to meet you. My name is Michigan.

198
00:30:24,211 --> 00:30:29,241
Good morning. Well. Going to put.

199
00:30:31,851 --> 00:30:35,691
Yeah. Thanks for some. Nice. Nice to meet you.

200
00:30:36,571 --> 00:30:51,551
I'm getting this. And in a very small.

201
00:30:56,931 --> 00:31:01,631
People are like are. Down the hill.

202
00:31:03,431 --> 00:31:17,881
I mean, your first year. Fantastic.

203
00:31:17,971 --> 00:31:22,381
Nice to meet you. I used to live in Santa monica, too. Great place. Yeah, pretty much.

204
00:31:22,941 --> 00:31:27,651
Yes. Beautiful weather. First.

205
00:31:32,131 --> 00:31:40,791
When you're. When I broke my neck out of the blue.

206
00:31:41,451 --> 00:31:45,551
Oh, vey. Oh, gosh. Yeah.

207
00:31:45,941 --> 00:31:51,941
Wow. All right. We got a couple more walk in.

208
00:31:51,941 --> 00:31:56,701
We'll do interest. Interesting. Then I'll jump into it. You want to introduce yourself? Yes.

209
00:31:58,941 --> 00:32:02,461
Yeah. This is part of the management training.

210
00:32:02,481 --> 00:32:05,810
You walk in. Introduce yourself. Just name where you're from.

211
00:32:05,811 --> 00:32:17,591
And we'll leave it at that. Nice to meet you.

212
00:32:18,071 --> 00:32:21,971
And then we had another one back there. We did? We get you? Yeah. Hi. Yes, my name.

213
00:32:24,811 --> 00:32:35,101
I did. We're about to. And so I work.

214
00:32:41,391 --> 00:32:43,641
Fantastic. So nice to meet you. All right, good.

215
00:32:43,941 --> 00:32:52,850
So maybe I'll spend, like, 3 to 5 minutes just blabbing about some stuff, but then let's open it up for Q&A and everything.

216
00:32:52,851 --> 00:32:59,781
Kathy taught you all that you shouldn't ask. Ask, like it's all fair game.

217
00:33:00,021 --> 00:33:03,291
Like, ask me whatever you want about anything.

218
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:09,770
I would take my answers, you know, for the $0.02 or cents and a half that they're worth.

219
00:33:09,771 --> 00:33:14,361
So I wouldn't over. But we could talk about anything y'all want to talk about.

220
00:33:14,661 --> 00:33:22,671
I unplugged the owl. I know tech is going to be upset at me, but, like, so you're you're you know, you're off of the recordings.

221
00:33:22,671 --> 00:33:28,820
Of course, your phones are probably recording everything. But so just a little bit about myself.

222
00:33:28,821 --> 00:33:33,441
I had the I studied economics as an undergrad at UC Berkeley.

223
00:33:33,441 --> 00:33:43,251
I grew up in Los Angeles and I went to Cal and um, I was studying econ and business and I needed an elective my junior year.

224
00:33:43,581 --> 00:33:50,181
And the thing that fit into my schedule was this class called Health Economics Economics at Stanford.

225
00:33:50,751 --> 00:33:57,261
And I loved it. I loved it. And that got me exposed to health care and this whole world.

226
00:33:57,261 --> 00:34:06,681
I then went to work for a startup that was doing kind of telecommunications, computer networking, modeling, and this is before we had high bandwidth.

227
00:34:06,831 --> 00:34:15,111
So how do you over just old school Ethernet and other networks at the time get higher bandwidth?

228
00:34:15,111 --> 00:34:20,061
And that got me interested in startups and technology and we started working with health care organizations,

229
00:34:20,061 --> 00:34:27,470
modeling early PAX Digital Radiology, radiology systems because at the time it was like you didn't have all the compression algorithms too.

230
00:34:27,471 --> 00:34:30,981
So how are we going to move these images around? It was it was interesting.

231
00:34:30,981 --> 00:34:32,841
And boy, how have things changed there?

232
00:34:33,081 --> 00:34:41,181
And then I decided to go back to graduate school and I was fortunate enough here to come to U of M and did do a degree MBA and the MHC.

233
00:34:43,121 --> 00:34:51,401
Graduated a couple of years before y'all so finished in 96. And I met my wife in the program here.

234
00:34:52,271 --> 00:34:53,861
Very productive years for me.

235
00:34:56,381 --> 00:35:02,410
I like to I like to say also, I never got better grades because I was always trying to like, you know, go study and let's go grab a beer.

236
00:35:02,411 --> 00:35:07,331
And she would never leave the library. I'm like, oh, my gosh. So it's like, I knew everything.

237
00:35:07,331 --> 00:35:11,821
I'm like, because I'd be sitting there waiting for him. Like, finally, like, we used to study at Rackham a lot.

238
00:35:11,831 --> 00:35:15,461
I'll still get a rack of. Yeah. And I always wanted to chit chat.

239
00:35:16,541 --> 00:35:20,501
You know, we sit there, they used to have like the little break room with the coffee machine.

240
00:35:20,801 --> 00:35:24,991
I still have that nasty coffee machine in there now, probably.

241
00:35:25,391 --> 00:35:29,081
Anyhow, as before, all the fancy coffee, we didn't have Starbucks.

242
00:35:29,381 --> 00:35:33,520
We had really we didn't have, you know, the crops and all of that stuff.

243
00:35:33,521 --> 00:35:36,821
We had to we had to drink coffee from the paper cup. Right.

244
00:35:36,851 --> 00:35:47,920
Walk through the snow in Michigan. Anyway, Nicole, my wife, did a fellowship at Henry Ford after she finished here in the School of Public Health.

245
00:35:47,921 --> 00:35:54,011
She was also a with a focus on. I had an extra year because I was in the school as well.

246
00:35:54,471 --> 00:36:05,651
Um, I did a summer at what's now called North Shore North North Shore Hospital, which is called Evanston in Chicago, which was great.

247
00:36:06,011 --> 00:36:11,831
And then my second summer I worked in management consulting in Minnesota for for Deloitte, which was great.

248
00:36:12,611 --> 00:36:17,861
Nicole did your fellowship at Henry Ford Health System. You might have heard of Game Warden.

249
00:36:17,981 --> 00:36:21,731
I don't know if Gail comes around here. Gail was the CEO there. He was the CEO at the time.

250
00:36:21,731 --> 00:36:28,031
And of course, Bos was also a grad here. Peter Butler, we're actually going to go visit Gail tomorrow morning in Detroit.

251
00:36:28,881 --> 00:36:33,281
And so Nichols really stayed in touch with him in a small, small world.

252
00:36:33,971 --> 00:36:37,571
Peter's son, Jeff Butler, he's a graduate here, also distinguished graduate.

253
00:36:37,931 --> 00:36:43,181
Uh, I took him on as a fellow. Years later, when I was at UCLA.

254
00:36:43,211 --> 00:36:47,711
And now he's running all of ambulatory care for UCLA. But anyway, so.

255
00:36:48,821 --> 00:36:52,861
So Nicole did fellowship. When we finished, we both moved out to the Bay Area.

256
00:36:52,871 --> 00:36:57,160
I had been in California, I worked for we each worked for consulting firms.

257
00:36:57,161 --> 00:37:04,031
At the time I worked for a firm called APM Doesn't Exist anymore, but it was a great healthcare management consulting firm.

258
00:37:04,421 --> 00:37:09,851
A lot of those folks, um, went to various different places, various offer consulting firms.

259
00:37:09,851 --> 00:37:14,861
Some of them are still at Chartists. They started that firm a couple of decades later, if anybody's heard about that.

260
00:37:14,861 --> 00:37:21,271
But, um, and another one is BDC, another Bay Area folks, but all over, uh,

261
00:37:21,581 --> 00:37:26,761
and Nicole worked for a company called the Bloomin Group, which was doing health policy consulting.

262
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:33,221
Um, and uh, then after a few years, Peter, her boss from Ford,

263
00:37:33,221 --> 00:37:38,261
became the CEO at the Methodist Healthcare System, Houston Methodist, what they call it now in Houston.

264
00:37:38,831 --> 00:37:42,160
And, uh, and she's like, You wouldn't want to go down there.

265
00:37:42,161 --> 00:37:45,371
And I was young and love and geographically unaware.

266
00:37:45,641 --> 00:37:48,731
You know, I'm like, it is kind of like San Francisco, L.A., San Diego.

267
00:37:49,211 --> 00:37:55,990
So we moved down to Houston. Um, and I worked for Memorial Hermann Health System, which ended up being great.

268
00:37:55,991 --> 00:37:59,111
I loved Houston. Great barbecue, good company barbecue.

269
00:37:59,111 --> 00:38:03,940
Every time I go, I hit it up. And we have two kids who are born in Houston.

270
00:38:03,941 --> 00:38:07,651
So, you know, I have this for a name, Amir Hummer.

271
00:38:08,141 --> 00:38:14,290
And like I got two kids. And when we when they were born, of course, since my wife did more of the work on the birth,

272
00:38:14,291 --> 00:38:18,611
they were born at Houston Methodist, not at Memorial Hermann. We were like, Where should they be built to be delivered?

273
00:38:19,301 --> 00:38:24,401
But when you have your your when your kid born there, they're like,

274
00:38:24,401 --> 00:38:30,841
would you like the normal birth certificate or the like four foot by three foot giant Texas star certificate?

275
00:38:30,851 --> 00:38:32,171
I'm like, [INAUDIBLE] yeah, give me that.

276
00:38:32,891 --> 00:38:41,501
So there's like two giant Texas flag sized, like birth certificates, which is a problem if you need to xerox it for an application or something.

277
00:38:42,161 --> 00:38:48,281
But like that was like, wow, Texas. Like then I felt like I was in Texas and then we had go Texan Day.

278
00:38:48,281 --> 00:38:55,081
Like it's history was pretty formal back then. I'm like, people wear a suit and tie, but like once a year during the rodeo, you know,

279
00:38:55,301 --> 00:39:01,420
you had Go Texan Day where you could wear your jeans and boots and like us greenhorns would walk in with our boots since,

280
00:39:01,421 --> 00:39:04,691
you know, not know what we're doing. But Houston was great.

281
00:39:04,691 --> 00:39:10,031
I worked at Memorial Hermann actually emailed an alum, Ken Wine can.

282
00:39:12,011 --> 00:39:14,601
Long time ago, he was a chief operating officer of Memorial Hermann.

283
00:39:15,051 --> 00:39:21,431
I emailed a bunch of folks and he was kind enough and said, Hey, let me introduce you to our head of business development.

284
00:39:22,101 --> 00:39:28,131
And he ended up hiring me. So I ended up being director of business development after doing management consulting for a couple of years.

285
00:39:28,611 --> 00:39:35,181
And we were at Memorial Hermann and kind of now an academic and community system, but we were buying hospitals.

286
00:39:35,571 --> 00:39:39,501
And the merger between Hermann, which was an academic medical center and memorial,

287
00:39:39,501 --> 00:39:44,660
which was a community hospital system, had just happened and that was great.

288
00:39:44,661 --> 00:39:50,211
And then my boss, Bird Zimmer Lee, who's been the CFO at Intermountain Healthcare for many years,

289
00:39:50,481 --> 00:39:57,261
he went from Memorial Hermann to Methodist, um, to Intermountain.

290
00:39:57,411 --> 00:39:59,961
And we're still in touch. He's amazing. He's great.

291
00:40:02,211 --> 00:40:09,801
He and I got assigned to this medical group that Herman, which was an academic medical center, had built this big physician group that.

292
00:40:11,161 --> 00:40:19,631
Was taking globally capitation, global capitation, total risk. And this was in the early years and losing their shirts for many different reasons.

293
00:40:19,631 --> 00:40:27,731
So he and I got assigned to that and I was young and not too far out of grad school in a consulting like, Oh, what a fun project.

294
00:40:28,031 --> 00:40:33,610
And then I'm like, I'm in a multibillion dollar system and there's not a single sleeper in the system who is willing to take this job.

295
00:40:33,611 --> 00:40:37,301
I wonder why. Well, so we talked about could we turn it around?

296
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:43,391
We talked about could we sell it? There was these physician practice management companies at the time, a few publicly traded ones.

297
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:49,451
And then we ended up doing what was called the orderly wind down, which was interesting.

298
00:40:50,801 --> 00:40:54,731
But we were able to get out of 70, $80 million loss in like six months.

299
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:59,171
So it was kind of I mean, Burt would probably say this to you, all the stuff.

300
00:40:59,171 --> 00:41:05,381
It was like actually an opportunity of a lifetime in a really twisted way because it was super hard and like,

301
00:41:05,891 --> 00:41:11,680
you know, dealing with these medical groups, bankruptcy attorneys, publicly traded companies, valuation firms.

302
00:41:11,681 --> 00:41:18,401
So I learned a ton in a very short amount of time. And then they said, you know, you seem like you're pretty good and good financially.

303
00:41:18,401 --> 00:41:27,281
Do you want to be the CFO of the teaching hospital? And so I'm, you know, now three years out of MBA, I say I'm not a CPA.

304
00:41:27,701 --> 00:41:30,911
And and they're like, you'll be fine. And I'm like, okay.

305
00:41:31,301 --> 00:41:42,250
So that was great. So I really learned I really learned budgeting and finance and how people try to game their budgets.

306
00:41:42,251 --> 00:41:47,830
Fascinating, you know? And so that was great revenue cycle, all that stuff.

307
00:41:47,831 --> 00:41:56,891
And then I moved into operations and then I became a head of parts of the operations of that at the OH at the AMC.

308
00:41:57,341 --> 00:42:00,250
And then they said, Oh, you're pretty good at that.

309
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:06,581
Do you want to be responsible administratively for the academic ambulatory practices with UT Houston?

310
00:42:06,971 --> 00:42:10,000
It was kind of a joint thing. The faculty were under the medical school.

311
00:42:10,001 --> 00:42:15,731
It's kind of typical and um, in the health system administration was running that.

312
00:42:15,731 --> 00:42:20,141
So that was, that was great super interesting learned a lot there.

313
00:42:20,801 --> 00:42:27,251
Um, Nicole had now is VP of marketing and Government Affairs at Houston Methodist.

314
00:42:28,061 --> 00:42:32,530
So she was doing really interesting work. Um, and then a few years later,

315
00:42:32,531 --> 00:42:40,901
I got recruited to be the CIO at Stony Brook State University in New York in Long Island and went there, which was exciting.

316
00:42:40,901 --> 00:42:46,390
I'll go faster now. But, um, and Nicole went to be kind of with the nonprofit world.

317
00:42:46,391 --> 00:42:50,801
She, she became the executive director for the Season Coming Breast Cancer Foundation for New York City.

318
00:42:51,311 --> 00:42:53,861
Uh, which was really interesting work as well.

319
00:42:54,461 --> 00:42:59,891
And then a few years after Stony Brook, I got recruited to be the quit UCLA's Health System back in Los Angeles when I grew up.

320
00:43:00,521 --> 00:43:05,291
And then a few years later, I got recruited to be the CEO at Stanford University's Health System,

321
00:43:06,491 --> 00:43:15,041
which was amazing and can talk more about these things. And then I had met the CEO of UnitedHealth Group and we had gotten to know each other.

322
00:43:15,041 --> 00:43:18,700
And he said, You know, why don't you come work for me? And I said, Why would I work for you? You're the bad guys.

323
00:43:18,701 --> 00:43:24,551
I'm on the good guy side. And he laughed. He said, No, we have this division called Optum and we're buying medical groups and doing technology.

324
00:43:24,561 --> 00:43:27,820
So I went over to be executive vice president and executive president.

325
00:43:27,821 --> 00:43:31,361
They're responsible for what they call now Optum health.

326
00:43:31,361 --> 00:43:35,291
So their care delivery and a lot of their care management stuff, which was interesting.

327
00:43:35,741 --> 00:43:37,421
And then during my time at Stanford,

328
00:43:37,421 --> 00:43:42,820
we had started a little venture arm and investing in a lot of innovative companies, one of which was this company,

329
00:43:42,821 --> 00:43:44,371
one medical, uh,

330
00:43:44,591 --> 00:43:51,641
which is a modernized primary care group with the kind of membership subscription model built for purpose technology and our own salary providers.

331
00:43:51,641 --> 00:43:56,561
We've really shown that we can deliver very high service net promoter scores and take our cost of care.

332
00:43:56,801 --> 00:44:00,641
Had a paper in JAMA last year showing for one employer. We took out 45% of their costs.

333
00:44:01,691 --> 00:44:03,971
That's more recent, but love the concept.

334
00:44:04,061 --> 00:44:10,300
Wanted to get into something where I can kind of move the levers a little bit more than the fifth biggest company in the US,

335
00:44:10,301 --> 00:44:15,511
which was very interesting and exciting to talk about that. So I came to be CEO at one medical.

336
00:44:15,521 --> 00:44:19,840
I've been there for five years. It's been amazing. We went from eight markets.

337
00:44:19,841 --> 00:44:24,731
We'll hit 30 this year. We went from like 400 people will have about 4000 this year.

338
00:44:25,361 --> 00:44:33,340
We went from being a private company to raising money from venture to taking it public to recently have announced where we're selling to Amazon.

339
00:44:33,341 --> 00:44:38,771
So that'll be interesting. So that's kind of the overview.

340
00:44:39,881 --> 00:44:47,141
It was longer than I wanted to do, but I know you all are often thinking about careers and career progression and stuff.

341
00:44:48,251 --> 00:44:57,881
My $0.02. I didn't plan any of that. I had no idea the reason why I got into academic medical centers and had a pretty good

342
00:44:57,881 --> 00:45:03,341
run there was because Nicole's job took us to Houston and I ended up connecting.

343
00:45:04,421 --> 00:45:09,071
With somebody there. And I, I was working in business development and they're like, well, why don't you go to the AMC?

344
00:45:10,751 --> 00:45:17,501
And I'd say, if there's any themes in my career, it's probably work on stuff that you find interesting,

345
00:45:17,831 --> 00:45:22,271
where it's important to you, but also to the organization.

346
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:28,181
In retrospect, some areas where I got exposure, so people knew me in the organization,

347
00:45:28,181 --> 00:45:33,041
so they would take somebody and say, No, that's fine, you can do this. I would have never gotten that job if I had applied for it.

348
00:45:33,041 --> 00:45:36,250
I was, you know, reasonably unqualified for it.

349
00:45:36,251 --> 00:45:43,541
But since they knew me, you'd be fine. And then it just worked out for both Nicole and for me that we were open to moving.

350
00:45:44,431 --> 00:45:49,201
So we moved a lot, which, you know, pros and cons, that's not for everyone,

351
00:45:49,201 --> 00:45:53,971
but we were both open to it and we managed both of our careers through the years.

352
00:45:53,971 --> 00:45:57,811
Later on, we had kids, you know, we moved them, gets a little harder as they get older.

353
00:45:58,171 --> 00:46:04,141
When I took the job at Optum United, we were living in Palo Alto and did not move the family.

354
00:46:04,471 --> 00:46:12,271
So that meant I was basically 100% on the road. But but, you know, these are some of the things that that one might trade off.

355
00:46:12,631 --> 00:46:19,180
All right. With that background. Let's open it up for Q&A on anything we can talk about.

356
00:46:19,181 --> 00:46:23,021
Anything you like. Just reintroduce yourself. Just name. Don't need the appliance.

357
00:46:23,021 --> 00:46:28,151
Get the appliances. Just name again. And you can ask anything you like.

358
00:46:28,371 --> 00:46:33,441
Please. Can you talk about. 80 million.

359
00:46:35,461 --> 00:46:39,431
How were you able to do like that at the time?

360
00:46:40,261 --> 00:46:44,551
Yeah. Well, so part of why it was a major loss was.

361
00:46:45,501 --> 00:46:51,401
The concept was good. Take a primary care group, which is concept was pretty similar to what we're doing today.

362
00:46:51,441 --> 00:46:55,311
What medical and take risk on a population 100% risk.

363
00:46:56,981 --> 00:47:02,590
The challenge is there's a lot of things that could go wrong if we do a lot of risk and they did all of them wrong.

364
00:47:02,591 --> 00:47:05,830
And also, it was an early era of this. Their rates were bad.

365
00:47:05,831 --> 00:47:12,070
Their contracts were bad. They had MD Anderson in as their cancer network.

366
00:47:12,071 --> 00:47:15,101
They got, you know, all the things you're learning. They got 100% adverse selection.

367
00:47:15,161 --> 00:47:19,541
Every cancer patient in Houston signed up for this to get globally capitated, great cancer care.

368
00:47:19,901 --> 00:47:27,040
And their premiums were like like this. And then all their physicians were mostly not mostly, but 50% new grads.

369
00:47:27,041 --> 00:47:30,731
They had no panels, no patients. They built all new clinics high overhead.

370
00:47:31,091 --> 00:47:36,401
So like, in retrospect, you're like, how was that going to work?

371
00:47:38,351 --> 00:47:46,451
And by the way, everybody was doing this at this era. This was kind of the first era of physician integration and growth and not wrong strategies.

372
00:47:46,751 --> 00:47:54,281
It's just execution is tough. So how we got out of it is we basically had to get out of all those contractual relationships.

373
00:47:54,701 --> 00:48:02,530
And so I learned a lot like. Leases going to landlords like, you know, and you're saying, there I go, you're on a hook for five years.

374
00:48:02,531 --> 00:48:07,211
I'm like, you know which system I work for, you know? And you see how many buildings we have we ever want to lease from us again.

375
00:48:07,211 --> 00:48:14,141
I mean, said it's slightly nicer but and like it was a little of me I just be like like Burt's like, you know, I, I got these ten.

376
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:20,861
You call these ten? I'm like. Hello? I'm calling from, you know, we can't pay the rent, you know.

377
00:48:21,461 --> 00:48:24,611
Right. You know, it was it was pretty interesting. You're just kind of thrown out there.

378
00:48:25,391 --> 00:48:30,520
And then, you know, the physician contracts with a little more complicated.

379
00:48:30,521 --> 00:48:34,151
But we were transparent, like, here's where it is, this thing isn't working.

380
00:48:34,151 --> 00:48:37,151
So let's figure out how we do this orderly way. Let's do severance.

381
00:48:37,571 --> 00:48:39,941
I mean, most of these groups, they were great positions.

382
00:48:40,361 --> 00:48:46,330
They got bought and sold like nine other times and they were making money left and right, so it just wasn't going to work.

383
00:48:46,331 --> 00:48:53,681
So a lot of transparency describing what the current state was. Um, and then, you know, in health care you have all these funny regulatory rules.

384
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:58,381
So even as you're shutting something down, you can't be seen as, um,

385
00:48:59,741 --> 00:49:03,041
paying for referrals or having kickback or let's say this person's going to private practice.

386
00:49:03,041 --> 00:49:10,331
And then we had to do a bunch of valuations on the settlement agreements. Of course, everybody wanted more and we're trying to pay a certain amount.

387
00:49:10,641 --> 00:49:14,200
It's kind of close the transaction, but then working with external valuation firms.

388
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:22,420
So that was interesting. That was my exposure to doing valuations and and learning about the room in these valuation analysis.

389
00:49:22,421 --> 00:49:26,891
I'm like, you need to get this number somewhere, needs to be to the valuation consultant.

390
00:49:26,891 --> 00:49:31,690
So that that was interesting. So later on in life they're like, Yeah, we valued it this way.

391
00:49:31,691 --> 00:49:36,191
And I'm like, I call B.S., you know, which methodology is, well, you know, you could use a discounted cash flow,

392
00:49:36,191 --> 00:49:40,451
the comparison valuation, you know, and you start learning and you get exposure to these things.

393
00:49:40,451 --> 00:49:43,840
And so that that was kind of how we got out of it.

394
00:49:43,841 --> 00:49:50,141
Um, transparency, directness, um, and sense of urgency.

395
00:49:50,381 --> 00:49:56,770
But also for most of the team and the staff, we were able to place them in our system because we were a big enough system.

396
00:49:56,771 --> 00:50:00,821
So it was. But those things are hard too, because you can't always.

397
00:50:01,211 --> 00:50:05,081
But there is enough demand, enough growth that that made that part easier.

398
00:50:05,211 --> 00:50:10,931
Yeah. Thanks for the question. Yes, please. So I have a two part question.

399
00:50:11,381 --> 00:50:15,190
First is what medical model for Amazon?

400
00:50:15,191 --> 00:50:21,931
What? What are the thoughts behind the. The part to question is thinking about Seattle.

401
00:50:25,921 --> 00:50:29,821
In Seattle. But what's important is one.

402
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:37,491
Yeah. Great questions. So just a little bit. What is when medical.

403
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:41,611
So we're a primary care group but we decided to do a few things differently.

404
00:50:41,881 --> 00:50:45,361
We wanted to have a really great, great, great customer experience.

405
00:50:45,721 --> 00:50:52,830
And then we wanted to be able to take our cost of care triple aim, quadruple aim and better health outcomes and better team environment.

406
00:50:52,831 --> 00:50:55,021
And we decided to do that in a few different ways.

407
00:50:55,531 --> 00:51:01,501
One, even though the world largely reimburses on a fee for service basis, all our providers are straight salary.

408
00:51:03,211 --> 00:51:09,811
We have no metrics. We have tons of metrics. Let me state that we have no compensation related metrics for the providers of productivity incentives,

409
00:51:09,811 --> 00:51:18,841
no quality incentives, no service incentives, none. But we're at the 90 plus percentile on the scores where 90 plus net promoter scores,

410
00:51:19,291 --> 00:51:22,891
because that's what you should do, like you're not going to do the breast cancer screening.

411
00:51:23,941 --> 00:51:29,481
So it's often at least in a lot of primary care areas, it's not a matter of people don't want to do it.

412
00:51:29,491 --> 00:51:33,901
It's how do you design a system to make it work? And then, by the way, we fire people.

413
00:51:34,141 --> 00:51:37,971
Like, if you don't want to do it, it's all good. This is not the right fit for you.

414
00:51:37,981 --> 00:51:42,420
And we say it more nicely if you but if of course, if you want to do this, if you want to deliver great experience,

415
00:51:42,421 --> 00:51:46,981
great quality care, then great like it should be like, yeah, you kind of did it decently.

416
00:51:46,981 --> 00:51:50,221
Like what? Let's do it. And of course we all have areas to develop.

417
00:51:50,551 --> 00:51:57,260
So salary model. We decided to create a membership or subscription model.

418
00:51:57,261 --> 00:52:04,160
We charge $16 a month for that. You have unlimited on demand, video chat, no co-pay, no deductible, no claim.

419
00:52:04,161 --> 00:52:08,811
You can do asynchronously so cheaper than Medicaid.

420
00:52:08,901 --> 00:52:16,101
If you're uninsured or anybody, you can sign up and you can get unlimited on demand, video chats, asynchronous care.

421
00:52:16,251 --> 00:52:22,281
And then we accept insurance. We're in network. Um. Acquiring customers.

422
00:52:22,701 --> 00:52:27,381
For people to know about you. Um. Is isn't the easiest.

423
00:52:27,621 --> 00:52:31,911
Particularly when your startup costs a lot of money. So we started going direct to consumer.

424
00:52:32,571 --> 00:52:40,211
So hey, consumers, find out about us. And we launched in San Francisco and kind of in the earlier days like, ooh,

425
00:52:40,251 --> 00:52:43,461
who would go on to this and book an appointment right now that's a little more ubiquitous.

426
00:52:44,811 --> 00:52:52,670
And then we started going direct to employer started going to companies that we serve, Google and Morgan Stanley and Pricewaterhouse.

427
00:52:52,671 --> 00:52:56,711
We're just mentioning the e y and Adobe and but like 8500 companies now,

428
00:52:56,721 --> 00:52:59,571
we said, why don't you offer this to your employees and why should we offer it?

429
00:53:00,141 --> 00:53:06,351
Well, I could help recruit, retain, keep engaged and productive your employees and take out customer care.

430
00:53:06,771 --> 00:53:10,971
And people love it. Um, and so that helped us grow.

431
00:53:11,451 --> 00:53:14,931
Um, and then to manage all this, we built our own software.

432
00:53:15,561 --> 00:53:20,391
And again, when we started this, what, you're not gonna use Epic or Cerner? Now we're going to build our own software.

433
00:53:20,871 --> 00:53:23,961
And not because those aren't great systems. They are, but they're complicated.

434
00:53:23,961 --> 00:53:28,821
And we decided to build the software around our staffing model and around our workflow.

435
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:35,271
So salaried model providers, we have our own we call our virtual medical team that are all straight salary.

436
00:53:35,271 --> 00:53:38,990
They all work for us. They're all in the same connected system. They do a couple of things.

437
00:53:38,991 --> 00:53:43,851
They'll do those on demand, virtual visits, but they also take work off our in-office providers.

438
00:53:43,851 --> 00:53:48,921
So we have a software layer, machine learning layer that read every message, for example, that you send to your provider.

439
00:53:49,161 --> 00:53:51,801
And depending on the content of that, we route that to different people.

440
00:53:52,101 --> 00:53:56,661
Hey, I need this routine prescription filled pulls out of the physician's inbox, moves to the virtual team.

441
00:53:57,231 --> 00:54:01,041
I need help book an appointment, pulls out of that, goes to one of our member support specialists.

442
00:54:01,581 --> 00:54:06,051
By that, we've been able to demonstrate about 50% half the tasks that a physician would see in Epic.

443
00:54:06,651 --> 00:54:11,841
Not because that's not a good system, but we've built a staffing model, a workflow model,

444
00:54:12,561 --> 00:54:17,151
and a compensation model that's not around our views, that's not around quick visits, refer them out.

445
00:54:18,471 --> 00:54:26,501
And so that's what we've done. Ironically, commercial insurance and primary care does not pay well.

446
00:54:27,701 --> 00:54:33,250
You don't make a lot of money if you're running long primary care appointments with free virtual care in nicer locations.

447
00:54:33,251 --> 00:54:39,071
With no ancillaries, there's not a lot of revenue. So the membership fee supplements that a little bit.

448
00:54:39,101 --> 00:54:43,121
Call it a care coordination or kind of virtual care capitation fee.

449
00:54:43,511 --> 00:54:48,901
And then we've done clinically integrated relationships with health systems where we'll sit on their contracts.

450
00:54:48,911 --> 00:54:57,521
So we've created partnerships with health systems across the US and then we've done full two way I.T. integration with Epic and Cerner.

451
00:54:57,971 --> 00:55:01,151
And so now what we can do is this. I'll come back to your questions.

452
00:55:01,151 --> 00:55:05,591
But now what we can do is we could really help. On the complexity of navigating health care.

453
00:55:05,771 --> 00:55:09,100
You have a question, you just push the button, respond in minutes.

454
00:55:09,101 --> 00:55:12,160
You can go to the E.R. here. But what? Respond in 2 to 3 minutes.

455
00:55:12,161 --> 00:55:18,581
No co-pay, no deductible, no claim. We could get you into appointment. Same or next day in a lovely office with very high service.

456
00:55:19,601 --> 00:55:23,951
You need an appointment with the specialists. We send the records over, we get the referral, we get the authorization.

457
00:55:24,431 --> 00:55:28,451
The information comes back into your system. You went to LabCorp Quest, CVS, Walgreens.

458
00:55:28,451 --> 00:55:32,711
We have full interfaces built into that. All comes back here. You have no idea what any of that means.

459
00:55:32,711 --> 00:55:36,551
You push a button, you can you can chat with a person or asynchronously do that.

460
00:55:37,031 --> 00:55:40,421
And so that's how it is that's shown us. We can have very high service.

461
00:55:40,841 --> 00:55:45,281
We could help improve health outcomes. Why? Because we have a membership model.

462
00:55:45,281 --> 00:55:49,631
So we have a population health model. And like at Stanford, we have amazing people.

463
00:55:49,931 --> 00:55:52,931
We didn't know who the patient was till they walked in our door here.

464
00:55:52,931 --> 00:55:59,771
Even though we're for those populations, most of whom are not capitated or in an enrolled model, we know who they are because they're signed up.

465
00:56:00,341 --> 00:56:03,821
So, hey, is it time for your mammogram? It's time for pap smear. Have you checked your blood sugar?

466
00:56:04,061 --> 00:56:08,141
So we do a lot of outbound digital population health. We don't have to have a contact center somewhere.

467
00:56:08,321 --> 00:56:12,341
It's all algorithmically driven. If you have a question, you could talk to somebody live.

468
00:56:12,461 --> 00:56:17,231
But a lot of that work is taken off the in-office provider because everybody's like, Oh, the PCP has to do all this.

469
00:56:17,231 --> 00:56:24,041
The PCP can't do all of it. You want the PCP to intervene by exception where a human is needed and you want the system to do the rest.

470
00:56:24,581 --> 00:56:33,431
So that's what we've done. We've probably invested well invested.

471
00:56:33,641 --> 00:56:38,231
We took other people's money to the tune of several billion dollars to date to do this.

472
00:56:38,921 --> 00:56:43,361
It's not easy to do. Like I said, we've grown now to 27.

473
00:56:43,541 --> 00:56:47,621
Markets will be in 30. I've been in a few of them in the last week or two.

474
00:56:48,491 --> 00:56:53,171
I was in New York yesterday, Boston the day before. Columbus, Ohio, Ohio.

475
00:56:53,171 --> 00:56:56,951
States our part in Boston, Mass. General bigger than our partner, Mt. Sinai as a partner in New York.

476
00:56:57,341 --> 00:57:01,811
I was in Durham not long ago. Duke's our partner. We have Emory in Atlanta.

477
00:57:01,841 --> 00:57:06,941
We have a bunch. Houston Methodist reform is our part in Baylor, Scott and White.

478
00:57:06,981 --> 00:57:11,110
Dallas is our partner. Ascension your seat in health care in Austin, a bunch of other places.

479
00:57:11,111 --> 00:57:17,911
Advocate Aurora. And we're about to launch in Milwaukee and in Chicago, UCSF, UC San Diego, dignity by others.

480
00:57:17,921 --> 00:57:22,211
But so then we started saying, okay,

481
00:57:22,241 --> 00:57:29,501
that works pretty well in a commercial population as you get into over 65 and a little bit to your question and to the dual eligibles,

482
00:57:30,341 --> 00:57:35,021
you need to do a lot more coordination outside of appointments because a lot of the problems are,

483
00:57:35,801 --> 00:57:39,941
hey, you're on nine medications, you're 89 years old, you're blind, you don't have adult children.

484
00:57:41,051 --> 00:57:44,500
What's the model there? So there we've taken global capitation.

485
00:57:44,501 --> 00:57:48,941
We take complete, full risk. Kind of like what? We lost our shirt on at Memorial Hermann.

486
00:57:49,541 --> 00:57:53,530
We've got a little smarter that again, we've built built for purpose technology around this.

487
00:57:53,531 --> 00:57:58,811
It's our software, it's our salary providers. Um, it's to be a little bit thoughtful.

488
00:57:59,081 --> 00:58:05,891
There's a lot of things when you take global risk from contracting to documentation to kind of the broader population,

489
00:58:05,891 --> 00:58:09,190
health and social determinants of health. And we do really well.

490
00:58:09,191 --> 00:58:15,250
We do the unhoused in those populations, but they have to be enrolled in part of the challenges getting people enrolled.

491
00:58:15,251 --> 00:58:19,781
Ironically, the duals, which are also called D snips, dual special need plans.

492
00:58:20,211 --> 00:58:24,250
They're actually a lot of the groups do the best on those populations.

493
00:58:24,251 --> 00:58:27,821
Why, if you document them, well, your revenue is quite high.

494
00:58:28,181 --> 00:58:33,051
And like if you are on a higher revenue base, if you can save five or 10%, it's just more raw dollars.

495
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:44,051
Adherence. Compliance is very challenging. There's much bigger problems on the on the unhoused than just health issues.

496
00:58:44,291 --> 00:58:45,850
I don't claim to be an expert on it,

497
00:58:45,851 --> 00:58:53,830
but living in the Bay Area and we have clinics in Seattle and Portland and we have partnerships with health systems up there as well.

498
00:58:53,831 --> 00:58:58,051
And I was just there. Two or three weeks ago. It's really troubling.

499
00:58:58,351 --> 00:59:01,561
But but our care model works actually quite well there.

500
00:59:01,561 --> 00:59:11,011
And interestingly, the economics work well. The thing in probably any organization is there's not a single answer in health care.

501
00:59:11,491 --> 00:59:17,641
Right. And people say, oh, commercial insurance, commercial insurance, raw primary care is there's no capitation.

502
00:59:18,181 --> 00:59:20,651
And. Fee for service reimbursement.

503
00:59:20,651 --> 00:59:27,611
When you have 30 minute appointments and salaried providers and free on demand virtual care, it's like that's not at all obvious.

504
00:59:28,301 --> 00:59:30,701
So we had to convince employers like, No, this is worth it.

505
00:59:30,731 --> 00:59:34,931
Here's how it's going to save you and save you money downstream to get people engaged, you should pay us this membership fee.

506
00:59:35,771 --> 00:59:40,431
Different model for Medicare. Medicaid. Duals. Straight Medicaid.

507
00:59:40,451 --> 00:59:47,861
Different every state. Different rules. And then you have to build workflows around these things if you want to do something scalable.

508
00:59:48,101 --> 00:59:51,701
Like we're delivering 90 net promoter score in 30 different markets, 27 markets.

509
00:59:52,181 --> 00:59:55,481
So how do you build common technology, common workflows?

510
00:59:55,481 --> 01:00:03,181
How can you train people in a standardized way? And that gets challenging when so many programs are idiosyncratic and have different goals.

511
01:00:03,191 --> 01:00:07,121
So sorry for the long answer, but good question. Yeah, please.

512
01:00:07,331 --> 01:00:13,211
So you said in fact. Yes. And I'm wondering.

513
01:00:13,861 --> 01:00:18,571
What, when and why would Amazon investments?

514
01:00:21,091 --> 01:00:25,231
One of my shareholders might be a great question.

515
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:32,911
Well, so a few things. And this is I'll give you secrets to being a CEO.

516
01:00:34,581 --> 01:00:37,611
You don't have to do it like this. But first of all, I refute the premise.

517
01:00:37,621 --> 01:00:42,861
What do you mean? We're not making money? We're not making money, by the way. But it depends how you define not making money.

518
01:00:43,401 --> 01:00:52,221
So at the time of IPO, we said we would be adjusted EBITA positive within three years, which we achieved.

519
01:00:52,281 --> 01:01:00,231
So on a limited basis, we are positive. And we said we would in the long, long run have a 45% care margin.

520
01:01:00,231 --> 01:01:05,121
It's a non-GAAP nine general accepted accounting principles metric, but it's like your gross margin.

521
01:01:05,511 --> 01:01:09,531
And we had 42%. And we said, Should we stop?

522
01:01:10,401 --> 01:01:14,691
Should we stop at eight markets? Positive, positive cash flow.

523
01:01:14,721 --> 01:01:19,100
Should we stop? I mean, that was a question. And so investors said, no, that's good.

524
01:01:19,101 --> 01:01:24,771
We believe you. Fine. We're going to throw. So we're pumping another billion dollars to go to 30.

525
01:01:24,791 --> 01:01:27,391
So that's really the cash flow difference. It's the investment in growth.

526
01:01:27,751 --> 01:01:31,951
The other thing we did is we said we're going to get into global capitation and

527
01:01:33,031 --> 01:01:36,781
getting a global cap sucks up a lot of cash flow for a number of different reasons.

528
01:01:38,331 --> 01:01:46,311
The first thing is in Medicare Advantage plans, when you take risk and you're usually getting a percentage of the premium,

529
01:01:46,311 --> 01:01:53,180
the health plan gets the money from CMS, from the government and they're often sub capitated plus or minus.

530
01:01:53,181 --> 01:02:00,381
85% of the premium comes to the primary care group can negotiate more or less the premium that the health plan gets.

531
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:05,581
Goes up and down based on two measures, really two sets of measures.

532
01:02:05,851 --> 01:02:11,371
One are quality scores, sometimes called stars rating. And they don't go up based on your quality scores.

533
01:02:11,581 --> 01:02:14,831
They go up in the quality scores of everybody in that geography.

534
01:02:14,851 --> 01:02:17,371
Under that health plan, tax ID.

535
01:02:18,801 --> 01:02:30,500
So let's say the Medicare premium is that the health plan is getting from the government is $8,000 based on the star score overall.

536
01:02:30,501 --> 01:02:37,701
And Medicare just published these out and they just put a lot more in service in CAP ratings, and some of them went way down and some went up.

537
01:02:38,061 --> 01:02:43,581
They love us for that. We're very good at that and we're very good on quality scores, so that drives it.

538
01:02:43,881 --> 01:02:49,941
The other thing that drives the capitation is the risk of the patient.

539
01:02:50,481 --> 01:02:54,321
The acuity of the patient. How in this is a muddy area.

540
01:02:54,771 --> 01:03:00,751
There's a lot of debate on this, but the acuity of the patient, by and large, is defined as the co-morbidities.

541
01:03:01,301 --> 01:03:10,721
It's something called hierarchical condition categories, which rolls up into something called a rap score or risk adjustment factor, if any.

542
01:03:10,821 --> 01:03:17,571
On the inpatient side, you'll talk about a case mix index. If you've heard CMI Araf is like an outpatient case mix index, basically.

543
01:03:17,901 --> 01:03:23,631
Well, your RAF, your risk adjustment factor is based on the codes documented last year.

544
01:03:24,541 --> 01:03:32,221
So if you have a brand new patient, you didn't have them. The primary care or whomever managed them before if they didn't document these codes,

545
01:03:32,251 --> 01:03:35,431
which, by the way, do not add to your fee for service reimbursement.

546
01:03:35,671 --> 01:03:38,221
So unless you're Medicare Advantage, you would never document all this stuff.

547
01:03:40,181 --> 01:03:50,411
So what happens then is in year one, your revenue because maybe the stars aren't high and the risk adjustment factor on high might be.

548
01:03:52,221 --> 01:03:57,201
Ten, 20, 30% lower than it might be in year two or three.

549
01:03:58,471 --> 01:04:04,320
And so your actual premium you might get and this holds for anybody doing Medicare Advantage in year

550
01:04:04,321 --> 01:04:09,031
one you're and you're at risk for everything you do in primary care but you have to pay the hospital,

551
01:04:09,031 --> 01:04:12,211
the specialist, the nursing home all comes out of that.

552
01:04:12,211 --> 01:04:19,771
And you could carve things out. You could do reinsurance. So, you know, in year one, it's not uncommon to pay out 110% of claims,

553
01:04:20,491 --> 01:04:24,261
meaning like you have to take cash out of your pocket to have these populations.

554
01:04:24,631 --> 01:04:28,111
Now, as you start getting more sophisticated about this, you start negotiating with the health plan.

555
01:04:28,321 --> 01:04:33,881
Well. Why do I need to do that? And this is depends on if you know how to do this.

556
01:04:34,861 --> 01:04:39,601
And how good you're negotiating and what's your leverage. You may put more cash out of pocket than others.

557
01:04:40,741 --> 01:04:44,461
So but if you're going to grow and you say we're going to grow this thing,

558
01:04:44,941 --> 01:04:48,481
which we said you're doing, you're necessarily going to bleed cash and it's like, no.

559
01:04:49,021 --> 01:04:53,581
So we could not grow it be smaller revenue. So we went from half a billion in revenue.

560
01:04:53,791 --> 01:04:58,771
Last year will be a billion this year. I mean, big growth, a lot of that is in global capitation.

561
01:04:59,071 --> 01:05:03,871
A lot of that's sucking up cash. So then there's other reasons.

562
01:05:03,871 --> 01:05:10,371
Like we could be running the place better, we could be more efficient, we could be better at stuff, we could be growing faster.

563
01:05:10,381 --> 01:05:16,051
So there. But that's why it's it isn't as straightforward of a question.

564
01:05:16,291 --> 01:05:22,441
It's like, if you want me not to grow, I make money. Um, but don't you see I have a model that works here and a business model.

565
01:05:22,771 --> 01:05:27,061
And then what we show our investors is we show on the senior side cohort to performance.

566
01:05:27,331 --> 01:05:31,651
Here's the cohort from 2017, for example. We have very high retention.

567
01:05:32,691 --> 01:05:40,701
80 to 90% retention. Five years later, we started at 110% medical claims expense ratio of the premium we got, we paid out 110%.

568
01:05:41,331 --> 01:05:45,921
With COVID, COVID, hospitalizations, all that stuff, we're at 70% now.

569
01:05:46,131 --> 01:05:53,031
If 30%. And when you go to 2018, 2019, 20, 2021, you see the same year over year cohort progression.

570
01:05:53,571 --> 01:06:03,231
And then in addition to kind of documentation, we show quality improvement scores going up as well.

571
01:06:03,231 --> 01:06:11,960
And we have very high net promoter scores. Yes. So we talk about this a little bit earlier on the policymaker or the policy analyst.

572
01:06:11,961 --> 01:06:16,461
Right. And I say this. Medicaid advantage for Medicare Advantage.

573
01:06:16,461 --> 01:06:23,991
Right. Going in and. And next year they've got all these documented.

574
01:06:25,131 --> 01:06:29,961
Right. People are thinking about this. We talked about this a little bit.

575
01:06:29,971 --> 01:06:34,851
Right. Is this that looks like up coding that patients wasn't.

576
01:06:35,471 --> 01:06:38,621
You know, I hadn't documented those previously.

577
01:06:38,861 --> 01:06:42,941
But then you said something about if they came from a non Medicare Advantage plant,

578
01:06:42,951 --> 01:06:49,791
like what is how why is that not from the analyst's perspective, same patient.

579
01:06:50,111 --> 01:06:55,570
Now it looks like they've got a whole bunch more documented conditions or whatever it is.

580
01:06:55,571 --> 01:07:01,391
What happened? Yeah. So it's, it's not the greatest system and I think there are some who take advantage of it.

581
01:07:02,181 --> 01:07:05,241
I don't think we are one of those at all. We do not.

582
01:07:05,721 --> 01:07:09,891
And there is some some who are quite aggressive, for example, and we don't do this.

583
01:07:10,281 --> 01:07:15,801
You can do all kinds of ultrasounds and find some more conditions. I don't think that's right.

584
01:07:15,981 --> 01:07:19,561
Is it technically wrong? You're not charging them for the ultrasound.

585
01:07:19,611 --> 01:07:24,261
You're globally capitated. Oh, you seem to have an obstruction at the bottom of your esophagus.

586
01:07:24,681 --> 01:07:27,891
Okay, you can do that. We don't do that.

587
01:07:28,551 --> 01:07:36,051
But one could do things like that. So I would say there's nothing perfect or magical about these systems.

588
01:07:36,051 --> 01:07:40,641
No different than DRG or or, you know, we're in a coding based system.

589
01:07:41,001 --> 01:07:47,121
I will say the positive of it is a lot of these entrepreneurial companies are all chasing dual eligibles and the unhoused.

590
01:07:47,541 --> 01:07:52,071
Huh. Isn't that interesting? And like health equity, we have extremely diverse patient population.

591
01:07:52,731 --> 01:07:57,581
So it's kind of interesting. Well, if you paid people money, they would do it.

592
01:07:57,651 --> 01:08:02,471
If you don't pay them money, it's probably not going to happen. Now, you don't want to overpay people.

593
01:08:02,481 --> 01:08:05,541
You don't want to disadvantage people. I think beyond the.

594
01:08:08,781 --> 01:08:12,860
INS and outs of risk adjustment factor. I think kind of a broader question,

595
01:08:12,861 --> 01:08:20,111
an interesting policy question is kind of the Medicare Advantage rates used to take the Medicare fee for service rates.

596
01:08:20,121 --> 01:08:29,871
They used to call it the average area per capita cost in PCC and basically say great will pay 95% of that plus or minus to the health plans.

597
01:08:30,171 --> 01:08:35,811
Well, now, with basically 50% of seniors in May, what's the right benchmark?

598
01:08:36,351 --> 01:08:42,531
And then. Yes, how do you how do you translate that? And so what what Medicare has done and done in these various demonstration

599
01:08:42,531 --> 01:08:46,821
programs is they put caps on caps on how much risk adjustment factor can go.

600
01:08:47,001 --> 01:08:50,121
And I think this is a fascinating area for research. Great. What's a better model?

601
01:08:50,451 --> 01:08:54,471
Like what's a better system? How should we do it? How would you how would you risk adjust?

602
01:08:55,581 --> 01:08:56,841
How would you not do it based?

603
01:08:56,841 --> 01:09:04,881
And so some people are like goes back to old school, just do it on age, sex and some other kind of socioeconomic demographics.

604
01:09:04,881 --> 01:09:09,181
And that is what it is. And. I wouldn't be against that either.

605
01:09:09,571 --> 01:09:13,601
I like to say we can live with any policy decision, but just keep it.

606
01:09:14,731 --> 01:09:16,111
And part of the challenge is.

607
01:09:17,461 --> 01:09:23,761
Each administration like everybody changes the thing and you're trying to make multi years because again we're building up,

608
01:09:23,791 --> 01:09:27,931
it's going to take us 5 to 10 years. We're investing in this and like, Oh, crud, they just change the rules.

609
01:09:28,261 --> 01:09:31,891
So it's not perfect. Um, but it's why.

610
01:09:31,891 --> 01:09:34,891
Emma, there exists a model and for Medicaid there it is not.

611
01:09:35,401 --> 01:09:42,961
What Medicaid does to the extreme of the opposite is they don't base the reimbursement on the average area cost.

612
01:09:43,231 --> 01:09:47,130
They base it on how you perform last year. So let's say you take out 30% of the cost.

613
01:09:47,131 --> 01:09:56,551
Congratulations, your reimbursements, 30% less next year. And that's why dual eligibles work because it's basically sitting on the Medicare system.

614
01:09:57,031 --> 01:10:02,401
And so and again, these are multiyear, these are complex patients.

615
01:10:02,401 --> 01:10:06,210
And we, for example, on our capitation, we have a whole team that goes to the home.

616
01:10:06,211 --> 01:10:10,651
We pay for transportation for that 98 year old. You can't see we're going into her home.

617
01:10:10,651 --> 01:10:15,480
We're giving her an iPad. None of it's reimbursable, but because we have the capitation, we can do that.

618
01:10:15,481 --> 01:10:24,450
So I think these are exciting areas for policymakers, for researchers and for innovators and organizations.

619
01:10:24,451 --> 01:10:27,451
I think the rules will evolve. They're not perfect.

620
01:10:28,441 --> 01:10:39,301
I also think, though, however. One is trying to stimulate people to start trying some stuff and giving incentives.

621
01:10:39,721 --> 01:10:45,120
I mean, I don't know why we're spending so much money as a country.

622
01:10:45,121 --> 01:10:48,751
Trillions on stuff. I'm like, okay, so you overpaid 50 billion. Like, who cares?

623
01:10:49,121 --> 01:10:54,571
Like, and again, that's easy for me to say, but I'm like, in the scheme of what we're spending like.

624
01:10:55,321 --> 01:11:00,441
And then once you figure out how it works, like, is the government getting ratchet down 100% right there?

625
01:11:01,681 --> 01:11:04,891
They control the decision making. But yeah, great question.

626
01:11:06,371 --> 01:11:09,461
Yes. So I can feel.

627
01:11:14,471 --> 01:11:23,131
They? How do you think?

628
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:35,451
And. Yeah, great question.

629
01:11:36,111 --> 01:11:40,670
I think for us it's less about virtual care. I mean, primary care is an we're in primary care.

630
01:11:40,671 --> 01:11:46,761
They all have primary care like and frankly, we have partnerships with these ginormous health systems.

631
01:11:46,761 --> 01:11:52,401
They have their own primary care and virtual care. So it's some level it's about execution.

632
01:11:53,241 --> 01:11:56,751
So. What's your model for doing virtual care?

633
01:11:57,351 --> 01:12:01,971
What's the response time of the PCP? 2 minutes. No co-pay, no deductible, no claim.

634
01:12:02,631 --> 01:12:05,721
Like how you staffing it? How many clicks is it?

635
01:12:05,751 --> 01:12:08,990
Take the provider. We measure how many clicks we measure, how many clicks they've done in a day.

636
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:14,151
We measure what's in their inbox at 4 p.m. and then we go to our product and engineering team and they take it down.

637
01:12:14,571 --> 01:12:18,081
Like, this is how that federal budget used to be. They call it pay for us. I still use that word.

638
01:12:18,081 --> 01:12:21,231
Nobody knows what it means. But you just spend the money, right? And you add it to the debt. No, no, no.

639
01:12:21,231 --> 01:12:24,351
You used to have to pay for things. So I call it pay for us on clicks.

640
01:12:25,101 --> 01:12:30,711
All we need people to do this quality stuff. And I'm like, Look, everybody wants to do good quality, but nobody wants more clicks and more work.

641
01:12:31,251 --> 01:12:36,861
So we have something I call it we call it the 4 p.m. with what's in your inbox basket electronically at 4 p.m.,

642
01:12:37,131 --> 01:12:39,501
simple metric, take it down, take it down each year.

643
01:12:39,861 --> 01:12:47,271
So at the end of the day, part of the challenge in a lot of these organizations, we were at Stanford, we were the first to do virtual care in Epic.

644
01:12:47,691 --> 01:12:50,961
Um, we hacked it. Judy got angry at us.

645
01:12:51,171 --> 01:12:54,621
And then I gave the keynote at the next year at the Big User Group Conference.

646
01:12:54,981 --> 01:13:00,560
And because we had one of the first to build our own app on top of Epic and then do virtual care.

647
01:13:00,561 --> 01:13:03,771
And we just I just paid one of our PCP straight salary to do it.

648
01:13:04,071 --> 01:13:06,631
And also we just paid a dermatologist. There was so much German for all.

649
01:13:06,631 --> 01:13:12,891
I'm just like, well, just salary, you know, but but why we also needed that was because it was different workflow.

650
01:13:13,131 --> 01:13:16,611
They couldn't make their revenue compensation goals if they had to do that.

651
01:13:17,241 --> 01:13:21,021
Um, as it ends up, virtual care is not faster for the provider.

652
01:13:21,261 --> 01:13:26,271
You could work from home, but like some of it's harder. Sometimes you have to have people come in.

653
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:29,481
You can't do blood work, you can't do labs, you can't do physical examinations.

654
01:13:29,961 --> 01:13:39,051
So I think just like in-office care, it's less about the technology and more about what's the consumer experience and what's the provider experience,

655
01:13:39,051 --> 01:13:45,051
and then what's the economic model. And I think our secret sauce, if you will, is the combination of those things.

656
01:13:45,501 --> 01:13:48,921
Here's the staffing model we've built. Here's the membership model we've built.

657
01:13:49,341 --> 01:13:52,521
That kind of takes away the friction at the margin on both the consumer.

658
01:13:52,761 --> 01:13:56,931
Here's the virtual team model we built. You can still book a billable appointment with your PCP.

659
01:13:56,931 --> 01:14:02,601
You can book a half an hour appointment or half an hour. We do build insurance for that, but we have the 24 seven on demand that we don't.

660
01:14:02,991 --> 01:14:08,001
So and it's not like what we're doing is unknowable to others.

661
01:14:08,001 --> 01:14:13,191
It's just very hard to do within an existing big system because at Stanford,

662
01:14:13,191 --> 01:14:16,151
like when I was going to put my money, I was going to put it into cancer, cardiac, neuro.

663
01:14:16,161 --> 01:14:21,891
I mean, we did this, we wanted to health plan, we did some stuff, but it was more innovation for the future.

664
01:14:23,001 --> 01:14:29,001
But when economics are tight, all those things get cut at these systems because that's not where your revenue comes from.

665
01:14:29,451 --> 01:14:34,341
So and that's why we found partnerships work well for them.

666
01:14:34,521 --> 01:14:38,930
Um, but it's not that they don't know and they're not smart and not doing great things.

667
01:14:38,931 --> 01:14:47,811
They are just very hard sometimes to execute different business models, you know, within all the other stuff you're trying to do in a health system.

668
01:14:48,591 --> 01:14:53,121
Yeah. What else? You know, some people find anything else.

669
01:14:55,291 --> 01:14:58,641
Yes. Wondering, like, what your strategy is.

670
01:14:59,731 --> 01:15:02,741
My. And he.

671
01:15:04,221 --> 01:15:12,581
You probably won't. What is your strategy? All the populations are as familiar.

672
01:15:19,931 --> 01:15:21,221
Yeah, a few things.

673
01:15:21,221 --> 01:15:34,001
So in our senior population, we have a team model that leverages health coaches that are, you know, multilingual, depending on the language.

674
01:15:34,721 --> 01:15:41,350
But we certainly have a big Latino community, so we have a lot of Spanish speakers we will often make.

675
01:15:41,351 --> 01:15:47,381
And, you know, that will be often an in-person appointment with your PCP, the health coach.

676
01:15:47,411 --> 01:15:51,471
You build that rapport, you build that relationship, and sometimes virtual care might just be phone calls.

677
01:15:51,491 --> 01:15:57,281
If that works, that's fine. During the pandemic, we gave people iPads and we said, You push this one button.

678
01:15:59,171 --> 01:16:01,361
That's it. Here's the chart. Push the one button.

679
01:16:01,721 --> 01:16:07,631
But even I like to say, for those of you who are more facile on tech, how many of you go to page two of a Google search?

680
01:16:08,081 --> 01:16:13,301
Oh, too much work. You can click a page and it can't do that. So I think here's where.

681
01:16:13,451 --> 01:16:18,811
And we do. We were talking about a lot of user design testing now.

682
01:16:19,301 --> 01:16:23,830
I'm getting older. I'm not too far from there. I'm like, am I going to like me?

683
01:16:23,831 --> 01:16:28,601
No, no. And like, I get it. I'm in a different background.

684
01:16:28,601 --> 01:16:35,351
And so you have a range of population. Some are more facile than not, but a lot of a lot of seniors are pretty facile.

685
01:16:35,951 --> 01:16:41,831
They're on Facebook. How many you are on Facebook? See you're with the seniors.

686
01:16:42,191 --> 01:16:49,270
Embarrassing now. But it's an interesting because when we do our growth in our marketing like Facebook,

687
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:51,761
they're not on Instagram, they're not on Snap, they're not on Twitter.

688
01:16:53,681 --> 01:17:01,301
But so but part of that you can educate people, but if you can make it easy enough to use, there's economic barriers and all those challenges.

689
01:17:01,301 --> 01:17:07,091
Sometimes you can give people stuff. Now you can buy some of these things if you're getting a premium of eight or 10,000 bucks a year.

690
01:17:07,391 --> 01:17:11,351
I can save one E.R. visit, you know, three, four or $500 on a tablet.

691
01:17:11,711 --> 01:17:16,961
I mean, you can't walk into the health system here for less than 800 bucks.

692
01:17:17,231 --> 01:17:21,371
Any health system? Not here like those things start trading off.

693
01:17:22,841 --> 01:17:26,291
But there's a lot of phone. That's fine. Pick up the phone.

694
01:17:26,981 --> 01:17:34,361
We don't need the video. The video helps on rapport. But if you already know the person, that helps a lot.

695
01:17:34,841 --> 01:17:39,221
But I think. I mean. That's where your department here is doing a lot of research.

696
01:17:39,551 --> 01:17:42,490
I think it's a fascinating area. I think there's a ton of opportunity.

697
01:17:42,491 --> 01:17:47,351
And what are the inequities and what are the differences and how do people think about technology and do they trust it?

698
01:17:47,381 --> 01:17:54,011
We were talking about this. I think it's such an exciting area and we're just at the beginnings of this.

699
01:17:54,671 --> 01:17:58,421
So, yeah, great question. I think we're pretty much at time.

700
01:17:58,421 --> 01:18:03,071
Cathie, what's our time going? 18, 12, 18, and we're going to go to 1220.

701
01:18:03,551 --> 01:18:07,631
Well, thank you all for coming on a Friday. Wow.

702
01:18:07,721 --> 01:18:18,371
That you are impressive. Just to sense of closing, it's really such a pleasure to be with you all and meet you all with great backgrounds you have.

703
01:18:18,611 --> 01:18:23,181
I think health care is phenomenally fun to work in.

704
01:18:23,201 --> 01:18:29,680
There's so many challenges. When I felt coming in to this is the current people don't know what they're doing.

705
01:18:29,681 --> 01:18:38,291
There's room for young people to make a difference. It's still the case, I think, still broken, almost, almost in all the same places.

706
01:18:39,341 --> 01:18:42,401
But you can make a difference. You can make a difference on individuals.

707
01:18:42,401 --> 01:18:48,671
Many of you have already worked in some capacity and you know, behind be positive,

708
01:18:49,061 --> 01:18:54,460
work hard, some find something you love and work hard at it and go for it.

709
01:18:54,461 --> 01:19:01,071
So thanks. Oh, thank you, Cathy.

710
01:19:01,671 --> 01:19:04,821
Something for you? Yeah.

711
01:19:04,941 --> 01:19:09,381
Sorry about that. Sorry about that. Thank you, Kathy.

712
01:19:11,331 --> 01:19:15,291
Thank you so much. Thank you all. Thanks for coming, everybody. Have a great weekend.

713
01:19:15,331 --> 01:19:43,111
Go, Blue Ivy. Oh.
