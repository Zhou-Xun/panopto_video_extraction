1
00:00:04,874 --> 00:00:09,874
discussing methods to calculate risk and introduce measures of mortality.

2
00:00:09,874 --> 00:00:14,874
Previously, we have been discussing methods to calculate risk with the simple cumulative

3
00:00:14,874 --> 00:00:20,874
risk method to estimate the incidents proportion. The actuarial or life tables method

4
00:00:20,874 --> 00:00:25,874
and most recently, the incidence density method. We will now discuss the Kaplan-Meier product

5
00:00:25,874 --> 00:00:31,874
limit method and introduce measures of mortality.

6
00:00:31,874 --> 00:00:37,874
The product limit method, also known as the Kaplan-Meier method, is a special case of the life

7
00:00:37,874 --> 00:00:42,874
table method. It involves calculating risk at the precise time at which

8
00:00:42,874 --> 00:00:47,874
each case occurs. And this avoids the limitation of having to categorize

9
00:00:47,874 --> 00:00:52,874
follow up time into intervals, which is done in the life table method and the density

10
00:00:52,874 --> 00:00:57,874
method. Recall that in the life table method we have interval follow ups where

11
00:00:57,874 --> 00:01:03,874
we don't know precisely when withdrawal from the study or disease onset occurs.

12
00:01:03,874 --> 00:01:08,874
And so we simply assume that they occur either at the exact time of the follow up

13
00:01:08,874 --> 00:01:13,874
or at the midway point in between followups. The density method

14
00:01:13,874 --> 00:01:19,874
also requires that we categorize follow up time into intervals.

15
00:01:19,874 --> 00:01:24,874
In the product limit method, we assume that withdrawal happens at the same time that cases

16
00:01:24,874 --> 00:01:29,874
occur when withdrawals do occur. And this is actually considered to be the best way of

17
00:01:29,874 --> 00:01:34,874
estimating timing of withdrawal. If we know the exact time at which

18
00:01:34,874 --> 00:01:39,874
the cases occur. Let's use the example

19
00:01:39,874 --> 00:01:45,874
that we looked at in the previous session, where we have seven subjects who are followed up

20
00:01:45,874 --> 00:01:50,874
for a total of five years in order to implement the product limit

21
00:01:50,874 --> 00:01:55,874
method. We begin by ordering all follow up times of the subject from shortest

22
00:01:55,874 --> 00:02:00,874
to longest. And here we assume that we know exactly when

23
00:02:00,874 --> 00:02:06,874
each case occurs. So you will note that the X is four individuals,

24
00:02:06,874 --> 00:02:11,874
four, five and seven, which are the three that developed the disease.

25
00:02:11,874 --> 00:02:16,874
You'll notice that these X's occur exactly at the midway point between intervals.

26
00:02:16,874 --> 00:02:21,874
So at time three point five for subject for zero point five four, subject five and two point

27
00:02:21,874 --> 00:02:27,874
five four, subject three. In reality, these may or may not be exactly the midpoint.

28
00:02:27,874 --> 00:02:32,874
But we would assume we are assuming here that this is in truth when they did occur and not a

29
00:02:32,874 --> 00:02:37,874
convenience of using the midpoint. Please note that if a withdrawal

30
00:02:37,874 --> 00:02:42,874
and a case are identical, we ordered the case first. So in this

31
00:02:42,874 --> 00:02:48,874
table, I have ordered all the follow up times of the subjects from shortest to longest.

32
00:02:48,874 --> 00:02:53,874
So on the top, we have 0.5. That corresponds to subject number five, who withdrew

33
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:59,874
at time 0.5. And at the bottom, we have 5.0, which corresponds

34
00:02:59,874 --> 00:03:04,874
to subject number one who contributed five years of person time.

35
00:03:04,874 --> 00:03:09,874
Please note that there are only five rows in this table and not seven rows, even though there are seven

36
00:03:09,874 --> 00:03:15,874
subjects shown in the figure. This is because there are two subjects which are numbers

37
00:03:15,874 --> 00:03:20,874
three and six, who are considered to have contributed zero person

38
00:03:20,874 --> 00:03:25,874
years of follow up because they were not at risk of the disease during

39
00:03:25,874 --> 00:03:30,874
the follow up time. So the first thing we do is we

40
00:03:30,874 --> 00:03:36,874
list the number or size of the population at risk over

41
00:03:36,874 --> 00:03:41,874
the duration of time for each with for each individual.

42
00:03:41,874 --> 00:03:46,874
And then we also indicate the number of cases or withdrawals over that same period

43
00:03:46,874 --> 00:03:51,874
of time. And I have done so here. So let's look at the first row of the table

44
00:03:51,874 --> 00:03:56,874
for the follow up time, 0.5 or the interval 0.5,

45
00:03:56,874 --> 00:04:01,874
which may be an easier way of thinking about it. There were five individuals in the population at risk, as

46
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:07,874
you can see from the five dashed lines over that time period, there was one case,

47
00:04:07,874 --> 00:04:12,874
which was subject number of five. For the next row in the table,

48
00:04:12,874 --> 00:04:18,874
which has a withdrawal time of 1.5, corresponding to subject number two,

49
00:04:18,874 --> 00:04:23,874
there were four individuals in the population at risk. As you can see from the forward, dashed

50
00:04:23,874 --> 00:04:29,874
lines that got that cut across the time. At 1.5,

51
00:04:29,874 --> 00:04:34,874
there were, in fact, zero cases or withdrawals. And this is because subject two, in fact, died

52
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:39,874
and was not considered to be a case or a withdrawal. And you can see similarily we

53
00:04:39,874 --> 00:04:45,874
do the same thing going down the rest of the rows in the table.

54
00:04:45,874 --> 00:04:50,874
So the next thing that we want to do here is calculate the conditional risk

55
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:56,874
based on the number or size of the population at risk and the number of cases or withdrawals

56
00:04:56,874 --> 00:05:01,874
that we have previously calculated simply. This is denoted as Rj

57
00:05:01,874 --> 00:05:06,874
over interval J equals Ij divided by Nj. And very simply,

58
00:05:06,874 --> 00:05:11,874
this would be, for the first row, one divided by five, which gives us 0.200, one divided by

59
00:05:11,874 --> 00:05:17,874
three, which gives us 0.333, and one divided by two, which gives us 0.500.

60
00:05:17,874 --> 00:05:23,874
This is the conditional risk at that exact time point of the subject's withdrawal or

61
00:05:23,874 --> 00:05:28,874
diagnosis of being a case. We can then calculate the conditional survival,

62
00:05:28,874 --> 00:05:34,874
which is simply one minus the conditional risk. And please note that this is the exact

63
00:05:34,874 --> 00:05:39,874
same thing that we did in the actuarial life table method. And this is why the product limit method

64
00:05:39,874 --> 00:05:44,874
is considered to be an extension of the life table method. And we use it when we know

65
00:05:44,874 --> 00:05:50,874
the exact time at which cases occur.

66
00:05:50,874 --> 00:05:56,874
Next, we can calculate the cumulative risk over the cumulative time that has elapsed,

67
00:05:56,874 --> 00:06:02,874
that has elapsed for each given time point of observation.

68
00:06:02,874 --> 00:06:08,874
And similarly, we calculate the cumulative survival as one minus the cumulative risk.

69
00:06:08,874 --> 00:06:13,874
So ultimately here in this table, we have a cumulative risk of 0.733

70
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:18,874
or 73%, a cumulative survival of 0.267 or

71
00:06:18,874 --> 00:06:23,874
26.7%. If this seems like I'm going too fast

72
00:06:23,874 --> 00:06:29,874
or if it's confusing, the slides are available on canvas so you can refer to these formulas

73
00:06:29,874 --> 00:06:34,874
and calculations later on when completing the in class activity in your small

74
00:06:34,874 --> 00:06:41,874
groups during the live Zoom session or when completing the exercise.

75
00:06:41,874 --> 00:06:46,874
And finally, here's a nice description that helps you identify which method you should use for

76
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:52,874
risk. And the answer to that question is it depends on your data. So these simple cumulative

77
00:06:52,874 --> 00:06:57,874
method to calculate the incidence proportion works when you have complete follow up of

78
00:06:57,874 --> 00:07:02,874
all individuals in your population. So there is no net migration. There is no drop

79
00:07:02,874 --> 00:07:07,874
out. There is no death. The population size is the exact same as it was from the

80
00:07:07,874 --> 00:07:13,874
beginning until the end of your follow up. In most cases, however, this doesn't happen

81
00:07:13,874 --> 00:07:18,874
and is not a realistic assumption and will lead to errors. If we if you use the simple

82
00:07:18,874 --> 00:07:24,874
cumulative method to estimate risk, the actuarial method or life table

83
00:07:24,874 --> 00:07:29,874
method is best when you have incomplete follow up and the data on the timing

84
00:07:29,874 --> 00:07:34,874
of cases and withdrawals is limited to interval periods. So you know that cases or

85
00:07:34,874 --> 00:07:39,874
withdrawals happen. You don't know precisely when they happen. But it is at some unknown

86
00:07:39,874 --> 00:07:45,874
point in time in between each of your interval follow up periods.

87
00:07:45,874 --> 00:07:50,874
The density method uses the incidence density, which uses person time

88
00:07:50,874 --> 00:07:56,874
to estimate cumulative incidents, and the density method is preferred when the exact time

89
00:07:56,874 --> 00:08:01,874
of onset or withdrawal is known. But I will note that you can only use

90
00:08:01,874 --> 00:08:06,874
that incidence density method when you have rate or incidence data and person year

91
00:08:06,874 --> 00:08:12,874
or person time data available to calculate the incidence density. And finally,

92
00:08:12,874 --> 00:08:17,874
the product limit method as an extension of the actuarial method is good to

93
00:08:17,874 --> 00:08:22,874
use. When you have incomplete follow up and you do have exact data available for

94
00:08:22,874 --> 00:08:27,874
cases or the timing of when cases occurs. But the data on withdrawal is limited

95
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:33,874
to interval periods. This is a useful slide to keep on hand when you're working through

96
00:08:33,874 --> 00:08:38,874
the in class activity or exercises. And finally, I would like

97
00:08:38,874 --> 00:08:43,874
to give a brief introduction to measures of mortality. So far in this

98
00:08:43,874 --> 00:08:48,874
chorus, we've talked about measures of disease in terms of prevalence, incidence

99
00:08:48,874 --> 00:08:53,874
and prevalence and incidence have concepts of time and duration attached to them.

100
00:08:53,874 --> 00:09:01,874
And we've also talked about that. The third important measure of disease is mortality.

101
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:06,874
And there are many ways to express measures of mortality. One is the case fatality

102
00:09:06,874 --> 00:09:11,874
rate. And this is simply defined as the number of deaths from a disease divided by the number of cases

103
00:09:11,874 --> 00:09:17,874
of a disease. This is a true proportion and it is typically expressed as a percentage.

104
00:09:17,874 --> 00:09:23,874
Even though we call it a rate. Please note that it is not a true rate and it is also sometimes called

105
00:09:23,874 --> 00:09:30,874
a case fatality ratio, which is also incorrect because it is not a ratio. It is a proportion.

106
00:09:30,874 --> 00:09:35,874
Next is the mortality rate. And this is something that everyone in this class is likely familiar with.

107
00:09:35,874 --> 00:09:40,874
And this is defined as the total number of deaths from all causes in a period divided by the number

108
00:09:40,874 --> 00:09:45,874
of persons in that population at the middle of the period. And this is typically expressed

109
00:09:45,874 --> 00:09:51,874
per 1000 population members or people. The time period may vary,

110
00:09:51,874 --> 00:09:56,874
but it must be expressed alongside the mortality rate. And conceptually, this is very similar to

111
00:09:56,874 --> 00:10:01,874
cumulative incidents or the incidents proportion where we do not incorporate time directly

112
00:10:01,874 --> 00:10:06,874
into the denominator. But we must express the time period that the cumulative incidence

113
00:10:06,874 --> 00:10:11,874
is associated with. And note here, we are calling this a mortality rate.

114
00:10:11,874 --> 00:10:16,874
But as you can see from this formula, time is not expressly included in the denominator. So it

115
00:10:16,874 --> 00:10:21,874
is not a true rate. It is a proportion.

116
00:10:21,874 --> 00:10:26,874
Similar to the overall mortality rate, the annual mortality rate is the total

117
00:10:26,874 --> 00:10:32,874
number of deaths from all causes over a one year period divided by the number of persons in that

118
00:10:32,874 --> 00:10:37,874
population at mid year. And again, this is typically expressed per 1000 population

119
00:10:37,874 --> 00:10:42,874
members or people. And please note, because populations change over time, the midyear

120
00:10:42,874 --> 00:10:47,874
population is often used in estimation. So let's work through

121
00:10:47,874 --> 00:10:53,874
a very quick example, comparing mortality rates and case fatality rates. So in a population

122
00:10:53,874 --> 00:10:58,874
of one hundred thousand people, there are eleven cases of leukemia in one year.

123
00:10:58,874 --> 00:11:03,874
Three of the cases die in that year. What is the mortality rate? Simply, this

124
00:11:03,874 --> 00:11:08,874
is three. There were three cases. Sorry, there were three deaths in that year,

125
00:11:08,874 --> 00:11:13,874
divided by one hundred thousand, which is the size of the total population. And this gives us

126
00:11:13,874 --> 00:11:18,874
a mortality rate of 0.03 per 1000 persons. On

127
00:11:18,874 --> 00:11:23,874
the other hand, the case fatality rate is three. So there were three deaths divided by eleven

128
00:11:23,874 --> 00:11:28,874
as the denominator, which is the number of cases of leukemia within the population. This gives us

129
00:11:28,874 --> 00:11:34,874
a case fatality rate of 27 percent. So the mortality rate applies to entire populations,

130
00:11:34,874 --> 00:11:40,874
whereas the case fatality rate refers to fatality among those who are cases.

131
00:11:40,874 --> 00:11:45,874
And finally, proportionate mortality, proportionate mortality is the proportion of mortality caused

132
00:11:45,874 --> 00:11:50,874
by a specific case. And here we simply calculate it as the number of deaths from a specific

133
00:11:50,874 --> 00:11:56,874
cause divided by the number of deaths from all causes. That's the end of part five.

134
00:11:56,874 --> 00:12:01,874
The next is part six, in which we will discuss standardization and age period and cohort effects in the

135
00:12:01,874 --> 00:12:06,874
Zoom session. In this session, we are also going to do some work examples

136
00:12:06,874 --> 00:12:11,874
in small groups of using the incidents density method and the Kaplin Maya method to

137
00:12:11,874 --> 00:12:17,416
estimate risk. And this is happening on Thursday, September 10th, beginning at ten thirty Eastern Time.
