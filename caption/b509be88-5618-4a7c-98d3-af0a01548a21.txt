1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:06,250
And then I was like, Oh, this is for like second half, Rita.

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:12,810
So it was kind of like, yeah, like over here, it was like 1:00.

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,310
It's about every story. Well, let's see.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:31,430
Like, for instance. Yeah, I agree with what, though.

5
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:47,510
I think it's two. I think it's 1 to 1 is this thing that we're going to have a research meeting, but I think we all do.

6
00:00:49,080 --> 00:01:01,530
But, I mean, what do we do? Well, over like two weeks, there are everything I told you about that.

7
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,200
You think you like about it? You like welcome.

8
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:13,820
Yes. I want to ask you a question. Explain that.

9
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,090
You know what? I think you. But.

10
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:31,950
I think we need to accelerate.

11
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:41,830
I it's really want to go through a part of that that.

12
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:51,990
How do you find the.

13
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:15,900
I think he was going to that. So I thought it was I think it's an elaborate kindness to be okay.

14
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:27,910
But didn't. It was number two, right?

15
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:36,660
Oh, yes. He a hero on. So then I was like, I already have a four year old.

16
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:46,560
It was like it was entitlement. And then I just took that state's face is because he really was arms and it was hard is

17
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:54,270
what you mentioned about this you say it's not like it was like basically you know,

18
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:58,440
you need this thing and then you can use this one year anniversary.

19
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:08,010
Okay, let's get started. Luckily, we don't have any fire drills today, although I'm sure we would have preferred it today.

20
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:12,930
Tuesday, hoping to have your exams back next week.

21
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:27,090
Any questions before we started? So we have today we're going to finish up randomization and then move into our next lecture,

22
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:32,730
which is about controlling for covariates in the analysis, which is highly related to randomization.

23
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:39,300
And then next Tuesday, we have no class because it's your fall break and then we'll come back Thursday and keep going on.

24
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:42,720
Now, this is the time when you want to start to think about your projects.

25
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,590
So remember you signed up for a topic at the beginning of the year.

26
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:53,760
You probably want to just check in with your team and make a plan at this point for moving forward.

27
00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:03,659
The there's so you're going to research the topic, you're going to try to address it, and then you're going to make a video recording of it.

28
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,559
So we don't have time to do it all in class. But the last few classes we are going to discuss them.

29
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:15,030
So it's expected that those videos are on I think it's yellow Digg and that you watch some and we'll have more information about later.

30
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:20,520
But just know that that is on the horizon. What else?

31
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:25,920
I think we all just need a break. So do I wish I got a break.

32
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:32,190
Fortunately, my son's daycare is out one day, and so I got a break with him.

33
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:37,290
He's actually great, but like, I have so much work that I need to do, that's not actually a break.

34
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:45,300
So anyways, it's. It's nice not to have class, I guess, Tuesday, and hopefully you will actually get to do something fun for fall break.

35
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:49,460
Are there exams after, like. Oh yeah. So you're going to study something here?

36
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:55,050
Is anybody doing anything fun? Going anywhere, anything.

37
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:00,500
Nobody wants to share. Okay.

38
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:07,799
Well, I won't I won't come. I won't bring my son. I promise. Most people in 653 said they were going to spend break catching up.

39
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,130
So 653 do you have an exam in that one or. It's just everywhere.

40
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:21,570
Where to see what people were doing. And most people said, we're catching up instead of realizing that take take a little bit of time to not do that.

41
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:25,670
Okay. All right. So I think we stopped here.

42
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,470
Is this does this look right to everybody? We stopped. Okay, good.

43
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:37,140
So we talked about a bunch of types of randomization degree or is that what we're talking about now?

44
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:42,450
That's where we've actually talked about some of these, right? So we were talking about a bunch of different types of randomization.

45
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:47,969
So we had simple and then we said like, well, that's, that's good and it can be used,

46
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:52,770
but if you have small samples, then you can get the balance right. So that's the issue with simple randomization.

47
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:59,490
So one easy way to fix simple randomization is to say run your randomization list, and if it doesn't look balanced, do it again.

48
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,750
And as long as you do that before you start actually using that randomization list and giving the treatment to someone that's valid.

49
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:11,130
So you're essentially just trying to find better or better randomization.

50
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:17,640
And then we said, well, there's this other way that if we're really worried about balance,

51
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:24,120
we can actually try to fix that balance in these like small blocks and so we can use block randomization.

52
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:32,909
And we talked a little bit about that when we said when we talked about phase two randomization, but then we added another element to it here,

53
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:37,229
which is instead of just saying, oh, we're going to use blocks of four, we can say,

54
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:41,190
Well, I don't want anyone to actually really be able to guess the next treatment.

55
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:43,649
So I'm going to choose a random block size first.

56
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:49,290
Maybe it's two or four or six or eight, and then within there the permutations of all the treatments are different.

57
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:53,219
And so therefore it's much harder to figure out what the next treatment is because I don't

58
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:58,200
know what block size I'm on and it's hard to figure out what everybody else has done.

59
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,770
So there's a random for me to block. Random.

60
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:05,110
It's. Asian. In a couple classes.

61
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:13,270
Actually, it might be the one after the break. You're going to get some time to play with these randomization processes in our.

62
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:18,339
And then we said, well, there's also this bias coin method.

63
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:27,010
So similar to how you did the biased coin design and phase one where you could flip a coin that could be not 5050, could be biased.

64
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:32,200
You can do the same thing with randomization so that you can kind of keep track of what the balance is.

65
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:41,530
And once you're off balance, you can flip a bias coin so that more people would likely be randomized to the treatment that has less people in it.

66
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:49,220
And then maybe we ended around here. We were talking about stratification.

67
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:56,960
So stratification is another way in which we can try to ensure balance with respect to specific variables.

68
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:04,040
So we're going to talk a lot more about, well, what variables or why are we doing this in this next lecture that we'll talk about today?

69
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:11,200
But essentially, we want if we have specific variables that we know are associated with the outcome,

70
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:21,050
we may want to upfront stratify on those variables to ensure that for everyone, say, for example, like age is really important.

71
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:25,340
So older individuals are going to do worse on this treatment than younger individuals.

72
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:31,640
Then I might want to separate people by their age. Maybe I have like over 60, less than 60.

73
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:39,020
And then within the less than 60 group, I'm going to use maybe random block randomization or simple randomization or whatever.

74
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,780
And so that there's balance in that younger group.

75
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:46,820
And then in the over 60 group, I'm going to do the same thing so that now there's balance in that over 60 group.

76
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:52,580
So I'm making sure that these two groups are definitely balanced across the treatment.

77
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:57,770
And so the stratification variables that you want to choose are what we call prognostic.

78
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,940
That means that those variables are associated with the outcome.

79
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,219
You only ever want to include a few prognostic or stratification variables.

80
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:17,080
So if you're setting up a clinical trial and somebody is like, Oh, well, it's age, it's BMI,

81
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:22,780
it's comorbidities, it's their previous treatment, you got to say, Oh, well, from the breaks, that's too many.

82
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:27,700
Once we add that many stratification variables, we're going to have these very sparse strata.

83
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:31,030
And then that's not useful. It's not necessarily going to be balanced.

84
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:40,000
And so primarily we try to choose maybe one to max three if it's a really big trial that we would use for stratification variables.

85
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:47,050
And these again are prognostic variables, meaning that there are variables that are associated with the outcome.

86
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:58,440
They may not be. So you might not have put them in the eligibility criteria for the trial,

87
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:05,190
but you might want to make sure that they are balanced because you're worried about that they are prognostic,

88
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:09,960
that they're associated with the outcome. So they might be the stratification factors.

89
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:12,690
So here's an example.

90
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:24,809
In a trial of a thrombolytic agent versus placebo in treatment following a heart attack, there was interest in stratifying on two variables.

91
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:32,370
So it was which center you were in. So for example, say it was like we had this trial at University of Michigan and we had this trial at Henry Ford.

92
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:37,709
And we thought, you know, the way that clinicians treat patients might be a little bit different at these

93
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:42,540
places and or the patients who come into these clinics might be different.

94
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,150
And so therefore, we're going to stratify on the center.

95
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:53,730
And we know that the time at which you get this treatment is very predictive or prognostic into how well you do.

96
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,099
Right. So if you come right in,

97
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:01,470
you're probably going to do much better than if you're it's over 6 hours since you've had this heart attack and you get this treatment.

98
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:06,510
So there are these two stratification variables, the center, and then also the time.

99
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:16,040
0 to 6 hours are greater than 6 hours. Now just because you choose specific strata, right.

100
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:22,639
And you're going to essentially what happens is you you create a randomization list within each one of these columns, right?

101
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,720
So then everyone at center one who is zero two, 6 hours from their heart attack,

102
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:31,160
they're going to be randomized between the two treatments ab ab whatever.

103
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,700
Right? You can use random block randomization there.

104
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:38,030
You can use simple randomization, bias coin, your choice.

105
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,130
And then similarly, everybody who center one greater than six, they're going to have a randomization list.

106
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:47,960
So it's going to be balanced center are 2026 center to greater than six.

107
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:52,880
So there's kind of like these four groups of individuals, right.

108
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:55,400
Who are going to be balanced across the treatments.

109
00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:02,509
But that doesn't mean that now within every group of individuals, you have the power to detect a treatment difference.

110
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:07,760
So usually the power, which we'll talk more about when we talk about hypotheses and sample size,

111
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:13,970
is based on one primary comparison, which is everyone in Group A versus everyone in Group B.

112
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:19,790
Just because we stratified means that there's balance. It doesn't mean that we can actually find the difference in those groups.

113
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:28,250
And the more strident, like I said, the more strident you have, the less people like you within each strata.

114
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,679
And some strata might be pretty sparse,

115
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:37,970
like it might be that they're not a lot of people that are seeking treatments that are one who have greater than 6 hours.

116
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:41,629
And that's okay. It's okay if there's not that many people in there. Right.

117
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:44,960
But then obviously you couldn't look at the treatment difference in that group.

118
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:56,209
You don't want over stratification. It's okay if there's a few if there's like one strata that has relatively few people.

119
00:12:56,210 --> 00:13:01,870
But what we're going to see in the next lecture is that we want to control for those variables in the analysis, right?

120
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:09,290
We want to add those to the regression. And so if you start to have very sparse groups, your regression is not going to converge.

121
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:09,649
Right?

122
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:17,660
So that's the issue that we we don't want to have all these sparse groups because we don't want to not be able to estimate that treatment effect.

123
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:31,200
There's also some some argument that like, why are we even doing stratified randomization, particularly in large trials?

124
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:37,230
Because we know that for large trials, when you do simple randomization, right balance generally occurs.

125
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:41,010
Balance is really only an issue of simple randomization in smaller trials.

126
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,650
So it's not necessary.

127
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:51,150
It's just sort of like an extra step that we can take to to make sure that there is definitely balance within these prognostic factors.

128
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,730
But if you're a trial is super,

129
00:13:53,820 --> 00:14:02,010
super large stratification is is likely just not really necessary to sort of like an extra protector that you're using.

130
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:06,180
But extra extra large is, you know, what does that mean? I don't know.

131
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:11,760
Definitely. I would say greater than 1000. If you're in the hundreds, you could still potentially have some imbalance that you're worried about.

132
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:15,510
So maybe use stratification, but even in the hundreds, it should be okay.

133
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:23,850
So stratified randomization makes the treatment groups appear similar with respect to the specific strata or prognostic factors.

134
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:29,700
This can give more credibility to your study because if there was chance imbalance,

135
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:34,590
then so you find a treatment effect, people peer reviewing or whatever.

136
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:38,610
So it could say, Oh, that's just due to the fact that you had older people in the one group.

137
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:44,700
And of course, you can control for that. Right. But still, people might say, oh, this trial wasn't run that well.

138
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:51,660
I'm not sure. Even with this added covariate, if we can really make sense of these results,

139
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:58,140
especially once you factor in human error and people stop taking the treatment, they do drop out.

140
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,180
They don't it. You're right.

141
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:08,010
When you factor in all those things, then this imbalance could be even more extreme based on differential dropout and other things like that.

142
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:21,110
So the block randomization within the strata might result in more precise estimates of the treatment difference.

143
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:26,120
And so it shows that the variance under stratified randomization can be shown to be four

144
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:31,370
sigma squared over n and under simple randomization the variance can be shown to be greater.

145
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:36,409
So the fact that we can actually like ensure this very balanced randomization,

146
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:42,110
we saw that when we have exactly half half right we have the most efficient treatment effect estimates

147
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:49,040
block randomization is going to get us to that close to that past half as opposed to simple randomization.

148
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:55,040
If we have simple randomization within blocks that are within the strata that are small, right, we can get imbalance that way.

149
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:02,869
And so the variance could be higher. So block randomization within stratified randomization can help us in terms of

150
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:06,260
making sure that there really is that balance on these prognostic factors.

151
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:10,880
The disadvantage is that you don't want to choose too many because once you choose too many,

152
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,160
then you have sparse strata and then you have issues with that efficient treatment effect estimate.

153
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:25,360
Okay. So then another type of randomization is called dynamic randomization.

154
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:31,540
And so this specifically, this one type of dynamic randomization we're going to talk about is called minimization.

155
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:39,880
And so we'll talk a lot more about very similar aspects to this when we talk about adaptive design in later lectures.

156
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:49,810
And this is sort of one. One version of it, although we're going to talk a lot more specifically about how we can use it.

157
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:59,409
This is more monetization. So a dynamic and trying to balance the groups not dynamic or adaptive in trying to get patients on the better treatment.

158
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:01,930
That's the way we're going to talk about it when we talk about adaptive design.

159
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:13,750
So in this way, you could say that you're not going to choose these specific strata strata variables or prognostic variables to stratify on.

160
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:21,160
But instead you have these prognostic factors that you want balance across all of them.

161
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:30,260
And so at any point in the trial, you can then assign the next patient such that there's the least balance across all of these factors.

162
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,430
It's going to I know this maybe doesn't make sense. It's going to make sense on the next slide.

163
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:43,299
So, for example, say that we have 80 patients already in this breast cancer trial and there are four strata that we're not

164
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:49,240
actually doing stratified randomization on there just for prognostic factors that we're interested in balancing.

165
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:55,650
And those are performance status, age, disease, free survival and dominant metastatic site.

166
00:17:55,660 --> 00:18:00,970
And each of these are the first three are binary variables and the last one has three categories.

167
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:11,110
Now, this 81st patient is coming into the trial, and that 81st patient, we need to know how they what their data is for each one of these variables.

168
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:15,430
So there are less than 50. They have their ambulatory.

169
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:19,750
Their disease for control is greater than or equal to two years. And they have visceral.

170
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:25,959
Their metastatic site is visceral. So here is what the data would look like.

171
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:34,840
It's essentially we take everybody that we've randomized already and we tabulate how what they are in terms of those four prognostic factors.

172
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:40,620
So there happened to be 30 on a who are ambulatory, 31 on B who are ambulatory.

173
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:42,580
Right. You can see they're all very close.

174
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:47,559
They're all very balanced because we're using this minimization method and how it works is that the next patient.

175
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:54,160
Right, was ambulatory less than 50 had D5 greater than or equal to two years and visceral.

176
00:18:54,340 --> 00:19:01,240
And so we add up the number of patients in those categories on a.

177
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:05,530
So 30 plus 18 plus nine plus 19.

178
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:12,189
And we add up the number of patients in those categories on B 31 plus 17 plus eight plus 21, and that's 77.

179
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:20,620
So we see that the balance is such that we need one more person on a to balance with the number of people on B and so that then the next person,

180
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,980
they're not really randomized, right? They're they're not at all.

181
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:27,880
Not actually. Not really. They're just not randomized. They're assigned treatment.

182
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:34,990
So we say, okay, then this next person gets treatment A, because that's where the balances for their factors.

183
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:43,220
So the the issue with this. Right. It's not actually randomization.

184
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:52,190
It's a. It's a deterministic assignment of treatment based upon the factors.

185
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:01,720
So since there's not randomization, there's a worry that bias could creep in.

186
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:06,490
Now, as I would, I would think, especially if you have multiple factors.

187
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:12,640
It'd be relatively difficult to keep track in your mind, like what the balance is across those factors,

188
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:17,470
what everybody else has been randomized to and what your incoming patient has.

189
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:23,530
However, we all have access to a computer and if somebody has access to these tables, right, they could very easily figure that out.

190
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:26,530
And maybe the clinician could say, oh, actually,

191
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:31,149
don't come on this trial right now because you're going to get a and we don't want you to get a right.

192
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:34,690
Like, they shouldn't do that, but they might. And because of that,

193
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:40,240
instead we can add this piece of randomization into it to say instead of you definitely get a let's

194
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:45,940
flip a bias coin and two thirds probability you'll get a one third probability you'll get B,

195
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,640
right? So at least now it's not deterministic.

196
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:55,090
There is probability involved, but we're going to have a higher probability that will maintain that balance or we'll get to that balance.

197
00:20:56,060 --> 00:21:03,040
Yeah, a common solution if there's a tie, like if you sum it up in both categories, I think if it's a tie you just flip a coin.

198
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:07,570
Yeah. Then you just do 50, you actually do 5050 randomization.

199
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:14,310
Okay. So this is related to something called the play the winner approach.

200
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,879
And we'll also talk about this more when we talk about adaptive design.

201
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:25,770
And there's a very well known example of play, the winner approach that actually occurred here at Michigan in Pediatric Echo.

202
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:32,639
And so that was with newborn babies who are having problems living and they would attach

203
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:39,870
them to this machine that would be a fake lung and heart for them is the actual machine.

204
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:46,470
You can use it on adults and it was used in adults in critical care and then they thought, oh, maybe we can use this for babies.

205
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:52,950
And so they used it, they, they had this trial, but they use this play the winner approach.

206
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:59,670
And so the first was the first patient was a flip of the coin and they got, I think, placebo.

207
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:04,020
And so they didn't get the equal or standard of whatever standard care was.

208
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,900
And then the next baby got echo and then that baby lived.

209
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:12,990
And so they gave the next baby Eskimo because there was a success on that treatment and that next baby lived.

210
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:16,049
So they gave the next baby male and that next baby lived.

211
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:21,209
And the first baby who didn't get M0 did not live. And so they had eight babies.

212
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:24,780
I think at the end of it we'll get to see the real one when we get to that point.

213
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:29,819
Seven had chemo and seven I think survived, or maybe six of them did.

214
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:34,229
And the first baby who got not M0 did not survive.

215
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:37,650
And so they said, Why are we doing this anymore? This trial is done.

216
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:43,470
We should just do chemo. However, there wasn't actual randomization involved.

217
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:47,070
Right? And it ended up only being on eight children, a babies.

218
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:51,990
And so there is a lot of controversy over the results.

219
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:56,670
Right. So as well, like, obviously we don't want to keep something that does look effective from them,

220
00:22:56,670 --> 00:23:00,030
but we actually don't have a lot of evidence that this is really effective.

221
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:04,200
And so there was a follow up trial in the UK, I believe, after that.

222
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:09,840
Anyway, so the point of the winter approach is that you can randomize the first patient

223
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:16,530
and then as soon as you see a success you just keep giving that treatment. And so again, this is more deterministic than randomized.

224
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:22,680
If you see a failure, then you get the other treatment.

225
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:33,509
And so this again, can bias can creep in because once you know the response of the previous individual, you know what the next individual will get.

226
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:39,180
And so you can maybe not put patients on that trial based on what the next treatment would be.

227
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:41,459
In order to do this, obviously,

228
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:47,220
this outcome has to be very quickly measurable because you don't want to be waiting around for months and months to figure out,

229
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:50,910
well, what was their response when you have people lined up waiting to be in this trial?

230
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:58,050
So this is only possible when you can very easily and quickly evaluate the response or the outcome.

231
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:10,020
Okay. So similar to the minimization method where we can add in randomization, you can also add in randomization to the play the winner,

232
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:19,380
so you can set it instead of actually definitely assigning that treatment that was successful or the other treatment if it was not successful,

233
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:26,819
we can add a layer of randomization and the way that it was first talked about is that all right,

234
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:30,720
if this if that treatment was successful, add another.

235
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:36,280
Add one more worth like adding a ball to the urn.

236
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:43,420
Right. You have equal. So you had ten patients on the trial and five had treatment and five had standard of care.

237
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:50,640
The person who had treatment just succeeded. We put one more treatment ball into the urn and now we draw right out of that.

238
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:55,660
So there's a little bit higher probability that you would actually get treatment as opposed to the control.

239
00:24:56,140 --> 00:25:02,020
And so and if they if they got standard of care and they succeeded, right.

240
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,460
We put one more standard of care.

241
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:14,019
And so then the treatment assignment probabilities would depend on the observed response rate or the observed number of successes in the trial.

242
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:21,820
And this is related to a response, adaptive randomization, which again we will talk about when we talk about the adaptive trials.

243
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:28,270
The goal here is trying to maximize the number of patients on the best performing treatment.

244
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:37,270
However, when there are unequal numbers on treatments, there can be a loss of statistical power in the treatment effect.

245
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:44,660
So we already saw that rate. Once we have half people on one treatment and half on the other, we have the smallest variance of the treatment effect.

246
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:49,840
Once we get beyond that half, half, then we have not efficient treatment effect estimates.

247
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:59,379
Also, there has been a lot of so that at some point there became this big a lot of

248
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:04,840
statistical literature on doing adaptive design as great randomized adaptive response.

249
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:10,810
Adaptive randomization is the way to go and then all of a sudden there's all this literature is like, don't do it, this is really bad.

250
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:15,410
This is going to have an efficient, inefficient treatment effect.

251
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:20,920
Assistance is going to have inflated type one error. You can make bad decisions and then you're treating people the wrong way.

252
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:29,499
And so when we do the adaptive design lecture, I have a series of readings for you from the Clinical Trials Journal,

253
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:34,240
which is if you again don't read very much in this class, please read that set of readings.

254
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:37,690
It's really, really interesting because it's all editorial.

255
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:43,540
So it's like everyone is from a half page to max, maybe two pages or one and a half pages.

256
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:51,340
And it's really big people in clinical trials, really big statisticians in clinical trial design that are arguing against each other.

257
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,260
One person will be like, Oh, this is the way to go.

258
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:57,909
Adaptive designs are the best, and the next person is like, Look at all these problems, and the next person is like, You're crazy.

259
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:01,660
No, this is really great. And the next person is like, I cannot understand you.

260
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:06,510
You should go to jail. I'm like, Yeah. I actually do get a little fiery.

261
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:10,650
And so it's really interesting to read and I think it's like five or six of them.

262
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:14,460
So all together it's not that much reading and it's just very interesting.

263
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:18,210
So again, if you don't read that much in this class, please read that said,

264
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:25,200
it's in the adaptive design lecture and it's the clinical trials set of of articles.

265
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:28,840
Okay.

266
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:41,200
So oh, and again in 803 and in our seminar in December, Peter Thall is coming to talk and I do encourage you to at least go to one of his sessions.

267
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:51,400
He was an early, enthusiastic individual about adaptive Roth response, adaptive randomization, and then he became one of its biggest critics.

268
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,420
And so he and in general, he's just a very interesting character.

269
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:59,740
So like you will be entertained at his talk if you go.

270
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:12,250
So these these the musician, the play, the winner, the randomize play the winner.

271
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:18,390
These are data dependent allocation strategies because we have to observe the outcome before we decide which the next treatment is.

272
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:26,009
And what this assumes and this is, again, one of the arguments against this type of randomization is that patients are

273
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:30,360
similar across the entire time that you're involving them in a clinical trial.

274
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:34,500
Right. That patients are similar, that the environment around the patients are similar.

275
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:41,400
And so that these extra potential confounding factors are not a problem.

276
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:47,010
You can imagine that if you are randomizing upfront, right,

277
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:51,870
and then you start doing this data dependent allocation and more people are getting a specific treatment,

278
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:57,269
but all of a sudden more people who are more ill start to enter the treatment

279
00:28:57,270 --> 00:29:01,139
this trial because they're hearing that they're getting this treatment right.

280
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:04,290
You have a different type of patient now than you did at the beginning.

281
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:10,139
And so just because they're doing well or they're not doing well may not be because of the treatment.

282
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:13,200
It may be because they're all chronically sick. Right.

283
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:20,280
And so we have to, in order to use this, be able to say that the type of patient across the entire time of the trial is the same.

284
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,089
There also could be issues where like, say, at the beginning,

285
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:29,370
you're doing this randomization and then all of a sudden, right, you're depending upon response.

286
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:34,920
And now later in the trial, there is this other medication that's available that patients are receiving

287
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,030
just right outside of the trial that they're getting something else right now.

288
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:46,620
Those patients are different. Again, it's something outside the trial that has changes, that has change that's probably going to impact the outcome.

289
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:51,180
And it's confounded with the fact that we've changed our randomization probabilities over time.

290
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:54,870
And so it's going to be difficult to tease those things out from the trial.

291
00:29:55,620 --> 00:30:01,350
So that's one of the again, one of the biggest arguments against this type of randomization.

292
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:08,310
Okay, so let's do a few pull everywhere and then move on to the next one.

293
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:15,810
So what is generally a requirement of comparative trial for estimating a causal effects?

294
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:30,600
So this is really thinking about random sample versus randomization.

295
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:37,300
And how that affects, if you can say, the treatment caused the outcome.

296
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:58,960
A few more. Okay.

297
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:10,300
So half the people essentially saying you need both a random sample and treatment randomization and half saying you need treatment randomization.

298
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:20,230
So in order for the trial to have a valid causal inference right about the treatment,

299
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:25,240
there needs to be randomization so that you have internal validity of the trial.

300
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,540
Right. So the question is, does it have to be a random sample or not?

301
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:35,470
So ideally you would have a random sample. However, that internal validity holds based on your randomization.

302
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:40,270
You don't need to have a random sample to make causal inference about the treatment effect.

303
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:45,010
So the correct answer is just B, but right.

304
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:51,940
Ideally, we'd be able to have both internal and external validity so that you would have the random sample as well.

305
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,840
But the causal facts, we really just need the internal validity.

306
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:59,820
Okay. How about this one? Okay.

307
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,320
I'm not surprised that this is all over the place. Right.

308
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:11,310
So how could the trial investigators being unblinded to the treatment assignments lead to a not random sample?

309
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:19,680
Anybody want to say lots of people chose it? Yeah.

310
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:27,390
Well, they can prescribe the treatment based on the severity of disease, so there's some other confounding factors to it.

311
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:38,550
Yeah. So if we know what the so if we know what the treatment are, we might direct specific people to specific treatments right now.

312
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:43,980
Does knowing what the treatments are effect who's invited to the trial at all?

313
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:49,860
I mean, do you know what the treatments are? Right. And every clinical trial, you just don't know which one you're giving.

314
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:57,410
Right. So the random sample would be a random sample of people.

315
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,460
With the disease right in the trial.

316
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,599
So that's the part that's the thing that's not totally clear to me about that.

317
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:15,030
One is that I do agree that there's definite room for bias of who gets which treatment.

318
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:19,920
But is there room for bias for who's in the trial altogether?

319
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:27,090
I don't know. You always know the treatments in the trial. You just don't necessarily know which one you're giving.

320
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:35,100
So that to me is like, I don't know. The trial is testing a high risk experimental therapy for chronic disease.

321
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:39,750
How about that one? Did anybody say that one could not comprise that random sample?

322
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,700
Yeah. Because like everyone who signed up for that travel already had the disease, so that wouldn't be random.

323
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:52,800
All right. Well, it should be a random sample of people with that disease.

324
00:34:52,800 --> 00:35:01,590
Right. So I think the question there is like if it's a high risk experimental therapy, are we then only going to choose the like?

325
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:09,850
Healthiest? Or are we only going to choose the least healthy people in that in the eligibility criteria because we're worried about the risk?

326
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:10,179
So that.

327
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:18,190
Well, I think there's a possibility for it not being a random sample because we might be very careful about who are choosing to be in that trial.

328
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:23,500
Right. Okay. And the trial is only happening at the University of Michigan.

329
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:29,379
Most people chose this one, right? 26 plus 16 plus 11.

330
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:34,450
So why is that? One room for a nonrandom sample? Yep.

331
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:39,090
Because there isn't necessarily external validity if you're applying it to something beyond universal.

332
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:45,750
Yeah, right. Like the people who live near University of Michigan in Michigan or go to University of Michigan,

333
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:49,650
they're probably not representative of all the people with that disease.

334
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:59,610
So, yes, so I think I think there are good arguments for B and C, I think, A, there's not quite as a clear argument.

335
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:07,590
Okay. How about this one? A clinical trial that was properly randomized can potentially make which of the following claims.

336
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:11,310
This is like the same kind of question as the first one.

337
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:40,500
All right. So this is again, the randomization versus the random sample.

338
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:45,600
So within the trial, right, we can say that there is a positive effect.

339
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:51,090
But unless the people in that trial are also a random sample of the individuals with that disease,

340
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:57,570
we can't say that there is necessarily a positive effect of that treatment in all of the individuals with that disease.

341
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:07,180
So we need both a random sample and randomization to make B to make that claim B, we just need randomization to make the claim a.

342
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:08,980
Right.

343
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:18,430
The biggest complaint or argument against results from clinical trials is that they are not realistic because they are specific group of people,

344
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:27,040
highly motivated volunteers who go into clinical trials that do not represent the greater individuals with that disease or in that area.

345
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:33,580
And they're saying that while you might see an effect in those people very applied to everybody, you're not going to see that effect.

346
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:39,790
So it's that issue of random sample. That issue of external validity or generalization.

347
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,920
All right. That's the biggest complaint or controversy about clinical trials.

348
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:49,760
Okay. So what's the primary rationale for using randomization?

349
00:37:49,820 --> 00:38:01,590
Is it to reduce bias or reduce variance? Yeah.

350
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:04,950
100%. You guys got that one produced by us? Great.

351
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:09,480
Oh, maybe there's more. Okay.

352
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:36,210
What's the effect of unequal randomization? Exactly.

353
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:40,480
So once you have unequal randomization or treatment effect, estimates are not as efficient,

354
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:46,030
which means that the variance is increased and the power has decreased.

355
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:56,060
All right. Now, there's a bunch of slides at the end of this that you can go through if you're really into directed cyclic graphs.

356
00:38:56,540 --> 00:39:00,890
So this explains randomization in terms of dags.

357
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:09,350
I decided that it was not worth teaching. Last few years it was particularly difficult to teach over Zoom when we were online.

358
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:15,700
And I just don't think it's. Absolute necessary to understand it.

359
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:22,120
But if you're really into Dags and want to go beyond the theory of randomization, it's here for you.

360
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:27,020
All right. So let's move on to this next one.

361
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:32,850
This is this is highly related because we're going to figure out if we're going to stratify by variables.

362
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:37,060
What do we that we need to use those variables in our analysis of the data.

363
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:45,100
So we're going to again focus on stratified randomization and how to choose these strata variables and then

364
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:51,840
understand why we need to adjust for them and introduce the concept of what's called intent to treat analysis,

365
00:39:51,850 --> 00:40:00,550
which if you read the clinical trials literature, you will likely see that it or intent to treat mentioned in terms of the analysis of it.

366
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:07,660
We will then in a later lecture also talk about alternatives to ITC analysis like per protocol.

367
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:13,170
And so we'll talk. We'll. Explain those in greater detail.

368
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:16,780
So we're just going to touch on it today. Okay.

369
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:19,270
So we just discussed why do we randomize?

370
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:24,970
And then today we're talking about and and then if we have stratification, we need to adjust for the variables.

371
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:32,470
We'll talk a little bit about deviations from randomization today, but more in the next lecture.

372
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:40,620
And then we're going to talk about randomization and different types of it in later lectures when we get to like adaptive designs.

373
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:49,010
So we might stratify based on covariate values.

374
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:57,860
Ideally, we're doing this because we want balance in this covariate, and we believe that the covariates are prognostic or associated with the outcome.

375
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:02,420
And so we might be doing this specifically because we want to do subgroup analyzes.

376
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:07,070
So we really want to know within a subgroup of people is there a treatment effect?

377
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:09,830
And so we want to make sure that there's a balance there.

378
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:16,160
We might be doing this because we know that if we have big imbalances, people aren't going to believe our results.

379
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:18,590
And so we're just saying, all right, well,

380
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:24,050
we're going to implement this trial to the best of our ability and ensure this balance so people aren't upset about it.

381
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:28,520
And then there's the question about are we doing this?

382
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:33,349
Because actually we could have increased precision on our treatment effect estimates.

383
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:38,000
And so we're going to see if, if and well, really when that occurs.

384
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:48,530
So again, if we're going to use stratification, we usually want a very a small number of stratification variables, one to maybe max three.

385
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:55,549
And when we have those stratification variables, right, those have to be able to be categorical, categorical variables that can be continuous.

386
00:41:55,550 --> 00:42:01,070
But we have to categorize them because we're creating these these categories of where there is balance.

387
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:06,830
So usually if we're going to choose one or two of those, they either have to or again, max, three categories.

388
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:11,570
We're generally not trying to choose categorical variables where there's like six categories.

389
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:17,300
We want to stratify on that and something else. Again, it just creates too many strata and they would be too sparse.

390
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:24,500
So we identify one or two of these strong prognostic factors, these factors that are associated with the outcome.

391
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:31,370
We separate the strata by defining these these categories essentially.

392
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:42,169
Right? So if we have two variables with two categories each that we have for strata, and then within each strata or strata, we do our randomization.

393
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:46,160
So generally we're going to use the random block randomization.

394
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:53,960
So for example, right, we had two variables with two categories each,

395
00:42:54,500 --> 00:43:01,610
then we have these four stratum strata for strata and within each stratum we've done

396
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:08,329
computed block randomization of block size for if we're hopefully doing random block right,

397
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:10,879
maybe they're a block size for if there are two treatments,

398
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:15,860
block size like four and six and maybe eight, but probably sticking to the smaller numbers.

399
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:23,300
So this is what a randomization list looks like, such that when a patient comes into a trial.

400
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:27,920
Right, we would need to collect the information on those prognostic factors.

401
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:32,690
So are you in stratum one too strong three or strong four?

402
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:42,469
So if strata, if the stratification variables are age less than 50 over 50 and maybe like BMI,

403
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:51,500
less than 21 over 21, right, then there would be less than 50 less than less than 50 age less than 21,

404
00:43:51,500 --> 00:44:02,750
BMI less than 50 age greater than or equal to fit 21 BMI greater than or equal to 50 age less than 21 BMI in the last one.

405
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:06,800
Right of the older, larger BMI individuals.

406
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:12,440
And so within each one of those groups, right, the patient comes in and we say, okay, what's your age?

407
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,899
What's your BMI now? We can put you into one of these groups.

408
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:21,260
And now I know which treatment you're getting from where, what number individual you are in this trial and which strata you fall into.

409
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:31,760
Now, if we have stratification in our randomization, then we want to include those variables in our analytic model for the treatment effect.

410
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:42,500
So if we're, for example, have a continuous outcome as as what the at the end of the trial that we're interested in,

411
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:50,010
then we would have a linear regression where treatment right versus B is our primary covariate of interest.

412
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:58,940
But we also put in the variable BMI and the the variable H and we'd use it in the categories that we use for stratification factors.

413
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:04,210
And so we're going to control our regression for the stratification factors because we know that those.

414
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:09,350
Right. We chose those because we believe that they're associated with the outcome.

415
00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:15,260
If we have a binary outcome, right, we could do a logistic regression, same thing.

416
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:22,610
We could also more sort of more simply do stratified mental and mental and social tests.

417
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:29,210
Or if we have survival outcome, we could do stratified log rank tests.

418
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:30,620
So those are just right.

419
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:37,070
Like the instead of doing a regression, we can just take sort of the simple test and do it with any strata and pool across them.

420
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:44,480
Right. If we have longitudinal data, we can use random intercepts for each strata.

421
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:51,200
And if we have time to event outcomes or survival, we can use individual baseline hazards.

422
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:58,980
So these are different ways to do the analysis of interests accounting for the fact that we have this strata.

423
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:05,930
I think simply you can just think about we have a regression now we're adding these variables to the model along with our treatment variable.

424
00:46:07,370 --> 00:46:13,040
So the question is, why are we doing this essentially, like why are we adjusting for the stratification factors?

425
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:19,130
So what we want to do is try to get the statistical intuition about this.

426
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:22,640
And so let's look at two potential analytic models.

427
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:26,570
So we have this first one where we have some intercept.

428
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:36,079
We have the treatment variable. So this is the indicator for getting A over B, and then we have our covariates, which we'll call or sorry,

429
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:41,720
our, our strata variable, which we'll call V and then you as our unknown error.

430
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:48,049
So alpha, delta and beta are coefficients, right?

431
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:55,250
The alphas intercept and then delta and beta are coefficients where delta is our real coefficient of interest.

432
00:46:55,610 --> 00:47:00,650
But we want to see if whether we need to control for, for the strata or not.

433
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:07,340
And so we're comparing this number one equation, which includes the stratification variable versus the number two equation,

434
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:13,670
which does not include the stratification variable. So we're asking like, do we actually need this V in this model?

435
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:18,560
Okay. The our we're assuming this is like linear regression.

436
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:26,599
Right. Assume we have an error term. This view which is normally distributed with mean zero and variance sigma squared

437
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:31,730
in the case that we include the the strata variable and squared if we do not.

438
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:40,559
So we have some questions. When are both of these models appropriate to use such that they satisfy all the linear regression

439
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:46,800
assumptions and then assuming that those assumptions are are not violated that they hold,

440
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:48,899
when are the treatment effects the same?

441
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:56,760
So that estimate the coefficient of our treatment effects Delta Star when we control for the strata versus Delta when we do not, when are they equal?

442
00:47:57,270 --> 00:48:04,800
And then assuming that the assumptions hold, when is there a gain in precision of our treatment effect estimate?

443
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:11,700
So when is there going to be when is it useful to actually adjust for B and one, is it not?

444
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:18,410
So if we take our model where we adjust for V, right, we take the expected value.

445
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:22,180
Obviously our error goes away because that expected value is zero zero.

446
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:37,290
And so if we define that, the expected value of the stratification variable is some MU plus some some variable times the treatment, right?

447
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:48,190
So we're saying that the expected value of our stratification variable is some mean effects plus some effects because of the treatment.

448
00:48:48,910 --> 00:48:53,320
Right. That this is how we're we're just defining that.

449
00:48:53,920 --> 00:49:00,489
Then we can make this model one, we can bring the like terms together, right?

450
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:10,210
So now our new intercept is alpha star plus beta times mu and our new coefficient with treatment is just Delta Star plus beta.

451
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:17,850
What is this, gamma? So all I did right is I just did the algebra.

452
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:22,719
I just put in what you obviously was this thing and then I brought the light terms together, right?

453
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:32,740
So I get a new intercept and a new coefficient for treatment based on my definition of the expectation of the strata given the treatment variables.

454
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:37,880
Now remember how squared. Where is Tao squared.

455
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:47,000
Tao squared is down. Here is the expected value of ah sorry is the variance of the error when we don't have that variable and

456
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:54,770
a sigma squared was the variance of the outcome when we do have both treatment and the strata involved.

457
00:49:55,550 --> 00:49:59,810
So Tao Squared is the variance of the outcome given the treatment.

458
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:10,010
And then this is equal to beta squared times the variance of the stratification variable plus sigma squared if we sorry,

459
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:13,370
if we want to actually make these variances equal. All right. What do we have to do?

460
00:50:13,370 --> 00:50:18,139
Well, that's true if we can define this.

461
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:22,340
So Tao squared is equal to beta times omega squared plus sigma squared.

462
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:25,550
So again here I'm just defining what this I'm just giving this some term.

463
00:50:25,850 --> 00:50:34,040
So I'm just saying this variance is omega squared and so tao squared equals the speed of squared omega squared plus sigma squared.

464
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:46,130
So when are these models? With whole one of the assumptions for linear regressions with hold for these models right.

465
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:54,660
Will they withhold if then right as I just found here if my expected value as I defined right of

466
00:50:54,660 --> 00:51:01,710
the given t is that mu plus gamma times the treatment indicator and my variance is omega squared.

467
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:09,580
So essentially I kind of give you the right I define those that that way so that these assumptions would hold.

468
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13,589
And so here my expected value of my outcome, right.

469
00:51:13,590 --> 00:51:17,610
Is as such where I again just brought those terms together.

470
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:29,350
So now assuming that these models have the linear regression assumptions withheld, then when does my treatment affect this?

471
00:51:29,370 --> 00:51:34,260
If I go back here, when does this Delta Star equal Delta?

472
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:40,620
Right. And so if I look at my models, right, I need this Delta Star.

473
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:51,550
To equal delta. And so. I need actually that this Delta Star plus beta gamma equals delta.

474
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:56,499
Right. And so when will this Delta Star plus be that gamma equal delta Delta Star equal

475
00:51:56,500 --> 00:52:00,879
delta either of beta equals zero or if gamma equals zero so meaning right.

476
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:07,720
If beta equals zero, what does that mean? That means there is no relationship between the stratification variable and the outcome.

477
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:16,590
And one gallon equals zero, right? That means that there's no relationship.

478
00:52:17,450 --> 00:52:21,500
Between that stratification variable and treatment.

479
00:52:22,810 --> 00:52:26,430
Right. So either there's no relationship between the stratification variable and the outcome,

480
00:52:26,430 --> 00:52:29,610
or there's no relationship between the stratification variable and the treatment.

481
00:52:30,850 --> 00:52:36,520
Then I would see that my treatment effect estimates are going to be the same if I control

482
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:40,240
for the stratification variable whether I don't control for the stratification variable.

483
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:49,830
And then the question is, so if I. Control for this variable.

484
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:57,730
Is it going to make my treatment effect estimate more precise or is it going to make that variance inflated?

485
00:52:57,750 --> 00:53:04,260
So now I want to compare the variance of the treatment effect estimate, right, this Delta or the Delta Star.

486
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:09,000
And I want to see when I want to try to compare those estimates.

487
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:17,639
So if I take the variance of my Delta hat, so this is from the model where I don't control for the stratification variable, right?

488
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:28,680
I get this, this formulation which I can write as beta squared, omega squared plus sigma squared over the variance of the treatment.

489
00:53:29,310 --> 00:53:37,530
And if I take the variance of the treatment effect when I control for the stratification variable, it depends on the variation,

490
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:43,049
the variance of that stratification variable right times sigma squared over the variance of that

491
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:47,240
stratification variable times a variance of the treatment minus the covariance between the two.

492
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:50,010
And so if I want to compare these right,

493
00:53:50,010 --> 00:54:00,630
I can put them in a ratio so I can look at the relative efficiency of when I don't control for my stratification variable B from what I do.

494
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:04,709
And that boils down to this effect down here, right?

495
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:09,870
So we could be doing this algebra the whole time, but I don't think it's worth the class time to do it.

496
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:12,870
I know you guys can do this algebra from your classes, right?

497
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:19,890
So now I get this one minus the correlation between the treatment variable and the stratification variable on the numerator.

498
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:25,770
And then one minus the speed of squared omega squared over beta squared, omega squared plus sigma squared.

499
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:28,860
So let's break down this stuff here.

500
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:35,820
So this is the relative efficiency of including the stratification variable to not including the stratification variable.

501
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:40,229
So this thing down here, this beta squared, omega squared over beta squared,

502
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:45,630
omega squared plus sigma squared is actually kind of like a R squared term.

503
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:50,969
So this is like the if you look where beta squared omega squared came from,

504
00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:58,110
it's the variance of the regression where I control for the code that stratification variable.

505
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:07,850
If my if I don't have error, write over the variation of that regression when I include the error.

506
00:55:07,850 --> 00:55:14,569
Right. So the variation of the expected value over the variation of if that is that error exists.

507
00:55:14,570 --> 00:55:22,430
Right. And so this is like the amount of variation in the outcome due to the variables I have in my regression.

508
00:55:22,670 --> 00:55:26,810
Right. That's like the R squared value. Remember R squared from regular linear regression.

509
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:32,970
So it's, it's similar. And once you have multivariable regression that's called a coefficient of variation, right?

510
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:37,520
The R squared doesn't actually hold anymore because we have multiple variables.

511
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,409
And so this is like this beta squared,

512
00:55:39,410 --> 00:55:46,460
omega squared thing is this coefficient of variation or the proportion of variance explained by my regression equation.

513
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:57,920
And this is actually often described as what we call a partial correlation between my stratification variable and my outcome given the treatment.

514
00:55:59,150 --> 00:56:03,830
So it's like the square root of this correlation, a partial correlation.

515
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:11,160
So I can rewrite that that denominator as this partial correlation.

516
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:17,399
And so now I have this one minus the the correlation squared between the treatment

517
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:23,960
and the covariate over one minus the correlation squared of the strata.

518
00:56:24,450 --> 00:56:28,690
Sorry, this is the stratification variable. Right. Stratification variable, the outcome given the treatment.

519
00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:34,800
So now my efficiency, the relative efficiency depends on how associated is treatment.

520
00:56:34,950 --> 00:56:40,620
And the stratification variable over how associated is that stratification variable and the outcome.

521
00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:44,459
Right. So now this efficiency of one,

522
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:48,900
I'm going to get a more precise treatment effect estimate depends on the association of the

523
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:55,770
stratification variable with treatment and the Association of stratification variable with the outcome.

524
00:56:57,330 --> 00:57:02,280
So if my stratification variable V and the outcome Y have no association,

525
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:09,780
once we've accounted for treatment right, then this denominator is going to be zero.

526
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:16,610
And so now if I look at this efficiency, right, it just depends on the numerator.

527
00:57:17,570 --> 00:57:21,860
And if I have, I have to have some positive value here. Right, because it's a squared thing.

528
00:57:22,190 --> 00:57:29,599
So obviously, this is going to be less than or equal to one, which is going to say that if I adjust for V,

529
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:36,830
when it's not actually associated for the outcome, then that's actually increasing the variance of my test statistic.

530
00:57:36,950 --> 00:57:42,139
So if I include the stratification variable, but that stratification variable is not actually prognostic,

531
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:49,760
it's not actually associated with the outcome. I've now introduced noise to my right as something that you learn in linear regression,

532
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:56,300
that when you keep adding variables that aren't actually associated, all you're doing is blowing up the variance, right?

533
00:57:57,110 --> 00:58:00,710
If you think about that, like how you calculated like the variance inflation factor.

534
00:58:03,850 --> 00:58:07,370
Or why you don't want to just add every variable to the model. Right.

535
00:58:07,390 --> 00:58:11,830
There's a bias variance tradeoff. We can see that very clearly here.

536
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:21,160
Not if we have this V variable in our model and it's not actually useful, it's just going to increase the variance of my treatment estimate.

537
00:58:25,570 --> 00:58:35,650
If I have the stratification variable that's unrelated to treatment as it should, because we have randomization, right?

538
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:41,170
We have the stratification variable where within each strata we've randomized.

539
00:58:41,530 --> 00:58:46,090
And so there should be balance in the treatments across each strata.

540
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:54,159
Right. So the stratification variable should be unrelated to treatment then this correlation.

541
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:58,870
Right. Of the treatment and that and the stratification variables should be zero.

542
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:04,209
And now this, this function.

543
00:59:04,210 --> 00:59:07,240
Right, this formula a fraction. That's a word.

544
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:10,450
Right? This fraction is now greater than or equal to one,

545
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:17,860
which means that my variance of including the stratification factor is lower than the variance when I didn't.

546
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:27,510
So if I have a prognostic covariate and randomization was done right now,

547
00:59:27,510 --> 00:59:33,300
I should get a more precise estimate of my treatment effects when I include that variable into my equation.

548
00:59:35,010 --> 00:59:37,200
So all of that can be summed up by this table.

549
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:48,479
Okay, so this table shows a correlation between the treatment and the stratification factor equaling zero, which means that the stratification factor.

550
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:51,330
Right, the treatment should be independent of the stratification factor,

551
00:59:51,690 --> 00:59:55,800
that we have a really good randomization, that there's balance in the treatment with the strata.

552
00:59:56,280 --> 01:00:01,650
Right. And this, this column should be fulfilled if randomization was done and done well.

553
01:00:02,510 --> 01:00:06,120
Right. So in clinical trials, we should be working within this column.

554
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:17,530
And so what this says is that if we have this stratification factor that isn't associated with our outcome,

555
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:24,490
then and, and the randomization works well, then we'll get the same treatment effect.

556
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:32,050
Okay. And these, these variances will actually be equal because this, this ends up being zero.

557
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:41,770
And so it doesn't add any. It doesn't inflate the variance that the variance is going to be inflated if we include that stratification factor.

558
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:45,790
Only if the randomization didn't work well. Okay.

559
01:00:47,530 --> 01:00:52,540
Now, if we have randomization that worked well and we chose well in terms of there's a

560
01:00:52,540 --> 01:00:57,250
prognostic variable that we stratified for and that's associated with the outcome.

561
01:00:57,640 --> 01:01:00,940
Now we can get more precise treatment estimates.

562
01:01:01,330 --> 01:01:09,010
And so that's why we want to try to adjust for these stratification variables in a clinical trial because we have randomization.

563
01:01:09,010 --> 01:01:14,950
So we believe that the treatment is independent from the stratification variable due to dramatization.

564
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:19,899
And we chose the stratification variable well such that it's associated with the outcome.

565
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:25,630
And now our treatment effect estimate is actually going to be more precise because we've controlled for the strata variables.

566
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:32,920
If we don't control for the strata variables right, then we can get not as precise treatment effect estimates,

567
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:36,340
which means that we could miss the treatment being significant.

568
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:42,879
Right. Imagine that if you just have a slightly larger variance, that P value might be over .05.

569
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:46,360
Right. And you would say, oh, this is not no longer a useful treatment effect.

570
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:51,640
However, if you are able to have this prognostic variable, you stratified on it, you include it,

571
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:55,780
you might get a smaller variance and then you might be able to find that effect.

572
01:01:59,430 --> 01:02:04,230
If you have a. Brain possession gone wrong.

573
01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:09,540
And there's some association between the prognostic factor.

574
01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:19,260
You actually don't know whether you're going to have more precise or less precise estimates, and your treatment effect is likely to be biased.

575
01:02:19,830 --> 01:02:24,750
So this is like this is not a good place to be in a clinical trial, right?

576
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:30,720
Where your randomization didn't work and you have stratification variables.

577
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:36,300
It's mostly just that your randomization went bad, right? And so therefore we have biased estimates.

578
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:40,710
So you don't want this level of trial. The randomization is trying to get away from this issue.

579
01:02:42,790 --> 01:02:49,980
All right. So the the the lesson is that as a baseline variables or the stratification variables are strongly correlated with the outcome.

580
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:55,330
Then if you adjust for those factors, you can increase the precision and the treatment effect estimate.

581
01:02:57,180 --> 01:03:02,350
What we'll see when we talk a lot more about sample size is that that really matters, right?

582
01:03:02,370 --> 01:03:10,290
What really matters in calculating sample size is type one error power that you want to find a desired effect size with a specific variance.

583
01:03:10,590 --> 01:03:15,780
And so if that variance can go down, then you can have higher power or smaller sample size.

584
01:03:17,850 --> 01:03:25,490
If your baseline variables are independent of the outcome and randomization isn't helpful, right,

585
01:03:25,710 --> 01:03:35,130
then you can have these small losses in the efficiency if if there's if they're not associated.

586
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:43,810
It's a baseline. Variables are independent and randomization works well is probably not the variance.

587
01:03:43,810 --> 01:03:51,670
It's going to be about the same so it's not that big. A deal is only becomes a bigger deal when you're very your randomization didn't work

588
01:03:51,670 --> 01:03:55,600
quite as well and the problem here is that it could be not just your organization,

589
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:59,319
but it also could be the issue of like informative dropout, right?

590
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:05,200
So if you your randomization well in terms of like there are 50 and 50 in the strata or whatever.

591
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:10,930
However, everybody in this one strata stopped taking the treatment or fell out of the out of the trial.

592
01:04:11,230 --> 01:04:16,990
Then all of a sudden. That prognostic covariate could be associated with the treatment.

593
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:20,290
Right. And so now there's a problem and you have some inefficiencies.

594
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:25,910
So it definitely this is definitely the case for linear regression.

595
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:30,090
It's actually a little bit different once you have binary or type two event outcomes.

596
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:37,290
So for binary outcomes, adding covariates actually always increases the variance of the treatment effect.

597
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:41,970
But you could have slightly less biased treatment effect estimates.

598
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:49,080
And so there is a paper on that. And then it's kind of similar for time to event outcomes such that you're.

599
01:04:50,710 --> 01:04:54,400
Estimate could be less precise, but a less biased.

600
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:03,040
So what do we recommend? So we recommend that before you actually run a trial, you say exactly what you're going to do.

601
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:06,610
And that's all done in this document called the protocol.

602
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:08,350
And we'll talk more about the protocol.

603
01:05:08,350 --> 01:05:16,510
But the protocol, you state your hypotheses and then you state your sample size and you state exactly how you're going to analyze the data.

604
01:05:18,310 --> 01:05:21,760
You also state how you're going to randomize the patients.

605
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:28,660
And so you'd say, you know, I'm using computed block randomization or I'm using simple randomization and I'm stratifying on these variables.

606
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:38,020
And if you're stratifying, you should only stratify on a few very strong prognostic variables if you're doing a multicenter trial.

607
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:43,989
We almost always stratify on the center, so once your trial is across multiple locations,

608
01:05:43,990 --> 01:05:50,680
that's automatically a stratification variable because there are lots of different potential confounding factors

609
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:56,469
associated with that sites and how it treats patients that while we're hoping it's the same for the trial,

610
01:05:56,470 --> 01:06:01,540
it might not be. And the and the patient not only how they treat the patients, but the patients that come into that site.

611
01:06:02,110 --> 01:06:05,200
Right. So we want we want balance at each site.

612
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:09,790
We don't want to add covariates only to improve precision.

613
01:06:09,790 --> 01:06:15,130
We want them to be scientifically justified. Right. So we can't just be like robot statisticians.

614
01:06:15,460 --> 01:06:22,150
We actually have to be scientists that are working with the clinicians that say, okay, well, what what is associated with outcome?

615
01:06:22,150 --> 01:06:24,850
What have others found? What is important to control for here?

616
01:06:26,770 --> 01:06:33,370
And actually, if there are imbalances based on the randomization or for whatever reason you can,

617
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:37,990
it's statistically acceptable to ignore these because they occurred by chance.

618
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:43,540
Right. But once if we know that it wasn't just chance, right.

619
01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:46,899
It wasn't just that our randomization something happened funny in the randomization list.

620
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:53,400
It was actually because somebody stopped coming or whatever.

621
01:06:53,410 --> 01:06:56,530
Some, some non some informative messiness. Right.

622
01:06:56,530 --> 01:07:01,870
You can't ignore those. But if it was really just that the randomization list wasn't perfectly balanced, that's okay.

623
01:07:02,180 --> 01:07:05,860
Right? We can ignore that. But other people might think that it still looks bad.

624
01:07:06,010 --> 01:07:12,700
Yeah. So if you had strong reason to believe that there was a prognostic covariate,

625
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:19,899
but you also similarly believe that you don't necessarily need to do stratified randomization because

626
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:23,950
maybe you just like have a large enough sample size that you think it's going to be balanced regardless.

627
01:07:24,430 --> 01:07:29,259
Do you still need to do that sort of stratification to get the benefit of adjusting for that?

628
01:07:29,260 --> 01:07:32,920
COVARIANCE Yeah, it usually still would. You don't have to, but usually you still would.

629
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:41,260
Okay. So generally in randomization we use randomization.

630
01:07:41,830 --> 01:07:45,460
It helps us make the causal claims that we have this internal validity.

631
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:54,219
It allows for us to say that there is a balance across the groups and there's no unmeasured confounding,

632
01:07:54,220 --> 01:07:57,730
but it cannot address the external validity issues.

633
01:07:57,730 --> 01:08:00,400
Right. That's where we need the random sample.

634
01:08:02,450 --> 01:08:07,790
Restricted randomization can be used to encourage balance between treatment groups or restricted randomization,

635
01:08:07,790 --> 01:08:12,439
meaning like minimization or playing the winner or whatever.

636
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:18,080
Right? We can use one of those types of randomization because we're really trying to bias coin to balance the groups.

637
01:08:18,980 --> 01:08:24,680
And these imbalances are likely to go away with large sample size.

638
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:29,659
However, bias due to confounding right doesn't go away with large sample size.

639
01:08:29,660 --> 01:08:35,290
So if there is a selection bias issue, just because you have more people isn't going to make that go away.

640
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:46,160
There could always be the selection bias issue. When we're analyzing the data, usually the main analysis is really simple.

641
01:08:46,490 --> 01:08:52,610
So for example, if we have a continuous outcome and we have two treatment groups often that the main

642
01:08:52,610 --> 01:08:56,900
primary analysis might say like we're just going to do a T test between the groups.

643
01:08:57,290 --> 01:09:01,970
However, this and that's how we would use like in a sample size formula to figure out the sample size.

644
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:08,959
But then usually there's always a more rigorous secondary analysis, which would include any of the covariates,

645
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:14,150
any stratification variables and or any other prognostic variable in the model.

646
01:09:15,950 --> 01:09:21,529
There are potential deviations, as we've already talked about, that can mess up randomization.

647
01:09:21,530 --> 01:09:26,200
So we randomize everybody, but then a participant can accidentally get the wrong treatment.

648
01:09:26,210 --> 01:09:32,690
So sometimes there happens to be issues or errors with the pharmacy getting the treatment to the right person.

649
01:09:33,050 --> 01:09:36,220
The person could say, no, no thank you. I no longer want to be involved.

650
01:09:36,230 --> 01:09:40,100
The person could not adhere to the treatment.

651
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:45,590
They could stop coming to the follow ups and just be lost to follow up.

652
01:09:45,950 --> 01:09:49,609
They could, you know, die during this.

653
01:09:49,610 --> 01:09:51,200
And so we don't have their information.

654
01:09:51,530 --> 01:09:56,870
And so there are lots of different ways in which they're not following the protocol in the way that they should.

655
01:09:56,900 --> 01:10:00,410
Right. They're not taking the treatment the way that they should for the length of time that they should.

656
01:10:00,410 --> 01:10:08,780
We're not getting the data that we should. And so the question is then, for example, say somebody was randomized to get treatment,

657
01:10:09,710 --> 01:10:13,190
but they stopped taking treatment and found some way to get treatment.

658
01:10:13,190 --> 01:10:16,100
B Or they just stopped taking treatment, ect. Right.

659
01:10:16,310 --> 01:10:23,300
So do we analyze that participant and we know that do we analyze that participant as if they had treatment at the whole time?

660
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:29,440
Do we analyze that participant in the time that they got that they got a and then that they got something else later?

661
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:32,990
Or do we exclude them or do we say that they got B, how do we actually analyze that data?

662
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:39,950
Right. So the question is, do we analyze it using the randomized assignment or the treatment they actually received?

663
01:10:41,540 --> 01:10:45,650
So for this one, I will use a date because it's not as difficult, I think.

664
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:55,549
So say we have some outcome now I'm calling it oh instead of y and remember we're interested in this average treatment effect.

665
01:10:55,550 --> 01:11:05,240
The average treatment causal factor is that expected outcome of the the expected outcome under a minus, the expected outcome under B.

666
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:10,370
And we want to equate this to as if like everyone got A and B right, and we saw the treatment difference.

667
01:11:10,370 --> 01:11:15,830
And everyone remember, we use potential outcomes to say that this occurred under the under some assumptions.

668
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:22,190
So suppose there's no treatment outcome association treatment doesn't make a difference, right?

669
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:33,800
The treatment is not effective. Then if they actually received the treatment, the treatment randomized was the treatment actually received.

670
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:43,239
Does it matter if we choose the treatment received or the treatment randomized rate the treatment actually received or the treatment randomized?

671
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:47,860
The TR is the randomized. So if we take a look at this, right,

672
01:11:47,860 --> 01:11:53,439
this I can rewrite these equations by just putting in well this is the actual treatment

673
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:58,590
T and this is the treatment randomized and it's the t i equals the tr right.

674
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:01,600
Doesn't matter. This is the same thing and it's zero, right?

675
01:12:01,620 --> 01:12:05,049
And if there is no association, then there's no difference.

676
01:12:05,050 --> 01:12:13,240
And it doesn't matter which one I do there. Now, suppose there's still no treatment outcome association.

677
01:12:13,810 --> 01:12:18,580
Right. But there's this treatment doesn't have an effect in effective treatment.

678
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:24,370
But now assume that like we have that patient that should have gotten A, but they got B, okay,

679
01:12:24,370 --> 01:12:30,640
or they had A for a little bit and then they got B so the treatment they were randomized to differs from the treatment that they actually received.

680
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:40,060
If I think if I try to figure these out right, this is the treatment that this type is the treatment they actually received.

681
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:50,620
Right? And if there's there's a potential confounder that's associated with the treatment that they actually received and the outcome right now,

682
01:12:50,620 --> 01:12:54,850
all of a sudden, if I look under that treatment, actually received right.

683
01:12:55,030 --> 01:12:59,500
My expected outcomes associate rate. It depends on this confounder.

684
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:07,870
Now for the treatment actually received a randomized to write this.

685
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:13,219
This confounder is acting on the treatment.

686
01:13:13,220 --> 01:13:16,760
Randomize. So, so here. Sorry, let me start over here.

687
01:13:16,820 --> 01:13:20,390
So if I look under here, right, the treatment they actually received,

688
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:27,680
the confounders acting on the treatment, if they got it, they're supposed to get A, but they got B, right?

689
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:32,059
This is going to be different. They they didn't actually get what they're supposed to get.

690
01:13:32,060 --> 01:13:34,850
This this confounders working in different way.

691
01:13:34,850 --> 01:13:43,730
If I look under this and what they actually were randomized to and I consider this that there's actually no association between treatment and outcome,

692
01:13:44,150 --> 01:13:50,270
then this actually equals zero. So if I take the difference under the randomization, it's zero.

693
01:13:50,270 --> 01:13:56,150
But if I take the the difference under the actually received, it's not actually zero.

694
01:13:56,390 --> 01:14:03,170
And so now we have a problem that what should have happened that there is no difference in these treatments, right?

695
01:14:03,170 --> 01:14:10,190
That if I randomize that there's no reason why right there balance across everybody and I see

696
01:14:10,190 --> 01:14:14,540
that there's no actual treatment difference versus now all of a sudden somebody made it,

697
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:19,850
somebody made a decision that they weren't doing that or they actually got the wrong thing right.

698
01:14:19,850 --> 01:14:22,490
There's potentially this treatment difference.

699
01:14:23,030 --> 01:14:29,780
And so there's this issue that I have to be really careful in the way that I analyze the data right now.

700
01:14:29,780 --> 01:14:34,219
Figuring out if I use their actual treatment received versus their treatment

701
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:38,720
randomized is going to make a difference in the treatment effect that I get.

702
01:14:38,750 --> 01:14:41,330
I have to be very careful in the way that I analyze the data.

703
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:50,690
So if you read clinical trial literature, what you'll almost always see is that the primary analysis is what we call an intent to treat analysis.

704
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:56,510
So that means that we intended to treat with them with what we randomize them to.

705
01:14:56,780 --> 01:15:00,320
And I don't care what actually happened to them or what they not.

706
01:15:00,350 --> 01:15:06,350
I don't care what they actually did. I'm going to pretend like they had what I randomized them to because that's where.

707
01:15:06,830 --> 01:15:11,209
Right. That assumptions of randomization, that balance occurs.

708
01:15:11,210 --> 01:15:14,630
Now all of a sudden they're not under my a bucket. Right.

709
01:15:14,750 --> 01:15:23,930
There's this, this potential imbalance between all those unmeasured confounders or prognostic factors between my for to my patients and A

710
01:15:23,930 --> 01:15:32,210
and B and so I need them to stay in that that bucket over there in A because that's what helps my balance in randomization.

711
01:15:32,540 --> 01:15:43,730
And so to ensure that the effect right that randomization that all the good the all of the advantage of randomization is taken accounted for.

712
01:15:44,180 --> 01:15:47,870
I need to analyze the data as if they got what they were randomized to.

713
01:15:48,590 --> 01:15:50,810
And essentially what we're saying is when I do that,

714
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:58,070
anybody what we hope is anybody that didn't do it over here right there is the same kind of people that didn't do it over here.

715
01:15:58,550 --> 01:15:58,820
Right?

716
01:15:58,820 --> 01:16:11,150
So that there is essentially balance between these possible issues of withdrawing or not sharing across the treatments in some sort of balanced way.

717
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:16,100
So the intent to treat analysis is, again,

718
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:22,040
just going to say you were randomized to a even if I know you didn't take a the way you should have or you got be,

719
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:31,370
I'm analyzing you as if you got a this as treated analysis is to say okay you randomized to a but you took these so

720
01:16:31,370 --> 01:16:36,100
I guess I'm going to change you to a B that's going to have an effects that can undo the effects of randomization.

721
01:16:36,140 --> 01:16:43,760
It takes away the advantages of the randomization in that internal validity because now I don't necessarily have the balance between arms.

722
01:16:47,450 --> 01:16:52,760
So what are we actually testing or what's the treatment effects that we actually get?

723
01:16:53,420 --> 01:16:58,070
It's really that we're testing for the effects of being a randomized to a treatment.

724
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:02,240
It's not actually testing the effect of that specific treatment.

725
01:17:02,540 --> 01:17:05,150
I mean, hopefully it is, right. Hopefully they're the same thing.

726
01:17:05,540 --> 01:17:13,279
Hopefully there's not that many people who don't actually take that treatment or, you know, take something else or whatever.

727
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:19,130
Hopefully that's very small. So hopefully these things are the same. But if we get really technical about it,

728
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:24,740
what we're analyzing in the clinical trial with an intent to treat analysis is that

729
01:17:25,010 --> 01:17:29,720
the effect of being randomized to a versus the effects of being randomized to be.

730
01:17:32,110 --> 01:17:41,349
And so we'll talk more about the intensive treat analysis, the Wall Street analysis and what's called a per protocol analysis in the next lecture.

731
01:17:41,350 --> 01:17:46,420
And there is a nice little YouTube video that I think explains it very, very well.

732
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:57,430
Okay. So that's it for today. I think your next homework is do it in a couple of weeks, but just check it.

733
01:17:57,430 --> 01:18:03,070
Make sure you have a great break and I will see you next Thursday.

734
01:18:05,980 --> 01:18:31,490
And I'm like, okay, guys, this is not so bad.

735
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:51,700
I felt like I was actually much appreciated by the Senate, just like we have our nights in the trailer.

736
01:18:52,180 --> 01:19:09,350
Yeah. And so I think you guys know my way out here.

737
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:25,750
I help you around, like, seven or the closest bathroom so I can do you all right.

738
01:19:26,290 --> 01:19:36,400
But I. Over dinner, actually, I don't really know what she said, so I would be dancing.

739
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:40,090
Okay. All right. I'll make sure you have any other plans.

740
01:19:41,230 --> 01:20:09,490
Okay. Not to mention, I told him you can actually use one objects and they are all the same.

741
01:20:10,340 --> 01:20:19,000
We would start using them on PyTorch Georgia to show a Pythagorean categorical.

742
01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:23,400
To such a high institution. I you because.

743
01:20:26,170 --> 01:20:30,700
Just one call for more than one survival.

744
01:20:30,790 --> 01:20:34,720
Unusual lock on Jenkins eyes.

745
01:20:35,680 --> 01:20:41,280
Could you tell how capable. These are paid to do without.

746
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:48,420
So I would challenge talking the New York.

747
01:20:49,490 --> 01:21:01,690
New York City enormously. Frankly, I love how all the discussion and discussion could hold or unity about.

748
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:09,460
You got some musicians? Oh, Kate, you auditioning again?

749
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:13,730
Yeah. Look how you are, how we are.

750
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:18,950
So what you guys are? It's music. Do I play it for you?

751
01:21:19,470 --> 01:21:23,280
Well, we all heard a lot about what they thought, what they think they were.

752
01:21:25,010 --> 01:21:28,470
This is how they.

753
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:40,740
Just so you know, I just don't think you should go without your time at all.

754
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:57,360
So to have had never got to see this piece of [INAUDIBLE], you know, because it was so hard to find.

755
01:21:59,010 --> 01:22:03,990
So, yeah, I would argue you.

756
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:13,230
So what I do is we obviously sort of push our equipment down.

757
01:22:13,620 --> 01:22:17,890
I hope it's you, but I think we have to do that.

758
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:30,800
That have to sit still for a long time.

759
01:22:31,950 --> 01:22:36,210
Oh. Oh, no.

760
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:48,150
You look like. Where he.

761
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:30,280
No. I.

762
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:32,100
I think. I.

763
01:28:55,140 --> 01:28:57,630
But you have a very.
