1
00:00:02,227 --> 00:00:04,237
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Maybe.

2
00:00:04,237 --> 00:00:10,537
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Maybe we can get started, it would be lovely if.

3
00:00:10,537 --> 00:00:15,517
Sharon Reilly Kardia: We could maybe here in the.

4
00:00:15,517 --> 00:00:19,717
Sharon Reilly Kardia: chat or.

5
00:00:19,717 --> 00:00:22,417
Sharon Reilly Kardia: You know, ways in which.

6
00:00:22,417 --> 00:00:32,887
Sharon Reilly Kardia: You know kind of running the remote sections have been a challenge, or you anticipate being a challenge because.

7
00:00:32,887 --> 00:00:51,487
Sharon Reilly Kardia: We, we have a couple of different kinds of scenarios, we have some faculty that are teaching in a class in person, and they have just a couple of students that are remote because of their particular.

8
00:00:51,487 --> 00:01:08,377
Sharon Reilly Kardia: situation, whether or not there's a medical issue or, for instance, a visa issue, but by and large, most students are are on campus coming to classes and we have a small numbers that are in remote sections.

9
00:01:08,377 --> 00:01:11,737
Sharon Reilly Kardia: versus some where.

10
00:01:11,737 --> 00:01:16,927
Sharon Reilly Kardia: there's many more students that are.

11
00:01:16,927 --> 00:01:31,117
Sharon Reilly Kardia: let's say having to take a fully remote class Those are two different scenarios so it'd be lovely if I could hear what.

12
00:01:31,117 --> 00:01:47,107
Sharon Reilly Kardia: where people are are you teaching a fully remote class or are you trying to think through how to handle a small number of remote students.

13
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:57,097
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Like Maria is having some technical difficulties I was having technical difficulty yesterday so i'm deeply appreciative of the patience.

14
00:01:57,097 --> 00:02:07,237
Danielle Stone: Since since she can join um I thought that i'll speak for the both of us were teaching for a coursera course so it's fully online.

15
00:02:07,237 --> 00:02:12,367
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Fully online okay.

16
00:02:12,367 --> 00:02:16,777
Sharon Reilly Kardia: So.

17
00:02:16,777 --> 00:02:30,457
Sharon Reilly Kardia: we've got one fully online linda's fully online with one student participating from South Korea okay great there's a little bit of a time challenge because that's nearly opposite.

18
00:02:30,457 --> 00:02:36,607
Sharon Reilly Kardia: um I think it's like a 12 hour delay or.

19
00:02:36,607 --> 00:02:43,807
Sharon Reilly Kardia: ahead of time i'm.

20
00:02:43,807 --> 00:02:50,767
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Maya or Rachel Do you know what your situation is whether or not you are.

21
00:02:50,767 --> 00:03:02,827
Sharon Reilly Kardia: interested in understanding more about sort of the fully remote or just handling a few students.

22
00:03:02,827 --> 00:03:07,567
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Maybe maybe not a few remote okay.

23
00:03:07,567 --> 00:03:09,307
Frederique Laubepin: same thing for me, I think.

24
00:03:09,307 --> 00:03:11,707
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Okay okay.

25
00:03:11,707 --> 00:03:33,697
Sharon Reilly Kardia: So that's probably the easiest place for us to start and then i'll sort of pivot to the the fully remote, so a few remote students what we're talking about in terms of the learning challenge is that.

26
00:03:33,697 --> 00:03:37,507
Sharon Reilly Kardia: We are recording Murray so.

27
00:03:37,507 --> 00:03:42,637
Sharon Reilly Kardia: it's it's always good to have a little backup and we're trying to make sure we have that.

28
00:03:42,637 --> 00:03:52,087
Sharon Reilly Kardia: So the first thing that's a great pivot for those that have just a few remote students or teaching remote everybody should be recording their zoom sessions.

29
00:03:52,087 --> 00:04:06,757
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Or, for instance, if there's an in person class there, so there should be a recording of that session, to the best of your abilities and so the number one thing that we have.

30
00:04:06,757 --> 00:04:25,837
Sharon Reilly Kardia: If we're in a classroom is pinup dough, and so we are asking for everybody to be knowledgeable about how to start and stop Panopticon if they're in a classroom and to make sure that those are automatically hooked up it's relatively.

31
00:04:25,837 --> 00:04:37,657
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Straightforward but hooked up with the canvas site, so that when they are recorded, they are connected to the course site.

32
00:04:37,657 --> 00:04:52,957
Sharon Reilly Kardia: that's kind of the most important, if you think about it way in which students that are remote for an in person class will get the information that's in the lecture there's really no other way to do that.

33
00:04:52,957 --> 00:05:10,117
Sharon Reilly Kardia: So that's pretty essential, and if you have not had practice at it um we have you know great instructional support jonah's on here from instructional services.

34
00:05:10,117 --> 00:05:15,757
Sharon Reilly Kardia: But other people like matt.

35
00:05:15,757 --> 00:05:25,027
Sharon Reilly Kardia: binder, who is also helping on the classroom services can help, and we would be happy to help anybody so recording.

36
00:05:25,027 --> 00:05:43,867
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Second thing for having just a few remote students is setting up a time to touch base with them every single week with the expectation that they are showing up to that session and that they're coming prepared.

37
00:05:43,867 --> 00:05:58,237
Sharon Reilly Kardia: With having watched the lecture having attempted or understood what are the assignments, and then you as either GSA is our instructors are meeting them with that same kind of expectation.

38
00:05:58,237 --> 00:06:13,957
Sharon Reilly Kardia: So it's not your typical office hours, where let's say a faculty or GS is kind of waiting for people with questions, we really do need to make a more active link to these remote students and even if it's just a short.

39
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:19,267
Sharon Reilly Kardia: outline of okay this, these are the topics for.

40
00:06:19,267 --> 00:06:31,507
Sharon Reilly Kardia: This week and there's an assignment do on Wednesday tell me what you got from the lecture so it's a little bit more of quizzing them or a little bit more of engaging them.

41
00:06:31,507 --> 00:06:50,497
Sharon Reilly Kardia: And having the assignment or the study sheets for an exam or whatever it is, at the ready and prompting them to actually demonstrate that they are up to speed to start the conversation and.

42
00:06:50,497 --> 00:07:01,837
Sharon Reilly Kardia: We are not expecting you to lecture an office hours or to try to reproduce what was happening in the class, but there should be an attention to.

43
00:07:01,837 --> 00:07:17,467
Sharon Reilly Kardia: A call it learning reinforcement so going through key topics going through problem areas that you know are tough for students and really you know moving towards a.

44
00:07:17,467 --> 00:07:22,627
Sharon Reilly Kardia: A deeper dialogue on the material to make sure that.

45
00:07:22,627 --> 00:07:25,297
Sharon Reilly Kardia: They have some kind of command on it.

46
00:07:25,297 --> 00:07:27,877
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Because.

47
00:07:27,877 --> 00:07:38,827
Sharon Reilly Kardia: we're not courses devised for remote or online, it has a bunch of supports to it that are in person classes don't have.

48
00:07:38,827 --> 00:07:48,607
Sharon Reilly Kardia: So we have to actually create those bridges in the remote office hours.

49
00:07:48,607 --> 00:07:57,517
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Anything else on the case where there will be just a few remote students.

50
00:07:57,517 --> 00:08:10,897
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Making sure that it's at a time that they can make is important, making sure that they know it's expected of them to show up like they would show up for class.

51
00:08:10,897 --> 00:08:24,127
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Because our material in our classes moves pretty fast easy to get behind, if you think about the number of challenges that a student is navigating remote.

52
00:08:24,127 --> 00:08:39,667
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Then they fall behind then it's going to affect to their success in the class so we're trying to be public health minded get in front of it be proactive be preventative so if if you think.

53
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:56,737
Sharon Reilly Kardia: A little bit like the public health mindset now from a teaching point of view that might be a way to help you think through what's needed.

54
00:08:56,737 --> 00:09:03,427
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Any other kind of questions i'll let.

55
00:09:03,427 --> 00:09:07,447
Sharon Reilly Kardia: i'll let the sort of chat.

56
00:09:07,447 --> 00:09:15,877
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Just kind of be open, if something occurs to you and i'm going to shift now to the fully remote.

57
00:09:15,877 --> 00:09:18,547
Sharon Reilly Kardia: The way in which.

58
00:09:18,547 --> 00:09:36,067
Sharon Reilly Kardia: we've found the fully remote classes to work, the best is for the zoom sessions to have a choreography that is laid out ahead of time with a kind of.

59
00:09:36,067 --> 00:09:54,487
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Balance of a little bit of recap, you know, maybe five or 10 minutes to get people oriented to the material again but there really should be an expectation that they are doing work before that zoom session.

60
00:09:54,487 --> 00:10:11,977
Sharon Reilly Kardia: In that kind of next part of a zoom session having it be reflecting either discussion questions that have come up in a canvas site or have been prompted in slack.

61
00:10:11,977 --> 00:10:17,707
Sharon Reilly Kardia: We highly recommend using slack as a way to.

62
00:10:17,707 --> 00:10:30,007
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Have students communicate a call it in real time what difficulties they're having with the material.

63
00:10:30,007 --> 00:10:34,957
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Murray i'm hoping that you have already.

64
00:10:34,957 --> 00:10:40,267
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Use slack or maybe you need to reach out to Lisa garber.

65
00:10:40,267 --> 00:11:01,777
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Linda chatters I had never ever used anything like it until last winter, but slack actually is a really nice platform for communication with students and they are very deeply appreciative that they can voice their questions and they're.

66
00:11:01,777 --> 00:11:23,377
Sharon Reilly Kardia: called quandaries when they hit certain pieces of readings or assignments, or even the schedule and get real time feedback from either their peers or from you in a forum that allows you to kind of answer everybody, at the same time.

67
00:11:23,377 --> 00:11:25,357
Sharon Reilly Kardia: So.

68
00:11:25,357 --> 00:11:50,167
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Why, I bring this up is that if we're using zoom as a platform for connection to students, that means that we have to hardwire the ways in which some of the basics are taken care of and.

69
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:53,407
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Murray, has entered the building.

70
00:11:53,407 --> 00:11:56,767
Marie Sylvia O'Neill: Murray, has an I think that can you hear me.

71
00:11:56,767 --> 00:12:10,417
Marie Sylvia O'Neill: Yes, okay sorry about that that was my phone hanging up, but I am glad to be here and thank you and I do I, I was on the orientation last night, and I will contact Lisa about slack ASAP.

72
00:12:10,417 --> 00:12:13,357
Sharon Reilly Kardia: fabulous fabulous.

73
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:22,537
Sharon Reilly Kardia: yeah I was sorry to miss that orientation, but it was one of the sort of like we've been having Internet issues from the mainland anyway um.

74
00:12:22,537 --> 00:12:24,637
Sharon Reilly Kardia: So a little bit of getting people up to.

75
00:12:24,637 --> 00:12:27,157
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Speed making sure that.

76
00:12:27,157 --> 00:12:37,417
Sharon Reilly Kardia: The key questions are addressed so that it doesn't stop people from moving to the next level and then another thing is putting some kind of.

77
00:12:37,417 --> 00:12:55,987
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Active learning inside of the zoom session so one of the things that i've loved to do is to use like Google slides give people access to those Google slides and have a slide for every breakout room.

78
00:12:55,987 --> 00:13:09,337
Sharon Reilly Kardia: So that when I give them an exercise like calculate and interpret this or what are you know, three ways to prevent that.

79
00:13:09,337 --> 00:13:25,237
Sharon Reilly Kardia: They are given the key question moved into breakout groups but they're all are actually doing the work on the Google slides a single Google slide deck so I can see my eight.

80
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:44,317
Sharon Reilly Kardia: or 10 breakout session groups all at one time looking at the slides, and I can see which ones are moving ahead well and which ones seem to be stalling and so that I can go into the breakout room and asked hey what's.

81
00:13:44,317 --> 00:14:08,857
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Your current you know thinking on this, and where are you stuck and then go back to the Google slide deck and see who else is stuck and then keep doing that, but having them actually test whether or not they know something rather than saying that they know it is a big learning.

82
00:14:08,857 --> 00:14:24,307
Sharon Reilly Kardia: A call an indicator so many of us listen passively and think that we know something, but then, when asked to actively use that information we're just like oh boy I have no idea.

83
00:14:24,307 --> 00:14:27,877
Sharon Reilly Kardia: um.

84
00:14:27,877 --> 00:14:34,867
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Another thing I see in the chat What are the options to run polls during lectures.

85
00:14:34,867 --> 00:14:49,357
Sharon Reilly Kardia: For in person lectures, with some remote students, that is something that it's easy to zoom to run a simple poll or to use poll everywhere.

86
00:14:49,357 --> 00:14:56,257
Sharon Reilly Kardia: And in in person classes poll everywhere, can also be used.

87
00:14:56,257 --> 00:15:17,227
Sharon Reilly Kardia: But i'm not exactly sure you would it would translate well to a remote small section, because of the way in which, if you only have two or three people in a remote section that polling doesn't have the same kind of.

88
00:15:17,227 --> 00:15:19,717
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Call group.

89
00:15:19,717 --> 00:15:27,547
Sharon Reilly Kardia: registering of what's going on, you would probably be better off just saying okay there's three or four you in this.

90
00:15:27,547 --> 00:15:42,277
Sharon Reilly Kardia: These office hours here's the question that we used in the in person and, what is your response so that it's.

91
00:15:42,277 --> 00:16:06,457
Sharon Reilly Kardia: it's relatively personalized in that case, and one of the one of the reasons we thought we should have this kind of workshop is that it does depend its context dependent, whether or not it's an in person class with a small remote or it's a fully remote class.

92
00:16:06,457 --> 00:16:08,407
Sharon Reilly Kardia: alright.

93
00:16:08,407 --> 00:16:19,687
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Another big thing that the zoom sessions are really important, that is just highlighting the timeline of the class reminding people hey this is do.

94
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:35,887
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Here and we're getting ready to transition to the next section it's that piece that gives kind of clarity and vision of what's coming down the road, so I always have a portion of this kind of what's in the future.

95
00:16:35,887 --> 00:16:43,987
Sharon Reilly Kardia: that people should be paying attention to typically in the beginning, and a little bit at the end of that zoom session.

96
00:16:43,987 --> 00:16:52,387
Sharon Reilly Kardia: i'm giving the students, the ability to actually have the same material that.

97
00:16:52,387 --> 00:17:04,267
Sharon Reilly Kardia: is recorded in some kind of other forum so Google slides Google docs anything that would allow them to have another sort of piece of the scaffold towards.

98
00:17:04,267 --> 00:17:18,397
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Remembering mean you guys are all right now just either headshots or names and and, for instance, I have no idea whether or not.

99
00:17:18,397 --> 00:17:43,777
Sharon Reilly Kardia: You are sleeping or doing the dishes or whatever, and our attention wanders when we are not a call it actively sinking in, and you can expect that also of your students so thinking structurally about what can they after the zoom session still have.

100
00:17:43,777 --> 00:17:55,327
Sharon Reilly Kardia: To help them kind of move more quickly towards a high quality experience of material of you as a teacher.

101
00:17:55,327 --> 00:17:56,857
Sharon Reilly Kardia: and

102
00:17:56,857 --> 00:18:01,147
Sharon Reilly Kardia: You know, teaching is an art.

103
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:18,517
Sharon Reilly Kardia: The ability to see where people are stuck in getting a concept getting a skill, or you know what's the level of practice that needs to happen, or what is extended context.

104
00:18:18,517 --> 00:18:28,957
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Only can be kind of gleaned in the back and forth, so you want to figure out ways to get that back and forth.

105
00:18:28,957 --> 00:18:54,547
Sharon Reilly Kardia: The chat is super important in any remote section, but you also could use a Google Doc that is in the chat where people are putting their questions and answers, so that you have something from session to session and it's just being mindful, to add that.

106
00:18:54,547 --> 00:19:09,007
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Each time there's a zoom session or reminding people of where it is a lot more a call it tending to the the structural components.

107
00:19:09,007 --> 00:19:12,487
Sharon Reilly Kardia: um.

108
00:19:12,487 --> 00:19:16,147
Sharon Reilly Kardia: What else.

109
00:19:16,147 --> 00:19:17,137
Marie Sylvia O'Neill: Sharon.

110
00:19:17,137 --> 00:19:19,927
Marie Sylvia O'Neill: Do you recommend.

111
00:19:19,927 --> 00:19:28,327
Marie Sylvia O'Neill: I was very intrigued by the Google slides do you recommend like I think i'd like to structure the 512.

112
00:19:28,327 --> 00:19:41,797
Marie Sylvia O'Neill: zoom sessions, with each group having a slide but are you kind of saying to have the same thing, or do you recommend like a word Doc where people can populate it with.

113
00:19:41,797 --> 00:19:56,317
Marie Sylvia O'Neill: questions, I just want to keep things simple already in the orientation people seem confused about slack and canvas and you know yellow dig so I just would love to hear a recommendation on.

114
00:19:56,317 --> 00:19:56,887
Marie Sylvia O'Neill: yeah.

115
00:19:56,887 --> 00:20:01,087
Marie Sylvia O'Neill: Google slides versus were to Google Doc.

116
00:20:01,087 --> 00:20:05,167
Sharon Reilly Kardia: yeah so the reason that I like the slides.

117
00:20:05,167 --> 00:20:18,337
Sharon Reilly Kardia: better than the Google Doc is that the slides have a kind of boundary to them so Google docs are kind of never ending they have no bottom.

118
00:20:18,337 --> 00:20:28,657
Sharon Reilly Kardia: And what I have been using them for is to be very specific like breakout session one here's the task.

119
00:20:28,657 --> 00:20:42,337
Sharon Reilly Kardia: here's the background information, and it may be a link to a paper or maybe a link to a website and then i'll have the next slide be breakout room ones response.

120
00:20:42,337 --> 00:20:53,317
Sharon Reilly Kardia: The next slide breakout room tues response and i'll show them before we go into breakout rooms hey This is where you're supposed to put your response.

121
00:20:53,317 --> 00:21:11,797
Sharon Reilly Kardia: And that way, even after the session has ended that Google slide deck has the call it space where breakout session one was and each of the rooms.

122
00:21:11,797 --> 00:21:24,487
Sharon Reilly Kardia: And that, for me it just helps me to understand how many people never even got to putting their answer in the Google slides they never got the answer.

123
00:21:24,487 --> 00:21:26,947
Sharon Reilly Kardia: And the word Doc is.

124
00:21:26,947 --> 00:21:30,367
Sharon Reilly Kardia: It doesn't have as many.

125
00:21:30,367 --> 00:21:39,097
Sharon Reilly Kardia: A call it easy to understand boundaries, where I would be able to see where breakout Room one was in breakout room for was.

126
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:46,867
Sharon Reilly Kardia: You see the difference, maybe I should show you an example.

127
00:21:46,867 --> 00:21:55,777
Marie Sylvia O'Neill: It makes sense to me, but if others are interested, maybe an example would be good, so okay.

128
00:21:55,777 --> 00:21:58,117
Sharon Reilly Kardia: i'm.

129
00:21:58,117 --> 00:22:21,757
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Sorry just relatively easy for me to get an example.

130
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:24,007
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Okay.

131
00:22:24,007 --> 00:22:27,247
Sharon Reilly Kardia: So.

132
00:22:27,247 --> 00:47:48,639
Sharon Reilly Kardia: So I teach public health 515 on population health and so this is my Google slide deck as i'm.

133
00:22:36,487 --> 00:22:47,707
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Moving through kind of what's the agenda it's nice to have an agenda, this is the very first class so i'm like what do I expect a little bit of housekeeping.

134
00:22:47,707 --> 00:23:04,267
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Some question some things about questions and what I like I love questions, this is the future looking, what can you can expect when are the assignments due to today's zoom or.

135
00:23:04,267 --> 00:23:06,787
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Then, this is my.

136
00:23:06,787 --> 00:23:15,217
Marie Sylvia O'Neill: response to be seen, slides because I can't see anything.

137
00:23:15,217 --> 00:23:16,687
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Yes, yes, you are looks like.

138
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:19,717
Sharon Reilly Kardia: It says that I am screen sharing.

139
00:23:19,717 --> 00:23:21,787
Joanna Kovacevich: i'm seeing slides here.

140
00:23:21,787 --> 00:23:25,807
Sharon Reilly Kardia: I need to okay.

141
00:23:25,807 --> 00:23:29,617
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Okay, so Marie.

142
00:23:29,617 --> 00:23:32,617
Marie Sylvia O'Neill: I see them now Yes indeed, thank you.

143
00:23:32,617 --> 00:23:34,057
Okay.

144
00:23:34,057 --> 00:23:35,317
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Okay.

145
00:23:35,317 --> 00:23:57,727
Sharon Reilly Kardia: And I can send you this as a copy right, so you could actually look look at this, because all I did was go through you know what was the the pieces to get me started and, probably, you know the seven or eight slides took me about 10 or 15 minutes right.

146
00:23:57,727 --> 00:24:10,387
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Then there were some questions from slack and I pulled them right in and you'll notice the difference in the font even because I just copied and pasted and.

147
00:24:10,387 --> 00:24:26,617
Sharon Reilly Kardia: I gave them a Google folder for the work that we were going to do in the zoom session and so everybody's you know got access to the slides I put that in the chat then they have.

148
00:24:26,617 --> 00:24:44,977
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Now, access to the Google folder and we were working on an example from type two diabetes, what are we trying to prevent and who, and I had given them some papers and I had given everybody a table.

149
00:24:44,977 --> 00:24:59,857
Sharon Reilly Kardia: What was the primary, secondary and tertiary prevention, and this is what group one group to group three group for group five group six had put in that table.

150
00:24:59,857 --> 00:25:12,007
Sharon Reilly Kardia: So that's what I had sort of set out as the kind of work that they were doing and in the.

151
00:25:12,007 --> 00:25:15,187
Sharon Reilly Kardia: In the Google folder.

152
00:25:15,187 --> 00:25:23,767
Sharon Reilly Kardia: There were these papers that they could access and these papers were assigned readings.

153
00:25:23,767 --> 00:25:27,607
Sharon Reilly Kardia: So we had talked through okay.

154
00:25:27,607 --> 00:47:48,639
Sharon Reilly Kardia: What, what do you need in order to do the assignment that was coming up.

155
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:45,487
Sharon Reilly Kardia: The zoom breakout rooms were actually like the very first question of that assignment.

156
00:25:45,487 --> 00:25:56,287
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Just it was getting people up using the language, using the literature, because that was the job of the very first assignment in week one.

157
00:25:56,287 --> 00:25:59,017
Sharon Reilly Kardia: So.

158
00:25:59,017 --> 00:26:07,267
Sharon Reilly Kardia: And they all had you know basically a good time filling in the table.

159
00:26:07,267 --> 00:26:18,157
Sharon Reilly Kardia: But not all of them filled it in correctly and we talked about that afterwards.

160
00:26:18,157 --> 00:26:29,707
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Look at questions, I mean that's just one way mean we had another faculty who led the zooms a little bit like a.

161
00:26:29,707 --> 00:26:45,877
Sharon Reilly Kardia: scavenger hunt, because what she was trying to do was to get the students to be working on their projects together and she was teaching them how to do evaluation.

162
00:26:45,877 --> 00:27:07,057
Sharon Reilly Kardia: So they had their individual projects and she was moving them through the steps of evaluation it's like okay everybody go and find blank for your area and bring it back, and you have 10 minutes, and they were doing the kind of share and compare.

163
00:27:07,057 --> 00:27:10,867
Sharon Reilly Kardia: With their own screens and their own materials.

164
00:27:10,867 --> 00:27:19,897
Sharon Reilly Kardia: And then the next 10 minutes was another thing that they had to find and they had to go out and that defined it and bring it back so.

165
00:27:19,897 --> 00:27:27,817
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Or, for instance, they went through journal articles that way to find in this journal article, the journal article was given ahead of time.

166
00:27:27,817 --> 00:27:53,467
Sharon Reilly Kardia: And they were told the basic prompts but then they had to actually demonstrate and describe it in the zoom session so it was more more action less lecture is always going to be better in the zoom session.

167
00:27:53,467 --> 00:27:57,817
Sharon Reilly Kardia: questions.

168
00:27:57,817 --> 00:28:05,287
Marie Sylvia O'Neill: Sharon, do you have a suggestion for group size for the great breakout rooms.

169
00:28:05,287 --> 00:28:08,257
Sharon Reilly Kardia: yeah if they're really expected to be.

170
00:28:08,257 --> 00:28:25,537
Sharon Reilly Kardia: actively doing things breakout groups of size like four is about about right that gets past four or five, then there are people that are not participating.

171
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:34,507
Sharon Reilly Kardia: um and it's different if what you are doing is.

172
00:28:34,507 --> 00:28:57,067
Sharon Reilly Kardia: just having a discussion there it's easier to have a larger groups and sometimes it's really kind of good to have larger groups, but if people are supposed to be testing their knowledge taste testing their abilities to use the concepts or solve a problem for is kind of optimal.

173
00:28:57,067 --> 00:29:01,987
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Three gets a little bit too little right.

174
00:29:01,987 --> 00:29:06,577
Sharon Reilly Kardia: So that's my sense.

175
00:29:06,577 --> 00:29:14,467
Marie Sylvia O'Neill: yeah thanks and on any given session people might not be there, so we can shuffle them around so.

176
00:29:14,467 --> 00:29:21,127
yeah.

177
00:29:21,127 --> 00:29:35,077
Sharon Reilly Kardia: A lot of times in the sessions i've learned that they need a little bit more demonstration to move more quickly, this is a little bit like the.

178
00:29:35,077 --> 00:29:42,427
Sharon Reilly Kardia: The attention to inclusive learning that we're trying to do more and more of.

179
00:29:42,427 --> 00:30:01,867
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Different learning styles will pick something up quickly and be able to move with it and other learning styles take a little bit more time so even just being able to give a small snapshot of what you are expecting them to do.

180
00:30:01,867 --> 00:30:06,337
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Can can really, really help.

181
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:18,277
Sharon Reilly Kardia: we've even found this with faculty that if we're not explicit and we just think Oh, we want this it never happens so you have to you have to create the.

182
00:30:18,277 --> 00:30:21,247
Sharon Reilly Kardia: The scaffolding.

183
00:30:21,247 --> 00:30:32,287
Sharon Reilly Kardia: The exemplars that allow people to move quickly.

184
00:30:32,287 --> 00:30:35,317
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Well, there.

185
00:30:35,317 --> 00:30:38,617
Sharon Reilly Kardia: will be questions.

186
00:30:38,617 --> 00:30:45,817
Sharon Reilly Kardia: um one of the things that just occurred to me is that.

187
00:30:45,817 --> 00:30:54,097
Sharon Reilly Kardia: For what I showed you for the zoom session I created a.

188
00:30:54,097 --> 00:30:56,587
Sharon Reilly Kardia: A template.

189
00:30:56,587 --> 00:47:48,639
Sharon Reilly Kardia: So that from year to year, I could do.

190
00:31:01,297 --> 00:31:15,667
Sharon Reilly Kardia: The same kind of thing or change it so, for instance, that this particular Google slide deck is what I made a copy of for last year and i'm make a copy of it but.

191
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:19,147
Sharon Reilly Kardia: One of the reasons i've pointed out, is it what does it look like.

192
00:31:19,147 --> 00:31:33,127
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Before the students get to it so each one of these breakout groups just has their own table and it's empty that's the prep that allows me to both get them.

193
00:31:33,127 --> 00:47:48,639
Sharon Reilly Kardia: oriented to what they're supposed to do, but then they see the place that they're supposed to do it so and I think this particular exercise actually took like 15 or 20 minutes.

194
00:31:48,757 --> 00:31:54,247
Sharon Reilly Kardia: For the students to do because.

195
00:31:54,247 --> 00:32:08,347
Sharon Reilly Kardia: When they realize just how tough, it is to go across those concepts into depth for the US population.

196
00:32:08,347 --> 00:32:17,497
Sharon Reilly Kardia: It was a it was a good exercise.

197
00:32:17,497 --> 00:32:21,877
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Their question questions.

198
00:32:21,877 --> 00:32:22,687
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Go ahead.

199
00:32:22,687 --> 00:32:37,147
Frederique Laubepin: Sorry, Sharon, I just want to mention I put a link to a document we created on running effective zoom sessions that's in the chat I would second everything that sharon's talked about.

200
00:32:37,147 --> 00:32:47,317
Frederique Laubepin: It would also point you to the materials we have on tools for engagement and collaboration, so the Google suite is.

201
00:32:47,317 --> 00:32:54,187
Frederique Laubepin: it's very helpful but depending on what you're trying to do there may be other tools, you know we've we've.

202
00:32:54,187 --> 00:33:00,457
Frederique Laubepin: mentioned poll everywhere in the in the chat, but there are you know, there are others.

203
00:33:00,457 --> 00:33:02,527
Frederique Laubepin: So.

204
00:33:02,527 --> 00:33:08,947
Frederique Laubepin: We have some we have some resources on on these tools for engagement and collaboration.

205
00:33:08,947 --> 00:33:22,477
Frederique Laubepin: And we're always happy to you know reach out to us and you know if you're trying to figure out what tool to use or how to approach teaching a particular class session we're always happy to.

206
00:33:22,477 --> 00:33:26,887
Frederique Laubepin: You know, go over options or brainstorm with you.

207
00:33:26,887 --> 00:33:35,377
Sharon Reilly Kardia: yeah and I would highly suggest taking them up on it, because what I showed you is good for the kind of class i'm teaching.

208
00:33:35,377 --> 00:33:40,657
Sharon Reilly Kardia: But, for instance we've had other faculty who have.

209
00:33:40,657 --> 00:33:45,277
Sharon Reilly Kardia: said things like Oh well, we use perusal.

210
00:33:45,277 --> 00:33:51,007
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Because of the way in which we're sort of emphasizing a heavy.

211
00:33:51,007 --> 00:34:05,197
Sharon Reilly Kardia: dig into the literature and we want the students to become much more familiar with that and to comment on papers, or to to get used to that kind of interaction.

212
00:34:05,197 --> 00:34:28,597
Sharon Reilly Kardia: With the literature or blogs, or whatever, and I don't do that or, for instance I created a simulation in my population health course and we used yellow dig for that simulation so different goals and different tools are better aligned.

213
00:34:28,597 --> 00:34:39,457
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Making it fun also makes a difference, having having zoom sessions be like a root canal not going to be a winner.

214
00:34:39,457 --> 00:34:47,377
Frederique Laubepin: yeah as a general rule of thumb if you're boring yourself there's a good chance you're boring your students and if you're having you know, an excruciating time.

215
00:34:47,377 --> 00:35:01,477
Frederique Laubepin: Teaching for zoom session this probably also excruciating for your for your students.

216
00:35:01,477 --> 00:35:15,007
Sharon Reilly Kardia: We have used cahoot at meetings but not actually in the classroom I think because polarity anywhere is a little bit excuse me poll everywhere, is a little bit.

217
00:35:15,007 --> 00:35:28,957
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Better for lack of a better word it's got more features and it has some nice ease.

218
00:35:28,957 --> 00:35:36,007
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Good luck Linda.

219
00:35:36,007 --> 00:35:56,107
Frederique Laubepin: And for anybody who may not have seen the dimension in the in the chat earlier on, if you'd like to be added, we have a school level license for Paul everywhere, if you'd like to be added to the license who doesn't do send us send us a note and will that will give you access to.

220
00:35:56,107 --> 00:36:07,957
Frederique Laubepin: You know, some some features that go beyond the basic you know you can have your own individual free account but you're limited in the number of participants and so with the school license.

221
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:17,557
Frederique Laubepin: You can have more participants and stuff like that, so if you'd like to be added to the to our license just send us a note.

222
00:36:17,557 --> 00:36:28,027
Sharon Reilly Kardia: frederica have a kind of off the wall question is just a occurring to me is, do we have docu cameras that are.

223
00:36:28,027 --> 00:36:36,847
Sharon Reilly Kardia: possible for either GS eyes or faculty to get access to, or do they have to go into a classroom.

224
00:36:36,847 --> 00:36:48,907
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Because, with some of, for instance, the bio stats or even the epic classes that have a lot of Problem Solving being able to see somebody in real time solve the problem.

225
00:36:48,907 --> 00:36:58,687
Sharon Reilly Kardia: boy that can make a big difference and tablets do work but they the the fidelity of the writing is not particularly good.

226
00:36:58,687 --> 00:37:10,117
Frederique Laubepin: um I think it depends on the tablet I don't believe we have like document cameras they I think the the document cameras, we have are in classrooms and are not.

227
00:37:10,117 --> 00:37:14,047
Frederique Laubepin: You know, mobile thanks for lending out.

228
00:37:14,047 --> 00:37:18,187
Frederique Laubepin: Unfortunately, met binder is on vacation this week.

229
00:37:18,187 --> 00:37:22,777
Frederique Laubepin: We, but he would be the person to talk to about.

230
00:37:22,777 --> 00:37:26,347
Frederique Laubepin: Borrowing a tablet for the term.

231
00:37:26,347 --> 00:37:33,157
Frederique Laubepin: And there are multiple ways in which you can use the tablet for notations.

232
00:37:33,157 --> 00:37:42,847
Frederique Laubepin: You know so including blank slides in your presentation or Joanna this morning was demonstrating how you can use jam board.

233
00:37:42,847 --> 00:37:50,017
Frederique Laubepin: To you know to write themselves equations you know ipads.

234
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:53,647
Frederique Laubepin: can work as Daniel mentioned.

235
00:37:53,647 --> 00:38:02,707
Frederique Laubepin: So there's you know, there are options and if you're interested in exploring on the options what might work for you what.

236
00:38:02,707 --> 00:38:09,847
Frederique Laubepin: What might be available, then again reach out to us and we'll help you know we'll be happy to.

237
00:38:09,847 --> 00:38:24,307
Frederique Laubepin: enter your questions or direct you to somebody who can.

238
00:38:24,307 --> 00:38:26,557
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Any.

239
00:38:26,557 --> 00:38:28,597
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Any last sort of.

240
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:36,007
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Questions for your specific classes.

241
00:38:36,007 --> 00:38:43,387
Frederique Laubepin: Concerns is there anything that you're particularly concerned about that we might be able to help.

242
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:46,777
Frederique Laubepin: or provide some support or we should plan on.

243
00:38:46,777 --> 00:39:02,227
Frederique Laubepin: Supporting.

244
00:39:02,227 --> 00:39:07,177
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Just experiment.

245
00:39:07,177 --> 00:39:12,397
Sharon Reilly Kardia: don't be shy to experiment.

246
00:39:12,397 --> 00:39:15,217
Marie Sylvia O'Neill: Just have.

247
00:39:15,217 --> 00:39:30,637
Marie Sylvia O'Neill: One question which is I set up my office hours on a Saturday after looking at the spreadsheet where that we have some people from Singapore and Qatar and you know just found a found a time where people can.

248
00:39:30,637 --> 00:39:50,137
Marie Sylvia O'Neill: Make it, but any suggestions like at least office hours in the residential times 12 were not well attended in general, but you know just being available I guess is the critical part, but any any thoughts on that and Danielle also will have an office hour.

249
00:39:50,137 --> 00:40:00,097
Sharon Reilly Kardia: yeah one of the things that in the epidemiology course that people get stuck on is the problem solving.

250
00:40:00,097 --> 00:40:16,807
Sharon Reilly Kardia: So if you rather than saying it's just office hours if you said it was like office hours and Problem Solving examples you would get I think a lot more people coming.

251
00:40:16,807 --> 00:40:29,497
Sharon Reilly Kardia: And you know if people want a one on one session because they are having kind of personal concerns that might be a different kind of ask.

252
00:40:29,497 --> 00:40:45,667
Sharon Reilly Kardia: But for the vast majority of the office hours that i've had they've been open and they've been more kind of here's the examples that will help you do it yourself.

253
00:40:45,667 --> 00:40:49,087
Sharon Reilly Kardia: that's what they're looking for.

254
00:40:49,087 --> 00:41:00,997
Sharon Reilly Kardia: And I mean epidemiology is full of jargon, so if you don't necessarily understand the concepts before you do it.

255
00:41:00,997 --> 00:41:08,857
Sharon Reilly Kardia: You need somebody to demonstrate difference between prevalence and incidents, for instance, or.

256
00:41:08,857 --> 00:41:13,687
Sharon Reilly Kardia: odds ratio and relative risks really jams people up.

257
00:41:13,687 --> 00:41:24,127
Sharon Reilly Kardia: So.

258
00:41:24,127 --> 00:41:34,387
Hsing-Fang Hsieh: I also have a question and I wonder if I could get some advice here i'm trying to teach a course that require students to it's a project base.

259
00:41:34,387 --> 00:41:52,927
Hsing-Fang Hsieh: So students will end up writing a proposal in end of the Semester and then offering this question wise, I wonder if there are suggestions that you could give her any tips you've been helpful for engaging speed and in a project based course.

260
00:41:52,927 --> 00:42:11,977
Sharon Reilly Kardia: So I teach the integrated learning experience in the online mph program and for us what we've done is created kind of the milestones throughout the Semester when they are supposed to get.

261
00:42:11,977 --> 00:42:38,167
Sharon Reilly Kardia: An outline the first draft, and to do, for instance inside of the zoom sessions paired peer reviews so peer review often will help the student who's doing the review to understand a wow I forgot this right or I see another way of doing this.

262
00:42:38,167 --> 00:42:54,187
Sharon Reilly Kardia: And so just having everybody doing one to two peer reviews and having my own let's say project review reviewed by two people I get further faster.

263
00:42:54,187 --> 00:42:57,517
Sharon Reilly Kardia: So that's one thing and it.

264
00:42:57,517 --> 00:43:02,107
Sharon Reilly Kardia: it's nice to give students, a little bit of.

265
00:43:02,107 --> 00:43:10,237
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Training and peer review, otherwise it can just be like a list of opinions.

266
00:43:10,237 --> 00:43:24,097
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Rather than even like how to give people critical feedback right, I mean there's a way to do it, that is easy on the ego and there's a way to do it that's hard.

267
00:43:24,097 --> 00:43:39,247
Sharon Reilly Kardia: So teaching students, how to do, giving critical feedback is another done skill set the other part about project base and are you having them do it in teams are individually.

268
00:43:39,247 --> 00:43:45,067
Hsing-Fang Hsieh: three to four events in one team and try to write out the proposal together.

269
00:43:45,067 --> 00:43:47,527
Hsing-Fang Hsieh: Okay that's the plane.

270
00:43:47,527 --> 00:43:50,647
Sharon Reilly Kardia: So you probably need to hardwire throughout the.

271
00:43:50,647 --> 00:43:58,657
Sharon Reilly Kardia: course some almost like poll everywhere about team dynamics.

272
00:43:58,657 --> 00:44:03,037
Sharon Reilly Kardia: And what is working and what is not working.

273
00:44:03,037 --> 00:44:16,627
Sharon Reilly Kardia: There is a piece of software that was developed by people at the Center for academic innovation, primarily, I think, for engineering students.

274
00:44:16,627 --> 00:44:21,217
Sharon Reilly Kardia: But it's actually got some very nice.

275
00:44:21,217 --> 00:44:36,547
Sharon Reilly Kardia: aspects to it to think about querying students about how it's going because there's always these issues of do you feel like you're working too much, do you feel like your work isn't recognized, do you feel like.

276
00:44:36,547 --> 00:44:46,627
Sharon Reilly Kardia: You are letting your team members down, are you feeling I mean so that kind of thing to just get people feeling like it matters.

277
00:44:46,627 --> 00:44:50,947
Sharon Reilly Kardia: That what their relationship to the team.

278
00:44:50,947 --> 00:44:56,197
Sharon Reilly Kardia: For the journey and then the outcome.

279
00:44:56,197 --> 00:45:00,967
Frederique Laubepin: The tool is called tandem.

280
00:45:00,967 --> 00:45:14,737
Frederique Laubepin: And i'm not sure how widely they're rolling it out, I know they were trying to improve it last year, so it wasn't truly available, it was developed for.

281
00:45:14,737 --> 00:45:22,807
Frederique Laubepin: You know by by some faculty in engineering but it's not specific to engineering right it's about group dynamics.

282
00:45:22,807 --> 00:45:26,707
Frederique Laubepin: Generally speaking, so it's anybody can.

283
00:45:26,707 --> 00:45:32,707
Frederique Laubepin: can use a tool what's what's neat about it is that you know the students sort of.

284
00:45:32,707 --> 00:45:45,967
Frederique Laubepin: give some information about you know, so I feel like my voice isn't being heard or you know, whatever and the tool kind of does some like team diagnostics and then give the students some materials right, so if.

285
00:45:45,967 --> 00:46:01,087
Frederique Laubepin: There seems to be an equity issue the tool role suggests, you know some some resources if there seems to be I don't know time management issues, then the tool will point them in that direction.

286
00:46:01,087 --> 00:46:10,747
Frederique Laubepin: But what's also need is that the instructor can have a view of how the teams are doing right and if if it looks like one team seems to be struggling.

287
00:46:10,747 --> 00:46:16,717
Frederique Laubepin: You know they're not really working well together, there you know, then you can you can.

288
00:46:16,717 --> 00:46:21,937
Frederique Laubepin: Specifically sort of go in and be like hey, how can I help you.

289
00:46:21,937 --> 00:46:33,187
Frederique Laubepin: work together better right so it's a very neat tool, I would encourage you to look into it, I just don't know how if Ai is letting a lot of.

290
00:46:33,187 --> 00:46:38,497
Frederique Laubepin: People use it at the moment, because I know, last year, they were they were still.

291
00:46:38,497 --> 00:46:46,447
Frederique Laubepin: Tinkering with settings and improvements and things like that, but if it's not available this year, you should definitely look for it next year because.

292
00:46:46,447 --> 00:46:50,917
Frederique Laubepin: I think it's got a lot of potential, especially for like the and I.

293
00:46:50,917 --> 00:46:55,477
Frederique Laubepin: started and for teaching people how to work in groups, which is not something we typically.

294
00:46:55,477 --> 00:46:57,277
Do.

295
00:46:57,277 --> 00:47:04,387
Sharon Reilly Kardia: yeah I actually just went into sort of steal some of the questions they asked.

296
00:47:04,387 --> 00:47:09,457
Sharon Reilly Kardia: To put into my own polls.

297
00:47:09,457 --> 00:47:13,987
Hsing-Fang Hsieh: This is really helpful, thank you for sharing.

298
00:47:13,987 --> 00:47:26,647
Sharon Reilly Kardia: All right, it's 1151 and I, I just want to be mindful we're starting a new Semester and stopping on time is, I think, important for people to be able to transition so.

299
00:47:26,647 --> 00:47:37,927
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Just know that you can reach out to any of us and we're happy to help, and you know if along the way, something happens and you're like oh boy this isn't working.

300
00:47:37,927 --> 00:47:41,557
Sharon Reilly Kardia: send us a line and we'll see if we can help.

301
00:47:41,557 --> 00:47:45,217
Sharon Reilly Kardia: All right, good to see you all, thank you.

302
00:47:45,217 --> 00:47:48,639
Hsing-Fang Hsieh: Thank you so much, great.
