1
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:23,820
Okay. I'm going to get started. So good morning to you.

2
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:32,219
Today, we'll be going over some two different things.

3
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:41,010
So we will finish the section on adult screening. There was a prerecorded lecture on the text.

4
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,019
Will, we'll go over it and we'll talk about Section five life.

5
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:51,960
Then we'll go over the quizzes for the screening.

6
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:59,309
And then from last week we had the let's try to get a journey so we can talk about it.

7
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:12,950
So if you have any questions and maybe quickly go over the reasoning questions that we have posted on, and then at the end we'll talk about Exam one.

8
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,340
I did release the grades. They didn't release them last week. I thought I'll just released them today.

9
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,940
We can go over them quickly, see if you have any questions.

10
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:29,760
I won't be releasing the like this solution to that, but you're welcome to come talk to me if you have specific questions or there's.

11
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:33,790
Huh? Like specific part that you want to go over.

12
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:38,920
Okay. Any questions? Okay.

13
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,570
And then next week, we will be going over.

14
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,400
Genetic Association studies.

15
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:58,970
So we will have you will have a prerecorded lectures, watch and quiz kind of similar to what we were doing early on in the semester.

16
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:06,530
Will start working on our last problems that and then we would kind of shift into more guest lectures.

17
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:21,170
Okay so factor five Leiden is is one of those conditions that is different from what we talked about so far.

18
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:37,560
And that is why those that have more adult onset online so not really detected in newborns or a carrier screening or yeah.

19
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:49,790
Not not detected in babies or infants. So it can maybe go on undiagnosed as far as the individuals can be asymptomatic.

20
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:56,920
And that's something that we will talk about, like the difference in screening for those individuals,

21
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:04,809
whether asymptomatic or asymptomatic conditions and for for as a learning objective,

22
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:15,490
it kind of follows what we had for the other conditions in terms of we want to know the basic epidemiology symptoms in infected organ systems,

23
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:20,350
genetics and biological pathways and and and treatment.

24
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:26,590
So factor five is, is a clotting disorder.

25
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:30,610
So you'll know probably when when you have an injury,

26
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:43,450
you have a good clotting cascade that gets triggered and forms a matrix that would kind of stop the bleeding factor, if I might.

27
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:51,790
It is a disorder in the sense that you have a hyper coagulation, so you have more clotting, you're more likely to have clots and these clots.

28
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:57,400
So they would kind of build up in the arteries. If you have an injury to an artery,

29
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:07,209
they can build up and they can end up being dislodged and either like blocked the vein or dislodged and

30
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:13,790
move to them in the bloodstream where they can have harmful effects to the lungs or the brain can.

31
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:24,090
So just a quick overview of like how blood clot is formed.

32
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:32,960
So like a normal ARDS, your brain, you have different components of blood cells that we with blood that you all know about.

33
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,190
The army sees white blood cells and the platelets and clotting factors.

34
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:47,400
And then if you have a break in the industrial cell or a break in the wall, so an injury that would result in bleeding,

35
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:54,360
that would trigger the platelets to come together to form the platelet plays it plug.

36
00:04:55,950 --> 00:05:08,190
And then you have the coagulation cascade form kind of initiated and fibrin is produced and that would kind of secure the clot in place.

37
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,829
Okay. So, so this process is kind of it's a cascade.

38
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:25,180
So it's regulated by a number of kind of factors that kind of come together to result in the final fibrin being produced.

39
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:31,739
So the trigger would be a damaged surface, and then you have all those different factors.

40
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:42,809
So this is factor 12 that is changed to factor 12 A and that that factor 12 A would be sort

41
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:51,540
of a catalyst for another reaction or another step in this cascade and so on and so forth.

42
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:02,280
So in in this step here, you see this is factor five.

43
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:08,280
So you see so this is factor five.

44
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:17,220
That, that this is where we have the mutation that we're talking about is affected by lightning.

45
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:31,590
And factor 535 is usually does it need any kind of factor that to change it to factor five A

46
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:38,700
and that would catalyze the change from strong benefit to thrombin and then to produce fibrin.

47
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:47,460
Okay. Now this process of factor five change 2.358 is regulated by this protein.

48
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:54,790
So let's see and see. The potency.

49
00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:00,879
His main goal is to inhibit coagulation.

50
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:06,820
So it's kind of stops 55 from changing to 5 to 5 A and so inhibits coagulation.

51
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:15,580
Now when you have a mutation in factor five, that would make it kind of unresponsive to protein C,

52
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:22,569
and so you have coagulation happening and turned on all the time.

53
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:28,690
So it's not responsive to the stopping signal by the protein C and that would end up

54
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:36,220
where you would end up with more thrombin and more fibrin and then more more clotting.

55
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:43,000
So so there's no regulation to the to the clot question or not.

56
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:54,870
So this is an example of a disease that does not have either allelic or locust heterogeneity.

57
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:59,700
Okay, so remember the conditions that we talked about before.

58
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:08,640
They could have either a mutation, a specific gene or different genes being affected.

59
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:19,740
This one is a single base change. So you have to change from the gene to an A at a specific position in the Factor five gene.

60
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:27,299
So it does not show me there are locus heterogeneity is an autosomal dominant incomplete

61
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:37,440
penetrance and the naming of of that is based on where it was first described.

62
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:46,890
So in my university in the Netherlands and in terms of its prevalence in different populations,

63
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:51,600
Swedish and Dutch populations have a higher prevalence of factor.

64
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,440
Five ladies is estimated to be between two and 7%.

65
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:03,810
So that's about ten, ten fold higher than all previous identified genetic risks for thrombosis.

66
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,919
And then if you look specifically at individuals who have venous thrombosis,

67
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:17,310
so individuals who have clots or come to seek care for having having clots,

68
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:25,969
they have there's a high there's a high likelihood that they they do have some form of 5 to 5 Leiden.

69
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:30,870
And so about 20 to 60% of them have actually have the mutation.

70
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:42,200
So this is this this is an example of a study where.

71
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:49,219
So, in fact, if I might and can maybe go undetected.

72
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:57,940
But there was the hypothesis or thinking that women who are taking oral contraceptives are out with and then

73
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:05,720
they have perhaps had five mutation that puts them at a higher risk for for thrombosis or developing clots.

74
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:14,269
So this is an example of a study that was done to really describe the risk that

75
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:19,760
is associated with having affective five mutation and having this exposure,

76
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:30,740
which is the oral contraceptive. So this is a so what they did was a case control study is if you you've taken any epidemiologic epidemiology course,

77
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:38,930
you know, this is the kind of study where we identify cases with the disease and then I try to match them with controls.

78
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:46,370
So individuals with no disease and then try to look at the prevalence of the exposure, like how does the exposure?

79
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,220
Kind of differs between cases and controls.

80
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:59,389
So and this is a good example of a study with kind of a gene environment interaction.

81
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:01,070
So we're looking at the genotype.

82
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:09,440
We're looking at the oral contraceptive use, which is kind of an exposure or maybe an environmental factor if you want, like not really genetic.

83
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:13,920
And we can look at the disease.

84
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,000
So we're looking at venous thrombosis.

85
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:27,639
So so cases where women aged 15 to 49 who had experienced the first episode

86
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:34,420
of venous thrombosis and they were enrolled 6 to 19 months after that event,

87
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:41,080
they were recruited from different clinics in three geographical regions, the Netherlands.

88
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:54,540
And then controls, we try to select them to match the cases in terms of how likely they were they were to develop the disease if they were exposed.

89
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:58,980
So so they were women from the same age group.

90
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:03,990
Friends or acquaintances of the acquaintances of the cases or partners.

91
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:10,350
And then in both cases and controls, we would determine the oral contraceptive use,

92
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:18,150
which was defined within 30 days before the thrombosis events for the cases or just the start date for the controls.

93
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:32,850
And then we would rule out to exclude out women who could have kind of different factors affecting their their disease status,

94
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:37,410
like post-menopausal or those who were pregnant within the last 30 days.

95
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:49,500
So this is like a basic setup table where you would have the Factor five genotypes and that's

96
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:55,740
like your the different genotype mutations that there's different genotypes and then mutations.

97
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:01,170
And then oral contraceptive use and breakdown the number of cases and controls.

98
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:13,090
Okay. Now, the main measure of kind of breast cancer in the in the case control study is an odds ratio.

99
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:27,860
So odds ratios. So response that would tell you what is the odds of the disease among those exposed compared to those not exposed or unexposed.

100
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:33,770
Okay. So, so in the first step, what they did is that they.

101
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:38,640
They have oral contraceptive use here, the on the left hand side.

102
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:46,500
And you could have you could be either positive or negative depending on whether the woman was an oral was using oral contraceptive.

103
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:51,720
And then you have cases and controls for for thrombolysis.

104
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:57,090
And that's kind of further stratified by having a factor five mutation.

105
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:02,150
So yes or no. And setting it up that way.

106
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:12,920
So you're looking at disease to know disease among those with oral contraceptive use and having a positive factor five mutation.

107
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:19,610
And then that the risk the odds ratio for for this part of the table would be five.

108
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:32,330
So the odds of having the disease among oral contraceptives or oral contraceptive users and having the factor five lightning was five.

109
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:41,960
And then among again, oral contraceptive users who do not have the factor five, retention was 3.7.

110
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:49,550
So. So looking at that, it looks like oral contraceptive use is not really.

111
00:14:51,070 --> 00:15:00,910
So comparing the 5 to 3.7 does not really have a strong effect on developing thrombosis.

112
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:13,870
Okay. Now we look at it in a different way where we we're kind of we're kind of changing the reference that we're looking at.

113
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,930
So if we set it up so that we're looking at both exposures, so we're looking at factor five light,

114
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:25,130
then we're looking at oral contraceptive use and we're going to compare cases and controls.

115
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:31,429
So, so we kind of have three levels of exposure.

116
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:37,430
So having them not having the mutation being oral contraceptive use or having the

117
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:43,489
mutation not being an or not being an oral contraceptives and then having both.

118
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:48,139
So you have the mutation and you're taking the oral contraceptives and we're going to

119
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:54,350
compare them to women who have neither the mutation or nor are taking oral contraceptives.

120
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,500
So if we set it up that way.

121
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:10,320
Then we see that the odds ratio for those who have both exposures compared to having none of the exposures is so much higher.

122
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:15,570
And odds ratio like if you want to calculate those numbers, it would be like.

123
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:27,820
Cases over control, cases over controls among those exposed compared to cases, number of cases and controls among those who are unexposed.

124
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:41,570
If you're interested in knowing how to calculate how. So that would be like 25 over two and then divided by 36 over hundreds.

125
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:45,370
That would give you that 34.7 odds ratio.

126
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:59,890
Any questions? Okay.

127
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:11,450
So. So it was clear from this finding that comparing those with the mutation and using oral contraceptive that to those who aren't,

128
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:15,780
you have neither of those risk factors. Then the relative risk was huge.

129
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:27,059
So 34.7 And then using another measure of kind of risk based on incidence of population incidence.

130
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:37,290
So kind of divide the number of cases by the follow up time that you would have calculated by person years so that we

131
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:49,110
can see that those with oral contraceptive use and that mutation have a much higher rate of of developing thrombosis.

132
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:59,070
So do we really test for factor five then?

133
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:08,460
Not really. Not in terms of like going out in a population and testing out people who do not have the disease or do not have symptoms.

134
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:16,620
Usually it's you would have like a family history of eating disorder kind of being.

135
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:22,380
You report that to your physician and that would maybe trigger testing for their testing.

136
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,640
This is kind of similar to the hemochromatosis.

137
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:35,130
Like you would have to have maybe some reason to be tested if you go in to the physician, see to for oral contraceptive use.

138
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:41,760
If you and you have maybe a history of blood disorders in your family or a clotting disorder,

139
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,800
then you might get tested before being put on oral contraceptives.

140
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:57,420
And then if you have like. Thrombotic events have thrombosis before the age of 45.

141
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:05,130
If you have it in a young individual, then maybe that would kind of trigger further testing 4005.

142
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:26,300
Okay. And that testing is basically it could be either like a kind of a blood test to kind of verify that there's a clotting disorder.

143
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:33,170
And then further test further steps can include onward genetic testing to test for the mutation.

144
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:40,480
Any questions on Factor five might end up.

145
00:19:46,710 --> 00:20:07,270
Or hemochromatosis. So both of these conditions are ones that would be best for best interests for adults.

146
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:11,950
Like if you think back to cystic fibrosis or.

147
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:24,190
We talk about PKU, we talk about congenital hypothyroidism, like these are more of an infant or infant kind of onset,

148
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:29,930
but these are more conditions that you would really capture adult stage.

149
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:37,480
So, so more of an adult kind of testing. Were there any questions on hemochromatosis?

150
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:54,610
So it's an iron overload. Can't go undetected just because it can slow or accelerate the presentation, can be can slow, can be slow or fast.

151
00:20:54,790 --> 00:21:08,260
It's kind of it can vary also depending on exposures like iron intake, blood loss through menstruation for women mostly would affect the liver.

152
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:15,090
And then it's it's it's a disease.

153
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:18,270
That's where you have a mutation in a specific gene.

154
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:25,600
We view this as the most common mutation of the C to A to Y.

155
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:37,170
And we need the same kind of concepts of when due test applies similar to what we just talked about.

156
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:45,049
So. You could have like a predictive test.

157
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:52,970
So if you have like an asymptomatic individual with a family history and that's more of a kind of a predictive test,

158
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,940
if you have symptomatic individuals that you suspect might have a mutation,

159
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:07,400
you could have more of a diagnostic test like you would test for test to see if they have the mutation.

160
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:15,260
But not it's not really kind of implemented on a kind of population based where you would test everybody.

161
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:23,420
Any questions? Okay.

162
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:33,090
Let me see. So we can maybe go quickly over.

163
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:43,170
As to the adult screening quiz. The.

164
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,439
So this combines like two kind of I think we didn't go over this one.

165
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:57,460
So. Cystic fibrosis is an example of many different mutations in a single gene.

166
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,799
So this is kind of important, you know, for all these conditions that we talked about,

167
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:06,380
like what kind of heterogeneity are they showing cause that locus heterogeneity.

168
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:17,530
And hemochromatosis is one of those that would have that have in adulthood kind of onset time.

169
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:24,250
This is the most common mutation for hemochromatosis.

170
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,990
Then cystic fibrosis mostly affects the pancreas and the lung.

171
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:36,780
It can, depending on the mutations and other factors, can be kind of more widespread.

172
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:42,310
But these are the most commonly affected organ systems.

173
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:54,340
And then adult carrier screening is recommended for cystic fibrosis, not hemochromatosis, as we just talked about.

174
00:23:55,180 --> 00:24:03,850
So you can think about, I don't know, screening as a kind of a spectrum, whether you test like in a newborn or even maybe prenatal,

175
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:09,070
like if you're doing IVF, like you could kind of detect the mutations really early on.

176
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:17,590
It can be in like in symptomatic people that you just want to confirm that that's more of a

177
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:25,540
diagnostic type of test or a predictive test where you can have a maybe a family history.

178
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:32,330
And then you just want to. Test, even if it's asymptomatic individual.

179
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:37,190
So it's kind of a spectrum. Then you have the carrier kind of testing where you.

180
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:45,790
You know, I don't care. Family history or you know, they come from an ancestry that has the high prevalence of a specific mutation.

181
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,630
They're likely to be carriers.

182
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:57,910
So it's it's kind of a spectrum when we test and depends on the condition, depends on the prevalence and and and other factors.

183
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,120
Okay. So let's see.

184
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:07,210
So we had also the eugenics.

185
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:20,950
Any any comments on the agenda? Yeah, I have a quick question about hereditary hemochromatosis.

186
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:25,659
So is it like that that we're screening or is someone present sent out?

187
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:31,060
Is that so?

188
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:40,600
It's more of an individual presenting with symptoms that you kind of.

189
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:47,749
It could be asymptomatic in the sense of like general health checkup.

190
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:56,510
Like you go to the physician and like it gets held in the blood panel that you test for for serum transferrin saturation.

191
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:02,480
But it's definitely not like a wide scale asymptomatic kind of.

192
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:09,690
Testing. So if you meet Moose, they have to have a reason to test for that.

193
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:13,890
Or, like, a reason to suspect that there's something wrong.

194
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:24,590
Any more questions? Okay. Hi.

195
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:29,940
So, um, were there any questions on you, Jennings?

196
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:39,299
I thought it's an interesting launch. I have not watched it myself like I didn't that I wasn't part of the class one when it was given.

197
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:48,180
I thought it was interesting. It leaves a lot of food for thought and all those testings that we talked about.

198
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:54,340
How? Like even in.

199
00:26:55,990 --> 00:27:01,510
And even now where we think these ideas of eugenics are like far, far away,

200
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:13,080
but they're really can can sneak into our thinking and something to be vigilant about as we look over our laws and practices.

201
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:25,540
So in her lecture, Dr. Cardea talks about how eugenics influenced family law,

202
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:32,290
like thinking about who can marry, who, sterilization and then immigration.

203
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:38,860
So who can end up in allowing a country or not to really talk about patents.

204
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:47,049
And then, I mean, a huge focus of the lecture was about like sterilization,

205
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:52,630
how it can it is a form of eugenics, regardless if there's informed consent or not.

206
00:27:55,670 --> 00:28:01,700
And eugenics was really a goal of public health, like we thought that.

207
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:08,350
I mean, they thought they were doing the job of betterment of society by thinking in that,

208
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:17,650
in that sense of of selecting out or weeding out individuals who were not fit or were not, did not meet a certain criteria.

209
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:24,730
And then this is an example from Buck versus Bell, Supreme Court.

210
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:32,770
This is the woman that was ordered to be sterilized because her children were seen as defective.

211
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:40,450
And then and Dr. Claudia talks about sterilization, California,

212
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:51,790
and how they would apply these criteria of feeble mindedness and being alcoholic or limiting, but not being ambidextrous.

213
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,980
Any questions on that and comments in general on eugenics?

214
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:08,090
Could you? Maybe we can spend a minute and talk about.

215
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:18,450
Maybe I'm always like where eugenic thinking could be in public health practice today.

216
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:22,850
Or it can be. And you can.

217
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:28,989
You can maybe observe in like how we practice public health.

218
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:33,640
Any thoughts or how would you define eugenics?

219
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:48,870
Yeah. I was thinking today, like with newborn screening and Down's syndrome, sometimes people don't even have babies then.

220
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:52,650
So I don't know if that's considered eugenics, but it's kind of like.

221
00:29:53,790 --> 00:30:04,139
Who's in the room? Yeah, yeah, definitely. I mean, it's kind of the what I mean, you have those like you have medical profession professionals,

222
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:12,000
like screaming and letting you know that you could have a baby with Down's syndrome or maybe deafness.

223
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:19,799
That's another thing that, like, we're able to know before the baby is born, but like,

224
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:28,470
who kind of makes the call of whether this baby can is is it's okay to be to be raised and born.

225
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:32,370
And there's. There's.

226
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:46,370
Like eugenics is really is it really a good example of eugenics, like trying to decide who's fit and who's not, like based on certain characteristics.

227
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:56,100
What else? She?

228
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:13,750
I mean, this is directly related to genetics,

229
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:22,540
but we talk a lot in early public health classes about different studies and how we use race and ethnicity to analyze very well.

230
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:28,740
And then so being careful about how we use that and what's that describing what information we're using with that.

231
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:36,910
But that's not directly related to genetics, but it's using that variable as a way to describe genetic differences, which isn't correct.

232
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:48,760
Yeah, yeah. That's a great example. Just really being so hyper focused on race or kind of differences in populations,

233
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:55,570
you can end up like identifying variants that and maybe downstream like.

234
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:03,820
Influence like achievements or what we know or like how we're going to treat certain conditions.

235
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:08,430
And those findings come from studies that were so hyper focused on race.

236
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:13,990
And you could have like more of a kind of race based medicine or race based kind of knowledge.

237
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:18,280
Yeah, that's a good example. Anything else?

238
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:21,069
Yeah, I know. There's the whole discussion about, like,

239
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:28,420
designer babies and like how like there's a question that people can use CRISPR to, like, edit embryos and stuff.

240
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:35,470
Yeah, yeah. That's a great example of trying to select those good characteristics, whatever that means,

241
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:42,280
based on what we know of genetics and, you know, not even for diseases, just for.

242
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:46,710
For books and. Yeah.

243
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:53,410
That's I think that's good. That's great. If you want the other comments or.

244
00:32:55,860 --> 00:33:00,240
Okay. Um, so this might today might be a short lecture.

245
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:12,690
Um, so before we talk about exam one, um, I think mostly everyone did could.

246
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:31,410
If you feel like you didn't. If you feel like you didn't do as well or as well as you want, there's still like exams two and three.

247
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:39,230
And so exam two would be, would be on campus.

248
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:46,270
It'll open up November ten. So that's that's an.

249
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:52,800
20 days, really, for example, to.

250
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:57,660
Really look over the study guide I have posted here.

251
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:07,079
I know it's the take home exam. Not take home, but it's it's you have two days but once you started you have 2 hours to complete the exam too.

252
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,200
So make sure you have looked at the material beforehand.

253
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:17,070
Know what? Know the stuff in the study guide so that you're not like I'm fumbling through and

254
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:20,730
trying to find the information the last minute because you will run out of time.

255
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:28,900
So yeah I'd send it's in time to our but you have a two day window to do it.

256
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:42,350
I think that day we do not have class. And then it is it's kind of two parts, multiple choice, and there are some open ended questions.

257
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:52,220
So, yeah, make sure you you prepare for that. If you look ahead on the study guide, if you have questions or things that are unclear, let me know.

258
00:34:55,810 --> 00:35:02,470
So for the exam, the first question was.

259
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:17,790
It's mostly straight forward, if you like. Everyone almost got this right, trying to decide the most the mode of transmission of this pedigree.

260
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:23,370
And this one, I feel like was okay.

261
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:30,210
This the disease y was was kind of a twist.

262
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:36,419
So so the frequency given here is not for the homozygous.

263
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:42,899
It's for individuals showing the disease. So so it's actually for the actual prevalence.

264
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:50,610
So you'd have to multiply it by to to account for those individuals who are not showing the disease but are homozygous.

265
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:58,140
So the total carrier frequency would be it would be an addition of those two frequencies.

266
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:05,310
And this one was basically like a basic probability.

267
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:14,890
We're doing multiplication of being carrier for disease X in disease Y, and we really did not grade like four carry over mistakes.

268
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:21,810
So so if you made a mistake once and ended up doing the calculations based on that, we're not going to deduct points.

269
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:30,300
And this one is the basic kind of event or probability.

270
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:35,490
So probability of a disease X plus Y minus the the overlap.

271
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:42,960
This one. Most people did. Prince and B, correct.

272
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:53,120
Part C was was Loomis kind of not really tricky, but just you couldn't get confused, like trying to track the recessive LDL.

273
00:36:54,150 --> 00:37:02,370
So most people got the one to the have to the par five.

274
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:12,270
But, but you have to kind of think about the different parts of the recessive you could come from from.

275
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:21,799
Individual I one and being in the child's the child could be you can have two copies that come from I one could have two

276
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:29,570
copies coming from I to and then you could have two ways by which the two recessive values can either come from I1,

277
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:35,720
I2 and then i2 and I1. So you would have like four mutually exclusive probabilities.

278
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:39,500
So you would need to, to add.

279
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:46,120
Um, this one was pretty much any question so far.

280
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:51,840
This one was pretty okay.

281
00:37:52,770 --> 00:38:05,129
This one was a little bit trickier, but the Y chromosome does not really care either that illegal or that the genotype we're looking at.

282
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:13,530
So. So it would be just the factor of the X that affected C, the affected X chromosome.

283
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:19,330
This one was pretty much okay for most people.

284
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:24,850
It's similar to what we did in class. This one to most people about this question.

285
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:32,530
Right. Some people were still kind of confused on adding the the log score.

286
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:39,670
So remember, you would add the log scores across categories of the same theta value.

287
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,420
So you'd end up with either point three.

288
00:38:52,850 --> 00:39:00,979
This one. Like most people. Some people kind of thought I was really looking for a kind of prespecified, genetic heterogeneity.

289
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:06,290
So it's just pretty much similar to the sample from the whole paper, like on breast cancer.

290
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,979
So you have family sorted by age of onset.

291
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:18,290
And as you kind of add families for the different age of onset, then you would lose the association.

292
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:26,149
So you really had to specify that the locus could be associated or is associated with early onset disease,

293
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:29,810
but not the later onset form of the disease.

294
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,820
And then the frequency was pretty much okay.

295
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:48,660
Some people, few people got confused with hardly one word, but most people did okay on this part of the questions or.

296
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:56,870
If you want to talk to me about things you're welcome to. Okay.

297
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:00,780
So that's it for today? For next week.

298
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,830
Remember to watch the prerecorded lectures.

299
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:12,950
I think this this next week's lecture will be interesting. It's very similar to what we do actually in for genetic testing nowadays, like do studies.

300
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:23,540
And it will really help you understand like some of this like future concepts that we will talk about cancer and gene gene environment interactions.

301
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:28,730
There's a quiz for that to make sure to do as well.

302
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:34,790
Yep. That's it for today. Thank you.
