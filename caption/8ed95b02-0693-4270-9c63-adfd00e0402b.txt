1
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:13,797
Today we're gonna continue our presentation on strategies to help you

2
00:00:13,797 --> 00:00:16,738
manufacture or illicit additional change talk.

3
00:00:16,738 --> 00:00:22,182
In particular, we're gonna demonstrate the values and strengths activities.

4
00:00:22,182 --> 00:00:26,681
Now this goes back one lesson well represented the importance and

5
00:00:26,681 --> 00:00:28,165
confidence rulers.

6
00:00:28,165 --> 00:00:32,966
The client's scores on those rulers help determine

7
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:36,683
which of the two strategies to use next.

8
00:00:36,683 --> 00:00:41,524
We recommend that if the important score is lower than the confidence score on

9
00:00:41,524 --> 00:00:45,842
the rulers that you use the values activity which will present in a few

10
00:00:45,842 --> 00:00:46,529
minutes.

11
00:00:46,529 --> 00:00:51,088
Alternatively, if the confidence score is lower than the important score,

12
00:00:51,088 --> 00:00:54,665
we recommend you use the strengths and abilities strategy,

13
00:00:54,665 --> 00:00:56,571
which will also present today.

14
00:00:56,571 --> 00:01:03,937
The goal of course is to try and tap into core values, strengths and abilities.

15
00:01:03,937 --> 00:01:07,251
So the person feels more motivated and more ready and

16
00:01:07,251 --> 00:01:10,271
more confident to make their behavior change.

17
00:01:10,271 --> 00:01:14,658
And going back to our original conceptualization to help energize

18
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:16,702
the behavior change attempt.

19
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:19,910
So let's start with the roles, goals and values list.

20
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:24,301
We typically present this to the client and we ask pick three or

21
00:01:24,301 --> 00:01:26,589
four that are important to you.

22
00:01:26,589 --> 00:01:27,971
Why don't you go ahead and do that?

23
00:01:27,971 --> 00:01:36,304
Can you find three or four that are important to you?

24
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:38,964
Now the list differs by age by culture.

25
00:01:38,964 --> 00:01:40,526
So here's the list for adolescents.

26
00:01:40,526 --> 00:01:41,772
It's quite different.

27
00:01:41,772 --> 00:01:44,332
It has things on here that are not on the adult list.

28
00:01:44,332 --> 00:01:51,889
For example having good friends and being a good school member.

29
00:01:51,889 --> 00:01:53,279
This list has three columns.

30
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:58,001
It can be used when you're talking with a parent about their kids health,

31
00:01:58,001 --> 00:02:00,220
in this case a child with obesity.

32
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,981
We would ask the parent to pick two from the first column.

33
00:02:03,981 --> 00:02:08,649
What's the value for your child, two from the middle what's the value for

34
00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:10,589
you and two from the far right.

35
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:14,156
What's the value for your family?

36
00:02:14,156 --> 00:02:17,521
We've developed lists for many cultures and many languages.

37
00:02:17,521 --> 00:02:22,110
On the screen is our list for the meaner community.

38
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:28,473
We also have it in French Spanish Russian and several other languages.

39
00:02:28,473 --> 00:02:34,695
Now the client has picked their values.

40
00:02:34,695 --> 00:02:36,409
What do you do next?

41
00:02:36,409 --> 00:02:40,669
Well, we recommend one of two or possibly using both of these probes.

42
00:02:40,669 --> 00:02:45,570
We start with how might the values you've chosen from the list?

43
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:49,509
We just showed you possibly motivate you to make this change.

44
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:52,602
How might the values you've chosen help you to maybe quit smoking?

45
00:02:52,602 --> 00:02:55,010
Now, here's a rotated version of that.

46
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:57,683
Let's say you change your behavior.

47
00:02:57,683 --> 00:02:59,313
For example, let's say you quit smoking.

48
00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:01,641
How might that influence your values?

49
00:03:01,641 --> 00:03:06,220
So for example, if the person said I want to be a good parent, we might say,

50
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:10,977
well let's say if you quit smoking, how would you feel about being a parent.

51
00:03:10,977 --> 00:03:13,859
And ideally the person would say, well I feel I'm feeling a good role model.

52
00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:16,691
I'm decreasing the chances my kid will smoke.

53
00:03:16,691 --> 00:03:19,601
I'm showing my kids that I'm doing the right thing and I care about my health.

54
00:03:19,601 --> 00:03:23,326
Those would be all examples of change talk that could be elicited by this discussion?

55
00:03:23,326 --> 00:03:27,939
Now, a common question is why isn't health on most of these lists.

56
00:03:27,939 --> 00:03:31,282
Isn't it the most obvious link?

57
00:03:31,282 --> 00:03:34,740
Well, first of all, health is not a value per se.

58
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,025
Health is sort of a means to an end.

59
00:03:37,025 --> 00:03:41,524
We often notice our health, only when we lose it.

60
00:03:41,524 --> 00:03:45,490
Having said that you can weave health into the narrative.

61
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,371
So for example, you might say,

62
00:03:47,371 --> 00:03:52,056
what connection do you see between being a good parent smoking and your health?

63
00:03:52,056 --> 00:03:56,335
And the person may say, well if I'm healthier because I quit smoking,

64
00:03:56,335 --> 00:04:00,345
I'll be able to be more energetic to hang out and play with my kids.

65
00:04:00,345 --> 00:04:02,696
So feel free to incorporate health into the narrative.

66
00:04:02,696 --> 00:04:06,646
Although we still recommend not putting it on the list in

67
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:11,277
part because the health issues will likely have already come up.

68
00:04:11,277 --> 00:04:14,720
Now there are a couple ways to use the values list.

69
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,455
The way I first presented it to you, the organic way,

70
00:04:18,455 --> 00:04:23,435
which is we ask look at this list what's important to you in that probe,

71
00:04:23,435 --> 00:04:26,435
we do not link it to the behavior directly.

72
00:04:26,435 --> 00:04:30,750
But sometimes you will find it works better to be more directive or

73
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:35,770
guiding in the way that you elicit the value selection by asking, hey, look

74
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:40,880
at this list of values which if any of these might be related to your behavior.

75
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,623
Try them both.

76
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,996
They work slightly differently and

77
00:04:44,996 --> 00:04:50,385
under different circumstances you'll find you might choose one over another.

78
00:04:50,385 --> 00:04:54,995
An interesting issue that has arisen in training folks to use these

79
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:57,968
strategies is how do I transition to this?

80
00:04:57,968 --> 00:04:59,021
What is the segue?

81
00:04:59,021 --> 00:05:04,016
It seems a little odd that all of a sudden I'm talking about these

82
00:05:04,016 --> 00:05:07,264
deeply personal values and attributes.

83
00:05:07,264 --> 00:05:11,914
So what you can see on the screen, our three sample

84
00:05:11,914 --> 00:05:17,020
segues to introduce the values of strength activity.

85
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:30,226
Take a look at the three.

86
00:05:30,226 --> 00:05:31,002
Which one do you prefer?

87
00:05:31,002 --> 00:05:33,905
Of course, feel free to edit.

88
00:05:33,905 --> 00:05:37,451
Tweak it, make it your own.

89
00:05:37,451 --> 00:05:40,055
The second strategy that we talked about earlier.

90
00:05:40,055 --> 00:05:44,444
This is done typically when confidence is lower than importance.

91
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:45,813
Is this strengths or abilities linkage.

92
00:05:45,813 --> 00:05:48,835
Here we're trying to build efficacy.

93
00:05:48,835 --> 00:05:53,826
We're trying to help the person feel more confident that they can tackle this

94
00:05:53,826 --> 00:05:57,665
change, be it smoking cessation, starting to exercise or

95
00:05:57,665 --> 00:05:59,834
controlling a chronic disease.

96
00:05:59,834 --> 00:06:03,784
So we typically ask the probes as listed on the slide, what are you good at,

97
00:06:03,784 --> 00:06:05,808
what is something you've achieved?

98
00:06:05,808 --> 00:06:08,145
What is something you've overcome.

99
00:06:08,145 --> 00:06:12,601
Next after they pick their strengths or abilities, we try and

100
00:06:12,601 --> 00:06:15,694
make a connection to the behavior at hand.

101
00:06:15,694 --> 00:06:17,071
So it might sound like this hey,

102
00:06:17,071 --> 00:06:19,270
your confidence to quit smoking was low as before.

103
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:25,189
Thinking about the strengths and abilities you picked like being a good father,

104
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:29,029
being good at sports, meeting challenges at work.

105
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:34,036
How about your successes or strength in these areas propel you to quit smoking?

106
00:06:34,036 --> 00:06:36,108
How might they boost your confidence?

107
00:06:36,108 --> 00:06:40,142
How might those inform you that you're gonna be able to do this.

108
00:06:40,142 --> 00:06:44,956
Now, we recommended using values of importance is low,

109
00:06:44,956 --> 00:06:47,675
strength of confidence is low.

110
00:06:47,675 --> 00:06:51,754
However, feel free to do both if you feel will be clinically helpful.

111
00:06:51,754 --> 00:06:56,945
Keep in mind that many of the items are on both lists like parenting and

112
00:06:56,945 --> 00:06:58,658
being a good athlete.

113
00:06:58,658 --> 00:07:02,059
So that's one of the reasons we generally recommend just doing one of the two.

114
00:07:02,059 --> 00:07:06,246
However, if you feel they need a boost in both importance and confidence,

115
00:07:06,246 --> 00:07:08,912
feel free to utilize both of these strategies.

116
00:07:08,912 --> 00:07:14,834
This concludes our section on eliciting change talk.

117
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:18,125
Today we've shown you two powerful strategies,

118
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:20,632
the values and strengths linkages and

119
00:07:20,632 --> 00:07:27,580
we've shown you an algorithm to help determine when to use each of these.
