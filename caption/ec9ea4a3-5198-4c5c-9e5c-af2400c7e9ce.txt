1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:04,930
So let's do this. What we will do is.

2
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:18,640
We will. So we will solve some selected questions from past exams.

3
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:31,690
We have uploaded in canvas all the exams from 2019, 2020 and 2021, and I would encourage you to sort of review those.

4
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:38,350
Look at the solution keep dry on your own first and then, you know, kind of while you are preparing for the exam.

5
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:51,130
So this should be very good preparation in addition to the lecture notes, the slides and the homeworks.

6
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:58,810
So the first question that I'm going to discuss is.

7
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:11,010
From 2019. And we are going to do this first set of like two falls short answer type questions.

8
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:26,070
And although we uploaded the solutions, but I want you guys to work with me alongside before I kind of,

9
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,400
you know, sort of give you the answers or you do.

10
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:41,410
The justification. So here is a simple linear regression model y equal to Paternot plus beta one Excite plus Epsilon II.

11
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:46,930
And we are assuming that Epsilon II has a normal distribution with mean.

12
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:51,910
Yes. Sorry, is. Could I please vote?

13
00:01:53,350 --> 00:02:00,070
Zoom in. Okay. Is it good?

14
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,140
Still not good. A little more. Okay. Okay.

15
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,840
Okay. Thank you.

16
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:17,070
So we have a simple linear regression model Y equal to bitterness plus B domain excite,

17
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:25,770
that's epsilon y and we assume that epsilon ie is distributed normally it means zero and radians sigma

18
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:36,750
squared and we assume that expected value of epsilon epsilon is equal to zero for all are not equal to g.

19
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,650
So the errors are uncorrelated.

20
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:48,000
Now for each of the following statements. Some say the statement is true or false.

21
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:54,780
And for this true false, I'm, you know, I, I don't need any justification.

22
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:59,820
But if we do see justification is needed, then you have to provide that.

23
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:12,350
So the first question is or the first statement is we need the normality assumption to derive the least squares estimates of beta zero and beta one.

24
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:26,860
Is this true or false? Is this a full statement of.

25
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,650
Fourth. We want to provide some justification.

26
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:41,280
You can help. Yeah.

27
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:54,210
So we do like the least squares. And then you actually did the normalization, then you actually don't need any these to be familiar.

28
00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:04,550
Go for the estimation bar in the least squares or the in the in the linear regression model.

29
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:09,200
You don't need the normality assumption. So this is a false statement.

30
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:16,490
Steven B The residuals from the SLR model have zero correlation.

31
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:25,380
True or false? Well.

32
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:33,730
Okay. I can see a bit more. Again.

33
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:38,680
Q I ask you how important. Okay.

34
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,950
So the the answer from here, is it false?

35
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:48,480
And the NGOs, by your assumption, are the list.

36
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,720
But the residual time. The next thing you'll see.

37
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:59,340
Member of the observe minus the predicted by minus by.

38
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:17,070
And in fact, in lecture, in module e, we should or we established the variance covariance matrix of the, uh, residual vector.

39
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:23,219
Okay. Uh, by using the a, the, the hacked matrix.

40
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:29,879
And if you remember, it's the variance covariance matrix is sigma squared times I minus E to it.

41
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,990
It is the prediction matrix. Okay.

42
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:40,139
So the errors are are are definitely correlated.

43
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,700
Oh sorry. That residuals are definitely correlated. Okay.

44
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:51,160
See the Chi Square distribution is symmetric about zero.

45
00:05:54,710 --> 00:06:00,370
True or false? I heard someone say.

46
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:13,709
It's false. Okay. It's positive.

47
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:17,130
It's a positive. You need to do things that don't really.

48
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,350
With all of these things positive, that industry cannot be symmetric about zero.

49
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:38,760
So this is, again, false. Okay.

50
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:47,220
Indeed, the constant variance assumption means that the variance of the Xs and Ys are seen.

51
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:57,700
What follows? What?

52
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:10,160
What is the constant variance assumption referred to? When we see.

53
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:16,850
When we talk about this. Yes.

54
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,780
So basically the variance of the air ducts.

55
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:30,040
Are assumed to be constant across all.

56
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:35,960
With the media circus in the night in the square for one I.

57
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:42,750
So this statement once again is false.

58
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:54,350
There is another name for the constant variance assumption anybody wants to.

59
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:04,830
See. Homeless kids do city so homeless scholastic assumption also means that the variance of the errors.

60
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:11,860
This constant does not depend on the level of its.

61
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:21,740
Okay. E r squared is the square of the Pearson correlation coefficient between the x and y values.

62
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:33,510
True or false? Through the lens.

63
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,720
They? It's too.

64
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,330
Again. It's true. So we'll get into sort of the average on this a little bit.

65
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,830
And a clip from the movie is the percent of variation explained by the musician.

66
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:14,360
So now we play down this question back to you and say, like, is this generally true for like a union regression?

67
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:21,700
Well. Will this be a full statement for MLA?

68
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:33,000
You're not sure? Anyone here? Was sure of about that.

69
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,820
No. So in general, this is not for these only one, but in particular.

70
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:48,060
Okay. So this is a true statement, but only holds for SLR.

71
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:49,649
Okay.

72
00:09:49,650 --> 00:10:06,330
So the next question is, and I give you a statement and I say prove or disprove the following statement, and this part does require justification.

73
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:15,720
So the statement is this In the SLR model above, if beta one hat is zero, then r squared is equal to zero.

74
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:23,489
Firstly, if you want to take a guess and tell me whether this is true or false, I love that.

75
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:26,490
And but I would need justification.

76
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:41,390
Is this true or false? It's true.

77
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:51,960
Okay. So. How would you sort of go about proving this?

78
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:59,450
Just just tell me, like the general approach and then, you know, I can go and sort of carry out or.

79
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,930
McCormick. You said you write the truth.

80
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:13,910
So what would be the best way of showing that Oxford equals Oxford is what it says are over access wide.

81
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:18,880
All right. So you fight against? Sure.

82
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:28,460
Yes. Did you have. Exactly.

83
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:34,790
Great. So if I can show that it's inside equal to zero, then I'm done.

84
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:39,140
So let me do a sort of show that a bit more formally.

85
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:42,470
That is the line of argument. So what is SSR?

86
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:50,670
It's this are is some like in general in the sort of general form of expression,

87
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:56,220
I'm going to write y, head minus y, but square some from it from one to n.

88
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:03,290
Right. This is the regression. Some of the models.

89
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:10,220
Some of square's. So what is why hack why hacked if I just plugin.

90
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:20,150
The expression from the app based on the least squares estimate of from the SLR model.

91
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:28,880
The y hat is beaten attacked last Beethoven had ixi minus y bar.

92
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:34,610
Square. Okay.

93
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:41,840
So this is equal to. From here to here.

94
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:48,900
Summation. I'm just writing out like. Lot more steps than you.

95
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:56,420
You could skip some of them. So what is better not hacked.

96
00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:04,580
From the least squares. Uh, equations we solve, then we get better.

97
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,719
Not had is equal to. Who wants to tell me?

98
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,520
Like the. So it's why bar miners.

99
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:21,170
I'm just writing the general formulation with the one hand expire.

100
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:32,550
Okay. Plus, I have. Beta one had excited.

101
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:43,160
Minus Y bar. Square. So if Beethoven had is zero.

102
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:53,810
Then these two arms drop off. And I'm left with y bar minus y bar squared.

103
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:59,810
Zero squared. Zero. So SSR is equal to zero.

104
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:06,899
Then for our square. Which is it sort of.

105
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:11,940
Or is this why? That is equal to zero.

106
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:14,970
Okay.

107
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:27,720
So in lecture, like, you know, sort of when I'm sure like kind of this sort of saw that in the other section, I said in lecture, I always say that.

108
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:34,910
This is the ACL in the in the above model is a lot bigger one equal to zero.

109
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:44,050
That's basically what we call the nominal, right? So in the letter I always refer to it as I, the non model.

110
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:49,450
So there is no forward information under the non model.

111
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,320
What is your best guess of based on all?

112
00:14:55,070 --> 00:15:04,790
We do have a lot of like why would you get an officer to deny what is your best guess of people are not it's just like bar the sample we.

113
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:14,229
So you would sort of. Approach it from there also that we want to have equal basically signifies the

114
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:20,290
non waterlogging the normal yearly square estimated for does not imply bar.

115
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:25,750
And so it's Assad is like like this like labor is this kind of like.

116
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:30,450
Showing it as a vehicle with more steps.

117
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:44,060
I think we are going to give points. If you argue that the oil is not going to land, the things that your best guess estimate was.

118
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:51,050
Discourse estimate for economic life on. Okay.

119
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:56,060
Good. Now, the next one is.

120
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:07,910
This problem also I would harm it would require you to justify your answer.

121
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:18,090
So here is some. 4G lit lit excite you know temperature in Celsius on a certain day and.

122
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:24,720
Excuse me. And why the ice cream sale in dollars? A Dairy Queen queen on that day.

123
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:32,700
Mr. Stack fitted a SLR model to the date and then decided he wanted to fit the model with temperatures recorded in Fahrenheit.

124
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:40,080
So he added another variable Z, which is the temperature in Fahrenheit to the above model heat.

125
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,490
So in other words,

126
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:54,300
he fitted the multiple linear regression model y equal to Paternot plus beta one exhibit excising Celsius less beta two zero cias in Fahrenheit.

127
00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:04,720
Plus Epsilon, I. So that what we are asking you is to comment on the above approach.

128
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:10,180
If you think it is appropriate, then comment on the relationship between the estimates of Bitcoin and B2.

129
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:13,690
If you think it is inappropriate, then please say why.

130
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:32,590
You take us? So excited is the temperature in Celsius and the 87% in Fahrenheit.

131
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:38,260
And we are fitting a multiple linear regression model with excitons as covidiots.

132
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:42,310
The question is, do you think this is an appropriate approach?

133
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:50,049
If if yes, then what is the relationship between those two members of BRCA1 and BRCA2?

134
00:17:50,050 --> 00:18:09,220
If not, then tell us why. Okay.

135
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:19,930
So here's the answer. It is not appropriate because I have do exactly biography and see your answer.

136
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:32,010
So the answer was it is not appropriate because if Science VII are linear before you do it and then you fix something at a certain.

137
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:38,920
You can get unique person is so.

138
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:47,660
Everybody is different. Yes.

139
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:58,670
Any marketing this region that needs. They you find that I mean, I do think that it's something that I'm not.

140
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:32,360
Exactly. Equal share? Yes. Okay.

141
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:39,980
Good. So let me just sort of make what I can go back and then get back.

142
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:44,620
So, like, if you answered like that. I could give you.

143
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:51,999
Maybe a little more than half the points. I was giving you a few points, and maybe I'll pick up.

144
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,120
On what? I mean, I think it's.

145
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,980
Because. Too many books can be recorded.

146
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:10,090
We talked about this. Michael, do you talk about the academy?

147
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:13,930
Near the end before we listen to people reading those.

148
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:20,580
But you can see the big evening celebrations of city squares, normally Christmas.

149
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:26,440
How how coordinated they are, how I mean,

150
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:37,420
how sort of strongly coordinated they are would influence your neck whether you're trying to for these matrixes,

151
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:47,890
blue or not, or merely merely think you would be affected by that, but purely because you do care.

152
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:53,280
And I'm going to give you fiction more. But sometimes there are people that are able to get to.

153
00:20:54,820 --> 00:21:01,620
So. So your answer was right. But your justification was not forcing anything that.

154
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:14,280
What is justification is for you to extend visas because we know that there is a deterministic relationship between centigrade in four,

155
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,550
it might be by five. Nine.

156
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:22,740
So what do these things there is something name for that that we've talked about in.

157
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:35,410
More unity. This means independence. Between X and Y is an exact function, the function of the other.

158
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:46,410
And you could write it as basically. You know, it's over five equals -39.

159
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:56,680
So there's a sticky dependency. And so the design matrix here would be less than two that.

160
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:04,210
Or in other words, you will not be able. In one example, The Matrix.

161
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:09,100
So you will not be able to do all the things that you need.

162
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,770
Solutions to the normal equation.

163
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:18,600
So I would give. That sort of point.

164
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:23,280
But. I would pick up some forms for that.

165
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:27,980
Does that make sense and does that. Sounds reasonable.

166
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,850
You want to add anything? Yeah.

167
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:40,420
So. So be careful about. And you'll see, like we talked about it in the context of like what needed to be said that.

168
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:46,200
You know, often times in the month when you get ignition, one of the vehicles will be cool with it.

169
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,740
But when does it become dangerous?

170
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:58,170
Or. That we will learn how to assess, to monitor, for diagnostics.

171
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:07,950
But the early detection, that sort of between periods that are benign or other ones does not affect the.

172
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:19,210
Okay. So. So again, this is inappropriate approach.

173
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:28,750
And precisely because of. Linear dependance.

174
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:36,710
Between. I.

175
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:55,180
So the design matrix is less than two. Okay.

176
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:05,580
So will not be able to opt in. Uniquely squared first two meters for better one and better to use.

177
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:15,889
Yes. The design metrics here would be I mean, we we call the design metrics as X here.

178
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:23,330
You know, it's a little to it. So the first column is the column of wants, then you will have just for the suit.

179
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:28,300
These are the centigrade temperatures. C one.

180
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:33,130
C two. CNN and then for an.

181
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,270
Okay. Any other questions?

182
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:51,930
Question e. Okay. Okay.

183
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:59,130
So I remember in the. President of the coalition between black and white.

184
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:06,060
Yes. Is the general. Okay.

185
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:09,990
Good question. So anybody wants to answer that.

186
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:21,200
So our studies, we see that split is the 40 you can look at for efficient between why are you and why you have.

187
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:53,490
Okay. So so the answer then your answer is yes.

188
00:25:53,490 --> 00:26:04,080
Like it's a true statement. Okay. And that's that is a justification, but it's kind of an indirect justification.

189
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:15,540
Do you agree? Anybody can give me a little sort of more detailed justification.

190
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:19,790
So the statement is in. King David.

191
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:37,000
Can you argue from the building's convenience with your supply chain?

192
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:45,860
My. That. So what is?

193
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:52,990
What is? What is? Why have. How do I find have?

194
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:12,780
In terms of like the projection matrix.

195
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:29,530
Okay. So here. Exactly. So firstly, the statement is correct.

196
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:35,060
Negative. So I think so why take is eight times.

197
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:42,880
Why is that happening? Everybody remember that now, right?

198
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:50,360
Right. I see. The cool gradients between Y and h, y and from.

199
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,780
Okay. Okay, great.

200
00:27:56,710 --> 00:28:03,130
Let's look at the second problem on this before the break.

201
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:07,659
So I just want to add one one comment on this party.

202
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:13,600
So asked, where is the horror stories of world affairs in quotation marks?

203
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:20,260
So when we talk about this, is that definitely true for for a simple linear regression, but for modern linear regression?

204
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:25,140
So the Pearson correlation, that's between two variables, right?

205
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:33,100
Between well, if you have x1x2, then you can talk about here the variation between Y and X plus four periods of relation between Y.

206
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:41,300
So that's between two variables are. But our square is a matter of the overall fate of the mall.

207
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:42,710
If you talk about our square.

208
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:54,680
Remember that our square is proportional to the variation in the response, one that's explained by the exact modified linear regression model,

209
00:28:55,400 --> 00:29:01,580
its assessment of the overall goodness of the model, and how well overall the model is.

210
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:08,930
So if you are model, linear regression model, then R squared. Again, it matters how the model performs overall.

211
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:16,340
So Peter, the coalition look at how not a matter of interpreting what each pulled out of it.

212
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,810
So that's why if we're not going Russia our square, it's not a different coalition.

213
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:41,980
Porterfield 740 election. You can see us waiting to see why.

214
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:48,950
In the design we use the design which says many products are responding to the different experience.

215
00:29:55,320 --> 00:30:00,270
You can be flying, but you have to take only fear of the fly and explain why.

216
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:05,520
And it's why. And it's been so on when you have got people to central.

217
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:12,680
Does that make sense? That that's what it sounds like?

218
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:23,410
Okay. So the next problem. Consider the regression to the origin model.

219
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:37,430
So we had mentioned in both sections that, you know, you can be asked to sort of because there was a question, will there be kind of like.

220
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,960
Derivation questions and answer is yes.

221
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:54,750
There can be when you apply the basic first principles to like how we derived any squares, estimate of how we do the normal equations and so on.

222
00:30:55,260 --> 00:31:03,000
So here's a problem like that. So this is considered this model.

223
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:06,780
Why are equal to one side plus Ypsilanti.

224
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:13,889
There is no better not. There's no intercept in the model. This is referred to as the regression to the origin model.

225
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:20,730
We have talked about the regression to the origin model in lecture and I showed you a picture as

226
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:29,219
to when you know biologically it would be possible in order to fit a edition from the origin.

227
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:40,440
But it's not a biological possibility. The model then is the just one based on the for the intercept is non-significant.

228
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:46,150
Then don't simply drop things. Just sit on the wall and do a division.

229
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:53,810
So we we had some good discussion about this model. But now assume that we are fitting distribution to the origin model.

230
00:31:54,650 --> 00:32:04,130
So once again, the assumptions that we make are epsilon. I has normal between zero variance sigma squared and errors are uncorrelated.

231
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:11,030
So the first part asks you to derive early squares estimated for beta one.

232
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:23,360
Oh, how did we in the in the in the general context of our SLR, how did we derive the normal equations for solving for beta?

233
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:27,440
Not in beta. Want to start from there? Start from the first principle.

234
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:30,590
So what? What do we do first? We write the.

235
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:38,710
Expression for. SCC first.

236
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,850
Right. Okay. So what is SSI in this model?

237
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:49,130
So SSI. Is equal to summation.

238
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:52,940
Why you hacked. Sorry.

239
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:57,110
Y minus y you hacked square.

240
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:04,640
So what is white hat? It's Beethoven hat, Ixi.

241
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:10,999
So this is my. Is this E. Okay.

242
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,059
So what do you do up in the air?

243
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:18,049
At least squares estimated for beta one. Then what do I do?

244
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:27,330
I speak. The first dedicated with respect to Beethoven.

245
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:36,090
And equate that to zero. So in other words.

246
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:49,020
This gives me. So here is my SSD. So I did the first derivative of this expression with respect to the one hand.

247
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:52,770
And what do I get? I get.

248
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:58,110
So I have a two that I kind of get dropped off.

249
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:07,240
I have y. Minus one hat if I.

250
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:13,589
And then from the beta one had that same expression.

251
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:19,890
I have a minus two, minus six, so I have a minus two exercise.

252
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:25,030
So I the minus two drops off. So I have XY.

253
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:32,510
Equal to zero. So I have to solve for this.

254
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:38,629
Okay. So what is if I solve for this?

255
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:52,210
What do I get? Summation essay. Why? Minus Beatle hat with the one hat summation exercise squared is equal to zero.

256
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,740
Therefore. What is Beethoven had?

257
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:06,100
Beta one hat is summation ixi y.

258
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:16,320
Divided by summation exercise square. So that's why Lee squared estimated for Beto one.

259
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:28,890
Okay. So now what is the I have to show whether this estimate there is is unbiased or not.

260
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:34,510
So in order to show if it's unbiased or not, what do I need?

261
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:40,290
I need to calculate the expected value of beta one hat. So what is expected value of beta one hat?

262
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:51,100
So in the in the expression for Beethoven, heck, what is the random quantity?

263
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:58,960
Why? Right. I mean, the denominator I have summation makes size square.

264
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:12,100
That speaks. So that's like a monster. If I can get it outside their expectation and I can write this as one over submission exercise square.

265
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:17,900
Expected value of summation ixi y.

266
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:24,970
Yes. Okay.

267
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:32,080
Now, once again, the only part that is random is by essay is like a constant.

268
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:36,460
So I can interchange the expectation and the summation signs.

269
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:44,590
So I'm just going to do that. So I'm going to write this as.

270
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,920
Trying to save space inside.

271
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:54,560
Summation Ixi expected value of y.

272
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:15,580
Yes. What is the expected value of Y?

273
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:33,489
Under the model. Under the model.

274
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:44,180
What is expected value of y? Who wants to tell me? But I want to say.

275
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:48,770
Okay, so I have Beto on side.

276
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,219
So what happens? I have beta one summation.

277
00:37:54,220 --> 00:38:02,290
It's so square divided by summation. It's a square. So the summation, it's so square gets cancel from the numerator and denominator.

278
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:05,840
I'm left with that one. So.

279
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:12,470
Veto on head is indeed unbiased.

280
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:28,100
Okay. What is the variance of beta one hack? Variants of beta one have.

281
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:38,520
Is equal to. Once again, I can apply the variance formula.

282
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:49,590
So this is Beethoven had this like a constant one over a constant times, like a random quantity.

283
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:55,460
So what happens to the variance expression? I have one over that constant square.

284
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:59,150
Correct. So I have one over summation.

285
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:04,050
Exercise. Square. Square of that whole thing.

286
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:11,580
And then I have evidence of some Mission X, Y.

287
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:26,770
So in other words, what do I have? I have once again, one word, summation, exercise, square.

288
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:33,250
Square of that. And then what happens to this?

289
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,170
Variance of the sum of random variables. How can I detect?

290
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:53,590
Variance of some of random variable supply. The variance formula is equal to.

291
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:12,420
Does everybody recognize this expression? It's I'm talking about variants of some of.

292
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:19,540
On this of marriage. Why I.

293
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:26,240
Okay. Good. So let's write the obedience part first.

294
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:33,200
So this is going to be what summation again, excised like a constant.

295
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:37,200
Right? It's I squared times variance of why I.

296
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:45,000
Plus you are seeing that there is also a convenient storm on both the Y.

297
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:55,160
Exactly. So the corporate storm drops off because why and why do you remember this at the old serve?

298
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:56,930
Wise,

299
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:09,670
they are uncoordinated by the assumption of the by the assumption that the errors are unfolding related so basically drops off the obedience term.

300
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:13,600
So what am I left with? I'm left with this.

301
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:20,260
And what is variance of why I. What is variance of y according to my model?

302
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:33,270
Sigma Square? Correct. Because why is beta one side plus epsilon nine billions of y is equal to variants of Ypsilanti, which is Sigma Square.

303
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:41,260
So what do I get? I get sigma squared over summation squared.

304
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:47,450
That's my variance. Okay.

305
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:51,590
Now, do the residuals. Some two zero.

306
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:59,880
Before. Before doing the proof. Who wants to take a guess?

307
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:08,840
Do the it was some two zero. In this model.

308
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:31,980
No. No. Okay. So if that is true, it's my hunch that most of.

309
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:47,920
The sample. Being. You are saying that for this model?

310
00:42:49,190 --> 00:43:00,649
Okay. Let let me just so the answer is correct the residuals do not necessarily some zero year.

311
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:04,010
Remember the model does not contain an intercept.

312
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:07,460
The model has no intercept. So.

313
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,370
Not necessarily. The answer is not necessarily.

314
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:21,250
What about the residuals? Some of the residuals here?

315
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:29,040
So what are the residuals? The why? Minus Y had.

316
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:38,470
Right. And what is why hack why hacking this model is between hack time sexy.

317
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:44,880
Yes we did. I believe squirts estimated for beta one in part E.

318
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:54,629
I'm just going to plug that in. So it's equal to summation ixi y divided by summation size squared.

319
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:59,840
That's my beta one had. Times XIV.

320
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:16,700
Yes. So this is equal to summation.

321
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:22,520
Why? I from one end.

322
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:28,660
Minus. Submission Ixi.

323
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:37,810
Dime summation essay. Why? Divided by summation exercise square.

324
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:55,480
We need not be equal to zero. So can I.

325
00:44:55,500 --> 00:45:00,960
Before we quickly go to the last part, can I just ask an additional question here?

326
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:08,460
So you give the correct answer. But I was not very happy with the justification.

327
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:12,180
I mean, you know, like, of course, now we have the proof, you know?

328
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:24,580
So that's why I would ask this question. If I give you the simple linear regression model, why, you cannot be the one to see the night.

329
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:30,500
And I ask the same question Do the residuals accidentally hack into that model sample zero.

330
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:41,370
What would be the answer? You know, in the Britain markets including immigration models like the and.

331
00:45:51,470 --> 00:46:03,860
You can see even got more problematic. So that you can the SLR model.

332
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:08,660
Bread and butter is the recipe that some people.

333
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:18,950
Yes. Will you be able to prove that?

334
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:32,800
The sole. This module, the main sort of or the main themes of this module?

335
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:37,540
This is that is not he does not have any.

336
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:47,250
They just kind of acts like. Like a century.

337
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:53,890
Why? Okay.

338
00:46:54,200 --> 00:47:01,930
So and then the last part comes, what is the distribution of beta one had?

339
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:13,450
So beta one had from the first part was summation exercise lie divided by summation exercise square.

340
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:19,680
Right. So can I write this as.

341
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:29,250
Something like this. Summation y assumption w.

342
00:47:29,270 --> 00:47:33,410
I. Y. So like linear combination of the wise where.

343
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:44,630
W is equal to. IXI divided by summation exercise square.

344
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,500
So I can write better one half as a linear combination of the of the Y.

345
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:05,340
And what do I know about. So if I have, I know the why are normally distributed by assumption.

346
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:15,560
So what about the linear combination of the wise? It's also normal, right?

347
00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:39,139
So linear combination of normals. Be the one had will also have a normal distribution with mean equal to bitcoin and

348
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:44,810
variants equal to sigma squared divided by summation exercise squared which we derived.

349
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:54,640
In fact. See, I think like. Okay.

350
00:48:57,710 --> 00:49:03,140
So that's it. And stop here over to pay some.

351
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:11,370
And. I will just.

352
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:19,600
See this? Take.

353
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:30,690
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's like a two day, maybe a five minute, you know, can you guys we all have a, you know, 5 minutes break before we.

354
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:36,410
Oh, yeah. We have to.

355
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:54,140
Yeah. Yeah. I must say, like, despite the fact that you're from the Northern.

356
00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:01,790
But said people shouldn't have to be asked to deny.

357
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:08,050
Oh, yes.

358
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:12,610
2020. 2020.

359
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:18,110
Oh, yes, that's true. Okay. No. Then that's fine. I'll just use the answer here.

360
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:24,940
Do you want to go through 2020? Yeah. Maybe go to 2020 to bring that along.

361
00:50:25,310 --> 00:50:29,650
Yeah, that's right. That's right. And also, I think I'll go with the question.

362
00:50:29,650 --> 00:50:35,650
Do you want to start with, you know, starts, too?

363
00:50:35,830 --> 00:50:38,950
Sure. So can we go back to the statement?

364
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:44,940
Which one statement segment?

365
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:49,600
We each have this one.

366
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:55,600
Yeah. So I believe you in the slides with that. We see that as our square is the square.

367
00:50:55,610 --> 00:51:01,179
So if you sample correlation between excellent bias and correlation coefficient.

368
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:05,320
Yes. So this is the sample is the whole population.

369
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:14,890
So yeah, it's the basically the Pearson correlation there is based on this need not be used to send me a subject

370
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:22,160
that is more rigorous to say it's a Samuel Pearson quotation I'm not just given here's incarnations.

371
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:30,760
Um, so, so if I had this is I run an exam maybe because it is for because false.

372
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:33,780
Because if I use it as a sample.

373
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:43,710
No. But how do we calculate the population for it is impossible to.

374
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:51,579
Yeah. Yeah. I mean don't like that should be specified.

375
00:51:51,580 --> 00:52:01,810
Are assembled carefully probably. But but I'm saying is that can I offer some justification in terms of when I met such and such.

376
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:11,190
Yeah. That's why I'm saying like if you if there is a doubt like this, I mean if you write some justification in.

377
00:52:11,470 --> 00:52:17,470
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely. Absolutely. If you provide justification, it's better for us to be okay.

378
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:23,030
Right. But what I'm saying is also like, if you have a doubt like that, please ask the exam.

379
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:27,280
Okay. So it makes sense.

380
00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:34,120
But if you want to ask them for A or B,

381
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:42,370
is there a case such that the results from this just so I know that the ratio

382
00:52:42,730 --> 00:52:52,030
cause covariance matrix for the registry for Sigma Square games ie minus eight.

383
00:52:52,480 --> 00:53:01,650
So is there anything about it that could be an artifact of the data is that that would be a

384
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:09,160
parallel that is that we have has to be an artifact of the group in general for example,

385
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:26,470
you know you know, and it may have happened up here, but not necessarily because it's one of the things that makes sense.

386
00:53:26,530 --> 00:53:29,960
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

387
00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:32,065
And like the middle, like for problem.
