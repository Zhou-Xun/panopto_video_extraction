1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,980
Okay. Finally. Thanks for your patience.

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:23,129
So today we're going to start a new unit. I really like this unit on groundwater, and it's a really critical topic and one that is often new to folks,

3
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:32,020
but it's super important and it's something that we all need to remember that is in many regards,

4
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:40,890
we're going to be, I believe one of our challenges over the next decades is part of climate change,

5
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,990
is sustainability, and everything else is just so critical for us to understand.

6
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:52,919
It's a finite resource. It is kind of like endangered if it gets contaminated.

7
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,850
If I get into endangered species or it goes extinct, it's almost like that.

8
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:05,969
I'll show you more of this particular slide later. But this was done actually 15 years ago.

9
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:11,670
Now a d view of an aquifer system underneath a Superfund site.

10
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:19,470
Okay. And still people have no idea about the subsurface environment of so out of sight, out of mind.

11
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:26,280
What we're looking at here is concentrations of the contaminant shown in blue.

12
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:31,019
We have the surface up here. This is an old quarry.

13
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:42,600
So it's about a 30 meter relief in Metamora, Michigan, about, oh, I don't know, 100 K from here, not even 50 or 60 miles.

14
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:54,390
We have the top of the groundwater here is measured by all these vertical lines, which are actually wells that were put into place on the surface.

15
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:01,739
We have an aqua tar here, another layer of groundwater here and an intermediate aquifer,

16
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,180
another equatorial and then another aquifer, the third aquifer.

17
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,620
Okay. And then sort of bedrock beneath.

18
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:19,740
And, you know, this is a reconstruction of an amazingly complex system which we need to understand, though.

19
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:25,350
Okay. And we're going to get into this and you're going to understand all of this stuff.

20
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:36,060
So my objectives in this area are to talk about groundwater, including drinking water sources, common sources of contaminants in the system.

21
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,460
I want to introduce some hydrology to you.

22
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:54,120
The hydrologic cycle. This is easy stuff, but then we'll get into more details with the subsurface environments and aquifers in particular saturated,

23
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:59,999
unsaturated environments confined to unconfined aquifers, notions of head stasis,

24
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,650
law, things like this that determine the transport and fate of contaminants.

25
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:13,740
Okay. And that's really the emphasis that I have here will introduce some models and do some case studies.

26
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,820
So it's a lot of stuff to do in four or 5 hours, something like that.

27
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,550
But it's a really important topic. You have readings, this is all on canvas.

28
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:29,790
And I like to start off with a simple question Where does your drinking water come from?

29
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:35,690
Who knows? Mine's coming from my mug.

30
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:41,990
Where's yours? Country. Well, which one of my house.

31
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:48,550
Where do you live? Right. You have your own world, not our own world.

32
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,780
Well, water. Okay. So do you know where it comes from? Not yet.

33
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:03,090
Is it a community water supply? You pay a water bill, all right?

34
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:12,800
No. Okay. Currently, I get my water from the cup, but back home, I get my water from the Lake Huron watershed.

35
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:20,830
Well, okay. We're about to be added to the Huron Water Treatment Platform for you from Port Huron.

36
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:25,470
Okay. Which is taking surface water. Yeah, I assume so too.

37
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:28,090
Okay. I think you know it.

38
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:36,229
And I really get it from here on the river where we get some of it from the Grand River and then we get most of it from groundwater or it depends.

39
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:39,350
They actually have two sources. Okay.

40
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:46,790
So I mean, it's your choice. You either get it from surface water or you get it from groundwater unless you get it from rainfall cistern,

41
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:50,510
which probably nobody does in this country. Okay. All right.

42
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:58,910
So, you know, nationally, it's important to understand that we have public water supplies where you pay a utility bill.

43
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:06,680
Okay. And they are either community water systems like Ann Arbor or Detroit or whatever,

44
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:12,520
or perhaps it's like apartment complex or a trailer park or something like that.

45
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,860
They have what we call non community water supplies.

46
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:23,710
There's many more of these, but they tend to be small. The community water supplies draw from surface water or groundwater.

47
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:28,100
You can see the numbers here and the population served.

48
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:34,760
So we have in this country, this is old data, but the trends are pretty similar because infrastructure changes so slowly.

49
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,690
We have about two thirds of people getting surface water and about a third groundwater.

50
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,020
And then in these non community systems, which are really small, again,

51
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:53,210
most people have their own well and they and this is a tremendous headache because they're totally unregulated.

52
00:05:53,750 --> 00:06:02,090
We have no idea what's coming out of that. Well, except that typically most states require you to do a beta test to see if there's bacteria in it.

53
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,890
That's about it. But in terms of contamination, no idea. Okay.

54
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:15,770
So the community water systems are drawing from groundwater, often the non community almost always drawing from there.

55
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:19,750
And so we have to understand what is groundwater okay, and what is surface water?

56
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,600
So these cartoons are demonstrating a couple of points.

57
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,860
The first point is the groundwater. Obviously, it's in the ground.

58
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,760
It's underneath the water table. If you can see in this light blue right here,

59
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:41,899
this line delineates pores or cracks that are saturated with water as compared to

60
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:46,190
above that line where they're partially saturated or not saturated or unsaturated.

61
00:06:46,850 --> 00:07:00,139
Okay. All similar terms and um, this is showing you then the unsaturated zone also called the Vito's zone where roots extend and so forth.

62
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:11,629
But this water table depth can be almost at the surface down to in an arid area like Arizona or something could be a thousand feet below the surface,

63
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,520
can be very, very deep. Depends where you are.

64
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:25,040
Aquifers are defined as water bearing reservoirs that can yield enough water to meet some sort of demand.

65
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:30,980
So there's kind of this market or use component to the definition.

66
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:38,000
Typically, there's sand or gravel aquifers may be depicted here.

67
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:45,950
There are bedrock aquifers depicted here where water is stored and rocks, the fractures and cracks and things like this.

68
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:52,750
Okay. And then there are unconfined and confined aquifers and we're going to spend a lot more time on that.

69
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:56,870
But the unconfined aquifer is at the surface.

70
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:02,660
For example, in this picture here, the rain comes down, infiltrates through the unsaturated zone.

71
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,920
The saturated zone is the unconfined aquifer. It rains a lot.

72
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:11,090
The water table will rise. Okay.

73
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:15,620
And if it gets really, really where it could be at the surface, like a bog or marsh.

74
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:20,720
Okay. And if you pump water out, it'll sink. And we're going to talk about all this and more.

75
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:30,920
In contrast, confined aquifers is shown in the bottom part of the slide right here are underneath some sort of confining bed, typically shared.

76
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:36,050
Over rock or clay or some some media like this, which doesn't pass water very well.

77
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:39,800
And that's just called a confined aquifer.

78
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:47,120
They can be sand gravel, they can be limestone, they can be fractured rock.

79
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:52,670
So just knowing what it is doesn't tell you. You have to know whether it's confined or unconfined.

80
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:58,460
The definitions here also talk about aqua turds or confining layers shown in gray here.

81
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:02,089
This is where water does not prefer to float.

82
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:08,990
It's not impenetrable, it's not impermeable completely, but it's relatively hard for water to go through.

83
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:17,030
And I've already talked about the water table, which separates the unsaturated above and the saturated below.

84
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:25,670
Okay, got it. So if you have a well, where are you getting your water from?

85
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,980
An aquifer. Which aquifer? Depends how deep the well is.

86
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:35,150
Which would be the preferred aquifer. And a pressure like this.

87
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:46,430
No. And it looks good.

88
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:53,330
Come on. You don't have to do it correctly.

89
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,180
But then again.

90
00:09:54,340 --> 00:10:07,590
And lengthy and you can find out this like these are important considerations the unconfined aquifers will see is really prone to contamination.

91
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:11,490
Okay. And so we really want to get clean water.

92
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:16,680
So we like to go and people. But you're exactly right. I mean, the cost of drilling is expensive.

93
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:20,249
And so if you're a farmer, you just need a lot of water.

94
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:30,630
You don't care about quality. You're going to use the unconfined aquifer. If your drinking water is, you typically want to go into a confined aquifer.

95
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:40,469
So we'll talk about. Great aquifers are used extensively in this country and everywhere else.

96
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:44,250
And most of that water is for irrigation, for crops.

97
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:50,760
Okay. That's a national level picture, you know, two thirds roughly for that.

98
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:56,700
You can see the other uses here. Public water supplies represent roughly 20%.

99
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:07,950
Every state in the country uses groundwater. Some states get almost all of their water from groundwater because they don't have any surface water.

100
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,790
Those states are all in crisis, okay, because groundwater tables are dropping.

101
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:19,140
The wells have to be dug deeper and deeper.

102
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:28,800
Michigan, we are so lucky. Okay. For groundwater supplies are very abundant as our surface water.

103
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:38,060
This cartoon shows sources of groundwater contamination.

104
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:43,430
We have lots of them. Okay. Starting at the left.

105
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:59,450
Here's what we call a deep injection well. And this is a lined multilayer well, which is designed to inject pump before waste into the injection zone,

106
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:05,840
typically beneath aquifers that are used for drinking water or other purposes.

107
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:15,350
We have several of these in Michigan. Okay. It's a way to get rid of pump of all sludge is waste and solvents and things like this.

108
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:19,730
Not very sustainable if you think about it. But, you know, these things are used.

109
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:28,190
You know, if this develops a leak and gets into an aquifer.

110
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:34,670
Bad news. All right. We have an unlined landfill next to it.

111
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:40,080
You have to remember, before 1980 or so, all landfills were abandoned.

112
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:45,080
There wasn't any requirement for that. They generate leachate.

113
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:55,640
Rainfall comes in, picks up. Whatever is in there, may move into unsaturated zone and then into the water table.

114
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,890
By the way, note here, this is important.

115
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:04,520
The water table in this picture is this line right here, and it's shown with a triangle and a couple of bars under it.

116
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:09,560
Okay. That's the universal symbol for the water table. Okay.

117
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:16,410
Cesspool discharge, fertilizer, pesticides all occurring at the surface.

118
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,880
Liquids that are generated will go through the unsaturated soils.

119
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:29,270
Make their way into the water table potentially. We've got a drinking water.

120
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:35,930
Well, for this residents pulling in water from this aquifer.

121
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,380
This is a confined aquifer. Okay.

122
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:45,950
We have a waste lagoon here. We have a factory dumping into a stream.

123
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:56,360
Stream moves along. It's in what we call direct communication with this unsaturated water table aquifer.

124
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:02,120
That means that water from the aquifer can get into the stream and vice versa.

125
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:06,350
Water from the stream get into the aquifer. It's communicating back and forth.

126
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:16,400
So that's a potential source of contamination. Another pumping well, in this case in the surface table aquifer.

127
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:23,690
And we have lots of pipes that connect the sewage to the wastewater treatment plant.

128
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:31,010
And they typically have lots of leaks and they will contaminate the aquifer as well.

129
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:38,420
In almost all of these cases, the aquifer that's most at risk, the upper aquifer,

130
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:44,720
the unsaturated or water table aquifer, there's a number of different names to okay.

131
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:53,250
Questions we could. I'm zooming in a little bit.

132
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,810
If you look at a business, for example, you know,

133
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:05,910
there are various opportunities here to have discharges into soils and groundwater and they are, you know, shown as a cartoon here.

134
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:15,480
Floor drains, septic systems leaking, underground storage tanks called lost surface spills, land disposal.

135
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:21,840
All these situations can end up with waste getting into the soil and then ultimately into the groundwater.

136
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:27,210
Is this common? Absolutely. Okay. Absolutely.

137
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:39,080
Zooming in a little bit more. Here's a website and we have who knows what's been disposed in there.

138
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,879
It could be municipal or industrial waste. It can generate leachate.

139
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:53,920
This picture is messed up because the only way a liquid will move in the unsaturated zone is straight downward.

140
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:59,770
Okay. And here it shows that by going off at an angle that can't be right, it'll go straight down.

141
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:03,490
It may diffuse, disperse a bit, but the angle will be downward.

142
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:11,830
What's also interesting here is there are drums that were buried in the ground.

143
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:15,940
The mean life of a steel drum buried in the ground.

144
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:20,200
Who knows? Ten years, maybe. It's not very long. It's going to leak.

145
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:30,229
Okay. This is also showing a couple of other pathways.

146
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:35,750
We have sorbet and some of the chemicals that are perhaps in the leachate from the

147
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:40,580
waste site or from the drums may stick onto the surface soils not move very much.

148
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:45,800
Okay, we call that sortation. There may be a certain amount of degradation.

149
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:49,040
Okay. So the chemicals may degrade over time.

150
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:59,299
There may be a certain amount of volatile zation moving upward and plants can even take these chemicals up in cases and degrade them,

151
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,870
potentially volatiles them or sequester them.

152
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:13,130
And one of the approaches that's used a little bit is to, in fact, plant in contaminated soil, certain vegetation,

153
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:21,490
with the idea that the roots will take up some of the chemicals and pick them up and put them into the leafy part.

154
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:28,280
You can cut off leaf part and reduce some of the chemical contamination or form of what's called phyto remediation.

155
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:35,090
Does it work? To an extent. Okay. Certain chemicals, again, triangle.

156
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,480
A couple of lines underneath our water table here. Okay.

157
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:47,890
This picture is also showing a couple of other pathways. We have runoff and degradation.

158
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:54,280
We're talking about surface runoff. So this is just overland flow in a precipitation event.

159
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:01,240
And of course, the water table can move and the groundwater can move as well.

160
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:06,340
Excuse me. Okay.

161
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,270
So this comes from one of those old EPA reports talking about sources of groundwater

162
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:14,050
contamination parallel with what we saw for surface water contamination.

163
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:21,130
Number one source in the US is underground storage tanks that are leaking.

164
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:26,870
Okay. There are millions of these in Michigan, millions of storage tanks.

165
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:32,770
Okay. And most of them, fortunately, at this point have been replaced with better tanks.

166
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:40,060
But, you know, there over the over the decades, just millions of lead.

167
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:48,280
Hmm. Number two, septic systems. Number three, landfills, industrial facilities, fertilizer applications, spills,

168
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:56,260
waste sites, impoundments feedlots, pipelines, injection wells, urban runoff, waste piles.

169
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:05,830
Lots of things. Okay. Basically, any activity at the surface where chemicals are involved can produce a source of groundwater contamination.

170
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:17,050
This is based on a subset of states reporting to the US EPA.

171
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:23,470
And you know, if you we look at a couple of categories here, leaking underground storage tanks,

172
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:30,580
the 22 states reporting at this time had a total of 85,000 sites,

173
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:40,840
of which 48,000 had confirmed releases and 15,000 had confirmed groundwater contamination.

174
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,800
So you can have an underground storage tank. It may not leak. It may leak.

175
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:50,650
You may not be able to confirm that the groundwater is contaminated or not, but you can probably assume that it is.

176
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:55,720
One of the things that's actually quite interesting here are surplus sites.

177
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:01,930
These are Superfund sites, and they can be either on the national priority list,

178
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:08,559
which gives federal money to clean them up or not on it, and recreates sites as a Resource Conservation Recovery Act.

179
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:15,100
These are the major pieces of federal legislation cercla and require designed to clean up underground.

180
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:24,550
Well, no superfund sites, just large spills. The challenge here is that after cleanup, which we call corrective action,

181
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:31,060
many of the sites still continue to have releases and continue to contaminate groundwater.

182
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:38,140
Okay. So this is a broad program designed to clean them up. It doesn't resolve the issue.

183
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:46,030
Okay. And then finally, you know, down here, national priority list and places are Superfund sites.

184
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:51,430
And in the universal Superfund law, there's 1500 of them.

185
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:59,350
Here's a category of 307. And almost all of them have water contamination, groundwater contamination.

186
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:08,770
Okay. So Superfund was really critical piece of legislation because it was specifically designed to look at groundwater contamination.

187
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:23,169
In Michigan, looking at, what, five years of data in the millennium period,

188
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:33,340
I guess the number of underground storage tanks is about 8000 that are leaking.

189
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:37,300
And then each year about another thousand were cleaned up.

190
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:49,990
Okay. And this comes in to play after recall was passed in 84, I believe, and there was an active program to remediate underground storage tanks.

191
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,160
And let me show you sort of what was done.

192
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,620
You fill up with gas at your gas station. You don't think too much about anything except the price.

193
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:06,520
I love the plots showing like approval rating of the economy and the gas price.

194
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:11,200
And they're like inversely related. Completely. But think about what happens underneath.

195
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:17,200
When you pull up the dispenser, you're basically drawing down an underground storage tank.

196
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:23,740
Okay. And there's typically several of them and underground lines and so forth.

197
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:30,730
And the issue is, if any of that system leaks, then you're going to end up contaminating the groundwater.

198
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:34,930
Okay. And the mean life of a steel tank.

199
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,630
Again, it varies, but it can be a short is ten years.

200
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:43,840
That means if you pulled up to a gas station that was 20, 30 years old, most likely it was leaking.

201
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:51,190
Okay. And what would happen in the leak? Well, it's kind of depicted in this cartoon, and we'll get a lot more into this.

202
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,950
But maybe it's a pinhole leak at the bottom of the tank.

203
00:22:54,430 --> 00:23:00,010
So you're going to have the gasoline or diesel or whatever it has in there leaking downward, spreading a little bit vertically,

204
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:09,430
settling, reaching, then the water table eventually in Michigan, typically just a few meters down, what's going to happen?

205
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:14,680
Water is heavier or denser than gasoline.

206
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:24,940
The gasoline is going to float on top. Okay. We're going to call gasoline a l natural light, non aqueous phase liquid.

207
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:28,390
I'm going to get more into that. Okay. That's important.

208
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:36,850
So it's going to float on top. It's going to depress the groundwater a little bit, but it's going to basically spread on top of the saturated zone.

209
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:42,520
Okay. Some of it's going to dissolve. And groundwater is always flowing.

210
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:52,089
It's going to move with the groundwater flow. Some of it's going to get into the unsaturated zone and then the vapor is going to come out.

211
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:52,749
I mean, after all,

212
00:23:52,750 --> 00:24:00,820
gasoline is pretty volatile and needs to multiply so you can burn it in your car and that vapor is going to contaminate the soil as well.

213
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:07,710
So this is a classic picture of an L Napa light, not aqueous phase liquid.

214
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:14,280
And here it is in a lot more detail, showing you sort of models of soil vapor transport,

215
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:21,510
which is a priority in many, many areas for the reason that this kind of presents a lot of human exposure.

216
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:27,120
Okay. So again, here is your aboveground storage tank.

217
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:34,470
In this case, leaking the gasoline or the product is moving down vertically.

218
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:38,549
It's what we call the capillary fringe, which I'll talk about.

219
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:44,130
But this is partially saturated water until it gets completely saturated at the water table.

220
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:48,930
Here's the triangle again. No, no horizontal lines. In this case, the L.

221
00:24:48,940 --> 00:25:01,530
An apple is floating on top. This smear zone might be this groundwater goes up and down, and when it goes down, the gasoline layer will sink as well.

222
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:05,430
And it goes back up. It's going to try to go back up, but some of it's going to stick.

223
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:16,650
And so we sort of smear the gasoline in the porous media we have here plumes of dissolved component moving down gradient.

224
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:27,690
And importantly here, though, we have the vapors coming off and moving into, in this case, an elevator sample or into a basement or whatever.

225
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:35,200
And you have to realize that buildings are typically under negative pressure because you heat the building.

226
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:39,540
Air wants to rise. That's going to create a little bit of suction down here.

227
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:45,209
It's going to draw those vapors. And even if it is at atmospheric pressure, there's no pressure gradient.

228
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:52,920
Some of it's going to diffuse out. And this presents tremendous potential for incoming vapors.

229
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:59,640
And the risk can be significant if you are near or right on top of a major source.

230
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:08,870
Yes. So the soil vapor is it rises up from the underground and it still can then affect the air that's in of that natural environment.

231
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:15,540
It can affect the air on the surface, but it's particularly likely to affect a confined, confined space like a building.

232
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:25,500
In Ohio, there was a, you know, one of these massive aboveground storage tanks holding maybe a million gallons.

233
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:30,090
It leaked over five or ten years.

234
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:38,930
Several times that. Okay. This was a massive plume and homes nearby.

235
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:46,200
In one case, somebody went on to the basement, turned on the electric switch and kaboom above the explosive level.

236
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:50,330
Very rare because, you know, you'd smell that and you probably would say, oh,

237
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:54,350
gosh, I can't, you know, something's wrong, but it can get to be like that.

238
00:26:54,360 --> 00:27:04,380
That's really rare. Typically, we're dealing with concentrations that are much lower now because those kinds of problems have been identified.

239
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:09,780
But this is still really common after gasoline storage.

240
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:19,530
The next most common problem is with dry cleaners because dry cleaners use chlorinated solvents, trichloroethylene.

241
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:24,870
Okay. And it's a volatile chemical and it's quite hazardous.

242
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,560
And there used to be dry cleaners everywhere. Okay.

243
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:34,890
In your neighborhood. And they just dump the chemicals out. So this is a big problem.

244
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:37,920
Michigan must have thousands of these sites, actually.

245
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,540
Yes. Dry cleaners now store that in tanks.

246
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:48,250
Well, yeah. So they're trying to get away from the use of these chlorinated solvents.

247
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:53,590
First of all, so many of them are using CO2 processes and then.

248
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:57,040
Yeah, the the solvents need to be caught and recycled.

249
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:08,250
Yeah, absolutely. In Ann Arbor, at Maiden Lane and Plymouth Road, you know,

250
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:13,330
that big new housing development right there from Plymouth Road to the river

251
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:19,660
was all contaminated due to a dry cleaner and due to a metals recycler there.

252
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:23,440
And both those produced and contaminate the groundwater.

253
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:31,510
There was another dry cleaning in the old West Side neighborhood that was contaminated as well.

254
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:40,530
I mean, those are just two that come to mind locally. This is actually a really complex picture here.

255
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:46,370
I wasn't I moved this up into this because this shows so many other things going on.

256
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:53,830
But there is a wind direction effect here about who's going to be brought down when this defines El Napoles.

257
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:57,570
It also defines De Napoles, which I wasn't going to talk about yet.

258
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:06,570
But the Napoles are chemicals that are denser than water, so we call them dense, not aqueous phase liquid.

259
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:14,610
And all of the chlorinated solvents are examples. So the dry cleaning fluid in fact is a tense non acquiesce phase looking.

260
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:24,090
What do I mean by a non acquiesce phase liquid? You know, when you take your salad dressing you add oil and vinegar, right?

261
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,080
Vinegar floats on top. I'm sorry. Oil floats on top.

262
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:31,980
The vinegar. Right. They don't want to mix. They form separate layers.

263
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:36,980
They're not aqueous phase. Okay. The oil is not at.

264
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:42,370
You kind of shake it up, makes it emulsify. You get them mixed up.

265
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:57,510
But, you know, that's different. This picture also shows migration processes, advection diffusion partitioning.

266
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:05,360
We'll talk more about those things. So anyway, back to the storage tanks.

267
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,340
You know, these are used for petroleum products and lots of other things.

268
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:15,650
Leakages occur both due to faulty installation as well as corrosion.

269
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:21,710
Typically, the gasoline spills or mixtures, there's hundreds of different compounds in gasoline.

270
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:27,950
We all talk about B compounds as a signature.

271
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:32,630
Everybody should know what be Texas benzene tell you Ewing ethyl benzene and xylene.

272
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:37,550
So these are common aromatic compounds that are found in gasoline.

273
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:41,210
Which of those is the most toxic benzene?

274
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:48,889
Okay. Benzene levels in gasoline have been reduced to less than a percent these days.

275
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:57,170
They used to be 7%. Perhaps they can be well below 2%, in part because of the carcinogenicity.

276
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:03,650
But anyway, if you find benzene, tell you in ethyl benzene and xylene gasoline spill.

277
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:13,280
Okay. You don't think too hard about it. For better or worse, we've added other things to gasoline like MTBE.

278
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:26,959
Okay. And MTBE is a real problem because unlike Btecs and the other chemicals, which aren't very water soluble, MTBE is very water soluble.

279
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:34,190
So it will basically flow with the water while the benzene and stuff will get trapped a bit more.

280
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:41,300
And, you know, as we saw the upper most aquifers, the water table aquifer will be most at risk.

281
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:46,290
Okay. So I took these pictures a while ago.

282
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:55,490
Most of this stuff has been done. But here is a gasoline station where they've just put in fiberglass tanks and replaced the steel ones.

283
00:31:56,780 --> 00:32:02,750
And I guess I didn't include it, but these are all doubled pipes.

284
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:06,860
So you have the pipe and then you have a pipe bomb around it.

285
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:11,120
And that space in between is monitored to see if there's any leakage.

286
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:18,620
And so you have like a failsafe system. If you did take that leak, will you know that the system is got integrity?

287
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:23,210
It's good. Same thing with the tanks. So this work has all been done.

288
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:27,650
And you guys are probably too young to have seen all this work.

289
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:32,180
But every gas station, this has been taken care of at this point.

290
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:37,820
And in fact, it is kind of interesting because we used to have probably twice as many gas stations as we have now.

291
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:43,880
And when this law went into effect and you had to replace all your tanks, many decided it's not worth it.

292
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,230
So we just shut down.

293
00:32:50,700 --> 00:33:02,070
So this old data from Michigan again shows, you know, hundreds of sites that have had groundwater impact due to underground storage tanks.

294
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:10,410
And many water supplies have been affected. Landfills were another source of contamination because they were unlined.

295
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:18,840
Same thing happened when laws went into effect that you had a line, your solid waste landfill.

296
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:22,860
Many operators said, can't do it, just shut down. Okay.

297
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:30,840
Unfortunately, they probably weren't cleaned up and so they may have impact in the groundwater.

298
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:39,210
This is basically a parking lot constructed in Lapeer, Michigan.

299
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:50,220
This was Michigan's largest Superfund site, which I guess I had the pleasure of working on, where they had land that was a quarry.

300
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:54,660
The operator decided it would be a good place to throw hazardous waste.

301
00:33:55,140 --> 00:34:01,560
So over about 15 years, he took a lot of waste from car manufacturers, you name it.

302
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:08,820
Just dumped it in the big hole. A quarry. Everything from metals to solvents to PCBs.

303
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:14,250
And walked away. It caught on fire several times.

304
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:23,970
The Girl Scout camp. Camp immediately next to it, basically until Superfund came along.

305
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:34,500
It was, you know, just there. And Superfund did some preliminary work because nobody had any idea what was going on in this place,

306
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:40,890
because you couldn't see anything from the surface. And they pulled out these 43 or 45,000 drums.

307
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:46,710
Okay. Just tossed in. That's not what you see here. These are in Overpeck drum.

308
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:53,490
So these are plastic drums where they put the metal ones inside because the metal ones were all in bad shape and

309
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:59,100
there were tons and tons of contaminated storage and lots of other things going on as well in this rural area.

310
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:04,200
That was the worst in Michigan, this largest Superfund site.

311
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:08,370
Cleanup costs 65 million or something like that.

312
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:20,400
This is an old picture again, but there's about 1500 of these sites designated as NPL sites, national priority list sites under the Superfund law.

313
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:38,880
And they're scattered about. You know, lots of different types of waste sites, about 40 million people living within five miles in Michigan.

314
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:42,310
Here are the list of national priority list sites.

315
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:46,540
The Metamora, one that I was just talking about must be this one right here.

316
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:57,790
And there are a couple more that are proposed, including Ann Arbor, because of the dioxane spill, which is the interesting thing that occurs.

317
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:04,480
There are 15 that are cleaned up and are de-listed or deleted as well.

318
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:18,260
Which area of the country do you think is the most Superfund site? I feel like.

319
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:23,260
Good. Bad, bad. Yeah.

320
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:27,190
Like New Jersey. New Jersey? Yeah.

321
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:33,220
So if you look at what's found at the Superfund sites, it's everything.

322
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:37,960
Okay. We have chlorinated solvents like TCE.

323
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:39,430
We have metals like lead.

324
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:52,990
We have the detox compounds, we've got PCBs, chloroform, more viruses, some metal compounds, uh, more chlorinated solvents, mercury, copper.

325
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:58,900
So it's really mixtures. Yeah. Is there a reason why New Jersey has so many Superfund?

326
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,730
Yeah, probably because of all the chemical production in the state.

327
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:15,659
Does it have does it have a lot of chemical production? Because it's like, yeah, it's a legacy issue probably.

328
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:19,500
But I mean, there was certainly, you know,

329
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:30,210
earlier industrialization along the Delaware River and throughout the state actually that just led to early development for all those.

330
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:34,790
New Jersey also has a pretty good environmental program these days, too.

331
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:44,580
So on the other hand, I know several people who were exposed to chemicals in New Jersey, and I lived in New Jersey, too, so I'm probably one of them.

332
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:51,240
But there's some, uh, there's some real interesting stories I can tell you about that.

333
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:57,600
Okay. I mean, you know, some of these chemical contamination sites were known for a very long time and nothing was done.

334
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:06,930
And certainly there is uh, well, I don't want to say politics or governance did, but certainly politics was important.

335
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:13,860
Um, but there were a lot of cover ups as well. Well, there are a couple of quite good books written about it too, by the way.

336
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:23,510
So, uh. Um, and there's some unusual events, too.

337
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:31,910
And one of the interesting things is that the, um, migration of groundwater can go for miles.

338
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:36,380
And so you might not need to be next to a site to actually get exposed.

339
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,920
So this is also another interesting challenge to.

340
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:47,549
I think the other issue about New Jersey that leads to more Superfund sites is the density of the state.

341
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:51,270
And to qualify for Superfund status, you have to show a couple of things.

342
00:38:51,270 --> 00:39:00,660
You have to show the source of the a demonstrated migration pathway or exposure route and an affected or potentially affected population.

343
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,979
And so the Metamora site, the one on the pier that I showed you,

344
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:12,810
the pictures that the drums really fell was strong, and that was potential for contamination.

345
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:21,300
But there wasn't really much of a population nearby. There were like 30 or 40 homes immediately abutting that, and they did use wells.

346
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:28,349
So there was an exposure pathway, but nothing like you would see and I don't know, Bayonne,

347
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:32,700
New Jersey or Toms River or someplace like that where you have very large populations.

348
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:37,530
So it's like New Jersey is number one in Texas and Mississippi.

349
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:41,790
Oh, gosh, I don't know who's number two. I just tried to track number one.

350
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,350
I think New Jersey had like 100 and something.

351
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:54,630
So another point to make is that you only become a Superfund site if your governor wants to designate you one.

352
00:39:55,740 --> 00:40:04,980
So what can I say? You know, another source of groundwater contamination are old wells.

353
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,700
Okay. For every storage tank.

354
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:13,290
You know, there was a well that pumped the liquid out and processed the hydrocarbons.

355
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:18,990
And over the decades, there have been hundreds of thousands, actually millions of wells drilled.

356
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:26,830
And what happens with these wells is that they present a vertical elevator for contaminants to move up and down.

357
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:32,100
And so it allows contamination to migrate very rapidly.

358
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:39,180
Okay. And so there has been a program to plug these old wells for many years.

359
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:45,929
Many of these old wells aren't even known about because if you drilled a well in 1920, you didn't find oil.

360
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:49,800
So you moved on and you drilled another one and you just left it behind.

361
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:54,389
And there's no owner, there's no property deeds or anything at this point.

362
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:58,110
They're called Orson Welles because they don't have parents, they don't have owners.

363
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:09,300
And now we still find these occasionally, and they are plugged with either cement or an expanding clay called bentonite,

364
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:16,290
which is a very fine clay, which when it gets wet, expands a bit and doesn't allow water to move.

365
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:26,100
Okay. And so states have obligations to actually try to deal with these.

366
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:42,350
So over the years, there's so many types of activities that have taken place, lots of small wood treatment operations,

367
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:56,960
creosote operations or other ways of treating lumber just by dipping it into chemicals to make it more impervious to water and rot.

368
00:41:57,470 --> 00:42:03,470
Lots of abandoned mining mining sites are shown at the top of brownfield sites.

369
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:08,809
And this last picture is actually what the Metamora site looked like prior to cleanup.

370
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:14,120
It was just a little sand quarry with some, you know, tires dumped.

371
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:18,409
And it doesn't look like anything special. But again, it caught on fire, you know?

372
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:30,059
So you knew something was underneath there. So again, you know, in terms of groundwater or there are different types of sources of contamination,

373
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:35,310
obviously not just Superfund sites, but urban runoff, agricultural runoff.

374
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:43,350
Some of these legacy sites, abandoned wells, potential for fracking, underground storage tanks, septic systems.

375
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:56,940
And, you know, in recent years, contamination at airports because of PFAS chemicals and people's chemicals have become very well publicized.

376
00:42:57,330 --> 00:43:07,080
So but there's lots of sources. So to wrap up, this kind of overview of contamination, soil and groundwater is a relatively new area.

377
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:14,040
I mean, I can talk about it, you know, now with a degree of, let's say, maturity, because, you know,

378
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:20,340
I've been looking at this for 20, 30 years, but before that, nobody would think about it.

379
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:26,850
The soil and land has been inadvertently and deliberately used as a place to put waste.

380
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:32,430
And we've talked about domestic, commercial, industrial, agricultural waste.

381
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:36,420
There are other ways groundwater can get contaminated.

382
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:42,870
One of them is excessive. Groundwater pumping can lead to what we call saltwater intrusion.

383
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:47,010
I'm going to talk about that hydrologic connections.

384
00:43:47,010 --> 00:43:52,379
I talked about that runoff from roads. I mean, you know, we treat our roads with the icing salts.

385
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:53,970
You wouldn't want to drink all that salt.

386
00:43:54,450 --> 00:44:02,160
But fortunately, that's in the surface aquifer we want to use to lower aquifers, accidental spills, deep well injection.

387
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:08,790
I didn't talk about land treatment. Land treatment is an industrial practice in the southern part of the country,

388
00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:14,840
mostly where they will take slugs and solids at the bottom of all storage containers.

389
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:20,160
I'm talking about big ones at refineries and mix them in with soil and the problem goes away.

390
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:23,879
They think, okay, it's called composting in a sense.

391
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:33,270
Some of it does go away, but some of the sludge remains or found in hazardous waste landfills, agricultural chemicals and agricultural return flows.

392
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:39,750
In other words, some water that's already run off the field and that could have nitrates and so forth.

393
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:54,440
Lots of forces. Why is this important? Because once these aquifers are contaminated by water, I mean, it's really, really hard to clean them up.

394
00:44:55,100 --> 00:45:03,260
Very, very expensive. Okay. So here's where, you know, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure or whatever.

395
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:07,670
Okay. It's really important not to contaminate your aquifer.

396
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:14,630
You guys read this for the XL pipeline.

397
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:20,450
It crossed a bunch of states. They talked about groundwater contamination a little bit.

398
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:28,100
And some of the potential impacts are summarized in Table is three.

399
00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:31,520
And it basically said, you know,

400
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:41,480
not too much contamination is likely and it's only going to affect the near surface level and typically only within a couple of hundred feet.

401
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:51,530
If there was a spill and they talked about groundwater wells and there's 2537 wells within one mile.

402
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:57,560
39 public water, 20 private wells within 100 feet of the right of way.

403
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:08,180
And so they say they may be affected. So at least they acknowledge the possibility of a spill and the potential impacts in there.

404
00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:14,360
But they said overall, it's unlikely that water quality would be affected.

405
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:20,130
Okay. So it's largely a, you know, no effect.

406
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,750
Okay. Okay. You remember that?

407
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:33,700
Yeah. I mean, for what it's worth, the kinds of things that are carried in a pipeline like this,

408
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:39,280
you know, they're toxic, but it's not like they are degradable.

409
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:44,680
And it's there's also contamination in the surface water aquifer, not the deep aquifer.

410
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:55,360
So. Okay. Recognizing how important contamination is, we also have to recognize the challenges that are involved.

411
00:46:56,830 --> 00:47:02,860
You cannot see or often measure what's going on in the subsurface.

412
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:09,819
We do have things like ground penetrating radar, neutron probes, things like this.

413
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:17,140
We can get a sense of whether there's a water table well, how deep the water table is, for example.

414
00:47:17,590 --> 00:47:22,360
But it's hard really to get without drilling something a sample.

415
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:25,420
Without obtaining a sample. It's hard to to measure things.

416
00:47:26,770 --> 00:47:32,410
Measurements are expensive because you do have to drill the system itself.

417
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:36,100
I like to think of as operating at different scales.

418
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:47,190
We have microscopic scale processes within the soil, grain or poor to regional water scale to global hydro sphere.

419
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,469
So it's lots of different scales here. It is dynamic.

420
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:58,930
It changes over time. This is actually a subtle point, but we used to think groundwater flows were constant.

421
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:03,550
Okay, just very slow, sort of glacial, but in fact it changes.

422
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:11,710
And so we consider it dynamic. There are physical, chemical and biological processes, so it's very interdisciplinary.

423
00:48:12,370 --> 00:48:20,620
And the models that we use are difficult, to say the least, to validate in certain special circumstances.

424
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:30,720
And then I've already mentioned, you know, how important it is. So I don't think I need to convince you.

425
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:37,800
You know, we need to meet our water demands. Soils often just used to dispose of stuff.

426
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:44,550
Many sources of contamination. Increasingly, we're finding groundwater being contaminated.

427
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:48,840
We have much better understanding these days of what's going on.

428
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:54,360
And as I said before, cleanup is really challenging, really hard, expensive and time consuming.

429
00:48:55,900 --> 00:49:00,190
Good. Good. Let me stop. Question.

430
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:07,260
Thoughts? Got your Halloween costume picked out.

431
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:13,320
I saw some firemen today, but they were only about three years old.

432
00:49:16,770 --> 00:49:20,490
You've got to go on a marathon. A puffin.

433
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:23,730
Okay. How come? How come?

434
00:49:25,110 --> 00:49:32,230
I went to different. It didn't bother people. They looked very cute. Okay.

435
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:40,040
Let's talk about the water cycle again, starting off with some cartoons just to do an easy introduction.

436
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:47,510
Globally, the water cycle can be broken down into just a couple of components.

437
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:54,739
We have precipitation coming down on the top left here may result in overland flow.

438
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:59,990
We call that runoff. A certain amount of precipitation will enter the soil.

439
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:04,850
We call that infiltration. A certain amount of that will get into the aquifer.

440
00:50:05,510 --> 00:50:09,229
Here is the water table. They don't have their triangle here.

441
00:50:09,230 --> 00:50:12,740
Unfortunately, here is an aquifer.

442
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:21,410
This is a sand and gravel aquifer. Here we have a shale bedrock layer with a sandstone aquifer underneath.

443
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:36,820
And then finally transpiration, you know, plants will uptake water and water will evaporate as well.

444
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:42,860
And very roughly about a third of the precipitation is runoff.

445
00:50:42,910 --> 00:50:46,360
A third infiltration and a third transpiration. Okay.

446
00:50:47,290 --> 00:50:56,650
Very, very rough. Those are important numbers, though, because what infiltrates will ultimately recharge the aquifers.

447
00:50:56,950 --> 00:51:02,260
And understanding what sustainable yield for an aquifer is really important,

448
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:06,970
because if you pump water out faster than it enters, what's going to happen?

449
00:51:07,870 --> 00:51:15,790
Levels will sink. Okay, so this notion of the water cycle, you know, is important at local levels.

450
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:20,320
The hydrologic cycle, of course, is global scale.

451
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:29,920
Basically, this just defines evaporative transpiration, precipitation, surface runoff, infiltration and recharge.

452
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:36,100
Recharge is the subset of infiltration that actually gets to the aquifer.

453
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:46,960
And some of the infiltration will be used by soils, by by vegetation or just evaporate, but some of it will go deeper.

454
00:51:47,170 --> 00:52:09,060
And that's the recharge piece. This is a textbook slide and it's useful just for conceptual purposes.

455
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:19,950
Atmospheric water in terms of thousand kilometers squared, surface water in the oceans or saltwater in the oceans.

456
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:30,780
That's about a billion cubic kilometers of fresh water in.

457
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:37,670
Lynx is pretty tiny compared to the ocean.

458
00:52:40,770 --> 00:52:48,720
Freshwater and glaciers is still a huge big resource when we get into groundwater, the data zone water.

459
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:55,320
Nobody's interested in that except farmers. I shouldn't say nobody that's important, but it's not a resource that we drink.

460
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:58,950
Instead, we look at the groundwater. It's about 4000.

461
00:52:59,370 --> 00:53:03,860
4 million cubic miles. Cubic kilometer. Cubic kilometers, yeah.

462
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:10,320
So if you look at all the freshwater sources beyond the glaciers, it's groundwater.

463
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:18,090
Okay. Far, far more than what's in lakes and streams.

464
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:23,730
And that even includes the Great Lakes. Okay. Far, far more in groundwater.

465
00:53:25,590 --> 00:53:32,920
Percentages are off here on the right. So it's a it's a critical resource.

466
00:53:34,570 --> 00:53:39,070
It's a finite resource, although it is sustained and replenished.

467
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:44,670
Okay. So some definitions and then we'll take a break.

468
00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:53,710
Groundwater is that portion of the water below the surface of the earth that can be collected with a well or a tunnel or a pipe.

469
00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:59,980
And it's also called free water because it's got pressure above atmospheric pressure.

470
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,190
In other words, the water will flow out okay,

471
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:12,299
roughly provides water for about half the population in the U.S. And some statistics here in terms of how much there is the depth,

472
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:16,800
the ground water can be highly variable depending on where you are.

473
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:23,610
It's not uncommon to be a thousand meters down. Let's take a break.

474
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:31,960
A couple minutes and then we'll come back. 2 minutes early.

475
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:41,520
Whatever. Don't start yawning.

476
00:54:42,180 --> 00:56:11,630
It's contagious. It is. Certainly I think about you.

477
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:19,320
One of the things I did over the weekend was to review 15 different proposals for Fulbright.

478
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:31,710
And one of them was on LCA lifecycle assessment and mining and electrification that is going to require oil, cobalt and all these other rare earths.

479
00:56:32,370 --> 00:56:38,430
And so this application was to try to get at some of the countries in Africa.

480
00:56:39,090 --> 00:56:47,130
The mining might be expected to increase Botswana and Zambia.

481
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:55,079
I'm going to make sense. I think she be.

482
00:56:55,080 --> 00:57:00,750
I'm not sure I do. I never saw much mining in Botswana, but I'll bet there is.

483
00:57:02,010 --> 00:57:08,820
I mean, that whole Southern Africa or South Africa was one of very rich.

484
00:57:09,090 --> 00:57:12,930
Yeah. And, you know, there's. Yeah.

485
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:21,330
In Ghana. I know there's now. And it's interesting because there's formal informal mining.

486
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:30,960
The formal mining is the big companies, typically Chinese are community banks and many U.S. players seem to be Canadian.

487
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:36,840
Absolutely. I would not likely so because there's a lot of mining.

488
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:46,090
I happen to be in Ghana when you.

489
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:56,230
The capital and somehow invited myself or got invited to a sustainable mining convention there.

490
00:57:56,980 --> 00:58:07,570
And, I mean, these are huge, well-resourced companies, you know, and they build them, which means they electrify them.

491
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:17,800
They try to be somewhat sensitive to the culture, you know, and then you go a couple of miles away, and this is often for gold and copper.

492
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:29,760
And then you have the informal operations where, you know, you get together with your buddies and you try to buy cyanide or mercury and you do this.

493
00:58:29,770 --> 00:58:36,250
Yeah, that's doesn't sound like something practical, but I mean, the informal sector is huge too.

494
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:41,080
And so these companies are saying at least we're complying with the laws, you know.

495
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:52,840
And so anyway, these this proposal was to try to look at this a little more systematically and figure out what could be done.

496
00:58:53,830 --> 00:59:01,930
Yeah, I have to say, I didn't score super high because I just didn't have enough.

497
00:59:03,490 --> 00:59:09,850
You didn't have a he was a mining professor from a well-known school of mines,

498
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:17,440
but he had no environmental health or LCA background and he had published one thing,

499
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:22,210
but it was very generic of mining schools beyond Colorado School of Mines.

500
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:28,210
Yeah, I won't say you guessed it, but are there.

501
00:59:28,450 --> 00:59:32,800
Yeah. And New Mexico has one. Arizona does mining.

502
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:40,059
So in John and you have a perception or a feeling for what the public perception was.

503
00:59:40,060 --> 00:59:46,750
There looked like the different types of mining, whether it be like a large corporation or China.

504
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:51,490
Yeah, it's very mixed.

505
00:59:52,300 --> 01:00:04,780
As I recall the you know, talking about the execs from the company, the tribal,

506
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:11,800
if that's the right term, I'm not sure leaders who are supported by the mine feel pretty positive.

507
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:22,240
I mean, it's that or subsistence farming or informal mining.

508
01:00:23,530 --> 01:00:28,030
Okay. And given those choices, I don't know.

509
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:37,120
I mean, there can be more than subsistence farming because farming is sort of certainly taken off as well.

510
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:40,710
But, you know, the thing that so well,

511
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:52,990
all of the mining companies are saying is that we need to do community preference to want to find out what the community wants.

512
01:00:54,520 --> 01:01:02,950
So so they're kind of making sustainable mining into somewhere, you know, so they pay off the community to get their money.

513
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:06,610
Yeah. Okay. I didn't know if that was if that was the sort of thing that was happening.

514
01:01:06,610 --> 01:01:11,050
There was a little more negative in the money.

515
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:15,669
Yeah. Well, I mean, you know, they're so they want to develop, right.

516
01:01:15,670 --> 01:01:21,700
And you know, I mean, if we take a dollar or two a day income, this is pretty dire, right?

517
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:33,700
So it's a good tradeoff. Interesting. SAVAGE So anyway, this was trying to do this at several different levels, was hugely ambitious.

518
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:38,200
And yet I'm not sure that the country would do it on their own.

519
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:47,450
So it might not be a bad way to go, but I just would rather see them team up with people who wanted to do what was going on.

520
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:58,450
Yeah. I got to do a five hour zoom call tomorrow to talk about all of these.

521
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:11,940
That's too much is too much for. And they make you sign something saying that you're not supposed to do anything else while Iran is in.

522
01:02:14,290 --> 01:02:18,750
Before she had a camera. I was sitting right there the entire time. That's the implication.

523
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:24,820
Because I mean, I think everybody is multitasking all the time now.

524
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:29,510
My good friends in the sun have found this immunity.

525
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:34,150
You know, I see painting the baseboards and things like that.

526
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:39,540
Well, this is also, I think, a volunteer activity as well.

527
01:02:45,110 --> 01:02:54,920
But it's fun to see what people are proposing. And, you know, this is the side of doing grants review and project review, things like that.

528
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:13,510
Okay. So again, we have another cartoon here just showing you the hydrologic cycle surface water,

529
01:03:14,050 --> 01:03:20,410
my ratios of one third, one third, one third, four evapotranspiration runoff percolation.

530
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:23,860
I guess I didn't use the term percolation. I use infiltration.

531
01:03:24,010 --> 01:03:24,850
It's the same thing.

532
01:03:28,510 --> 01:03:42,700
Determining these fractions is really important because we need to know what is the sustainable yield for surface water as well as groundwater.

533
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:56,810
You know, clearly if precipitation patterns are changing as a result of climate change, projections may become more questionable.

534
01:03:57,190 --> 01:04:01,060
But it's something that we have to figure out. Okay. So it's an important priority.

535
01:04:04,190 --> 01:04:15,400
Okay. Drilling down. The upper layer of the earth's crust is broken down into different zones or horizons, we call them.

536
01:04:15,910 --> 01:04:22,740
At the very top we have what we call the soil zone, where there's a good bit of organic matter.

537
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:28,510
Nutrients and roots reach into that. Below that is what we call the intermediate zone.

538
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:35,440
And then further down you have the capillary fringe, the water table, and then the groundwater saturated.

539
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:44,980
So in the capillary fringe we have a change in water saturation from 100% at the water table to a smaller amount,

540
01:04:45,310 --> 01:04:47,860
with the water being drawn up by capillary pressure,

541
01:04:48,340 --> 01:04:57,070
you know, if you insert a very thin straw into the liquid, the water will rise through the straw because of capillary forces, surface tension forces.

542
01:04:57,370 --> 01:05:06,429
That's what's going on in the capillary fringe. If the soil is something like a fine clay, you have microscopic tubes.

543
01:05:06,430 --> 01:05:09,580
That capillary fringe can be five meters high. Okay?

544
01:05:09,610 --> 01:05:14,739
It can be very substantial or even more if it's cobbles and rocks and things like that.

545
01:05:14,740 --> 01:05:18,280
The capillary fringe is essentially all purpose is negligible.

546
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:26,410
This picture is also showing that if you drilled a well and we have the open part of the well shown with these slots,

547
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:34,930
basically most wells are nothing more than PVC pipes, typically 2 to 4 inches for smaller ones, and they simply cut slots in them.

548
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:40,390
Okay. The water in the well, how high will it rise?

549
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:52,290
Just to the water table. Right. So, you know, in this picture, in a surface water aquifer, that's basically what's going on.

550
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:57,900
The horizons are further broken down as shown here.

551
01:05:58,340 --> 01:06:05,850
Again, we have the organic layer. We have A, B and C and sometimes other layers, very heterogeneous.

552
01:06:05,910 --> 01:06:14,190
In this case, we have naturally formed soil with an increase in the rock size or excuse me, particle size.

553
01:06:14,190 --> 01:06:24,030
But there are stratified soils where over the years floods or storms have produced layers of

554
01:06:24,030 --> 01:06:30,660
clay sand alternating depending on erosion patterns and alluvial action glaciers and so forth.

555
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:37,470
So it's pretty complex. We classify soils by grain size in my office.

556
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:41,610
I still have, you know, I have civil engineering backgrounds. So we used to do all this kind of stuff.

557
01:06:42,090 --> 01:06:45,620
These are like mini sieves. Okay.

558
01:06:45,630 --> 01:06:52,680
And basically, you stack these, put the soil on top, shake them, and each layer has a smaller screen.

559
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:58,890
And then you capture particles of that size and then you get the size classification like this.

560
01:06:59,340 --> 01:07:04,890
And these are typically seven inches in diameter and it's just like a mini set we use occasionally.

561
01:07:05,310 --> 01:07:11,220
Understanding the grain size is really important because it affects so many properties of the subsurface.

562
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:19,890
We call the tiniest stuff colloids. Clays are typically two microns to maybe five or ten microns.

563
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:24,750
Rock flours, silt, sand, gravel and boulders.

564
01:07:25,650 --> 01:07:29,430
And we have soil size distributions depicted here.

565
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:39,780
And if you buy if you have a sandbox, for example, you might want all your sand to be about one millimeter or something like that.

566
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:47,520
And so that would be maybe a line, I don't know, like ESP or something like that.

567
01:07:47,850 --> 01:07:55,950
It's a port that's a gravel. Here's a sand is uh, w or was ESP.

568
01:07:55,950 --> 01:07:59,700
Yeah, the ESP right here. So this is all stuff that's about the same size.

569
01:08:00,210 --> 01:08:05,370
Okay. That's called poorly graded. But typically we want big particles, small particles.

570
01:08:05,580 --> 01:08:14,700
And so you get a different size distribution. Yeah, there's a maybe a little less and this is partly to clarify questions around grain,

571
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:21,120
but does water flow slower when it's through smaller pools and faster?

572
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:24,690
Yeah. Typically we're going to talk about verses long. Figure that out.

573
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:29,970
Okay. But yeah, I mean, very, very fine grained material in particular.

574
01:08:30,270 --> 01:08:35,910
Something that's down in this clay area is almost impenetrable.

575
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:43,050
Okay, well, something that is gravel or pebbles, water will flow through because the channels are big and open.

576
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:51,569
Okay. But as we'll see, most soils aren't just big or small, but they're well graded.

577
01:08:51,570 --> 01:08:55,560
So they have both. In the openings, you have little sand.

578
01:08:56,040 --> 01:09:01,709
Okay. So you have big boulder boulders and cobbles and and and things.

579
01:09:01,710 --> 01:09:08,520
And then the interstitial spaces are also filled up to sort of there are different soil size

580
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:15,190
classifications depending whether you're a highway builder or an agricultural person or I guess,

581
01:09:15,220 --> 01:09:23,250
in the Corps of Engineers. But typically, we divide most into clays, silt fans and cobbles and gravel.

582
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:27,540
Okay. There are texture triangles.

583
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:35,400
I'm not going to go over this. This is a cute little program that you can download that estimates many of the different soil properties.

584
01:09:36,060 --> 01:09:47,340
And I'm not going to go into that either. But this is kind of important because we have different types of soil and rock structures shown here.

585
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:52,709
At the top we have this sedimentary deposit well sorted.

586
01:09:52,710 --> 01:10:02,250
So I have larger C cobbles or pebbles and the spaces in between that are not filled in.

587
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:04,410
So water can go through this very easily.

588
01:10:04,740 --> 01:10:14,880
In contrast, here we have the same pebbles or cobbles, but then we have sands and maybe salts in here and water won't flow through that very easily.

589
01:10:16,010 --> 01:10:21,630
Okay, these are both all let's call them sedimentary deposits, although they can be deposited for different reasons.

590
01:10:22,170 --> 01:10:28,710
In contrast, below we have rocks that's fractured and those fractures will hold water.

591
01:10:29,250 --> 01:10:34,890
And what's interesting with the rocks is that they're called an isotropic the processes.

592
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:41,430
So in other words, if I have water that's coming down this way, it's going to flow.

593
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:47,559
Forensically through this. Okay. And in contrast to this, one word is coming down.

594
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:52,600
It's going to move to your right. Okay. So there's this flow direction imposed.

595
01:10:52,930 --> 01:10:58,120
Moreover, if I try to push water in this direction, it's more resistance by pushing in this direction.

596
01:10:58,510 --> 01:11:06,210
So the properties are a function of direction as compared to this kind of stuff, which looks the same if I rotate it 90 degrees.

597
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:07,300
It's all the same.

598
01:11:12,350 --> 01:11:22,579
So the bottom line, though, is that in both cases, we can end up with small or large pores and the larger pores are easier to flow water through.

599
01:11:22,580 --> 01:11:25,760
And the more of them, obviously, it's still easier.

600
01:11:27,410 --> 01:11:33,020
One of the very wonderful things about soil is that it's a hugely effective filter.

601
01:11:33,650 --> 01:11:40,370
Okay. This is exploited in the in the water that you drink because chances are it came through a sand filter.

602
01:11:40,970 --> 01:11:48,500
Okay. And filtration mechanisms are depicted here where we have really three mechanisms.

603
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:52,100
Particles can just be larger than the pores.

604
01:11:52,580 --> 01:11:56,150
So they just are filtered out by surface filtration.

605
01:11:57,410 --> 01:12:00,560
They can stick inside. This is called straining.

606
01:12:00,890 --> 01:12:08,750
And then often there's a charge to the particles and the grains, so they will stick to the outer absorption processes.

607
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:15,140
So the bottom line is, when the water does get through this, many of the contaminants may be removed.

608
01:12:16,550 --> 01:12:22,550
In your drinking water and wastewater systems, they typically use a well graded sand,

609
01:12:22,970 --> 01:12:30,940
and it's can be just a couple of feet in thickness and it can remove a tremendous amount of material,

610
01:12:32,690 --> 01:12:38,030
typically back flushed to remove the contaminants and restart the process.

611
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:44,810
Vito's zone is the unsaturated zone, also called the zone of Aeration.

612
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:49,120
It's above the water table. This is a critical zone for agriculture.

613
01:12:49,130 --> 01:12:54,650
It's the one that you come into contact with. The water in there is called Vito's Water.

614
01:12:55,250 --> 01:12:58,250
It's a very complex system.

615
01:12:58,820 --> 01:13:07,760
It's a multiphase system where we have water, soil potentially contaminants, soil, gas.

616
01:13:08,210 --> 01:13:11,240
We may have biological material in there as well.

617
01:13:11,630 --> 01:13:19,940
So there's a lot going on. The water is held in by capillary pressure and the water movement is vertical.

618
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:27,680
So this is a multiphase system and it's also got hysteresis effects to it.

619
01:13:29,180 --> 01:13:36,500
So in other words, if there's soil is dry and you wet it, water will move in a certain way.

620
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:42,260
If that soil is already wet and you put more water on it, it moves differently.

621
01:13:43,250 --> 01:13:51,620
Okay. Because the wedding has already been accomplished. And so it's very complex and really interesting when you think about this,

622
01:13:51,620 --> 01:13:58,070
because if in fact we have prolonged droughts, then the soil may be very dry.

623
01:13:58,370 --> 01:14:05,960
And in fact, when it does rain, there's less infiltration as compared to if you had like nicely spaced out rainfall,

624
01:14:06,140 --> 01:14:08,540
same amount, more water would recharge.

625
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:18,650
So it becomes really maybe a secondary thing to consider, but it's potentially important given changes in climatic precipitation events.

626
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:29,230
We think about precipitation in the sustainable yield.

627
01:14:29,830 --> 01:14:35,680
And this is an example where the total precipitation say centimeters coming down.

628
01:14:36,490 --> 01:14:51,460
Typically in this particular area, about 476 millimeters half a meter as going into surface runoff, evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge.

629
01:14:52,300 --> 01:15:03,910
And these calculations are part of an iOS, which I did not give you, but the guys here calculated what was sustainable, recharge.

630
01:15:04,330 --> 01:15:14,050
And basically, of the 476 coming down into the area, only 20 millimeters late to recharge.

631
01:15:14,620 --> 01:15:20,110
Okay. And so this is essentially a mass balance for the water balance.

632
01:15:20,830 --> 01:15:29,440
And this particular energy development area would pump out water from the system.

633
01:15:29,710 --> 01:15:37,660
And if they pumped out more than equivalent to 20 millimeters, the groundwater table would say, okay,

634
01:15:37,810 --> 01:15:44,440
this is particularly important in this area because it is a boreal type forest and a lot

635
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:51,670
of marshland and this would cause changes in the ecology that could be quite significant.

636
01:15:54,310 --> 01:16:00,760
I didn't go through the calculations, but it just. That's just not much to question, right?

637
01:16:03,620 --> 01:16:19,850
Recharge areas are locations that are responsible for the bulk of the water being transmitted downward to an aquifer they may be exposed.

638
01:16:21,470 --> 01:16:25,820
They are typically just a small fraction of the surface area.

639
01:16:26,510 --> 01:16:36,170
What we call higher critical recharge areas are the ones that we should really care about because any contamination in

640
01:16:36,410 --> 01:16:47,570
these recharge areas will contaminate the aquifer and recharge areas for water table aquifers or the entire land surface.

641
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:56,600
But recharge areas for confined aquifers are very special places, and I'll show you some pictures of those.

642
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:04,970
So again, the amount of recharge is determined by lots of different factors permeability of the soils,

643
01:17:06,290 --> 01:17:13,670
the rainfall patterns and amounts, and the soil moisture and the runoff and evaporative transpiration of the water cycle again.

644
01:17:18,910 --> 01:17:29,920
So from that water soil calculator, I pulled out some tables and typical tables or typical numbers for a couple of different types of soils.

645
01:17:30,370 --> 01:17:38,180
For example, sand has an infiltration rate of about 50 millimeters per hour.

646
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:41,110
So in other words, water can move through pretty quickly.

647
01:17:41,530 --> 01:17:52,150
The porosity this is the area that is not comprised of the sand itself as a fraction is about 38%.

648
01:17:52,450 --> 01:17:56,990
That's the area where water can move through specific gravity.

649
01:17:57,070 --> 01:18:05,740
It's just the density. Field capacity is if I saturate that soil, pull it up so the water drains out.

650
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:12,940
What's left is about 15% of the mass will be water.

651
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:17,110
Okay. And then crops can pull out about half of that.

652
01:18:17,590 --> 01:18:21,550
Okay. About 7%. And these things don't really matter.

653
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:26,560
Contrast that to very fine material like a clay.

654
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:33,220
Here we get perhaps half a millimeter per hour moving into it very little.

655
01:18:34,180 --> 01:18:38,230
We have porosity, which is quite high, about 50%.

656
01:18:38,860 --> 01:18:46,960
Okay. Clays are constructed of sheets of of the of the clay particles.

657
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:50,410
Okay. With the ability to store water in between.

658
01:18:50,620 --> 01:18:59,950
But nothing gets into the sheet, typically. The specific gravity is a bit lower because much of it is just a void space.

659
01:19:00,580 --> 01:19:05,500
The field capacity, if you've ever picked up clay that's saturated, is holding a lot of water.

660
01:19:06,010 --> 01:19:11,740
Okay. It's about 44% water. And of that, crops can ultimately pull out about half.

661
01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:20,710
Okay. So this is just demonstrating how important soil properties and soil textures are in some of these water properties.

662
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:28,090
Okay. If you're a gardener or a farmer, you know, you like to get like a mixture of soil.

663
01:19:28,090 --> 01:19:35,230
So you have some loam and some clay to hold the water and some coarser stuff to aerated so air can move in.

664
01:19:35,590 --> 01:19:38,620
So you like a mix. Okay.

665
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:45,340
So in terms of contaminating the unsaturated zone, many contaminants can enter it.

666
01:19:45,370 --> 01:19:49,840
And we've talked about surface spills, waste sites, other nasties, fertilizers.

667
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:58,750
We didn't talk about deposition of airborne contaminants. This is possible for both particles and gases as well as waste treatment.

668
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:07,110
So I think we have seen almost all of these terms except for one.

669
01:20:08,790 --> 01:20:12,690
But here we have the water table.

670
01:20:13,950 --> 01:20:26,040
We have the recharge area for this aquifer where the geology is such that we have exposed face here for this aquifer.

671
01:20:26,610 --> 01:20:29,810
And so this is a critical area. Okay.

672
01:20:29,850 --> 01:20:34,260
Responsible potentially for a large amount of recharge in the system.

673
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:38,970
We have confining beds in different colors here. We have consolidated rock at the bottom.

674
01:20:39,970 --> 01:20:44,670
Okay. The only thing we haven't seen on here, it's a little tricky to explain.

675
01:20:44,670 --> 01:20:50,070
I have a better slide to do it, but I'll start here. Is this flowing artesian aquifer?

676
01:20:50,820 --> 01:20:56,670
If I put a well in the water table aquifer, how high does the water rise in the well?

677
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:02,430
There's no pressure, so it just rises to the extent of the water table.

678
01:21:02,670 --> 01:21:04,380
Okay. I'm going to have to pump it beyond that.

679
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:11,070
This well, and I don't like this picture so much because it doesn't show you where the screens are or the inlet to the well.

680
01:21:11,070 --> 01:21:17,130
But they're at the bottom. Okay. In this picture, if I take this well, the water is going to flow out naturally.

681
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:24,840
Why? So different pressure.

682
01:21:25,050 --> 01:21:34,560
Absolute hydrostatic pressure. So if you think of it, at the end of the diagram, you have water pressure pushing down at this level here.

683
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:38,910
And this level is the same level to which the water rises in this well.

684
01:21:39,270 --> 01:21:42,420
But it's above the ground surface here because of the topography.

685
01:21:43,110 --> 01:21:46,260
So basically, you can just think of this as like a big U pipe.

686
01:21:47,190 --> 01:21:50,340
Okay. And the water should be the same height.

687
01:21:51,030 --> 01:21:55,080
And since its height is lower than the other height, it flows up. Okay.

688
01:21:56,370 --> 01:22:00,750
Now, this is a simplification because there's certain amount of resistance to flow.

689
01:22:01,230 --> 01:22:06,120
And so it won't quite rise to the same level. But the concept is the thing that I'm after here.

690
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:15,870
Okay. This is called artesian well. These are somewhat rare, but I guess Roman's got to name it.

691
01:22:17,370 --> 01:22:23,490
And, you know, sometimes you'll see them as a seep or something like that.

692
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:34,379
Definitions of aquifers are shown here. I think the important thing here is that we have two types of aquifers.

693
01:22:34,380 --> 01:22:44,190
We have sand aquifers, typically sands and gravels old streambeds, alluvial valley use, coastal plains, glacier deposits, things like that.

694
01:22:44,580 --> 01:22:52,620
We have bedrock aquifers, okay? Typically limestone, sandstone, granite and shale, but mostly limestone and sandstone.

695
01:22:53,190 --> 01:23:00,050
And then a subset of those will be cavernous limestone cores and things like this.

696
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:04,290
Okay, that's not so common in Michigan, but it is common to the south.

697
01:23:08,070 --> 01:23:12,570
Oh, okay. This is the monster picture today.

698
01:23:12,660 --> 01:23:17,280
Okay. I want you to know everything on this slide, okay?

699
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:21,100
That's my goal for today. All right.

700
01:23:23,620 --> 01:23:31,210
There's a few new things here on this picture, but this gives you the knowledge to talk about ground water with anything.

701
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:35,290
Okay. So what is new?

702
01:23:36,250 --> 01:23:39,510
Well, first. Yeah.

703
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:44,090
We have our water table, our triangle here.

704
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:53,160
Nothing new there, but look up here. We have another water table up here, but there's unsaturated soil underneath it.

705
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:58,410
We call this a perched water table because it's perched above.

706
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:00,810
And typically this is ephemeral.

707
01:24:00,900 --> 01:24:07,910
It goes away, may only appear when you get a lot of rainfall, you have a little bog, it might dry up something like that.

708
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:15,420
These exist based on low permeability soils, typically that are some distance still from the water table.

709
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:19,260
Okay, not a lot of value except for ecological value.

710
01:24:19,260 --> 01:24:23,489
There's no nobody's going to pull water out of a water table like this.

711
01:24:23,490 --> 01:24:29,250
I have one. I've camped sometimes, but you know, other than that, you want flowing.

712
01:24:29,250 --> 01:24:38,340
WELLS We've seen this before, artesian wells again, we have the critical recharge area well above the height of the well.

713
01:24:39,330 --> 01:24:47,220
The screen is placed down here. And so this is showing you a piece of metric or surface.

714
01:24:47,880 --> 01:24:58,180
And that piece of metric surface is this dashed line starts at the recharge height and that accounts for the friction of the water moving through.

715
01:24:58,680 --> 01:25:03,030
So the water will rise to the piece of metric surface.

716
01:25:04,260 --> 01:25:09,570
Each aquifer has a different piece of metric surface. So that's what's new on this slide.

717
01:25:10,020 --> 01:25:13,810
Okay. I'm sorry. Could you just find that again?

718
01:25:14,140 --> 01:25:19,810
Sure. So let's look at this aquifer right here.

719
01:25:21,340 --> 01:25:27,370
Okay. This is this blue is equatorial and so, like, impermeable.

720
01:25:27,910 --> 01:25:32,410
And so the water is recharged up here and will move downward this way.

721
01:25:33,290 --> 01:25:44,260
The height of the water in the wells in this aquifer will go up to what we call the piece of metric surface, which is just lying right over here.

722
01:25:46,030 --> 01:25:48,249
The reason is, like before,

723
01:25:48,250 --> 01:25:55,840
if you just consider this to be a big pipe and then we had another extension to the pipe right here, that water would rise up.

724
01:25:56,800 --> 01:26:03,550
So it would be the same at both sides. But because the water is flowing and losing some of its energy,

725
01:26:03,550 --> 01:26:08,260
because of the resistance moving through the soil, it won't rise to quite the same height.

726
01:26:09,070 --> 01:26:14,170
And that effect is represented in the piece of metric line up here.

727
01:26:14,830 --> 01:26:15,940
So it slopes downward.

728
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:27,610
So just to make sure I'm understanding 70 of metric surface or level is the level below the recharge area the water will rise to?

729
01:26:27,730 --> 01:26:33,070
Yes. So it's essentially the static pressure that's available at any point in the aquifer.

730
01:26:38,110 --> 01:26:42,280
Okay. There's a couple of other features here that are important as well. But let me just clarify.

731
01:26:42,290 --> 01:26:46,029
Everybody's good with. I mean, these are fusion wells aren't that important.

732
01:26:46,030 --> 01:26:55,690
But the the nice thing is that if you do really well in a deeper aquifer that is a, you know,

733
01:26:55,840 --> 01:27:03,910
300 meters down and the piece of metric surface is only 50 meters down, all you have to do is put in enough energy to pump 15 years.

734
01:27:04,570 --> 01:27:08,470
The rest of the water will rise anyway. So that's a good thing about that.

735
01:27:09,770 --> 01:27:14,229
Of course, you may not have a piece of metric surface like this.

736
01:27:14,230 --> 01:27:17,620
Okay. Still could be way, way lower. Okay.

737
01:27:17,630 --> 01:27:24,100
There's a couple of other features in here. Really important. The first is we have what we call windows.

738
01:27:25,570 --> 01:27:31,240
This is an impermeable layer. It could be sail fine clay or silt.

739
01:27:31,750 --> 01:27:33,400
But there's something wrong here.

740
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:43,000
It either thins out or it's discontinuous or there's gaps or something like that which allows leakage between this aquifer and this aquifer.

741
01:27:43,990 --> 01:27:48,640
And this is maybe not so bad because it's a way to recharge the aquifer.

742
01:27:49,150 --> 01:27:54,160
But on the other hand, if this aquifer is contaminated and you're drawing water from the deeper one,

743
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:57,940
then this window leads to contamination in that lower aquifer.

744
01:27:59,050 --> 01:28:03,520
Okay, are the flows can be either direction.

745
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:07,360
Here's another leakage area where the flow is moving upward.

746
01:28:09,190 --> 01:28:12,550
It will move up or down depending on the static pressure.

747
01:28:13,540 --> 01:28:17,049
Okay. And that static pressure is reflected by the piece of metric surface.

748
01:28:17,050 --> 01:28:26,590
So that's why we care about that. This is all really conceptual because I can't look at the window, I can't stare down and actually see this thing.

749
01:28:27,010 --> 01:28:32,080
Okay? I have to infer based on some measurements, it's not easily done,

750
01:28:32,470 --> 01:28:41,049
but it's clearly an issue in Michigan and other areas where we have alluvial aquifers that are put down by glacial deposits and it's a mess.

751
01:28:41,050 --> 01:28:45,370
Okay. They're not consistent. They thin out and so forth. I will give you some examples of these.

752
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:57,710
Okay. Windows. Good. I think the only order and they call to me for this.

753
01:28:59,450 --> 01:29:10,370
STRANG The only other thing that's in here is what we call a saltwater wedge or intrusion.

754
01:29:11,330 --> 01:29:16,010
Here we have our aquifers discharging into the ocean or sea.

755
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:22,159
Normally, the water will come down. This would be fresh. Water will displace the sea.

756
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:32,860
Water will go out into the sea. Okay. If I'm in Georgia or wherever on the coast somewhere, excuse me.

757
01:29:33,290 --> 01:29:39,500
And I start pumping water out faster and faster from this aquifer, there's going to be less moving into the ocean.

758
01:29:40,220 --> 01:29:43,400
Okay. And at some point, there won't be any moving into the ocean.

759
01:29:44,120 --> 01:29:47,780
And at some point, I'll be sucking water this direction as well.

760
01:29:48,230 --> 01:29:54,470
And that will allow the saltwater to move vineyard. Saltwater is considerably denser than freshwater.

761
01:29:54,890 --> 01:29:59,090
So it's going to form this kind of wind and flow underneath.

762
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:09,530
And we already have a number of coastal areas where pumping has been higher than sustainable yield, allowing this saltwater wedge to move upward.

763
01:30:09,530 --> 01:30:18,620
And we're going to contaminate some of these wells. And once that salt has entered the system, well, it could take a long, long time to clean up.

764
01:30:20,010 --> 01:30:24,230
Okay. Question. Yeah, yeah.

765
01:30:24,570 --> 01:30:28,020
I just want to have is I have any problem. How is the saltwater going?

766
01:30:28,530 --> 01:30:35,640
Like what is causing it to actually move it to the. Well, there's all the weight of the water from here pushing down.

767
01:30:35,850 --> 01:30:38,910
Right. So it's going to want to expand wherever there is a void.

768
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:43,060
So if I stop the flow, okay.

769
01:30:43,140 --> 01:30:51,000
Or push the flow backwards because these wells are going to suck in water from all directions, then that will allow the salt water to move up.

770
01:30:52,800 --> 01:31:01,320
I was just going to ask, what's the immediate response to that? Is there any way to turn off the well?

771
01:31:01,740 --> 01:31:06,420
Okay. But, I mean, you know, you need the water, right? So you got to have an alternative source.

772
01:31:06,810 --> 01:31:18,330
And typically, larger water systems will not depend on a single well because of the vulnerability, you know, if the thing shuts down or whatever.

773
01:31:18,330 --> 01:31:27,030
So they'll have a water network with multiple wells. So but the long term issue, this is a real challenge.

774
01:31:27,330 --> 01:31:30,100
Okay. Was there another question?

775
01:31:30,220 --> 01:31:40,560
Yeah, I was wondering if saltwater intrusion is also used to define or is use of the term when, um, saltwater comes in from brine or from.

776
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:51,040
So is there another term? No, you wouldn't call that saltwater intrusion, but it's just road salt, you're saying, right?

777
01:31:51,160 --> 01:31:54,550
Yeah. Yeah. No, I mean, that's just a surface contamination.

778
01:31:55,150 --> 01:32:00,010
So I think the the saltwater intrusion is always a coastal type of phenomenon.

779
01:32:00,430 --> 01:32:05,290
That's what I've seen. Okay, so we're good with everything on this picture.

780
01:32:06,130 --> 01:32:11,470
Well, then we can go home. That's what I wanted to cover today, but I'll be okay.

781
01:32:13,180 --> 01:32:22,980
Again, this is conceptual. Okay. But it's a nice summary of all these different concepts, and it is a useful, uh,

782
01:32:24,160 --> 01:32:30,760
framework for dealing with what you can visualize is a three dimensional pattern of groundwater flows.

783
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:38,860
I have to say, if you go back just a couple of decades, this understanding was much simpler.

784
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:42,490
Okay, we can think about this as a dynamic system.

785
01:32:43,030 --> 01:32:47,720
And we didn't really consider very much the distance scales that are involved.

786
01:32:47,740 --> 01:32:52,390
And that's what I'm going to talk about. Okay.

787
01:32:53,260 --> 01:33:01,180
We talked about aquifers a little bit. I want to talk about confined and confined aquifers.

788
01:33:02,710 --> 01:33:07,450
Unconfined aquifers have a lot of names for attic water table aquifers.

789
01:33:07,900 --> 01:33:11,410
Think of it as a bathtub. Okay. Full of sand.

790
01:33:11,710 --> 01:33:17,680
Okay. And the water comes in and it doesn't go to the top of the bathtub.

791
01:33:17,680 --> 01:33:24,280
It's somewhere in between. Okay. If you get more water in, then you pull out the water level rises.

792
01:33:24,460 --> 01:33:27,820
Okay. So it's frequently moving up or down as well.

793
01:33:29,410 --> 01:33:39,370
There's no protective, confining layer above it. And so, you know, contamination is easily accomplished.

794
01:33:39,700 --> 01:33:44,590
I mentioned groundwater levels can rise and fall. It's basically like an underground lake,

795
01:33:45,700 --> 01:33:52,960
generally not too desirable as a safe drinking water supply because the levels go up and down and because it's easily contaminated.

796
01:33:58,510 --> 01:34:05,050
The water table is a depth at which the soil pores are saturated.

797
01:34:05,740 --> 01:34:09,570
So I went for a little hike yesterday and I'm always thinking about this kind of stuff, right?

798
01:34:09,820 --> 01:34:15,820
So I look at the lay of the land and there's, you know, Michigan doesn't have a lot of relief, but we have marshy areas and so forth.

799
01:34:16,180 --> 01:34:21,560
And I'm thinking about the water table just a few feet below the earth's surface go up on a hill.

800
01:34:21,580 --> 01:34:27,460
It's going to be deeper than that. Okay. 2D layer following the Earth's contours, roughly.

801
01:34:28,420 --> 01:34:35,920
Okay. Groundwater depth is a pretty key parameter if you're going to build a house, probably.

802
01:34:36,070 --> 01:34:45,280
You don't want your basement flooded. If you build the basement to adapt, which is above the ground water table, you should be okay.

803
01:34:45,380 --> 01:34:51,490
Right. All right. But there's lots of homes where it's pretty close.

804
01:34:51,970 --> 01:34:56,370
And if the ground water depth is, the water table is above the basement.

805
01:34:56,380 --> 01:34:57,670
So you're going to have a flooded basement.

806
01:35:03,150 --> 01:35:12,300
We express the ground water or water table depth as meters below ground surface pegs or sometimes above mean sea level.

807
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:21,750
And the direction and slope of the groundwater table indicates the direction and velocity of flow.

808
01:35:22,680 --> 01:35:34,650
Okay, some explain that here is a waste site and it's bordered by a river down here and we have lots of different boreholes.

809
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:39,759
PS Are the different boreholes, they're actually called?

810
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:47,190
PS Ometer locations, basically just sensing the depth of the groundwater and we have contour lines on here.

811
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:51,390
But these aren't surface contours. These are mean.

812
01:35:53,730 --> 01:35:58,070
In this case, it is the parametric surface.

813
01:35:58,080 --> 01:36:03,060
It's really the height above mean sea level for the water table.

814
01:36:03,660 --> 01:36:08,880
Okay. So we have 430 feet for 24, 26.

815
01:36:09,240 --> 01:36:18,780
We come down to the river for 16. So this is the surface showing you the groundwater depth.

816
01:36:19,170 --> 01:36:25,810
And the water is going to want to flow downhill and it's going to want to flow perpendicular to the gradient.

817
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:35,640
Okay. So four 3428 water is going to flow this direction, it's going to curve a little bit and then make its way into the river.

818
01:36:37,860 --> 01:36:44,969
And I can deduce that because I have enough boreholes or pedometers to construct

819
01:36:44,970 --> 01:36:48,780
what I think is the piece of metric surface or the water table height.

820
01:36:49,410 --> 01:36:53,370
And then I just draw lines perpendicular to that to get the flow direction.

821
01:36:56,610 --> 01:37:03,870
Okay. If you don't like that because you're looking at me like you're puzzled, consider these lines to be the surface height.

822
01:37:04,020 --> 01:37:07,390
Okay. The terrain height. And I drop the ball right here.

823
01:37:07,410 --> 01:37:11,160
Which way is that ball going to roll perpendicular?

824
01:37:11,190 --> 01:37:17,040
It's going to roll straight downhill. Right. It's not going to curve off to one side or the other orders exactly the same way.

825
01:37:17,340 --> 01:37:21,030
Except instead of using a topographic height, I use the water table plate.

826
01:37:22,680 --> 01:37:32,670
Water will always flow downhill. So the image is just basically like different buildings and how the water would flow.

827
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:39,120
Unbelievable. Exactly. Forget it. The buildings are even there. I think that they're important because they're the source of the contamination.

828
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:47,940
Okay. So what you can say is that if you had a spill over here, it's going to end up somewhere over here.

829
01:37:48,390 --> 01:37:51,720
There's the spill over here. It may be a little bit to the south.

830
01:37:53,220 --> 01:37:58,200
Okay. Recognize, this is a map drawn on a particular day.

831
01:37:59,370 --> 01:38:04,320
And what they found was in the dry season.

832
01:38:04,650 --> 01:38:10,470
It's quite different from it is in the wet season, but still it's going to flow in the direction of the river.

833
01:38:11,850 --> 01:38:17,490
No surprise, right? You expect the river to accumulate the water because it's probably in a valley anywhere.

834
01:38:18,540 --> 01:38:30,210
Okay. But this is where we can just visualize the groundwater elevations or, again, the piece of metric surface to deduce the flow of the water.

835
01:38:30,930 --> 01:38:38,900
Okay. All things being equal, a steeper gradient means faster flow.

836
01:38:40,100 --> 01:38:48,450
A team with the same soil properties. And we'll talk about that when we talk about our series.

837
01:38:50,540 --> 01:38:54,020
Okay. If I convince you with my bowl analogy.

838
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:59,570
Okay, that applies only to unconfined aquifers.

839
01:38:59,930 --> 01:39:08,030
Confined aquifers are different. They are there's a confining bit of both confining being below.

840
01:39:08,450 --> 01:39:11,930
And the water is being squeezed in that layer.

841
01:39:12,860 --> 01:39:18,650
The pores are completely saturated with water. It's like a sandwich.

842
01:39:19,160 --> 01:39:24,830
Greater pressure yields, more pressure. These can occur at very great depths.

843
01:39:25,250 --> 01:39:35,330
There may be multiple aquifers and the flows here are also three D, but it depends a lot on the configuration or the underlying geology.

844
01:39:36,230 --> 01:39:40,010
Okay. And we talked about artesian wells.

845
01:39:40,070 --> 01:39:44,660
They can only result from a confined aquifer.

846
01:39:45,980 --> 01:39:52,070
Otherwise, there's no pressure. You can have a seep. That's just the water coming out from something.

847
01:39:52,070 --> 01:40:02,040
But it's not really usual. Here is a picture of another Egis.

848
01:40:02,060 --> 01:40:07,580
This one is in Canada looking at all the different boreholes that were drilled.

849
01:40:07,730 --> 01:40:11,450
This area right here is the study area of major interest.

850
01:40:15,540 --> 01:40:27,600
And so there are surveys like this done to characterize the subsurface geology and the p symmetric surface also called the hydraulic head.

851
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:31,590
And the reason is we want to know which way the water is flowing.

852
01:40:32,220 --> 01:40:39,750
And so if we can establish again, the surface here is 505 25, 550.

853
01:40:40,050 --> 01:40:45,320
Which way is the water flowing in this area? North.

854
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:52,130
Okay. That's very important to understand. This is not the surface table aquifer.

855
01:40:52,550 --> 01:40:59,480
This is the deep aquifer. So if we construct the piece of metric surface, then we can deduce which way the water is flowing.

856
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:08,920
This is an interesting little area right in here. Don't ask me why, but if I had a spill right in the middle here, some of it might flow north.

857
01:41:08,930 --> 01:41:13,670
Some of it might flow south because of the contours that I see here.

858
01:41:14,060 --> 01:41:19,700
I think I need more information to tell you that, because the interpolation could really be an error,

859
01:41:21,320 --> 01:41:27,140
because I don't have very many boreholes in that region. Good.

860
01:41:28,310 --> 01:41:36,710
For fractured rock aquifers. We have a couple of different pictures like this where they're basically solid rock to fractures where water can occur.

861
01:41:37,820 --> 01:41:43,370
This is pretty complex because of the anisotropic aspects to this.

862
01:41:43,700 --> 01:41:52,730
Also, these aquifers typically don't contain a huge amount of water per square meter, cubic meter, but they can be very large.

863
01:41:53,180 --> 01:41:57,050
The flow occurs through these fractures. So that is important.

864
01:41:57,530 --> 01:42:04,399
And there's also a diffusion process that takes place because the rough matrix itself is quite complex

865
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:11,780
and can have micro cracks and structures and properties that absorb and absorb contaminants as well.

866
01:42:15,240 --> 01:42:19,620
Okay. Finally, there's more heterogeneity.

867
01:42:20,100 --> 01:42:28,800
Heterogeneity is a physical characteristic that varies in space as compared to homogeneity.

868
01:42:29,340 --> 01:42:32,430
And this is, again, for the groundwater discussion purposes.

869
01:42:32,730 --> 01:42:41,130
It's uniform in space. Okay, isotropic is the property that's the same in all direction.

870
01:42:41,400 --> 01:42:46,110
And isotropic is a property that differs in all directions or differs in direction.

871
01:42:46,710 --> 01:42:50,550
Anyway, here we have a subsurface.

872
01:42:50,550 --> 01:42:52,440
We're may be looking at a profile.

873
01:42:52,740 --> 01:43:04,590
We have what we call some clay lenses or areas where there are low permeability strata, maybe an ancient stream bed deposited a layer of clay.

874
01:43:04,920 --> 01:43:09,930
Then there was erosion and they put their cobbles and sand around.

875
01:43:09,930 --> 01:43:19,340
That water is going to want to flow through the high permeability areas much faster than the low permeability area.

876
01:43:19,740 --> 01:43:23,210
This is a macroscopic type of process. Okay.

877
01:43:23,820 --> 01:43:27,960
In contrast on the right, here's an individual sand grain.

878
01:43:28,950 --> 01:43:38,370
Okay, surrounded by maybe an organic carbon or mineral surface that will sort particles or colloidal material or dissolved material.

879
01:43:38,790 --> 01:43:46,110
And again, we're going to have flow around these sand grains, but then we have an interaction with that surface.

880
01:43:47,100 --> 01:43:51,780
So these things are operating in this case to the very microscopic scale.

881
01:43:52,140 --> 01:43:56,130
At this case, it can be meters, kilometers, even larger.

882
01:43:56,430 --> 01:44:00,360
Many different scales are occurring here. So very complex to characterize.

883
01:44:00,840 --> 01:44:05,520
This is something that we would characterize in engineering terms as a bulk parameter process.

884
01:44:05,880 --> 01:44:09,570
I'm not trying to model or understand individual sand grains.

885
01:44:09,870 --> 01:44:16,710
I'm trying to understand it in scale, which is meaningful for my my analysis is probably much larger.

886
01:44:18,510 --> 01:44:21,120
Makes sense. Okay. Very complex.

887
01:44:21,120 --> 01:44:29,760
You can see it's, you know, just all these things happening recharge areas for a confined aquifers are often critical.

888
01:44:30,540 --> 01:44:36,660
It's the area as I shown on the pictures before, where precipitation is transmitted directly downward.

889
01:44:37,290 --> 01:44:45,899
These are important for watershed protection and you need to define these recharge areas

890
01:44:45,900 --> 01:44:51,570
and you need to protect them because otherwise your aquifer can get contaminated very,

891
01:44:51,570 --> 01:44:56,900
very easily. Okay.

892
01:44:56,930 --> 01:45:00,220
I talked about unconfined confined aquifers.

893
01:45:00,230 --> 01:45:05,500
I didn't talk too much about aqua turds. These are the confining layers.

894
01:45:05,510 --> 01:45:13,190
We talked about windows already and the opposite of recharge area is a discharge area and that's where the water flows out.

895
01:45:13,910 --> 01:45:23,360
Okay. So a lot of terminology here. But you know, again, to give you the vocabulary, these are the terms that you need.

896
01:45:25,130 --> 01:45:34,670
And then lastly, here is a picture, cross-sectional picture of what we believe was happening at the Metamora Landfill.

897
01:45:34,670 --> 01:45:38,930
And I'll bring in the videos next week and talk about this. There's a landfill.

898
01:45:39,350 --> 01:45:45,920
There's a drum area where all those drums were pulled out of the ground, the leachate.

899
01:45:46,190 --> 01:45:51,200
Again, the artist conception here is wrong. Should have gone vertically down into the aquifer.

900
01:45:51,740 --> 01:45:56,690
Here's the surface aquifer called the shallow aquifer flowing to the right.

901
01:45:58,040 --> 01:46:02,870
The aqua tarred was made out of silt and clay.

902
01:46:03,320 --> 01:46:06,320
We call it till it looks like it's thinned out.

903
01:46:06,350 --> 01:46:09,980
A couple hundred meters down stream became a window.

904
01:46:11,240 --> 01:46:15,229
This allowed part of the plume for both the drums and the landfill.

905
01:46:15,230 --> 01:46:25,160
And this had everything in it. Okay. The one that you see easily is salt chloride iron, but you can also see volatiles and so forth.

906
01:46:25,970 --> 01:46:32,510
This window allowed the so-called intermediate aquifer to get contaminated.

907
01:46:33,350 --> 01:46:39,500
The problem is, if we're going to clean this up, this intermediate aquifer is huge.

908
01:46:40,370 --> 01:46:44,150
And if we're going to pump that water out, it's a huge volume of water.

909
01:46:45,140 --> 01:46:48,830
Okay. If it stayed in the Shell aquifer, much more manageable.

910
01:46:50,360 --> 01:46:57,710
Okay. So this just shows you, again, a conceptualization of the way a window would lead to broader scale contamination.

911
01:46:58,790 --> 01:47:08,310
Okay. And this is a real world problem. One or two turns referred to as two aquifers can be made out of different types of material.

912
01:47:08,690 --> 01:47:16,250
And I'm just referring to the type of material that's I think it could have been a shale, but in this case, it's alluvial.

913
01:47:16,640 --> 01:47:21,950
So it's all a function of erosion over the eons.

914
01:47:22,190 --> 01:47:30,259
And a lot of the erosion and deposition would be of sand.

915
01:47:30,260 --> 01:47:36,260
So clay things like this. That's where we stop.

916
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:46,520
Once you get to your Halloween friending. Okay, so let me know how the homework is going.

917
01:47:47,450 --> 01:47:50,990
And good luck with that and the rest of your week.

918
01:47:51,710 --> 01:47:52,790
Thank you for.
