1
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,140
Oh, my God. I room now.

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,140
We're going to go know.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:29,110
Yeah. I want you.

4
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:43,930
It's like to live on my face, I guess.

5
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:49,530
Yeah, I think so.

6
00:00:51,860 --> 00:01:00,509
I just. I really can't understand why they're nice outside of Detroit.

7
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:07,830
So I live across the lake and they're at Windsor. And one of the windmills is like.

8
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:26,390
No, actually, I'm in apartment in Ann Arbor now. So it's like basically I'm an undergraduate program, so I'm on the senior class and it's going to be.

9
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,610
So I'm just wondering if you like.

10
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:39,590
I just didn't know if I was going to actually do anything else.

11
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,550
Oh, nice to meet you.

12
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:51,600
So how are you doing?

13
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,610
All right.

14
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,330
All right. Everybody is watching.

15
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:06,580
Very well. All right.

16
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:15,750
Well, welcome to your public health part for discussion on prevention.

17
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:25,049
To start, you can find the materials under week three on the canvas site and the slides

18
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:29,580
have a survey we would like you to take to get to know more about the class,

19
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,470
who's in it, and like identify your section.

20
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,380
So spend about 5 minutes on that.

21
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:45,060
You can also find the engaged learning for today under week three.

22
00:03:08,170 --> 00:04:57,230
I. It's.

23
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:46,780
Or anyone that just came in. You can find the discussion slides and engage in learning.

24
00:07:40,740 --> 00:09:48,910
They? What?

25
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:48,190
And. Before we move along to the quick review, I'd like to introduce myself.

26
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:55,600
My name is Christopher Croom. I'm a Ph.D. student in epidemiology, studying genetic epidemiology.

27
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:10,270
I. The first thing we'd like to do after the survey there is to go over one of the answers, since there were some questions about some.

28
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:21,830
And the first question is, it's possible that Alzheimer's disease has not been increasing in the U.S. since 1980, but rather diagnosis has improved.

29
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:32,130
That is true. Epidemiology has played a role in each of the following here besides reducing wait time physician offices.

30
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:40,020
That's seems to be more of a business role than increasing efficiency at a physician's office,

31
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:49,950
whereas it's something like calorie counts or needle exchange programs are more directly related to disease and reducing harm.

32
00:11:52,680 --> 00:12:00,000
Which of the following are potential explanations for undeserved and observed association between exposure and health outcomes?

33
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:07,170
All of these. It could be due to chance. There could be an error in measuring the exposure.

34
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:15,210
There could be an error in measuring the outcome. Or the exposure could actually cause the disease.

35
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:25,020
And for Hill's criteria. Only one or two must be met to establish a cause and effect relationship.

36
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:31,770
Adding more does not necessarily mean you have causality, you're just increasing your evidence.

37
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:39,810
Typically, you must have temporalities before or after a cause and effect relationship.

38
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:45,150
And typically you see you reverse causality and say, that happened.

39
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:57,770
And it is not correct for a physician to tell a patient who smokes that they will eventually develop lung cancer while smoking does increase risk.

40
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,700
It does not guarantee you will develop lung cancer.

41
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:04,820
And some people just are resistant to that.

42
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:13,550
And it causes in a series of causal cars do not have to occur in all of the fires.

43
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:20,210
It could just be part of one. Oftentimes that turns into a cause.

44
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:25,040
It doesn't have to be in others that lead to the same disease.

45
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:34,840
Exposure to the measles virus is a necessary cause of measles and the component measles,

46
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:43,329
but it is not sufficient by itself to cause measles because you might be vaccinated or you could

47
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:49,450
have had measles before and developed immunity so you could be exposed and nothing happened.

48
00:13:53,530 --> 00:14:00,310
And for which of hills criteria you have established to further consider a cause and effect relationship.

49
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:05,230
And that is temporalities because needs to come before the effects.

50
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:17,900
And of these statements, the true statement is a relationship between an exposure and disease outcome does not necessarily imply causality.

51
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:23,360
For some reason, as we saw before, it could be due to chance or measurement error.

52
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:33,380
It may lead to arthritis through chronic inflammation and excess weight bearing on the joints.

53
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:41,459
Example of biological plausibility because you can see how this biologically would happen

54
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:48,260
to excess weight causing strain on your joints for the information leading to arthritis.

55
00:14:50,690 --> 00:15:03,320
Four queries to the examples of primary prevention or a booster shot of the MMR vaccine, or a healthy 30 year old person exercising.

56
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:06,200
These both prevent the onset of disease.

57
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:21,370
The following are examples of secondary prevention mammogram in a healthy 50 year old woman and the HIV testing offered at a healthcare.

58
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:26,239
These tests would be in asymptomatic individuals.

59
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,500
So you would hope to catch it early and manage the condition.

60
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:39,700
Or improve outcomes. Tertiary prevention would be returning to exercise after a heart attack.

61
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,280
I'm living in a halfway house for a recovering alcoholic.

62
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,410
For these. You've already been diagnosed with the disease, such as the heart attacks.

63
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,560
And you're trying to manage the condition.

64
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:05,860
Being evaluated by a doctor for a mysterious skin rash is not considered secondary prevention because you already develop symptoms.

65
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:16,600
The natural history of disease does not refer to the historical, increasing and decreasing incidence of a specific disease.

66
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:21,700
And all ideologic factors are risk factors.

67
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:32,770
At least one level of prevention can be implemented during which of the following points in the natural history of any disease,

68
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:41,740
which would be all of these chances are really pathogenesis, advanced disease or pre pathogenesis period.

69
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:53,260
The advanced disease would correspond to tertiary prevention early pathogenesis, secondary and pre pathogenesis primary.

70
00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:00,370
And which level of prevention is initiated during the pre clinical trials.

71
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:07,450
So you have onset and you're not preventing it, but you are asymptomatic in the pre clinical.

72
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:18,310
So it's secondary. Tertiary prevention generally involves programs and initiatives that target large groups of healthy people.

73
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:24,460
Our primary prevention focuses on rehabilitating individuals recovering from disease.

74
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:38,830
This is false. Tertiary and primary. Or a 65 year old woman who visits her doctor for complaints of knee pain and upon what?

75
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:46,360
The doctor orders a knee X-ray to look for any bone or soft tissue abnormalities around her joints.

76
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,000
This is an example of secondary prevention. That is false.

77
00:17:53,900 --> 00:18:03,800
He already has this excellent technology to refresh your memory.

78
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:09,590
Primary prevention prevents the initial development of disease among the disease.

79
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:21,350
Free secondary prevention is early detection of existing disease among the asymptomatic to reduce severity and improve outcomes,

80
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:31,850
tertiary prevention is designed to reduce the impact of disease among the disease individuals who have already been diagnosed.

81
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:42,290
Diagnosis is detection of disease among individuals already exhibiting symptoms or among those identified through secondary prevention programs.

82
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:48,810
Here is a nice little graphic showing the stage of disease.

83
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:51,560
For primary prevention, is disease free?

84
00:18:52,910 --> 00:19:02,210
The description for primary prevention is to decrease risk, and the goal is to prevent disease or secondary prevention.

85
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:13,370
Your stage is at biologic onset and the description is for screening to detect the disease early before you have these symptoms.

86
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,250
The goal of secondary prevention is to improve the outcome with early treatment.

87
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:29,750
They don't want things to progress so far that you're already showing symptoms, that it might be so late that you can only manage the condition.

88
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:37,850
For tertiary prevention. The stage is at the chronic stage, so it's already set in and you've developed symptoms.

89
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:46,510
For tertiary, you want to reduce equally and the goal is to slow or stop the progression of the disease.

90
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:55,180
And this is now a time for our engaged learning that you can find under week three.

91
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:03,830
So able to take about 15 minutes to review the scenarios that are listed and complete the exercise,

92
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:10,460
after which we will discuss this in groups with your neighbors and then go over it as a class.

93
00:20:49,810 --> 00:21:05,230
That's because he's got his insecurities and.

94
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:29,240
Because you see.

95
00:21:34,020 --> 00:22:03,360
He also seemed like he was something of 2 seconds because he was just 70 or.

96
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,690
Yeah, yeah, I know.

97
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:14,790
You know, it's one thing to laugh because you can do whatever it takes.

98
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:19,410
I mean, like you already have.

99
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:26,790
Yeah. Yeah. But it's all secondary.

100
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:46,000
If you have symptoms of COVID tests done, the first one is very easily amortized.

101
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:55,290
There's no risk here as well.

102
00:22:55,450 --> 00:23:30,120
And if you didn't it and there is something responsible for this, it's we're just not going to go through that with these women.

103
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:40,320
The woman is already. So we know why you should try to cut your breast cancer, because.

104
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:44,090
I think that there is a diagnosis at the spread.

105
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:49,410
Diagnosing it, you also have a little bit closer with your lungs or whatever.

106
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:53,020
So I was kind of. I'm sure that you already have to see.

107
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:58,620
Yeah, I don't really know for sure.

108
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:17,520
I just used to and still using prep as well as having heard her the canvas.

109
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:33,790
The other kids have said, what I do is figure out what I don't know here.

110
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:46,370
Yeah. And you could take it from here in New York.

111
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:51,810
Yeah, I know for sure.

112
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:58,770
I've been listening to this again.

113
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:12,710
One, I don't think. I don't want to go on a different social network.

114
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:27,270
Yeah, that's right. Okay. And it says, you know, but do you have any idea?

115
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:39,120
Well, I'd like to think someone just like because I think I look at that.

116
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:50,430
I think I just don't understand.

117
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,430
They don't know that they have, you know.

118
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:59,670
So I think it just does.

119
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:07,860
Is it true that increased risk?

120
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:27,180
And I don't think they are you know, then you're not really talking to them about it would also be a diagnostic test.

121
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:30,420
Is there a better test for you after that in positive?

122
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:38,840
Yeah, right. Because if you don't have any symptoms, then you're okay.

123
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:42,900
So you get them. Yeah.

124
00:26:49,090 --> 00:27:07,390
Because you want to address things with primary industries and these therapies that can help their energy.

125
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:14,860
So you can cure here with the medicines from it, which is probably twice coffee.

126
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:22,660
You could catch it for a routine vision sensitization.

127
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:55,090
I should mention that you're just being in this texting and driving, and I always thought that this is why you can't see how I can make them better.

128
00:27:55,100 --> 00:28:04,160
I know how to avoid this one.

129
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:20,080
I wasn't sure if this is true here. I can just be attached to this group and I think it's diagnosis and I just want the person to be vulnerable.

130
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:37,000
But this is just simply trying to understand the flowers for the biopsy because they are food insecure about it.

131
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:57,879
But it's also I don't think I felt like I was saying secondary or I didn't know anything about it because she always had them.

132
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:11,920
The first it's thing I would know, I just I just found this download.

133
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:23,130
It was probably just watching out for our interests and she went Greektown.

134
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:56,700
I mean, every company and some of us are actually so, you know, so if you don't get into the back of my mind,

135
00:29:56,950 --> 00:30:20,500
I, I know that's what I saw that there had also been submitted.

136
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:24,699
So something that's very weird, right? There's no context.

137
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:28,270
We just. Let's wait and see.

138
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:40,929
Your mind actually kind of blew my concern after your projections, I think is probably more because it sounds pretty routine.

139
00:30:40,930 --> 00:31:06,520
I'm glad you came up because that's what the x ray and I didn't go to private practice.

140
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:13,120
But you just continue to work for me.

141
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:20,470
It's whenever I think it right. Yes.

142
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:27,640
But I was complaining because when she was first diagnosed.

143
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:44,710
Yeah, I really I was like I was like, oh no, you should be diagnosed.

144
00:31:44,860 --> 00:32:01,870
Right. So obviously they need to identify what role they have in working with them as well as the views on how you.

145
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:11,110
I'm going to solve this. Okay. Because because they our pressure I didn't know about this.

146
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:27,120
I think if you're just joining us on this point because it was in the context of getting your guys playing, it's like, yeah, yeah,

147
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:36,730
there is like identify problems to keep the diagnostic straight out of the audience and it's certainly an extreme I would take I was like,

148
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:49,360
Yeah, no question about it because I think if they were healthy and they were healthy, I was very confused the whole time you were doing that.

149
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:59,960
Like I opened a bone marrow biopsy that that you need to have.

150
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:23,319
I could have a screening and I feel like, Oh my God, I don't know, I just please your phone.

151
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:35,950
And every time it looks like I didn't I didn't know only two.

152
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:44,280
We might also be like, that's one.

153
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:52,650
It was like, well, I don't know, I don't know anything about it.

154
00:33:52,800 --> 00:34:16,570
So, you know, it's one of the reasons why it's like kind of like sincerity.

155
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:34,510
Okay. All right. So you're going to hire New York private,

156
00:34:34,930 --> 00:34:49,710
but going to get some individual stories about your guys because it's a pretty good vaccine has probably never had a lot of time for that.

157
00:34:49,960 --> 00:35:00,430
It's like you still have it. But I was so nice because that was nice.

158
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:06,790
Have you treatments you wanted to have?

159
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:12,150
Is this what I would find in my mind?

160
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:17,990
I that you just have to wait and you're trying to keep it mind.

161
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:29,290
This is actually stop guys is going to be like I'm scared.

162
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:45,060
It's like, yeah, I get so excited about this.

163
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:56,530
I don't want anybody on this side because they don't want to have this would not have it.

164
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:18,249
So you are already oh it's just looking at their sexual perspective because it's the a exposure that depends on whether or not to discuss

165
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:36,040
in larger groups with neighbors like you can have a ton of opportunities and I just wanted to introduce the Blossom because I have HIV.

166
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:46,800
I think they put it put down to there is this entire surveillance medication back in the Massachusetts.

167
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:52,210
In the trenches there. It is often treated as such.

168
00:36:53,230 --> 00:37:06,010
Just because there is a sectarian conflict.

169
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:48,190
I don't know. I don't think I've often wondered that would be some of my or friends or talking about what was going on.

170
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:55,820
And he doesn't even count. He's like that just wasn't able to just like I.

171
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,760
But not as a child then.

172
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:03,489
I mean, this is a pedophile ring.

173
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:14,050
They're also the reasons they didn't blame them for something like it.

174
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:22,210
And they want to go back to doing that.

175
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:30,330
Oh, you love her? Yes. She was like that one point.

176
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:43,780
It's like testing and I like it, but it's not like the doctor is interacting with her.

177
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:52,250
But, you know,

178
00:38:52,780 --> 00:39:07,209
when it's like maybe you have to go on some time every month since the one that has gone into the negative because like they're

179
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:28,480
just like they told me that I might not be able to actually go to the awards and the doctors and not because they already have.

180
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:37,450
But it wasn't because I was thinking about it at this point.

181
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:46,540
I mean, I that's what I thought.

182
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:58,510
It would be interesting to see that.

183
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:14,490
What do you mean? Oh, you're right. We need to do that.

184
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:25,350
I have a 22 year old little boy.

185
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:50,520
Yeah. You don't have as a you know, I was to tell you, this is not my mindset, okay?

186
00:40:51,580 --> 00:41:04,500
So I can't remember what happened there because I don't like that.

187
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:12,940
But I, I think that's I don't know if I try to do this.

188
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:18,830
You know what? I was going to say that with you, right?

189
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:27,610
What are we doing? So I was like, well, you know, I mean, come on, almost.

190
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:34,600
You know, this is my church where it's like a stage for the first day to jump for justice.

191
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:42,380
And I was like, Yeah, yeah, go to [INAUDIBLE]. And maybe you.

192
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:54,150
Avatar. You know what?

193
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:58,470
I just. I don't know who. This doctor from Nickelodeon in trouble.

194
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:03,360
Oh, my God. You know, that's like the Nickelodeon sucks.

195
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:12,990
I mean, you know all of that. You know, that's what I was doing.

196
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:20,879
Yeah, because I heard about from you always.

197
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:25,920
Like, you should play three times.

198
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:45,170
I thought you were in a conference. You know, it's like making a joke or thinking to myself, like, if it's.

199
00:42:45,210 --> 00:43:01,890
If it's like a kid. And I was 35 or six when I probably read it.

200
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:13,950
All of them are coming back and doing all that. You know, the English was the last time to fire me.

201
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:46,050
I like to think that Sorbitol is kind of funny and usually it forces you to do the undergrad where we go.

202
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:52,230
Since I started looking into it so far, it's fine.

203
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:57,650
It's been more good. Yeah. Ask her again in two months.

204
00:43:57,670 --> 00:44:06,600
You're getting lots of information.

205
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:21,089
You're safe here for the first 44, like a second summer next week and it's going to rain.

206
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:26,220
There's snow taking out as well as the middle of it.

207
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:46,950
It was always something that was just like usually not like taking notes.

208
00:44:47,400 --> 00:45:03,970
It's not like the worst of it at all, like the cold winters or or a cold in the present day or so.

209
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:18,390
It's nice. It's like, I would say, like being like different people in there.

210
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:26,430
So no matter who you are, you really get what you do.

211
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:30,910
Never better. I was trying to wonder.

212
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:35,759
Michigan, I looked like the first time I live in New York City.

213
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,950
It's so cold. Yeah, I'm just.

214
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:49,470
I'm an undergraduate. Senior undergraduate. I know it sounds like a classic.

215
00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:58,550
Well, you know, I knew.

216
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:11,040
Yeah, I got a really good. Yeah, like, well, there's only 3.4 million square foot Cambridge.

217
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:26,580
I remember, like, I was expecting this sort of like they're not actually they're kind of like they know who you are.

218
00:46:26,970 --> 00:46:30,240
It's like I missed the decimal point. Yep.

219
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:39,270
Yeah. I mean, you're in second place over the course of, like, you know, you've never experienced this one.

220
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,360
And I just thought this all started some time before. I was like.

221
00:46:47,830 --> 00:46:54,750
Difficult to figure it out right now. You're in college, so you know what I was doing?

222
00:46:55,080 --> 00:47:08,110
I'm like, I got a job after college, you know, going to back out of it all and it's going to go up as I go.

223
00:47:08,110 --> 00:47:17,810
And so I would go back to school and then I went and then also like taking.

224
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:30,190
I'll take advantage of that. Yeah, I guess I was kind of curious, why did you come up there in my freshman year?

225
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:40,660
Maybe that I was here to tell you that.

226
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:48,210
Is that like where they perceive you?

227
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:53,980
You started to have a particular trouble with some of these places,

228
00:47:55,810 --> 00:48:02,680
first undergoing a functional MRI brain scan after experiencing a loss of peripheral vision.

229
00:48:03,770 --> 00:48:07,580
What is this? Diagnosis?

230
00:48:08,030 --> 00:48:15,040
Yes, diagnosis. You already have symptoms. And it does not reduce the impact of disease.

231
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:26,230
It could guide for this is to go back to this slide right here and you can see which things it fits and does not looking like specific phrases.

232
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:34,490
So this one's detecting the existing disease for the polio vaccine.

233
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:39,210
What type of prevention is this? The primary, yes.

234
00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:45,200
You prevent anti-malaria medication for people who do not have the disease,

235
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:55,460
traveling to a location where the disease is endemic primarily to follow up exams to identify metastatic disease.

236
00:48:57,750 --> 00:49:02,130
Since diagnosis. Yes, you already have symptoms and it does not reduce them.

237
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:07,890
Active cervical cancer surveillance of a patient with HPV.

238
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:13,230
Second secondary.

239
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:17,780
You're trying to detect it early before cervical cancer develops.

240
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:23,360
It will not prevent the development of disease, but it will change when you might be infected.

241
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:30,470
Mammography in a healthy 55 year old secondaries.

242
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:35,650
The goal is to detect it early. Sunscreen use on a cloudy day.

243
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:41,810
Yes. You prevent things like melanoma or sunburn.

244
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:49,660
I deal with anti-retroviral medications during the first year.

245
00:49:49,670 --> 00:49:59,630
Yes, you've already been infected and you're trying to reduce the impact on the ear protection while mowing the lawn.

246
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:04,280
Primary. Primary. Just to prevent things like hearing loss.

247
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:11,220
Steroid creams for rheumatoid arthritis, for sure.

248
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:19,070
Yes. You already have that diagnosed disease and you're trying to reduce the impact, the routine blood lab work.

249
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:28,450
So I think it's secondary. It will not prevent the disease and you're trying to detect it in asymptomatic people.

250
00:50:28,870 --> 00:50:35,580
If there is a disease. Condoms for STDs sti the primary.

251
00:50:35,590 --> 00:50:38,860
Yes. You're trying to prevent the initial onset or development.

252
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:51,710
Taking a nasal swab and sending it for laboratory testing for RSV and influenza and a child with symptoms, a runny nose and difficulty breathing.

253
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:57,590
Yes. Diagnosis. You're symptomatic, but not yet diagnosed.

254
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:04,160
Getting an X-ray of the hand following reports of joint pain in your fingers.

255
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:09,350
Diagnosis. Diagnosis? Yes. You're symptomatic and not yet diagnosed.

256
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:13,580
Once again, testing for pre-eclampsia and pregnant women.

257
00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:20,570
Secondary. Secondary. Yes. You're detecting before symptoms emerge to improve outcomes.

258
00:51:21,930 --> 00:51:25,020
Routine vision and hearing tests for schoolchildren.

259
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:30,980
It's like secondary. Yes, it can stop the disease from coming on.

260
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:45,600
If you're trying to detect symptoms early or detect this early before sexual pre-exposure prophylaxis prep for HIV two primary.

261
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:53,200
Yes. You're trying to prevent the infection. A patient with anemia undergoing bone marrow biopsy.

262
00:51:57,180 --> 00:52:00,410
Yes. The patient already has anemia.

263
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:07,020
So you're trying to see what the underlying disease is symptomatic and trying to identify the disease.

264
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:14,190
The routine part. And your dental clinic, which is the primary.

265
00:52:16,350 --> 00:52:24,490
Trying to prevent the initial development of disease, such as abscesses or cavities or whatever.

266
00:52:24,590 --> 00:52:29,610
I'm getting an EKG due to presence of an arrhythmia.

267
00:52:31,770 --> 00:52:37,290
Diagnosis? Yes. You're symptomatic and you're trying to identify the existing disease,

268
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:45,390
getting blood pressure at regular doctor's visits despite not having previous high blood pressure.

269
00:52:47,410 --> 00:52:52,120
Secondary. Yes, it is early detection before you're symptomatic.

270
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:59,800
Mental health treatment, support groups for sharing.

271
00:53:00,790 --> 00:53:08,110
Yes. And this question assumes that you're after diagnosis with a mental health issue.

272
00:53:08,590 --> 00:53:16,780
So you're trying to reduce that impact on your life. Dialysis for someone with end stage renal disease.

273
00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:21,849
Sure. For sure. Yes, you have. The disease has been diagnosed.

274
00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:31,690
You're trying to reduce the impact. Tuberculin TB skin test and a newly hired hospital employee considered secondary.

275
00:53:31,690 --> 00:53:36,030
Yes. Trying to detect in the asymptomatic.

276
00:53:39,290 --> 00:53:42,590
Blood glucose meter for diabetes management.

277
00:53:43,450 --> 00:53:50,930
Prescriptions for serious. After diagnosis and to manage blood glucose and diabetes.

278
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:58,080
And doubts about the risks involved in using lead based glazes for ceramics.

279
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:04,600
Primary. Yes. You're trying to prevent the initial development of disease.

280
00:54:06,190 --> 00:54:11,290
Folic acid supplements for a person who is not yet but is planning on becoming pregnant.

281
00:54:13,010 --> 00:54:24,960
Finally, yes, you've heard that initial happening, HPV vaccine in a patient who has tested positive for HPV high risk type 16 person.

282
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:29,970
This one is actually primary. It's sort of a trick question.

283
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:37,150
There are many different types of HPV, and the vaccine covers more than just the one type.

284
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:45,460
So if you have this one detected, you might still not be infected with the other types of HPV.

285
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:50,490
So the vaccine will prevent those. So that's why it would be primary.

286
00:54:54,040 --> 00:55:04,960
That one is tricky. If you're going a comprehensive eye exam with an ophthalmologist following a non passing score on your vision test

287
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:13,390
as the Department of Motor Vehicles starts to diagnose that just the non passing score would be your symptoms.

288
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:22,450
You're trying to figure out what's going on. Hearing aids for someone with conductive hearing loss.

289
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:32,440
Year. Yes. You're trying to reduce the impact of the hearing loss and manage that chronic pain management program.

290
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:39,700
First year. Yes, it's after diagnosis and again to reduce the impact of the pain.

291
00:55:42,370 --> 00:55:48,670
Physical therapy following ACL injury, which is a specific diagnosis.

292
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:55,570
So yes, tertiary it's after diagnosis and it reduces the impact.

293
00:55:57,490 --> 00:56:00,880
A biopsy to examine an atypical mole.

294
00:56:03,070 --> 00:56:08,320
Yes. Diagnosis. If you're symptomatic and you want to figure out what it is.

295
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:12,250
Seatbelts. Primary?

296
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:18,250
Yes. To prevent injury and occupational therapy following a stroke.

297
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:25,880
Yes. That is tertiary. It's after diagnosis and it's to reduce the impact of the stroke on your lungs.

298
00:56:33,270 --> 00:56:38,790
For that exercise activity. Which ones gave you the hardest time?

299
00:56:38,790 --> 00:56:52,280
What took you the longest? In particular stand out when we were talking about the active cervical cancer surveillance issue with HPV.

300
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:57,080
They were just debating about that one since the patient already had HPV.

301
00:56:57,320 --> 00:57:01,309
Yeah, but even though they they already have that, it's still secondary.

302
00:57:01,310 --> 00:57:07,690
But we were debating if it was like secondary, tertiary or diagnosis, yet you got the HPV.

303
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:13,939
So for from the perspective of cervical cancer, you are not symptomatic for cervical cancer.

304
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:17,450
So you're looking into the fact that early to be that.

305
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:29,800
The others. Okay.

306
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:41,470
Which examples do you think would have the biggest impact on public health, like in the population or specific populations even?

307
00:57:55,320 --> 00:58:03,800
Personally, a big one would be you go first, which is primary, because I guess primary prevention,

308
00:58:03,810 --> 00:58:10,050
I was thinking like the polio vaccine, which could basically eradicate certain diseases.

309
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:24,780
Although there is an outbreak and public health emergency in the state of New York because people started taking the vaccine, which was not advised.

310
00:58:30,790 --> 00:58:34,780
Primary prevention is very big for the health of the public.

311
00:58:46,590 --> 00:58:52,010
I think there's an issue on canvas because it says the artists and this is yeah

312
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:56,910
there was an error yesterday I think it will be working correctly next week,

313
00:58:56,910 --> 00:59:00,990
but it probably shows up with all of the answers already in there and like you submitted it.

314
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:04,790
Yeah. It also says that I'm now on attempt to mine. Yeah.

315
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:15,120
Because of other people submitting it I think. Okay, so you guys just go ahead and submit it individually and it should show up on your account.

316
00:59:15,610 --> 00:59:21,850
Okay. You'll get a credit as long as you don't have to submit.

317
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:34,110
I'll let you know with a glass of it, but I think you have to.

318
00:59:34,110 --> 00:59:39,060
It doesn't matter if it's just going to be graded on items that should be made for consideration.

319
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:53,170
And we just went over the routines and it's mostly a review activity.

320
00:59:53,210 --> 01:00:04,320
I'm going to be looking for COVID 19 prevention strategies currently in place.

321
01:00:06,850 --> 01:00:11,340
Yes. That's for publication. Yes, that's right.

322
01:00:14,090 --> 01:00:23,140
Taxi. Yes. What do you think of a secondary prevention for COVID 19?

323
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:31,410
I guess it's not secondary, but I guess if you just regularly get coded tests.

324
01:00:31,450 --> 01:00:44,410
Yes. If you have an exposure, those and if you don't have symptoms but you had an exposure, is that still just secondary to you don't have symptoms?

325
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:52,540
I think it would be relevant while you your asymptomatic.

326
01:00:52,570 --> 01:01:09,760
I think that secondary communication, your results would actually be useful to confirm that whether or not you wanted to be certain.

327
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:16,200
Tertiary prevention in the future.

328
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:25,350
Symptomatic. You've already got COVID 19, so what can you do to lessen the impact on yourself?

329
01:01:25,470 --> 01:01:34,720
So you're summit s isolate. About medicines tax slug.

330
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:41,140
It seems like you've got it to minimize the effects.

331
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:49,310
Can you think of any additional use for COVID 19?

332
01:01:52,160 --> 01:02:07,010
Comment 2020 Education.

333
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:21,430
The primary function of distance learning and policies.

334
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:35,170
Yes. And guess what?

335
01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:41,330
A vaccine like a vaccine mandate, would that count as a strategy?

336
01:02:42,020 --> 01:02:48,410
I don't know the prevention method that gets the vaccine rates up on the population to reduce transmission.

337
01:02:51,740 --> 01:02:55,720
Just lower the overall burden for breakthrough infections.

338
01:03:02,310 --> 01:03:08,770
Previously. Yeah.

339
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:12,950
I suppose everyone is done with their engaged learning.

340
01:03:12,950 --> 01:03:17,630
We can. And that sounds good to me.

341
01:03:20,270 --> 01:03:27,700
Thank you. Thank you. You don't, you?
